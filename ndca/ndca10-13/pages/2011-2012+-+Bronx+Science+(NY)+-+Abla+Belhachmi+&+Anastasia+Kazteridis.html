<span class="BoldUnderline">Disposal in outer space. The objective of this option is to remove the radioactive waste from the Earth, for all time, by ejecting it into outer space. The waste would be packaged so that it would be likely to remain intact under most conceivable accident scenarios</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">A rocket or space shuttle would be used to launch the packaged waste into space. There are several ultimate destinations for the waste which have been considered, including directing it into the Sun</span>. The high cost means that such a method of waste disposal could only be appropriate for separated high-level waste (HLW) or spent fuel (i.e. long-lived highly radioactive material that is relatively small in volume). The question was investigated in the United States by NASA in the late 1970s and early 1980s. <span class="BoldUnderline">Because of the high cost of this option and the safety aspects associated with the risk of launch failure, this option was abandoned.

What happens to all that radioactive waste created by nuclear power plants? Not much<span class="BoldUnderline">. In 1982, Congress mandated the construction of a national nuclear waste repository. It's been nearly 30 years since then, of course, and there's no such repository.</span> Planned for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, it was scuttled by the Obama administration due to NIMBY issues -- and <span class="BoldUnderline">there's no rush to find an alternative to Yucca.</span> As a result, nuke plants are still required to keep their waste on site. So, they do. In Virginia, for instance, <span class="BoldUnderline">nuclear waste continues to pile up -- at one site, the radioactive waste containers cover a plot of land the size of a football field. Between Virginia's two nuclear power plants -- the Surry and North Anna Power Stations -- there's 5.2 million pounds of waste in storage. And, of course, more is always on the way</span>. The Daily Press sets the scene at Surry: The bus stops before a barbed wire gate at Surry Power Station, less than a mile from the James River ... Inside the fence, on a concrete pad the size of a football field, is nearly 1.9 million pounds of radioactive nuclear waste. Encased in concrete casks and no immediate public health threat, the waste is a by-product of nearly four decades of atomic energy-making at Virginia's oldest nuclear power plant ... Most of the fuel is stored in 16-foot tall concrete casks that stand upright and weigh more than 262,000 pounds<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> when full. Scenes like this are common across the country -- with no permanent place to store the waste, it simply piles up. There are plenty of reasons that this is unacceptable: potential ecological, human health, and security-related woes abound. Many of these containment sites weren't designed for long-term storage, which has environmental advocates and scientists concerned. Edwin Lyman, a physicist and nuclear proliferation expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C, told the Daily Press, &quot;There are a handful of scenarios, such as an earthquake or terrorist attack, that could cause the casks or pools to leak, he said. Also, spent nuclear fuel remains radioactive for thousands of years -- it could cause the concrete and other materials to erode.&quot; There are also fears that nuclear waste is leeching into groundwater after years of storage -- tritium, the radioactive isotope of hydrogen, was discovered in groundwater near North Anna. It doesn't pose any immediate health risks, officials say, but the occurrence does point to worrying possibilities. National security hawks worry that the policy of leaving so much nuclear waste onsite could be exploited. And environmentalists have long been concerned about the effects of radioactive waste on nearby wildlife and ecosystems. There's some 138 million pounds of nuclear waste piling up at power plants around the nation. It's probably time we found someplace to lock it up. </span><br />

First, <span class="BoldUnderline">toxic waste poses a severe health and safety risk</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Some chemical agents cause leukemia and other cancers; others may lead to organ ailments, asthma, and other dysfunctions; and yet others may lead to birth defects such as anencephaly</span>. Toxic waste accomplishes these tragic consequences through direct exposure, through the contamination of the air, land, and water, and through the bioaccumulation of toxins in both plants and animals. And because of what Ben Chavis in 1987 termed &quot;<span class="BoldUnderline">environmental racism,&quot; people of color (and poor people) are disproportionately affected by toxic waste. Native Americans are especially hard hit because of their ethnicity, their class, and their unique political status in the United States. </span><br />

If a cask wears down from its exposure to the elements over time, not to mention the thermally hot high-level radioactivity contained within it, no safe, sure plan yet exists to transfer the waste inside it to a new cask. </span><br />

Nuclear testing and storage is an ongoing nuclear war against indigenous people and the third world.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> The vigorous invasion of the logic of capitalist accumulation into the last vestige of relatively autonomous space in the periphery under late capitalism is propelled not only by the desire for incorporating every fabric of the society into the division of labor but also by the desire for &quot;pure&quot; destruction/extermination of the periphery.26 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">The penetration of capital into the social fabric and the destruction of nature and preexisting social organizations by capital are not separable. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">However</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">, what we have witnessed in the phase of late capitalism is a rapid intensification of the destruction and extermination of the periphery</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. In this context, capital is no longer interested in incorporating some parts of the periphery into the international division of labor. The emergence of such &quot;pure&quot; destruction/extermination of the periphery can be explained, at least partially, by another problematic of late capitalism formulated by Ernest Mandel: the mass production of the means of destruction.27 Particularly, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">the latest phase of capitalism distinguishes itself from the earlier phases in its production of the &quot;ultimate&quot; means of destruction/extermination, i.e., nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Let us recall our earlier discussion about the critical historical 348 Nuclear Globalismi Traversing Rockets, Satellites, and Nuclear War via the Strategic Gaze conjuncture where the notion of &quot;strategy&quot; changed its nature and became deregulated/dispersed beyond the boundaries set by the interimperial rivalry. Herein, the perception of the ultimate means of destruction can be historically contextualized. The only instances of real nuclear catastrophe perceived and thus given due recognition by the First World community are the explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which occurred at this conjuncture. Beyond this historical threshold, whose meaning is relevant only to the interimperial rivalry, the nuclear catastrophe is confined to the realm of fantasy, for instance, apocalyptic imagery</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">. And yet how can one deny the crude fact that nuclear war has been taking place on this earth in the name of &quot;nuclear testing</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&quot; since the first nuclear explosion at Alamogordo in 1945? As of 1991, 1,924 nuclear explosions have occurred on earth.28 The major perpetrators of nuclear warfare are the United States (936 times), the former Soviet Union (715 times), France (192 times), the United Kingdom (44 times), and China (36 times).29 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">The primary targets of warfare (&quot;test site&quot; to use Nuke Speak terminology) have been invariably the sovereign nations of Fourth World and Indigenous Peoples</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Thus history has already witnessed the nuclear wars against the Marshall Islands (66 times), French Polynesia (175 times), Australian Aborigines (9 times), Newe Sogobia (the Western Shoshone Nation) (814 times), the Christmas Islands (24 times), Hawaii (Kalama Island, also known as Johnston Island) (12 times), the Republic of Kazakhstan (467 times), and Uighur (Xinjian Province, China) (36 times).30 Moreover, although I focus primarily on &quot;nuclear tests&quot; in this article, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">if we are to expand the notion of nuclear warfare to include any kind of violence accrued from the nuclear fuel cycle</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> (particularly uranium mining and disposition of nuclear wastes), we must enlist Japan and the European nations as perpetrators and add the Navaho, Havasupai and other Indigenous Nations to the list of targets. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">Viewed as a whole, nuclear war</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, albeit undeclared, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">has been waged against the Fourth World, and Indigenous Nations. The dismal consequences of &quot;intensive exploitation,&quot; &quot;low intensity intervention,&quot; or the &quot;nullification of the sovereignty&quot; in the Third World produced by the First World have taken a form of nuclear extermination in the Fourth World and Indigenous Nations. Thus, from the perspectives of the Fourth World and Indigenous Nations, the nuclear catastrophe has never been the &quot;unthinkable&quot; single catastrophe but the real catastrophe of repetitive and ongoing nuclear explosions and exposure to radioactivity</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Nevertheless, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">ongoing nuclear wars have been subordinated to the imaginary grand catastrophe by rendering them as mere preludes to the apocalypse</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. As a consequence, the history and ongoing processes of nuclear explosions as war have been totally wiped out from the history and consciousness of the First Masahide Kato 349 World community. Such a discursive strategy that aims to mask the &quot;real&quot; of nuclear warfare in the domain of imagery of nuclear catastrophe can be observed even in Stewart Firth's Nuclear Playground, which extensively covers the history of &quot;nuclear testing&quot; in the Pacific: Nuclear explosions in the atmosphere . . . were global in effect. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">The winds and seas carried radioactive contamination over vast areas of the fragile ecosphere on which we all depend for our survival and which we call the earth. In preparing for war, we were poisoning our planet and going into batde against nature</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> itself.31 Although Firth's book is definitely a remarkable study of the history of &quot;nuclear testing&quot; in the Pacific, the problematic division/distinction between the &quot;nuclear explosions&quot; and the nuclear war is kept intact. The imagery of final nuclear war narrated with the problematic use of the subject (&quot;we&quot;) is located higher than the &quot;real&quot; of nuclear warfare in terms of discursive value. This ideological division/hierarchization is the very vehicle through which the history and the ongoing processes of the destruction of the Fourth World and Indigenous Nations by means of nuclear violence are obliterated and hence legitimatized. The discursive containment/obliteration of the &quot;real&quot; of nuclear warfare has been accomplished, ironic as it may sound, by nuclear criticism. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">Nuclear criticism, with its firm commitment to global discourse, has established the unshakable authority of the imagery of nuclear catastrophe over the real nuclear catastrophe happening in the Fourth World and Indigenous Nations almost on a daily basis.</span><br />

The deletion of the real story of the so-called “battle of Washita” from the official Seventh Cavalry history given to the perpetrators of the No Gun Ri massacre is revealing.

Power-mad US forces deploying the latest genocidal war tools, some suggestively named after native tribes that white North American “pioneers” tried to wipe off the face of the earth (ie, “Apache,” “Blackhawk,” and “Comanche” helicopters) are walking in bloody footsteps that trace back across centuries, oceans, forests and plains to the leveled villages, shattered corpses, and stolen resources of those who Roosevelt acknowledged as America’s “original inhabitants.”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Racist imperial carnage and its denial, like charity, begin at home. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">Those who deny the crimes of the past are likely to repeat their offenses in the future as long as they retain the means and motive to do so. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is folly, however, for any nation to think that it can stand above the judgments of history, uniquely free of terrible consequences for what Ward Churchill calls “imperial arrogance and criminality.” </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">Every new U.S. murder of innocents abroad breeds untold numbers of anti-imperial resistance fighters, ready to die and eager to use the latest available technologies and techniques to kill representatives – even just ordinary citizens – of what they see as an American Predator state.

Neutron radiation from increased nuclear activity has empirically increased seismic activity, this means nuclear waste can literally cause the earth to explode.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Consequences of using modern nuclear weapons can be far more serious than previously imagined. These consequences relate to the fact that most of the heat generated in the planetary interior is a result of nuclear decay. Over the last few decades, all superpowers have been developing so-called &quot;neutron bombs&quot; [1]. These bombs are designed to emit intensive neutron radiation while creating relatively little local mechanical damage. Military seem very keen to use neutron bombs in combat, because lethal neutron radiation can penetrate even the largest and deepest bunkers. However, the military seem to ignore the fact that a neutron radiation is capable to reach significant depths in the planetary interior</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">. In the process of passing through the planet and losing its intensity, a neutron beam stimulates nuclei of radioactive isotopes inside the planet to disintegrate. Stimulated disintegration, in turn, produces more neutrons. This process causes not only an increase in radiation levels but also increased nuclear heat generation in the planetary interior, far greater than the energy of the bomb itself. It typically takes many days or even weeks for this extra heat to conduct/convect to the surface of the planet and cause increased seismic/volcanic activity. Due to this variable</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and seemingly inconsistent delay, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">nuclear tests are not currently associated with seismic/volcanic activity, simply because it is believed that there is no theoretical basis for such an association</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Perhaps you heard that after every major series of nuclear test there is always a period of increased seismic activity in some part of the world. This actually cannot be explained by direct energy from the explosion. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">The mechanism of neutron radiation accelerating decay of radioactive isotopes in the planetary interior – a process that generates more neutrons and heat, however, is a very realistic explanation of Observable Reality.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> The process of accelerating volcanic activity is nuclear in essence</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="BoldUnderline">. Accelerated decay of radioactive isotopes already present in the planetary interior provides the necessary energy.The TRUE danger of modern nuclear weaponry is that their neutron radiation is capable to induce global overheating of the planetary interior, global volcanic activity and, in extreme circumstances, may even cause the entire planet to be demolished</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. So far, nuclear tests on Earth were limited to a few per year. Can we really predict what will happen if the US army uses dozens of their Neutron Bombs to destroy all “suspected” and “potential” weapon sites in Iraq? </span><br />

(Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 28: 285-310, “BAD ENDINGS: American Apocalypsis”)-Modernity is both a condition of possibility for the contemporary ... into a machine of horror and destruction<br />
Modernity is both a condition of possibility for the contemporary apocalyptic field and an example of its sensibility. Rapid, large-scale technological and industrial developments and the explosion of a mass consumer culture transformed the texture of experience; the phenomenal world became more chaotic, fragmented, and disorienting; sensory stimulation took on a new intensity (Schivelbusch 1979). A new sensational fascination with spectacles of catastrophe in the media developed as an aesthetic counterpart to the radical transformations of space, time, and industry, and as compensation for their alienating effects (B Singer 1995). But modernity itself is also already structured by apocalyptic-millennial vacillations between utopian and dystopian visions in which antimodern nostalgia for origins and simpler times meets dreams of enlightenment and progress, instrumentalr ationalitym eets avant-gardee xperimentationw ith form, and oppositions between the rational and the irrational, center and margin, and order and disorder become charged (Buell 1998, Ivy 1995, Lears 1994, Marx 1964). The modern world is characterized by simultaneous overstimulation and numbness, alarm and anesthesia (Berlant 1996, Buck-Morss 1995, Feldman 1994, Ivy 1993, Terkel 1988), and it is imagined in terms of dialectical extremes, of heaven and hell, or of dreamworld and catastrophe. In the omnipresent media, world events are presented as a state of constant, tautological crisis. Talk shows suggest that social and psychological problems are everywhere, and that our job, as an audience, is to recognize them in everything we see (Mellencamp 1992:150). In movies so scripted they can only be described as mythic, superhuman (and heavily armed) heroes avert imminent social, moral, and/or environmental collapse in a final battle, leaving a budding nuclear family standing in the ashes to begin the world again (Lapham 1996). &quot;Reality&quot; TV shows (such as COPS, 911, America's Most Wanted, and Unsolved Mysteries) take us inside the houses of the stigmatized poor and marginal for a glimpse of personal and social collapse, while shows about glamorous media stars and the lifestyles of the rich and famous present the millennial dream of a sudden twist of fate. Finally, critiques of the media, like critiques of modernity, are themselves often apocalyptic and millennial, depicting the media as conspiratorial, totalitarian, and contagious, or as a technological means of promoting universal education, common citizenship, global religious conversion, or utopian global community (Bray 1996, O'Leary 1998). The dialectic is unstable and subject to sudden shifts. In 1997, for instance, the utopian view of the interet as a teledemocracy and information superhighway gave way, for some, to darker themes of paranoia and conspiracy, with images of child pornography and sex cults trying to recruit new members online (Dean 1998:14). Mediation itself raises questions of control. Fears of cover-ups or of disinformation campaigns easily slide into full-blown conspiracy theories, and millennial hopes often turn on the dream of a return to direct action, direct, unmediated communication, and simple, authoritative truths imagined as a premodern state of being (Stewart 1999). The transition to advanced capitalist, or neo- or post-Fordist economics (processes of deregulation, privatization, franchise, and differentiation, and a shift from a product economy to a service and information economy) has produced down-sizing, reengineering, volatile markets, corporate mergers, transformations in the relationship between governments and corporations, growing inequality of income and control, and global dependence on huge communications industries (Mellencamp 1992). The new complex, or &quot;flexible,&quot; systems are large, diffuse, dynamic networks that are unpredictable and subject to sudden collapse or sudden shifts of control from one part of the system to another (Davis 1998, Martin 1994). Global scale means both unprecedented power and intense vulnerability to disruptions and outbreaks anywhere in the world, giving rise to fears of anarchy, terrorism, scarcity, crime, and overpopulation (R Kaplan 1994). Power and insecurity are expressed in apocalyptic and millennial idioms of breakthroughs and breakdowns, stock market crashes, and a New World Order. Contemporary &quot;risk society&quot; (Beck 1992, 1995) produces alarming worst-case scenarios in the very effort to calculate precise risks in order to insure against them (Buell 1998, Douglas 1985, Lupton 1993). Advertising commodifies both fear and the dream of personal, exceptional safety in selling everything from insurance to schools to cars to high-priced skin creams such as Charles of the Ritz &quot;Disaster Cream,&quot; Estee Lauder &quot;Skin Defender Cream,&quot; and Golden Door &quot;Crisis Cream&quot; (Mellencamp 1992). A nostalgia for a simple past and the figure of a utopian future are modeled, concretely, in master-planned and gated communities. The figure of a middle class has become a norm or ideal that signals safety, while the poor have dropped out of view except as criminals, spectacular &quot;failures&quot; as individuals, and dangerous urban mobs. Violence and abjection are seen as a contagion, like a virus: Self-control and social containment are the only known vaccine (W Brown 1995, Davis 1998). Brown (1995) argues further that we are seeing changes in the very conditions of democracy, including depoliticized, or naturalized, modes of domination; a state more obviously invested in particular economic interests, political ends, and social formations; the disintegration and fragmentation of forms of association other than those organized by the commodity market and the classificatory schemes of disciplinary society; an unparalleled powerlessness over the fate and direction of one's life coupled with an unrelieved individual responsibility without insulation from failure; and a politics ofressentiment, which takes suffering as a measure of social value. These changes challenge the presumption that there is a public that shares a notion of reality, a concept of reason, and a set of criteria by which claims to reason and rationality are judged (Dean 1998). The ideal of a central public sphere still sometimes animates the dream of a transcendent voice of reason, but it is no longer possible to deny fundamental differences between particular publics and counter-publics based on gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, and myriad other identities and socialities (B Robbins 1993, Gibbs 1996). These publics vie for a more general public voice and legitimacy (Dean 1998) through claims of suffering and heroism. Death, disaster, and impending catastrophe becomes the only thing that can unite a general &quot;public&quot; (Martin 1994), especially when apocalyptic threat is followed by millennial amnesia in the form of dreams of love and freedom achieved and miraculous new beginnings.<br />

<span style="background-color: white;">From this critical conception of ideology it is clear that the process of neoliberal globalization has gone hand-in-hand with the construction of enabling and supporting intersubjective meanings. The apparent triumph of neoliberal ideology in recent years is, however, the result of a long historical process in which the basic concepts of social life have been defined and constructed in certain ways (see Polanyi 1957). In this historical process even the unquestioned meanings of deeply embedded core social practices, such as what constitutes economic activity, become changed to fit particular interests, but are kept in the realm of what Bourdieu calls ‘dox’ where ‘the natural and social worlds appear as self-evidence’ (Bourdieu 1977: 164; also see MacLean 2000). Hence</span><span class="BoldUnderline">the purpose of neoliberal ideology is the construction of a sense of reality that the present</span>social structure of global capitalism and the<span class="BoldUnderline">distribution of wealth and power</span>engendered by that social structure<span class="BoldUnderline">is, and should be, natural</span>. That is that the global capitalist society is not the product of power and arbitrariness, but of normal and natural processes that have to be accepted. In this context, the summary argument that Bauman makes regarding neoliberal ideology needs emphasizing here: The point of similarity between the neo-liberal world-view and a typical ‘<span class="BoldUnderline">classic’ ideology</span>is that both<span class="BoldUnderline">serve as a priori frames for all future discourse</span>, setting what is seen apart from what goes unnoticed,<span class="BoldUnderline">awarding or denying relevance, determining the logic of reasoning and the evaluation of results.</span>What, however, makes the neo-liberal world view sharply different from other ideologies – indeed, a phenomenon of a separate class – is precisely the absence of questioning; its surrender to what is seen as the implacable and irreversible logic of social reality. (Bauman 1999: 127) In the ‘natural’ processes of globalization the political goal is to achieve a ‘self-evident’ structure of (global) society in which there is as near as possible a ‘quasi-perfect correspondence between the objective order and the subjective principles of organization’. In order to achieve this, those who wield power must capture the ‘instruments of knowledge of the social world’, as these are political instruments which contribute to the reproduction of the social world by producing immediate adherence to the world, seen as self-evident and undisputed, of which they are the product and of which they reproduce the structures in a transformed form. (Bourdieu 1977: 164)<span class="BoldUnderline">Hence the importance of not allowing epistemology</span>(one of the key instruments of knowledge of the social world’)<span class="BoldUnderline">to be defined as</span>‘given’, as<span class="BoldUnderline">outside the parameters of what we</span>in academic IPE<span class="BoldUnderline">should question. As Strange argued</span>in the last lines of her last piece of writing, ‘although academic debate by itself rarely changes the basic ideas…that at any time dominate the knowledge structure,<span class="BoldUnderline">academic debate</span>when it takes place against a background of growing disillusion, or doubt and uncertainty,<span class="BoldUnderline">can act as a catalyst to action</span>.11 One can only hope that, as in so many other aspects of IPE, she is right.<br />
Specifically, our act of rethinking the congressional agenda to include those forgotten by the current order creates a hot potato that politicizes the entire economic and social order, repoliticizing neoliberalism’s violence, and moving the periphery into the spotlight.<br />

<span class="BoldUnderline"> Where modernization risks have been 'recognized' - and there is a lot involved in that, not just knowledge, but collective knowledge of them, belief in them, and the political illumination of the associated chains of cause and effect - where this happens the risks develop an incredible political dynamic. </span>They forfeit everything, their latency, their pacifying 'side effect structure&quot;, their inevitability. Suddenly the problems are simply there, without justification, as pure, explosive challenges to action. <span class="BoldUnderline">People emerge from behind the conditions and objective constraints. Causes turn into causators and issue statements. 'Side effects' speak up, organize, go to court, assert themselves, refuse to be diverted any longer. As was said, the world has changed. These are the dynamics of reflexive politicization producing risk consciousness and conflict. This does not automatically help to counteract danger, but it opens up previously closed areas and opportunities for action. It produces the sudden melting point of the industrial order, where the unthinkable and unmakeable become possibilities for a short period. What begins to happen here, is of course supposed to be prevented through resisting recognition. This once again throws characteristic light on what is really at stake in the process of recognition for modernization risks.</span> The decisive factor here is not, or at least not only, the health consequences, the consequences for the life of plants, animals and people, but the social, economic and political side effects of these side effects: market collapses, devaluation of capital, creeping expropriation, new responsibilities, market shifts, political pressures, checks on plant deci*sions, recognition of compensation claims, gigantic costs, legal proceedings, and loss of face.<br />
And, the most important determination of ethics is accountability-randomness is inevitable to some degrees, but taking responsibility for violence and injustice is crucial to an effective ethical system<br />

<span class="BoldUnderline">The problems of hierarchy were mentioned in passing above</span>. These problems received a great deal of attention in the early post-war period leading to a trend away from hierarchical structures (see section on Contemporary Organizational Theory). <span class="BoldUnderline">Ultimately they are problems of accountability and responsibility. It is the foundation of fairness and justice that those who are responsible must be held accountabl</span>e. <span class="BoldUnderline">This axiom applies equally to organizational theory.</span> In a narrow, tall, pyramidal hierarchy it is hard to keep responsibility and accountability together<span class="BoldUnderline">. Accountability gravitates toward the top managers will be held accountable for performance. Responsibility heads down the chain of command as the executives become increasingly isolated from the substantive activity of their agencies. The problems of asymmetrical information</span> (subordinates have more information than their bosses<span class="BoldUnderline">), moral hazard</span> (subordinates know they will not be held accountable for poor performance so they perform poorly<span class="BoldUnderline">), shirking, and outright subversion become serious. Classical organizational theory failed to account for these tendencies. These unforeseen pathologies in complex hierarchies spurred a move away from classical organizational theory</span> (see section on Problematic Internal Institutional Pathologies for intelligence-specific examples).<br />

Economists may not necessarily share the economic and social interests of the true believers and may have a variety of individual psychic states regarding the economic and social effects of the utopia which they cloak with mathematical reason. Nevertheless, they have enough specific interests in the field of economic science to contribute decisively to the production and reproduction of belief in the neoliberal utopia. Separated from the realities of the economic and social world by their existence and above all by their intellectual formation, which is most frequently purely abstract, bookish, and theoretical, they are particularly inclined to confuse the things of logic with the logic of things. These economists trust models that they almost never have occasion to submit to the test of experimental verification and are led to look down upon the results of the other historical sciences, in which they do not recognise the purity and crystalline transparency of their mathematical games, whose true necessity and profound complexity they are often incapable of understanding. They participate and collaborate in a formidable economic and social change. Even if some of its consequences horrify them (they can join the socialist party and give learned counsel to its representatives in the power structure), it cannot displease them because, at the risk of a few failures, imputable to what they sometimes call &quot;speculative bubbles&quot;, it tends to give reality to the ultra-logical utopia (ultra-logical like certain forms of insanity) to which they consecrate their lives.<br />
The current system of risk results in the passing of responsibility for action onto abstract situations, we no longer take the responsibility ourselves, but instead shift it onto apocalyptic scenarios that demand we take a specific action, this results in the production of large-scale disasters for the sole purpose of sustaining the depoliticization of domination and to ensure that neoliberalism continues to have a population to sacrifice, this exposes the flaw of utilitarian thinking-it does not have any inherently ethical stance, but rather pushes off responsibility for decisions somewhere else and calls for us to to take a random action in order to prevent an unlikely scenario<br />

The Department of Defense defined ORS as “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of Joint Force Commanders needs”61 but the concept has its naysayers. Future funding and senior leadership support will demonstrate the necessity of implementing the ORS concept. The President’s Fiscal Year 2010 budget request significantly diminished the ORS budget. The $112.9 million request would reduce the FY 2009’s appropriations by $83.7 million (42.5%). HASC added $23.4 million to the ORS budget to fund remaining development and launch costs of the ORS-1 satellite. The Fiscal Year 2011 budget is still in work, however the FY11 Air Force Posture Statement stated a request of $94 million, almost 9% of the total space-related budget, for the ORS program. These on-demand space vehicles will only augment or temporarily replace large satellite systems, so they will most likely not have all the capabilities of the more complex spacecraft but they should have enough survivability and operational mission requirements to serve as temporary solutions. The ORS concept is sound and funded, but to be effective it must be delivered to the user efficiently on-time and on-budget. This innovative way of doing business in space starts with a revolutionary alteration in the current military space<br />

<strong>A stable, predictable funding stream is vital to ORS technology development</strong><br />
<span class="apple-converted-space"><strong><span style="color: #101010;">Dinerman, 6</span></strong></span>– DOD space consultant, and <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">senior editor at the Hudson Institute’s New York branch (Taylor, The Space Review, “</span></em>Tactical IR satellites: operationally responsive spacecraft?,” 8/7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/675/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/675/1</a><br />
<br />
The troops on the ground need information they can use in a timely and easily understood format. Simply to provide them, or division or brigade intelligence staffs that support them, with raw satellite data is probably worse than useless. The next generations of US Army and Marine Corps units are going to require information that can be integrated into their “network-centric” information systems. Imagery from space-based infrared sensors that are specifically designed for tactical utility should be part of these networks.<br />
This is a mission for a future constellation of small “operationally responsive” satellites. Part of the constellation should be kept in orbits that take them over places such as south Lebanon or the Afghan-Pakistani border where we can assume that there will be trouble for a long time to come. These should be carefully calibrated on a constant basis, so that their positioning information is ultra-precise. Other satellites can be kept on the ground ready to be launched at relatively short notice to supplement the ones on orbit over the world’s trouble spots, or they could be launched to cover unexpected outbreaks of fighting.<br />
A model for the way such a program could be run is GPS, which, over almost three decades, has gone from prototypes to sets of more and more sophisticated and capable satellites. These spacecraft have, on the whole, been both cost effective and free of the kinds of nasty and expensive surprises that have plagued SBIRS and other Air Force satellite programs.<br />
An operationally responsive tactical IR satellite system would have to be both affordable and based on proven and reliable technology. The first generation of such satellites may not have all the desired features, but if properly designed—with the right filters and the right level of multi- or hyper-spectral sensitivity—such craft would give the ground forces a valuable early operational capability.<br />
To make the program affordable it would have to be designed to use already existing bus and power supply systems and probably also an in-service communications architecture. It would have to be light enough to be launched on a Delta 2 or on a future operationally responsive spacelift vehicle. Most important of all, the funding stream—no matter how much or how little—would have to be predictable so that the contractors would have the incentive to plan for the long term. This would be the most difficult part of the program since it would mean asking Congress to give up part of its power over the annual budget cycle.<br />
Another way to keep the program affordable would be to keep the early requirements to a minimum. The first versions should be strictly for ground force use only, with perhaps some applications for Marine Corps amphibious warfare requirements. Only after the system has proven itself should the program be allowed to move on to develop air-to-ground sensor-to-shooter loops.<br />
Ultimately a constellation of a dozen or so spacecraft in orbit, backed up by a similar number on the ground, would be ideal for the early versions of the full system. The ground segments will have to be as simple and as inexpensive as possible since it will need to be deployed with more than fifty Army and Marine brigade-sized units as well as with higher headquarters.<br />
If the idea of operationally responsive space means anything, it means that the military space forces, particularly Air Force Space Command, are ready to give priority to supporting the troops on the front lines worldwide. Enhancing the combat effectiveness of the Army and the Marines and helping to save American lives should be the highest goal. As Clausewitz put it, “The object of fighting is the destruction or defeat of the enemy.” The more that military space contributes directly to that objective, the better for the troops on the ground and for America as a whole.<br />

ORS is inevitable – other space powers will do it if the US doesn’t<br />
<span class="AuthorDate">Wertz, 8 </span>- president of Microcosm, a space technology small business in Los Angeles, and the general chairman for the first five Responsive Space Conferences (James, “It’s time to get our ORS in gear,” The Space Review, 1/7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1032/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1032/1</a>)<br />
<br />
Can the US overcome bureaucratic impediments in order to make it happen?<br />
Here we would have to say that no one knows. It may or may not occur for all of the reasons that Dwayne Day has clearly pointed out. The need for ORS has been formalized for some years in the <em>Operationally Responsive Spacelift Mission Need Statement</em> (ORS MNS) of December 20, 2001. But that does not mean that it will actually come about. There are a variety of entrenched interests and organizational sandboxes arrayed against ORS, or trying to reshape it in their own image. This is, of course, the same process that has brought us $32 billion in cost overruns in the ten largest DoD space programs according to a 2007 <em>Aviation Week</em> article. We would have to conclude that the odds of success are slim, but not zero. In many past technology developments, it has been Congress that has made things happen. That may or may not occur here.<br />
One thing seems clear: if ORS doesn’t happen in the US, it will certainly happen elsewhere. According to a DoD 2007 assessment, the Chinese have already announced a near-term goal of launching satellites within hours of demand. The Russians have been able to do so for years. The Europeans are well ahead of the US in a formalized process for creating low-cost space missions. The rest of the world will move ahead with the capability to respond rapidly to changing world events, irrespective of whether the US chooses to do so.<br />

Put your disads away – ORS test launch should have triggered the link<br />

And Now The Tests Begin (Satellite),” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.satnews.com/cgi-bin/story.cgi?number=856786810" rel="nofollow">http://www.satnews.com/cgi-bin/story.cgi?number=856786810</a>)<br />
[SatNews] New capabilities will be delivered to combatant commanders in short order. Air Force Space Command provided <em>ORS-1</em> for early COCOM acceptance and entry into trial period, signifying the start of the satellite’s year-long mission under the direction of the 1st Space Operations Squadron and U.S. Strategic Command who will operate and task the satellite in direct support of USCENTCOM, September 29th. Since its launch June 29, the ORS-1 spacecraft has undergone an exhaustive checkout from component initialization to sensor calibration and system characterization. The satellite features a modified version of the <em>Senior Year Electro-optical Reconnaissance System-2</em> sensor currently flown on the U-2 aircraft and was developed to address a U.S. Central Command need for enhanced battlespace awareness. The satellite, which was developed as a partnership between theORS Office and SMC’s Space Development and Test Directorate, uses an existing payload and bus structure to deliver new capabilities to the combatant commander in record time. ORS-1 was developed from an initial concept to an operational capability in just under three years. “The entire government and contractor team worked tremendously hard to meet CENTCOM's need and deliver ORS-1 in record time, and we are very proud of the capabilities ORS-1 is providing to CENTCOM today,” said Col. <em>Carol Welsch</em>, acting director for the Space Development and Test Directorate. “This success would not have been possible without the outstanding teamwork between the ORS Office, SMC, 50th Space Wing, Goodrich, ATK, Orbital Sciences Corp. and Lockheed Martin. I'm inspired by the dedication of this team and look forward to applying lessons from our ORS-1 experience on future responsive space programs.” &quot;This transition is an important step toward providing operational capabilities to support our deployed Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines,” said Dr. Peter Wegner, director of the Operationally Responsive Space Office. “I am extremely proud of the teamwork exhibited by the government and contractors.&quot; The Space and Missile Systems Center’s Space Development and Test Directorate transferred <em>Satellite Control Authority</em> of the ORS-1 to Air Force Space Command’s 14th Air Force on September 15th. This transfer of authority marked the end of the early-orbit checkout phase and the beginning of early operations for the Air Force’s first ORS mission. The satellite will be focused on supporting the warfighter in the deployed theater. The satellite will also undergo a six-month <em>Joint Military Utility Assessment</em>, which will evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the system, as well as identify possible technical changes that can be made to improve future ORS missions.<br />

Space assets are vulnerable- makes attacks inev<br />
<span class="AuthorDate">Rendleman, 10 –[</span> Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science]<br />
The 11 January 2007 test of a Chinese ground-based, direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) kinetic-kill interceptor against one of their own defunct weather satellites generated considerable angst across the United States space community. The 2007 test demonstrated that the importance of space capabilities is also their Achilles heel, that is, their deadly weakness in spite of overall strength; it is far too easy to neutralize space systems and their power. In the broad strategic context, space capabilities have their own set of unique, inherent vulnerabilities, which are largely the result of orbital mechanics. This invites destruction, damage, and even just mischief delivered by even the least significant adversary. However, other nations may seek to deny U.S. advantages in space through a variety of negation and prevention actions.<br />
Negation Threats<br />
Satellite systems consist not only of spacecraft, each with their own payload and bus, but also a supporting infrastructure—ground control stations, tracking and control links, commonly referred to as the tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&amp;C) links, data links, launch facilities, and an industrial base. Each of these components is at risk to threats of physical and cyber attack, and sabotage, and can be negated, simultaneously or each in detail. The satellite payload, bus, links, and infrastructure can be negated by using a variety of permanent or reversible means to achieve one of the five possible effects, known as the ‘‘five Ds’’—deception, disruption, denial, degradation, and destruction.5<br />
Space-based threats proliferate as a result of the ever-growing global availability of technology and access to the space domain. There are huge incentives for states to invest in and use space, and the spread of space technologies has occurred. States with sufficient resources can now reach out to space and ‘‘touch’’ satellites through a variety of means, and achieve one and even more of the five Ds. Spacecraft are vulnerable to direct ascent weapons as demonstrated by the Chinese ASAT test, and to a variety of other groundbased, airborne, and space-based ASAT technologies. Direct-ascent launched, or orbit-based nuclear devices, can be detonated, generating radiation and other lethal effects to destroy unshielded electronics over a wide lethal range. Co-orbital ASATs could be employed, comparable to the old Soviet system that was tested extensively in the 1970s and early 80s. In a less likely scenario, space-borne mines can also be deployed in close proximity to spacecraft, or exploded to generate debris clouds that destructively engage whole classes of satellites in the same orbital plane or in crossing orbits. Ground, space-based, or airborne lasers could be used by adversaries to wreak havoc. Blinding operations could be executed and inflict effects ranging from temporary ‘‘dazzling’’ to permanent burnout of optical or other sensors with intense energy bursts.<br />
Ground systems, supporting communications, and their nodes, are vulnerable to diverse land, sea, or air kinetic attacks, including sabotage. Unprotected systems are also susceptible to electronic attack through jamming and electromagnetic deception techniques. Jammers emit signals that mask or prevent reception of desired signals; these methods can disrupt uplinks, downlinks, and even cross-links. By disabling the means of command and control, and data communications, jammers render satellites inoperable or unavailable. Electromagnetic deception techniques can be employed to confuse systems; this could include sending false, but deceptively plausible, commands that cause spacecraft to perform damaging or wasteful maneuvers, modify databases or execute configuration changes, or otherwise destroy it.<br />
Similarly, supporting terrestrial ground stations, computer networks, and links are vulnerable to information operation and cyber attacks. These attacks could involve directing global denial of service tasks, injecting fake commands, malicious software and viruses into the space system, performing unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of sensitive information (data interception), and causing unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of network information, services, and databases.<br />
In sum, there is a wide span of kinetic and other types of attacks an adversary could consider and employ. There is potential that even non-state actors can access some of these technologies and space systems, and achieve several of the five Ds; however, it is unlikely they can obtain and then employ a full-spectrum of these means and achieve all of these effects. Conducting an attack within the space domain involves a rather substantial investment to develop, acquire, operate, and sustain needed shooter, sensor, and command and control systems. Given the scope and commitment needed to affect such a move, an on-orbit attack would probably be made only in the context of a larger strategic struggle, perhaps as a prelude to or part of early combat operations. On the other hand, inexpensive jamming technology is available to even the poorest potential adversaries. As such, jamming poses the most used and growing threat to space systems. Some argue that jamming also carries with it implicit political and legal sanctions since no major space power has moved to ban or make even temporary and reversible jamming illegal. This may change now that a number of nations have banned together to object to recent Iranian satellite jamming.6 Cyber adversaries and criminals are also beginning to hone their craft. They present an evolving threat to space systems; and like jamming, cyber threats can be developed and deployed for only modest investments.<br />
Prevention Threats<br />
Prevention actions generally involve economic, political, informational, and diplomatic instruments of national power. For example, an extremely large creditor nation could employ its considerable economic clout and leverage in an attempt to compel or blackmail the United States to not license or permit imaging of its territory, preventing its use, and reducing its exposure to such observation. The creditor nation could seek to accomplish its objective by destabilizing the world market place. It could refuse to purchase treasury offerings that underpin the burgeoning U.S. fiscal and trade deficits, perhaps arguing that remote sensing, especially commercial remote sensing, of its territory infringes on its territorial and sovereign rights, or that it constitutes ‘‘unlawful’’ industrial espionage, and is thus, an unfair trade practice.7 Commercial remote sensing systems are nowan important resource for the United States Government and its national security needs. U.S. Government orders help sustain and stabilize the remote sensing industry,8 and any limitations on activities, whether for U.S. Government customers or commercial ones, imposed in response to external economic threats could evolve to cause problems. In an alternative scenario, a state, acting through political allies and proxies, could exert considerable influence and dominance to affect a change in U.S. law. This change could restrict licensing of commercial remote sensing imagery, restricting the market place and impacting business models for producers.9<br />
As a diplomatic prevention example, adversaries could attempt to use international forums and treaties to deny frequency rights needed by U.S. military or intelligence satellites by making spurious ‘‘paper satellite’’ filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). ‘‘Paper satellites’’ involve ITU applications for satellite orbital slots, many for ‘‘speculative’’ systems that will never leave Earth. These filings can block access to scarce spectrum and orbital resources.10 The ability to place communications and other satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) positions could be held at risk. Some characterize some of these types of actions as a form of ‘‘lawfare.’’ ‘‘The term lawfare describes the growing use of international law claims, usually factually or legally meritless, as a tool of war. The goal is to gain a moral advantage over your enemy in the court of world opinion, and potentially a legal advantage in national and international tribunals.’’11<br />
Prevention actions taken to hobble U.S. space systems are not armed attacks. As is discussed later, the use of force is only authorized under the United Nations (UN) Charter in response to an armed attack, or upon authorization of the UN Security Council. As such, using armed force to deter and defeat prevention actions involving political or diplomatic subterfuge or intrigue may be unlawful under international law. Creative alternative solutions must therefore be found to assure access to space when facing these types of threats.<br />
Implications for U.S. Space Strategy<br />
The wide span of threats poses profound implications for U.S. space strategy and its execution. First, unlike the Cold War era, the United States now confronts a wide array of global actors, all operating with different motivations and incentives, some of which could become potential adversaries who can attack or threaten space capabilities. These state and non-state adversaries exhibit a wide array of political, economic, technical, and social differences. Having many potential adversaries makes each of them harder to understand. This complicates efforts to understand motivations and to influence perceptions for deterrence purposes. These differences, in turn, increase the likelihood of misperception, undercutting strategies to protect access to space capabilities. When one’s attention is divided, deterrent measures that are appropriate for one target may not be useful, or even counterproductive, for another. This requires tailored intelligence efforts, information operations, and transparency efforts in order to avoid or minimize disputes and prevent problems.<br />
Second, the broad array of adversaries exhibit widely varying risk-taking behaviors. Risk-taking behavior can strongly influence an adversary’s perception of a situation. Understanding this phenomenon can lead to better ways of influencing those perceptions. Unfortunately, potential adversaries may not care that space systems offer tremendous value and capabilities to all nations, or care whether conflict in space could create space debris that could cost all nations access to the domain. A strategy to assure continuing access to space assets must therefore be sufficiently flexible to address both risk-averse and risk-taking adversaries. Indeed, potential adversaries may shift from risk-taking to risk-adverse over a relatively short period of time. China may fit in this category. Within a decade or two, it will have its own extensive space-based communications, navigation, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellite constellations, all of which will be integrated into its military operations. No doubt, China will embrace that evolution and become very reliant on space capabilities; this will shift it from an asymmetric competitor to one similar to the United States or Russia. Third, with the demise of the Soviet Union, some political commentators and critics described the United States as a ‘‘hyperpower’’ not just a ‘‘superpower.’’ 12 Though buffeted by recent events involving Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and the 2008 global financial meltdown, U.S. military supremacy continues. But, that supremacy does not make or guarantee a successful space strategy. Adversaries may believe they have a higher stake than the United States in the outcome of a particular crisis or conflict. Alternatively, the United States stake in the crisis may not be commensurate with the possible cost of involvement by the United States military and the rest of its national security apparatus. The first alternative may encourage mischief by adversaries; the second discourages U.S. action. As a result, adversaries may find threats of U.S. action in response to hostile acts affecting U.S. access to space systems to be non-credible.<br />
Fourth, while the United States has produced superlative space capabilities, it has not produced enough systems ready to survive the new kinetic, exotic, jamming, and cyber threat environment. The vulnerability exists because the spacecraft developed and deployed today are in many ways the same as those originally fielded during the Cold War. During that epic struggle, there was a tacit and then explicit understanding that each superpower would not attack and overwhelm the other’s space systems, except in the direst of circumstances, perhaps during the throes of a nuclear conflagration. Indeed, a number of agreements between the superpowers adopted the understanding and ruled out interference with national technical means, including space assets. This belief in the superiority of space systems and power blinds the United States to the inherent strategic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in these systems. This, predictably, can now be exploited by potential adversaries, such as China, who, with their recent ASAT test, appear more willing to fully explore the technologies needed to expand the limits of conventional war to include the space domain. Consequently, by historically and diplomatically reducing the threat, engineering of some satellite threat detection, attack avoidance, and other defense subsystems have not matured enough so that they are sophisticated, nimble, and robust enough to counter new 21st Century adversary attack capabilities.<br />

<strong>China has the intent to attack</strong><br />
<strong>Wortzel, 8</strong> - Colonel, United States Army (Retired) (Larry, Astropolitics, 6:112–137, “THE CHINESE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY<br />
AND SPACE WARFARE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
The PLA is exploring in theoretical research, basic research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons.77 These include:<br />
. satellite jamming technology;<br />
. collisions between space bodies;<br />
. kinetic energy weapons;<br />
. space-to-ground attack weapons;<br />
. space planes that can transit and fight ‘‘up or down’’ in the upper atmosphere or space;<br />
. high-power laser weapons;<br />
. high-power microwave weapon systems;<br />
. particle-beam weapons; and<br />
. electromagnetic pulse.78<br />
PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies. The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not, it is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the blinding of a U.S. satellite mean they are achieving some success.<br />
PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 The Chinese see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they would probably use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.S.81<br />
One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. As the PLA modernizes its own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4SIR) systems, it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict.<br />
The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites<br />
One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons or a deeper crisis.<br />
For example, four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College, in Wuhan, have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S.82 In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85<br />
In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88<br />
The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems. One possible reaction by the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike against China’s strategic missile forces. Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research.<br />
Space Deterrence<br />
Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems.<br />
In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability.<br />
Conclusions<br />
There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First, in the event of conflict with the PLA, military operations carried out across all the domains of war, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, are likely. Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA.<br />
U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions. There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims;97 the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory.<br />
The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance. No such dialogue has taken place with China. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures.<br />
Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability. PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature. By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S. To this end, the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict.<br />

Military space missions Little is known about the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) actual capability to wage war in space. What has been demonstrated, however, including the 2007 ASAT<span style="color: green;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/2" rel="nofollow">test</a></span>and reports of China blinding US intelligence satellites, has caused much consternation across the world. One aspect of Chinese military aspirations in space that has been studied is the internal publications of the PLA and its stated views on space doctrine. Increasingly, these writings have accepted the inevitability of the weaponization of space and called for appropriate preparations to be made to successfully wage war in space. Given the dual-use nature of most space technology, it is no surprise that China’s military uses of space are advancing commensurately with its civilian and commercial programs. First of all, China is widely known to have an array of intelligence satellites for space reconnaissance and surveillance. The Ziyuan Earth observation satellite is known to be one of these, but China has also fielded the Fanhui Shi Weixing, or Retrievable Satellite, which drops canisters of film from space.15 China’s ongoing microsatellite program has sparked some of the most concern abroad. Aside from intelligence satellites, microsatellites have many potential offensive uses such as maneuvering in range of an adversary’s satellite and either latching on—a “parasitic microsat”—to disrupt proper functions, or merely exploding within range of a target satellite to destroy it. Furthermore, the ability to deploy a constellation of microsatellites on short notice, a capability China may already possess with its Kaituozhe launch<span style="color: green;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/2" rel="nofollow">vehicle</a></span>, denies the deterrence factor that could otherwise prevent offensive attacks on an adversary’s space assets for fear of retaliation. China’s rocket technology also has proven offensive military use in space: the ability to shoot down enemy assets in space through direct ascent attacks. China demonstrated such ability in 2007, which has been the impetus for much of the recent speculation about China’s military space aspirations. Despite political blowback from this test (it resulted in a 20 percent increase in the total amount of trackable space debris in low Earth orbit), China may still be pursuing ASAT technologies.16In January 2010 China conducted a successful test of its ground-based midcourse missile interception technology. This test used technology similar to its 2007 ASAT test and, as exemplified by the US Navy-led Operation Burnt Frost that intercepted the satellite USA 193, missile defense technology can serve ASAT ends. In addition to these hard-kill capabilities, China has the capability to use soft-kill measures to neutralize adversary’s space assets. China is known to have the means to jam satellite communication and GPS receivers and is developing directed energy ASATs, including high-powered microwave and particle beam weapons.17The US Department of Defense (DoD), in their annual report to Congress on China’s military modernization, also notes that China is developing ground-based laser ASATs, the beginnings of which may have already been demonstrated. In 2006 the director of the National Reconnaissance Office, Donald Kerr, substantiated reports that China used a ground-based laser to dazzle a US spy satellite over its territory. Although this laser could not do any long-term damage, similar techniques and capabilities used to track and dazzle this satellite could be coupled with more powerful ground-based lasers to destroy space assets. Some reports actually indicate China has already tested and deployed a ground-based ASAT laser that can target assets in LEO.18 Despite the array of activity the PLA conducts in and through space, they seem to lack a specific doctrine for the employment of their space capabilities and have not made public any substantial plans for military uses of space. In lieu of a formal declaration on space, there is a growing literature from <strong>within</strong> the PLA ranks that may be forming the basis for what later becomes stated—or unstated—PLA space doctrine. These authors generally hold the same assumptions about space, including the inevitability that space will be a domain of war in the future.19Many also acknowledge that establishing space dominance will be crucial to fully exploiting wartime necessities such as control of airspace and secure command and control.20 Three internal Chinese sources are largely cited <strong>as being the defining PLA space doctrine writings</strong>:<em>Space War</em>by Colonel Li Daguang;<em>On Space Operations</em>by Colonel Jia Junming; and<em>Joint Space War Campaigns</em>by Colonel Yuan Zelu.21Colonel Li highlights many specific recommendations to develop the PLA’s space fighting capabilities, including fielding offensive capabilities capable of “destroying or temporarily incapacitating all enemy space vehicles that fly in space above our sovereign territory.” Other recommendations include focusing development on land-based anti-satellite weapons and anti-satellite satellites as well as “assassin’s mace” space weapons that could deal a crippling blow to an enemy. Particularly important to foreign perceptions of China, these writings also call for China to combine military and civilian technology and integrate peacetime and wartime facilities. Other authors on the subject promote such actions as: fielding sea-launched anti-satellite weapons, attacking GPS with high energy laser weapons, fielding stealthy space satellites and weapons, and seeking the ability to attack terrestrial targets from space. Kevin Pollpeter, summing up the view of most Chinese authors writing on the subject, writes, “<strong>The development of space technology will inevitably lead to the militarization of space and space militarization will lead to confrontation in space</strong>. As the struggle over air and space control is becoming the new focal point of war, space will become the main battlefield of future wars.”22Pollpeter also notes that throughout his extensive review of Chinese space writings, there were no rebuttals to the view that China will inevitability develop and use counterspace weapons. These views also seem to be held by some in the upper echelons of the PLA. In November 2009, PLA Air Force (PLAAF) commander Xu Qiliang stated in an interview with the PLA Daily newspaper, an official government publication, that the militarization of space is a “historical inevitability” and called on the PLAAF to develop offensive and defensive capabilities in space.23Xu is not only the head of the PLAAF, but as of 2007 was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (CCCP) and a member of the Central Military Commission (CMC)—two primary policy decision making bodies in China. The Foreign Ministry tried to backtrack on Xu’s comments days later by reiterating that China has “all along upheld the peaceful use of outer space,” and would not be part of a space arms race.24However, Xu did not personally retract his statements and, given his elite government position, this interview could actually be exemplary of how some of China’s top official’s views space. Indeed, there is some indication the CCCP acknowledges the need to prepare for the weaponization of space. In December 2010, the official publication of the CCCP, the Qiushi Journal, on its website released an article that spoke to China’s perspectives on space war: China's missiles can directly attack the military satellites, which usually orbit at an altitude less than 10,000 kilometers...China should make efforts to develop space weapons as soon as possible, as this is the most effective military means of attacking the U.S. If we can eventually fire missiles from a satellite, the U.S. will find that it has nowhere to hide; it will find itself entirely exposed to the attack radius of Chinese weaponry…Vigorously strengthening the building of our space military forces should be not only the focus of our national defense, but also the most powerful weapon to deter U.S. military blackmail.25 After the article was translated into English, the original Chinese version was altered to state that the views were those of the authors only. In a society well versed in controlling media and hiding military intentions, it is interesting the Chinese government is allowing these and other perspectives to be published containing such inflammatory language on space warfare. This suggests that perhaps the views are not condemned or are being floated as trial balloons to gauge foreign response.<br />

But at present, the nation would be at a disadvantage in long range conflicts with the U.S.: However, naval forces at sea and ground forces operating outside the Chinese mainland (even as close as Taiwan) would still require secure, mobile communications for military functions such as command and control.

PLA is isolated from the Chinese govt<br />
MacDonald, 11 <strong>- Senior Director, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program, U.S. Institute of Peace (Bruce, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA”, 5/11, lexis)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>One characteristic of too many wars in the last century is that they are the result of miscalculation that ignites the tinder of fundamental geopolitical tensions. Averting major power conflict requires skillful management of tensions by senior leaders of the major powers. China has become much more internationally sophisticated, though with important exceptions, in its dealings with the rest of the world than has been true in the past, and this is reflected in its civilian leadership. Unfortunately, the PLA's senior officer corps trails its civilian counterparts in this respect. They have much less interaction with foreign official and travel abroad much less frequently than their U.S. counterparts. This means that the PLA overall views world events from a less knowledgeable and sophisticated perspective, a danger in this increasingly complex world, and could explain, for example, the political &quot;tonedeafness&quot; of the PLA in the manner they conducted their 2007 ASAT test.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>This PLA problem becomes more serious when one realizes that the PLA is organizationally separate from the rest of the Chinese government, and reports only to the Central Military Commission, currently chaired by President Hu Jintao. President Hu, and his likely successors, have no significant military background, and the majority of the CMC's members are top PLA officers, suggesting that civilian oversight of major military decisions and consideration of their larger implications are not as carefully reviewed as in the U.S. government. Normally this would not be too great a concern, but in a crisis this could be dangerous. Add to this the fact that China has no equivalent of our National Security Council, a critically important body for coordinating our security decisionmaking, and one comes away concerned about the relative insularity of the PLA in the Chinese power structure.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In a crisis, the PLA probably cannot be counted on to show as sophisticated a sense of judgment as one would hope any country's military leaders, even an enemy's, to show. All these problems and many more pose potential threats to internal political stability and Communist Party control, providing ample opportunity for crisis and conflict in the years ahead.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Overview of The Strategic Landscape of Space</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Space assets, and the communications and cyber links that enable them to function, are the means by which essential national security information is either generated, transmitted, or both. This information is the lifeblood of U.S. conventional military superiority and plays a key role in U.S. strategic nuclear posture as well. As such, these space related assets represent extraordinarily appealing targets in any future conflict, and their relative vulnerability can provide dangerously attractive incentives in a crisis to preempt, escalating to war. Resisting this temptation to attack may be morally virtuous but could be strategically unwise: going first in a space conflict with a nearpeer space adversary appears to offer many advantages, while absorbing such a strike, with all its attendant destruction of military capabilities, and then responding to the attack against an opponent fully expecting such a response, appears to be militarily and strategically quite undesirable.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>As technology advances, the ways of interfering with, disrupting, or destroying information streams in space or supporting space systems will likely increase, as will U.S. and others' dependence upon such systems. Providing defensive options for U.S. space assets should be pursued where appropriate, but most space observers believe that offense has the advantage in space over defense, as General Cartwright observed last May. Cartwright also noted that the challenging issues that space poses has made the Space Posture Review &quot;the most difficult of all the defense reviews&quot; the Obama Administration has undertaken.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The overall U.S. goal in space should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States and its allies, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. and allied security. The United States has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies. This need not mean that China and others must perforce be disadvantaged by such an arrangement - there should be ample opportunity for many countries to benefit and prosper from a properly crafted system of space management.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>There is an inherent risk of strategic instability when relatively modest defense efforts create disproportionate danger to an adversary, as with</strong><br />
<strong>space offense. And there is a serious risk of crisis instability in space when &quot;going first&quot; pays off - destroying an adversary's satellites before he destroys yours. We don't know what would happen in a crisis, but the potential for space instability seems high and likely to grow.</strong><br />

<strong>Marshall, 8 - NASA Ames Research Center (Will, Astropolitics, 6:154–199, “REDUCING THE VULNERABILITY OF SPACE ASSETS: A</strong><br />
<strong>MULTITIERED MICROSATELLITE CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE,” Ebsco Political Science)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Space assets are one of the most critical ‘‘Achilles’ heels’’ of the current military capability of the United States (U.S.). This is for two reasons: (1) the U.S. military space systems—in particular reconnaissance, navigation, signals intelligence, early warning, and communications systems—are critical to modern military warfare and intelligence; and (2) space systems are inherently vulnerable to attack. This combination is understood at the highest levels and was espoused in the ‘‘Rumsfeld Space Commission’’ with talk of a ‘‘Space Pearl Harbor.’’1 Whether one agrees with the tone, this is a genuine security problem for the U.S. in need of a near-term solution. While there have been numerous papers, and much media and academic attention, in the space security discussion focused on promoting or criticizing space-based weapons,2 there have been far fewer papers and studies offering constructive ways forward that deal with these genuine security concerns in a broader sense.3</strong><br />
<strong>The central motivation for this paper is to put forward one key element—the satellite architecture—in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. space assets. It is hoped that this idea, together with others like it, should stimulate and contribute to a debate on more constructive ways forward for how to achieve space security in the post-Cold war world.</strong><br />
<strong>Importance of Space Assets</strong><br />
<strong>For better or worse, it is clear that the U.S. military is to some significant extent dependent on its key satellites, which number about 86–105 operational satellites at present. These satellites constitute a significant part of the eyes, ears, and central nervous system of the modern military.4 A practical example that helps to illustrate this is the case of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. First, the decision to go was based in part on satellite imagery and signals intelligence from satellites; whether or not it was interpreted or used correctly is a separate issue. Second, the planning and operation were facilitated by satellite imagery. Third, many planes, ships, tanks, and units’ positions were known through Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and even most munitions were guided by GPS. Fourth, the operation was commanded from the U.S. in large part through the use of communications satellites. Perhaps more importantly than any of the functions in the Iraq example, early warning (EW) satellites are the U.S.’s and Russia’s first warning of nuclear missile attack. As Gray classified, space assets have moved from being ‘‘useful and important’’ to an ‘‘indispensable adjunct’’ in the military over the last decade.5</strong><br />
<strong>Space assets are definitely used a great deal by the U.S. military, but that does not mean necessarily as strong a dependence as Gray implies. The loss of U.S. space assets could range in its effect anywhere from a loss to the U.S. military in practical operations, to being catastrophic to U.S. security. The former would entail a reduction in operational effectiveness or speed, but fundamentally supposes that back-up systems and/or redundancy allow a near continuation of military capability. The latter scenario would entail an effective disablement of the U.S. military capability from normal operations. In reality, the significance lies between these boundaries, but this is a topic that could benefit from further research.</strong><br />

<strong>Primacy fills in for powerless institutions—key to solve genocide and mass violence globally</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The United States possesses the military and economic means to act assertively on a global basis, but should it do so, and if so, how? In short, if the United States conducts itself in this way, will the world be safer and more stable, and is such a role in America’s national interest? Here, the anarchy problem is especially pertinent. The capacity of the United Nations to act, especially in coping with the most urgent and deadly problems, is severely limited, and in this sense, the demand for “global governance” far exceeds the supply. Since its inception in 1945, there have only been two occasions (Korea in 1950 and Kuwait in 1991) when the U.N. Security Council authorized the use of force, and in both instances the bulk of the forces were provided by the United States. In the most serious cases, especially those involving international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, ethnic cleansing, civil war, and mass murder, if America does not take the lead, no other country or organization is willing or able to respond effectively. The deadly cases of Bosnia (1991–95) and Rwanda (1994) make this clear. In their own way, so did the demonstrations by the people of Liberia calling for American intervention to save them from the ravages of predatory militias in a failed state. And the kness of the international reaction to ethnic cleansing, rape, and widespread killing in the Darfur region of Western Sudan provides a more recent example.</strong><br />

Commitment to ORS is vital to eterrence by denial – it will prevent attacks against US space assets<br />
Sejba, 10 <strong>- USAF Congressional Budget Liaison Officer Budget and Appropriations Liaison Directorate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget Secretary of the Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC (Timothy, “ Deterrence for Space: Is Operationally Responsive Space Part of the Solution?”, High Frontier, May, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf</a>)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The space domain, often referred to as “The High Frontier,” no longer is a sanctuary outside the reach of foreign intervention. The threat to space systems and their capabilities is broad, ranging from reversible effects such as jamming or blinding, to more destructive means such as anti-satellite weapons. It is now time to take actions for the <em>sake of space</em>, and assure its continued contributions across the full spectrum of military operations. Given the criticality of space to not only our military power, but also our economic power, it is time we develop policies and field capabilities to deter future adversaries from attempting to degrade, deny, or destroy space capabilities and services. The asymmetric advantages enabled by space can no longer be assumed and as a result, a new National Security Strategy for space must be forged, one that combines deterrence with basic protection capabilities never before afforded our space systems. Yet, space deterrence is not an “all in” strategy, nor can it reduce the risk of attack to zero.1 Should aspects of deterrence fail, we must take steps to defend and protect our space systems and the critical global services they provide.</strong><br />
<strong>Operationally responsive space (ORS) by definition is “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of joint force commanders’ needs.”2 Dissected further, one key word stands out: <em>assured</em> … being sufficiently robust, timely, agile, adaptive, and resilient, to achieve desired outcomes with a high degree of certainty.3 So while ORS intends to provide operational and tactical support to the joint warfighter, its true value will be the assurance it provides as a credible strategic <em>deterrent</em> against space attacks.</strong><br />
<strong>As a deterrent, ORS provides access to existing capabilities, or rapid deployment and employment of new capabilities, denying the benefits our adversaries may seek by attacking our space capabilities. Through timely and accurate intelligence, we can work to understand our adversaries’ intent and armed with this knowledge, we gain the opportunity to influence their decision-making calculus. Understanding intent, coupled with credible and timely ORS capabilities, can effectively deny or greatly reduce the benefits they seek by attacking the asymmetric advantages enabled by space.</strong><br />
<strong>ORS provides a responsiveness that will allow the commander, US Strategic Command (CDR USSTRATCOM), to respond and support our combatant commands real-time and near-term requirements. To support these requirements, ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year.</strong><br />
<strong>The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations.</strong><br />
<strong>Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space</strong><br />
<strong>For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space. In fact, a deterrence strategy that includes the threat of punishment (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space.</strong><br />
<strong>For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form, mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy; a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy is not directly applicable to space.6</strong><br />
<strong>Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space.</strong><br />
<strong>Instead, deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries (against their most prized assets);9 and encourage their restraint.</strong><br />
<strong>A New Focus of Deterrence</strong><br />
<strong><em>What does deterrence look like in the 21</em><em>st</em> <em>century? The US has not yet figured that out, said Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear.</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>~</em> Sandra I. Erwin, <em>Future of War—How the Game is Changing</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>… Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.…</em> ~ US National Security Strategy, 2006</strong><br />
<strong>In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command.</strong><br />
<strong>The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making.”10 In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations even in a contested environment.</strong><br />
<strong>Deny the Benefits—ORS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Examples</strong><br />
<strong><em>People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) view of space: Space shifting from enabler to key battleground. Space characterized as important because it contributes to information dominance; space now described as important in its own right….many in the PLA see space as a likely future arena for conflict.</em></strong><br />
<strong>~ Space and PRC National Security,’ Dean Cheng, China specialist, The Heritage Foundation, 8 October 2008.12</strong><br />
<strong>The purpose to benefit denial is to convince an adversary that their intent will not be achieved, or have little to no value. Today, our ability to field ORS capabilities is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent. Instead, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities. These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency. However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack.”14</strong><br />
<strong>The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices.</strong><br />
<strong>Moving forward, to be a true deterrent, ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them. Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). Tier 1 and Two ORS capabilities can be deployed and employed rapidly, within hours to days. The cost for Tier 1 includes implementing new concept of operations for deployed on-orbit systems, or the rapid, low cost launch and deployment of systems intended to augment existing systems for Tier 2.</strong><br />

<strong><span class="BoldUnderline">The U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities</span>. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. <span class="BoldUnderline">The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities</span>. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that <span class="BoldUnderline">efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities.</span> ,,39 Further, <span class="BoldUnderline">the DoD's Plan for Operationally Responsive Space highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness and adaptability to the threat</span>, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42 The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43 The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44 While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , <span class="BoldUnderline">ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements</span>. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. <span class="BoldUnderline">Field-ready systems would provide a credible defensive deterrent against existing and likely Chinese offensive anti-satellite actions.</span> PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement. Space Situational Awareness <span class="BoldUnderline">Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy. The U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Although the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network</span> (SSN) network, <span class="BoldUnderline">it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space</span>;<span class="BoldUnderline"> the</span> February 10, 2009 <span class="BoldUnderline">collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise</span>.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. <span class="BoldUnderline">Improved SSA also allows the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites</span>. Intelligence Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States. Preplanned Satellite Actions <span class="BoldUnderline">Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting to an anti-satellite attack. </span>While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These <span class="BoldUnderline">orbital maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the anti-satellite weapon</span>. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target. Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. <span class="BoldUnderline">If a conflict looks to be inevitable, they could decide to rapidly execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. If the conflict escalates into a conventional war, the single maneuver may buy the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">enough time to execute a kinetic strike that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program.</span> The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets. Variable and Rapid Launch Capability <span class="BoldUnderline">The current United States Department of Defense launch complex does not have the capability to rapidly replenish satellites in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies</span>. Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48 Small Satellites <span class="BoldUnderline">The United States must also make a move towards smaller satellites that use a common bus and architecture</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">A single launch vehicle could then deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the rapid establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict or replenishment of an old one</span>. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 <span class="BoldUnderline">Having numerous small satellites ready to launch can also lesson the need to perform defensive orbital maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished</span>. Finally, <span class="BoldUnderline">small satellites are inherently harder to track whether by radar or optical telescopes</span>. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites. Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe. Decreased Dependence on Space Systems The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission. Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, <span class="BoldUnderline">defense against the long term radiation effects must focus on hardening all future satellites against nuclear explosions. Without hardening, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite replenishment could take months and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost</span>.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites. Institutional Changes Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user. Transparency <span class="BoldUnderline">The above actions may deter China from further pursuing its anti-satellite programs, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities</span>.</strong> Engagement <strong>Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic· missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO. Additionally, <span class="BoldUnderline">the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program</span>.53 <span class="BoldUnderline">Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals</span>. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, <span class="BoldUnderline">proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities</span>. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, <span class="BoldUnderline">these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that can damage satellite systems</span>. “<span class="BoldUnderline">A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action</span>.”56 Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply. CONCLUSION The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57 Council on Foreign Relations <span class="BoldUnderline">The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degrade US military capabilities in a conflict with China. The United States should rely on a defensive space strategy to deter Chinese anti-satellite actions. The strategy must include robust space situational awareness, preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes</span>. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. <span class="BoldUnderline">The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat</span>. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58</strong><br />

Responses<br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">Satellites can be defended against some kinds of direct kinetic attacks. They can be moved out of range of the attacker’s terminal engagement sensors, if there is enough warning and accurate track of the interceptor and enough understanding of the kill mechanism, and if the satellite has been designed to withstand the loads created by the movement. There may be ways to confuse or defeat the sensors used to detect and track the target satellite, either in initial acquisition or in terminal engagement. The target might also be protected by active defenses, although with intercept occurring only about ten minutes after launch, the defenses will probably need to be directed energy rather than kinetic weapons. Either case would require precise situational awareness—exact information about the technology and operation of the attack—together with major advances in command and control for the defenses.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">Even without enemy action, satellites in orbit might provide less space support than needed. Satellites might be lost to collisions with debris or other objects; or essential components might fail. Or it may be that prewar planning proved inaccurate, that more support is needed to meet unforeseen needs, or that demand for space support at the outbreak of crisis proves much greater than had been anticipated.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">These problems are not remedied by defenses; instead, they call for a supplemental capability, to augment capacity to meet surging needs and to replace lost or failed sensors. Some of this supplemental capability might be found already in orbit: the communications and intelligence satellites of commercial entities and allied governments. While not all of the products of these systems will be militarily useful to the U.S.—and probably none will possess the capability of analogous U.S. government systems—the diversity of information they could provide and the speed with which it could be available would surely prove advantageous.</span><br />
More capable systems, fully compatible with U.S. forces and fully under U.S. control, could in principle be stored in orbit; the engineering requirements for long-term storage and return to full operation seem well understood<span style="color: #231f20;">. At the same time, these systems might themselves suffer on-orbit misadventures, might potentially be targeted, and might prove useless in the face of unforeseen needs. Still, this approach offers the fastest, and probably the most expensive, path to the most capable supplementary systems.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">Supplements might be provided more cheaply and more reliably if they were stored on the ground, ready to be launched in response to the developing needs of joint force commanders. If these supplemental systems could be launched and brought into operation quickly enough, the time required for adversaries to detect, track, and assess them might deter antisatellite attacks completely. If launched before hostilities began, these supplements would confront adversaries with the need to prepare revised and more complicated plans for attacks in space, perhaps with less confidence that all important systems were in the crosshairs.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">If launched as replacements for satellites </span>initially lost to enemy action, the supplements would shrink the advantage that was sought in attacking the original satellites. If the U.S. <span style="color: #231f20;">coupled its supplemental replacements with vigorous offensive counterspace actions of its own, an enemy’s initial attacks would leave the U.S. with a diminished yet effective set of space assets and the enemy with none. All in all, being able to supplement or restore needed capability in orbit would likely prove a stabilizing and deterring influence; not being destructive weapons themselves, the supplements could scarcely be considered escalatory.</span><br />

<span class="BoldUnderline">An active region of the sun that blasted out powerful solar storms four days in a row last week likely isn't done yet, scientists say</span>. Officially, the flare-spouting region is called sunspot 1283. But space weather experts have dubbed it &quot;Old Faithful,&quot; after the famous geyser in the United States' Yellowstone National Park that goes off like clockwork. And the solar Old Faithful should erupt again before it dissipates, researchers said. &quot;It still has a fair amount of complexity,&quot; said solar physicist C. Alex Young of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. &quot;So we still have a pretty good chance of seeing some more stuff from this one.&quot; An active sunspot Sunspots are temporary dark patches on the solar surface caused by intense magnetic activity. Some last for hours before disappearing; others linger for days, weeks or even months. <span class="BoldUnderline">Powerful solar storms often erupt from sunspots. These include radiation-flinging solar flares and phenomena known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) — massive clouds of solar plasma that can streak through space at up to 3 million mph</span> (5 million kph). <span class="BoldUnderline">From Sept. 5-8, sunspot 1283 produced four big flares and three CMEs</span>. Two of the flares were X-class events and two were M-class flares. (<span class="BoldUnderline">Strong solar flares are classified according to a three-tiered system: X-class are the most powerful</span>, M-class are of medium strength and C-class are the weakest.) While the rapid motion previously observed in sunspot 1283 seems to have died down a bit, Young said, <span class="BoldUnderline">the sunspot looks poised to erupt again sometime soon</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">&quot;There's a good probability that we're still going to see at least another M-class flare, possibly another X-class flare,</span>&quot; Young told SPACE.com. It's not uncommon for sunspots to pop off a number of powerful flares in quick succession the way 1283 has done, he added. That seems to be the natural order of things. &quot;When you see one big flare, your chances of seeing another one are pretty good,&quot; Young said.

But they're not there yet</span>. &quot;We still have a long way to go to really have the kind of forecasting capabilities that we have with terrestrial weather,&quot; Young said. That's not to say scientists aren't making progress. Indeed, they've learned a lot about solar eruptions lately, Young said. And the knowledge base will continue to grow, he added, as a fleet of sun-watching spacecraft beam home more and more observations of Earth's star. &quot;We're really in a great time right now in terms of the data that we have,&quot; Young said, citing the contributions of spacecraft such as NASA's STEREO and Solar Dynamics Observatory, as well as SOHO, a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency. &quot;It's going to be pretty exciting, from a solar physics and a space weather point of view.&quot; All of these eyes on the sun should be treated to quite a show over the next several years. <span class="BoldUnderline">Solar activity has been ramping up over the last few months as the sun works toward a maximum in its 11-year activity cycle. Scientists expect the peak of the current cycle, which is known as Solar Cycle 24, to come in 2013. </span><br />

In the past, solar storms have caused billions of dollars of commercial satellites to malfunction and die prematurely. A Great solar storm has the power to destroy many space assets (Space Station, Space Shuttle, LEO Satellites, GEO Satellites, Off World Missions) simultaneously. In our technology driven society, satellites play an important role in communications. The loss of satellites can affect: major news wire service feeds, network television, satellite television and cable programming, nationwide radio service, weather data, cell phone service, pagers, automated teller machines, gas station credit card handling services, airline weather tracking services, earthquake monitoring network, blackberries, GPS navigation service, and critical military &amp; airline communications. And this list grows longer every day. Current commercial satellites are light-weight, sophisticated, built at the lowest cost using off-the-shelf electronics. 3 This current low cost approach makes new satellite design more vulnerable to damage from solar storms due to less radiation hardening. A high-energy particle from an SPE can penetrate the wall of a satellite and deposit sufficient charge to cause an electrical upset to a circuit switch, false command, memory state change or loss. 1 As the nuclear particles collide within the spacecraft, they release electrons that build up an internal dielectric charge. This static charge can destroy circuitry on electronic boards. The particles can also change data and instructions stored in computer memory. Only deaths with “day, month and year” listed were used in this analysis.Impact, 2007 James A. Marusek 21 Some of the memory damage is soft causing Single Event Upset (SEU). Generally, this anomaly can be corrected by a computer reboot. But some of the damage can be hard causing unrepairable physical damage to the junction of the microcircuit. These types of failures can be fatal.<br />

What would happen…Iraq and Afghanistan]<br />
<br />
What would happen if the technology our modern military depends upon were to suddenly be compromised? The military Global Positioning System (GPS) is just one technology heavily relied upon for a variety of critical US military operations. Military GPS systems are responsible for increasing weapons accuracy, and therefore decreasing the number of warheads and military personnel required to take down a target or complete a mission. The GPS system was first introduced in the 1970s for military usage exclusively. GPS has since expanded into the commercial market – just about every new vehicle is introduced with a built in GPS, and standalone GPS systems can be added to older model vehicles easily – which makes constant innovation possible, but also lowers the high standards often demanded for the testing of military technology. Today, military GPS technology is so prevalent that John Pike of Globalsecurity.org claimed it is absolutely vital to American military functions; every military moving vehicle uses GPS. At least 100 U.S. military defense systems rely on GPS: aircrafts, ships, armored vehicles, bombs and artillery shells. In addition to GPS guided weapons systems, the Army also uses GPS units as patrol and location tracking tools for military service members in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />

Last October, around Halloween, the Sun produced a solar storm that was one of the largest ever recorded, and was strong enough to raise some concerns about the safety of Earth’s satellites. According to a recent paper published in Space Weather, such concern may well be justified. If its conclusions are correct, then a solar storm the size of one that was observed in 1859 could potentially kill several weather, telecommunications, and military satellites in less than a year. Here’s where the danger lies: most satellites, at least at some point in their orbits, fly through the inner radiation belt surrounding the Earth (aka the Van Allen Belt). The inner radiation belt, like it says on the tin, comprises quite a bit of intense radiation. However, satellites are shielded from that radiation, and the intensity of the radiation in the inner belt is relatively stable. That’s because it’s in large part shielded from high-energy particles by the plasmasphere, which is a cloud of plasma that is part of the Earth’s magnetosphere. Usually, when a solar storm hits, most of the radiation either hits the outer radiation belt or the plasmaphere. When the plasmasphere gets hit, some of the plasma dissipates, making it smaller, but that dissipation prevents too much intense radiation from hitting the inner belt. During the Halloween storms, observations showed that there was significant erosion of the plasmasphere. Not enough to let significant radiation into the inner belt, but enough that the study authors wanted to take a closer look at the data. Based on observational data of solar storms, the radiation belts, and the plasmasphere during past years, the authors were able to successfully model the Halloween solar storm. They then modeled a solar storm with the intensity of the Carrington Solar Storm, which took place in 1859 and is estimated to have been about four times stronger than the Halloween storms. When the Carrington storm was modeled, the results showed that the plasmasphere was eroded to the point that much more radiation reached the inner belt than is normally the case. Moreover, the intensity produced “waves” of strong radiation continually moving through the inner belt. Based on their models, the authors suggest that the high radiation intensity of the inner belt could persist for as long as a decade. That intensity would likely swamp the radiation shielding on a typical satellite, and the authors estimate that most would be rendered inoperable within a year after the storm. The loss of satellites as a result of a solar storm would be an economic catastrophe – we rely on satellites for a large portion of our day to day lives, even when we don’t realize it. The researchers hope to continue their work modeling radiation from solar storms, with an eye towards better and more accurate predictions, as well as looking for ways to diminish the impacts of such storms. In the meantime, the authors suggest that satellite engineers incorporate the potential for intensification of the inner radiation belt in their radiation mitigation strategies. That strikes me as a good idea.<br />

<strong>Growth solves racism</strong><br />
<strong>Business Week</strong> 11-06-<strong>1995</strong> ln<br />
Everyone agrees that it would be a calamity if African Americans’ economic progress of the past half-century ground to a halt. These days, economists are focusing on ways to improve public schools, revitalize neighborhoods, and open up employment for poor and working-class Americans, black and white. What Washington <strong>policymakers have to consider</strong> is <strong>that no reform can work without strong economic growth</strong>. Robust growth raises income of both whites and blacks. More important, it <strong>attacks</strong> the pinched economic conditions <strong>that allow racism to flourish.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Poor economic conditions racism</strong><br />
<strong>Progressive ’92</strong> (January, p. 7)<br />
That racist and anti-Semitic appeals are more popular during times of economic decline is nothing new; Such demagoguery is an old and dishonorable tradition in Europe as well as in America. When people are desperate, they will seek out any politician offering a scapegoat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Economic decline causes hate crimes</strong><br />
<strong>Kim ’93</strong> (Marlene, Prof of Labor Studies @ Rutgers University, 1993 p. viii)<br />
In addition, anti-immigration sentiment, like hate crimes, ignites when economic times are tough. During the Great Depression of 1930s, <strong>lynchings of African Americans increased</strong> and 300,000 Mexican Americans were forcibly bussed back across the border. Over a hundred years ago, the US prohibited Chinese and later all Asians from immigrating, sanctions that were not lifted until the 1940s<br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">While </span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the economic contraction is</span><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> apparently slowing in the advanced industrial countries and may reach bottom in the not-too-distant future, it's only </span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">beginning to gain momentum in the developing world</span><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">, which was spared the earliest effects of the global meltdown. Because the crisis was largely precipitated by a collapse of the housing market in the United States and the resulting disintegration of financial products derived from the &quot;securitization&quot; of questionable mortgages, most developing nations were unaffected by the early stages of the meltdown, for the simple reason that they possessed few such assets. </span></strong>But now, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">as the wealthier nations cease investing in the developing world</span> or acquiring its exports, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the crisis is hitting them</span> with a vengeance. On top of this, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">conditions are deteriorating at a time when severe drought is affecting many</span> key food-producing <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">regions</span> and poor farmers lack the wherewithal to buy seeds, fertilizers, and fuel. The likely result: <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">A looming food crisis in many areas hit hardest by the global economic meltdown</span>. Until now, concern over the human impact of the global crisis has largely been focused — understandably so — on unemployment and economic hardship in the United States, Europe, and former Soviet Union. Many stories have appeared on the devastating impact of plant closings, bankruptcies, and home foreclosures on families and communities in these parts of the world. Much less coverage has been devoted to the meltdown's impact on people in the developing world. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">As the crisis spreads to the poorer countries</span>, however, it's likely that <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">people</span> in these areas <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">will experience hardships</span> every bit as severe as those in the wealthier countries — and, in many cases, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">far worse</span>. The greatest worry is that most of <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the gains achieved in eradicating poverty</span> over the last decade or so <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">will be wiped out, forcing</span> tens or hundreds of <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">millions of people</span> from the working class and the lower rungs of the middle class <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">back into the penury</span> from which they escaped. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Equally worrisome is the risk of food scarcity in these areas, resulting in widespread malnutrition, hunger, and starvation. All this is sure to produce vast human misery, sickness, and death, but could also result in social and political unrest of various sorts, including riot, rebellion, and ethnic strife. </span>The president, Congress, or the mainstream media are not, for the most part, discussing these perils. As before, public interest remains focused on the ways in which the crisis is affecting the United States and the other major industrial powers. But the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and U.S. intelligence officials, in three recent reports, are paying increased attention to the prospect of a second economic shockwave, this time affecting the developing world.<br />

(Space.com) Magnetic storms set off by the sun could pose a bigger threat than thought to weather, communication, military and other satellites close to Earth, with a potentially devastating economic impact, scientists suggest. In the new study, researchers found that solar radiation can energize a belt of high-energy particles that surrounds Earth more dramatically than previously believed. The study focused on the possible effects of a particularly strong magnetic storm on the Van Allen radiation belts, the dangerous rings of high-energy particles that girdle the Earth. The belts are split into two distinct zones. The outer belt, which is made up of electrons, reaches from about 15,800 to 31,600 miles (25,500 to 51,000 kilometers) above the surface, while the inner belt, which consists of a mix of electrons and protons, reaches from about 4,000 to 8,000 miles (6,400 to 12,800 km) above. Scientists had known the outer belt could become far more intense during geomagnetic storms caused by high-energy particles spewed by the sun, such as the storm that supercharged Earth's northern lights display Monday night (Sept. 26). However, they have long thought such storms do not affect the inner belt. Now computer simulations suggest that during a &quot;superstorm&quot; -- which has occurred in the past and is likely to recur in the future ? the electrons in the inner belt, too, could become energized. Near-Earth radiation could then remain dramatically more intense for several years afterward. &quot;The increase in radiation in the inner zone may last for up to a decade and continue damaging satellites for years after a very strong storm,&quot; study lead author Yuri Shprits, a space physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told SPACE.com. This radiation would damage satellites in that zone and potentially cut their lifetimes by five-sixths or more. [Related: Space Radiation to Rise for Astronauts, Airline Passengers] &quot;It would not destroy all satellites at once,&quot; Shprits said. &quot;However, at least according to our calculations, a very strong storm can increase the radiation dose in the inner zone by a factor of 10, and within a few years we may lose a significant portion of the satellites that traverse the inner zone.&quot; In terms of new strategies that might be needed to protect satellite systems, &quot;it's hard to say,&quot; Shprits said. &quot;First of all, we need to estimate risks and estimate cost. If cost is too high, we may want to accept the risks and start getting ready to replenish the fleet in the case of such event.&quot; &quot;There are a number of rather expensive strategies that can be used to mitigate the risk, including redundancy in electronics and increased shielding,&quot; he added. &quot;Zero risk means infinite cost.&quot; Two missions to study the radiation belts are planned for 2012, Shprits noted: NASA's Radiation Belt Storm Probe will observe radiation belts in the equatorial plane, while Moscow State University's LOMONOSOV mission, with UCLA-built instruments on board, will observe radiation belts at low altitudes. The scientists detailed their findings online in the Aug. 25 issue of the journal Space Weather.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Department of Defense defined ORS as “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of Joint Force Commanders needs”61 but the concept has its naysayers. Future funding and senior leadership support will demonstrate the necessity of implementing the ORS concept. The President’s Fiscal Year 2010 budget request significantly diminished the ORS budget. The $112.9 million request would reduce the FY 2009’s appropriations by $83.7 million (42.5%). HASC added $23.4 million to the ORS budget to fund remaining development and launch costs of the ORS-1 satellite. The Fiscal Year 2011 budget is still in work, however the FY11 Air Force Posture Statement stated a request of $94 million, almost 9% of the total space-related budget, for the ORS program. These on-demand space vehicles will only augment or temporarily replace large satellite systems, so they will most likely not have all the capabilities of the more complex spacecraft but they should have enough survivability and operational mission requirements to serve as temporary solutions. The ORS concept is sound and funded, but to be effective it must be delivered to the user efficiently on-time and on-budget. This innovative way of doing business in space starts with a revolutionary alteration in the current military space</span><br />
<br />
<strong>A stable, predictable funding stream is vital to ORS technology development</strong><br />
<span class="apple-converted-space"><strong><span style="color: #101010;">Dinerman, 6</span></strong></span>– DOD space consultant, and <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">senior editor at the Hudson Institute’s New York branch (Taylor, The Space Review, “</span></em>Tactical IR satellites: operationally responsive spacecraft?,” 8/7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/675/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/675/1</a><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The </span>troops on the ground need information they can use in a timely and easily understood format<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Simply to provide them, or division or brigade intelligence staffs that support them, with raw satellite data is probably worse than useless. </span>The next generations of US Army and Marine Corps units are going to require information that can be integrated into their “network-centric” information systems<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Imagery from space-based infrared sensors that are specifically designed for tactical utility should be part of these networks.<br />
This is a mission for a future constellation of small “operationally responsive” satellites.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Part of the constellation should be kept in orbits that take them over places such as south Lebanon or the Afghan-Pakistani border where we can assume that there will be trouble for a long time to come. These should be carefully calibrated on a constant basis, so that their positioning information is ultra-precise. Other satellites can be kept on the ground ready to be launched at relatively short notice to supplement the ones on orbit over the world’s trouble spots, or they could be launched to cover unexpected outbreaks of fighting.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A model for the way such a program could be run is GPS, which, over almost three decades, has gone from prototypes to sets of more and more sophisticated and capable satellites. These spacecraft have, on the whole, been both cost effective and free of the kinds of nasty and expensive surprises that have plagued SBIRS and other Air Force satellite programs.</span><br />
An operationally responsive tactical IR satellite system would have to be both affordable and based on proven and reliable technology. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The first generation of such satellites may not have all the desired features, but if properly designed—with the right filters and the right level of multi- or hyper-spectral sensitivity—such craft would give the ground forces a valuable early operational capability.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To make the program affordable it would have to be designed to use already existing bus and power supply systems and probably also an in-service communications architecture. </span>It would have to be light enough to be launched on a Delta 2 or on a future operationally responsive spacelift vehicle. Most important of all, the funding stream<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>no matter how much or how little—would have to be predictable so that the contractors would have the incentive to plan for the long term<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This would be the most difficult part of the program since it would mean asking Congress to give up part of its power over the annual budget cycle.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Another way to keep the program affordable would be to keep the early requirements to a minimum. The first versions should be strictly for ground force use only, with perhaps some applications for Marine Corps amphibious warfare requirements. Only after the system has proven itself should the program be allowed to move on to develop air-to-ground sensor-to-shooter loops.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Ultimately a constellation of a dozen or so spacecraft in orbit, backed up by a similar number on the ground, would be ideal for the early versions of the full system. The ground segments will have to be as simple and as inexpensive as possible since it will need to be deployed with more than fifty Army and Marine brigade-sized units as well as with higher headquarters.</span><br />
If the idea of operationally responsive space means anything, it means that the military space forces<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, particularly Air Force Space Command, </span>are ready to give priority to supporting the troops on the front lines worldwide. Enhancing the combat effectiveness of the Army and the Marines and helping to save American lives should be the highest goal<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Clausewitz put it, “The object of fighting is the destruction or defeat of the enemy.” </span>The more that military space contributes directly to that objective, the better for the troops on the ground and for America as a whole.<br />

ORS is inevitable – other space powers will do it if the US doesn’t<br />

<br />
Can the US overcome bureaucratic impediments in order to make it happen?<br />
Here we would have to say that no one knows. It may or may not occur for all of the reasons that Dwayne Day has clearly pointed out. The need for ORS has been formalized for some years in the <em>Operationally Responsive Spacelift Mission Need Statement</em> (ORS MNS) of December 20, 2001. But that does not mean that it will actually come about. There are a variety of entrenched interests and organizational sandboxes arrayed against ORS, or trying to reshape it in their own image. This is, of course, the same process that has brought us $32 billion in cost overruns in the ten largest DoD space programs according to a 2007 <em>Aviation Week</em> article. We would have to conclude that the odds of success are slim, but not zero. In many past technology developments, it has been Congress that has made things happen. That may or may not occur here.<br />
One thing seems clear: if ORS doesn’t happen in the US, it will certainly happen elsewhere. According to a DoD 2007 assessment, the Chinese have already announced a near-term goal of launching satellites within hours of demand. The Russians have been able to do so for years. The Europeans are well ahead of the US in a formalized process for creating low-cost space missions. The rest of the world will move ahead with the capability to respond rapidly to changing world events, irrespective of whether the US chooses to do so.<br />

However, other nations may seek to deny U.S. advantages in space through a variety of negation and prevention actions.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Negation Threats</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Satellite systems consist not only of spacecraft, each with their own payload and bus, but also a supporting infrastructure—ground control stations, tracking and control links, commonly referred to as the tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&amp;C) links, data links, launch facilities, and an industrial base. Each of these components is at risk to threats of physical and cyber attack, and sabotage, and can be negated, simultaneously or each in detail. The satellite payload, bus, links, and infrastructure can be negated by using a variety of permanent or reversible means to achieve one of the five possible effects, known as the ‘‘five Ds’’—deception, disruption, denial, degradation, and destruction.5</span><br />
Space-based threats proliferate as a result of the ever-growing global availability of technology and access to the space domain. There are huge incentives for states to invest in and use space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, and the spread of space technologies has occurred. States with sufficient resources can now reach out to space and ‘‘touch’’ satellites through a variety of means, and achieve one and even more of the five Ds. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Spacecraft are vulnerable to direct ascent weapons as demonstrated by the Chinese ASAT test, and to a variety of other groundbased, airborne, and space-based ASAT technologies. Direct-ascent launched, or orbit-based nuclear devices, can be detonated, generating radiation and other lethal effects to destroy unshielded electronics over a wide lethal range. Co-orbital ASATs could be employed, comparable to the old Soviet system that was tested extensively in the 1970s and early 80s. In a less likely scenario, space-borne mines can also be deployed in close proximity to spacecraft, or exploded to generate debris clouds that destructively engage whole classes of satellites in the same orbital plane or in crossing orbits. Ground, space-based, or airborne lasers could be used by adversaries to wreak havoc. Blinding operations could be executed and inflict effects ranging from temporary ‘‘dazzling’’ to permanent burnout of optical or other sensors with intense energy bursts.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Ground systems, supporting communications, and their nodes, are vulnerable to diverse land, sea, or air kinetic attacks, including sabotage. Unprotected systems are also susceptible to electronic attack through jamming and electromagnetic deception techniques. Jammers emit signals that mask or prevent reception of desired signals; these methods can disrupt uplinks, downlinks, and even cross-links. By disabling the means of command and control, and data communications, jammers render satellites inoperable or unavailable. Electromagnetic deception techniques can be employed to confuse systems; this could include sending false, but deceptively plausible, commands that cause spacecraft to perform damaging or wasteful maneuvers, modify databases or execute configuration changes, or otherwise destroy it.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Similarly, supporting terrestrial ground stations, computer networks, and links are vulnerable to information operation and cyber attacks. These attacks could involve directing global denial of service tasks, injecting fake commands, malicious software and viruses into the space system, performing unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of sensitive information (data interception), and causing unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of network information, services, and databases.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">In sum, there is a wide span of kinetic and other types of attacks an adversary could consider and employ. There is potential that even non-state actors can access some of these technologies and space systems, and achieve several of the five Ds; however, it is unlikely they can obtain and then employ a full-spectrum of these means and achieve all of these effects. Conducting an attack within the space domain involves a rather substantial investment to develop, acquire, operate, and sustain needed shooter, sensor, and command and control systems. Given the scope and commitment needed to affect such a move, an on-orbit attack would probably be made only in the context of a larger strategic struggle, perhaps as a prelude to or part of early combat operations. On the other hand, inexpensive jamming technology is available to even the poorest potential adversaries. As such, jamming poses the most used and growing threat to space systems. Some argue that jamming also carries with it implicit political and legal sanctions since no major space power has moved to ban or make even temporary and reversible jamming illegal. This may change now that a number of nations have banned together to object to recent Iranian satellite jamming.6 Cyber adversaries and criminals are also beginning to hone their craft. They present an evolving threat to space systems; and like jamming, cyber threats can be developed and deployed for only modest investments.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention Threats</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention actions generally involve economic, political, informational, and diplomatic instruments of national power. For example, an extremely large creditor nation could employ its considerable economic clout and leverage in an attempt to compel or blackmail the United States to not license or permit imaging of its territory, preventing its use, and reducing its exposure to such observation. The creditor nation could seek to accomplish its objective by destabilizing the world market place. It could refuse to purchase treasury offerings that underpin the burgeoning U.S. fiscal and trade deficits, perhaps arguing that remote sensing, especially commercial remote sensing, of its territory infringes on its territorial and sovereign rights, or that it constitutes ‘‘unlawful’’ industrial espionage, and is thus, an unfair trade practice.7 Commercial remote sensing systems are nowan important resource for the United States Government and its national security needs. U.S. Government orders help sustain and stabilize the remote sensing industry,8 and any limitations on activities, whether for U.S. Government customers or commercial ones, imposed in response to external economic threats could evolve to cause problems. In an alternative scenario, a state, acting through political allies and proxies, could exert considerable influence and dominance to affect a change in U.S. law. This change could restrict licensing of commercial remote sensing imagery, restricting the market place and impacting business models for producers.9</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">As a diplomatic prevention example, adversaries could attempt to use international forums and treaties to deny frequency rights needed by U.S. military or intelligence satellites by making spurious ‘‘paper satellite’’ filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). ‘‘Paper satellites’’ involve ITU applications for satellite orbital slots, many for ‘‘speculative’’ systems that will never leave Earth. These filings can block access to scarce spectrum and orbital resources.10 The ability to place communications and other satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) positions could be held at risk. Some characterize some of these types of actions as a form of ‘‘lawfare.’’ ‘‘The term lawfare describes the growing use of international law claims, usually factually or legally meritless, as a tool of war. The goal is to gain a moral advantage over your enemy in the court of world opinion, and potentially a legal advantage in national and international tribunals.’’11</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention actions taken to hobble U.S. space systems are not armed attacks. As is discussed later, the use of force is only authorized under the United Nations (UN) Charter in response to an armed attack, or upon authorization of the UN Security Council. As such, using armed force to deter and defeat prevention actions involving political or diplomatic subterfuge or intrigue may be unlawful under international law. Creative alternative solutions must therefore be found to assure access to space when facing these types of threats.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Implications for U.S. Space Strategy</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">The wide span of threats poses profound implications</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> for U.S. space strategy and its execution. First, unlike the Cold War era, </span>the U<span style="font-size: 5pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">tates </span>now confronts a wide array of global actors, all operating with different motivations and incentives, some of which could become potential adversaries who can attack or threaten space capabilities<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. These state and non-state adversaries exhibit a wide array of political, economic, technical, and social differences. </span>Having many potential adversaries makes each of them harder to understand. This complicates efforts to understand motivations and to influence perceptions for deterrence purposes<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>These differences, in turn, increase the likelihood of misperception, undercutting strategies to protect access to space capabilities. When one’s attention is divided, deterrent measures that are appropriate for one target may not be useful, or even counterproductive, for another<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. This requires tailored intelligence efforts, information operations, and transparency efforts in order to avoid or minimize disputes and prevent problems.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Second, the broad array of adversaries exhibit widely varying risk-taking behaviors. Risk-taking behavior can strongly influence an adversary’s perception of a situation. Understanding this phenomenon can lead to better ways of influencing those perceptions. Unfortunately, </span>potential adversaries may not care that space systems offer tremendous value and capabilities to all nations, or care whether conflict in space could create space debris that could cost all nations access to the domain. <span style="font-size: 5pt;">A strategy to assure continuing access to space assets must therefore be sufficiently flexible to address both risk-averse and risk-taking adversaries. Indeed, potential adversaries may shift from risk-taking to risk-adverse over a relatively short period of time. China may fit in this category. Within a decade or two, it will have its own extensive space-based communications, navigation, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellite constellations, all of which will be integrated into its military operations. No doubt, China will embrace that evolution and become very reliant on space capabilities; this will shift it from an asymmetric competitor to one similar to the United States or Russia. Third, with the demise of the Soviet Union, some political commentators and critics described the United States as a ‘‘hyperpower’’ not just a ‘‘superpower.’’ 12 Though buffeted by recent events involving Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and the 2008 global financial meltdown, U.S. military supremacy continues. But, that </span>supremacy does not make or guarantee a successful space strategy.Adversaries may believe they have a higher stake than the United States in the outcome of a particular crisis or conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>Alternatively, the United States stake in the crisis may not be commensurate with the possible cost of involvement by the United States military and the rest of its national security apparatus. The first alternative may encourage mischief by adversaries; the second discourages U.S. action. As a result, adversaries may find threats of U.S. action in response to hostile acts affecting U.S. access to space systems to be non-credible<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Fourth, </span>while the United States has produced superlative space capabilities, it has not produced enough systems ready to survive the new kinetic, exotic, jamming, and cyber threat environment<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. The vulnerability exists because the spacecraft developed and deployed today are in many ways the same as those originally fielded during the Cold War. During that epic struggle, there was a tacit and then explicit understanding that each superpower would not attack and overwhelm the other’s space systems, except in the direst of circumstances, perhaps during the throes of a nuclear conflagration. Indeed, a number of agreements between the superpowers adopted the understanding and ruled out interference with national technical means, including space assets. </span>This belief in the superiority of space systems and power blinds the United States to the inherent strategic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in these systems. This, predictably, can now be exploited by potential adversaries, such as China, who, with their recent ASAT test, appear more willing to fully explore the technologies needed to expand the limits of conventional war to include the space domain<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Consequently, by historically and diplomatically reducing the threat, engineering of some satellite threat detection, attack avoidance, and other defense subsystems have not matured enough so that they are sophisticated, nimble, and robust enough to counter new 21st Century adversary attack capabilities.</span><br />

<strong>Wortzel, 8</strong> - Colonel, United States Army (Retired) (Larry, Astropolitics, 6:112–137, “THE CHINESE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY<br />
AND SPACE WARFARE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
The PLA is exploring in theoretical research, basic research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.77 </span>These include<span style="font-size: 5pt;">:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>satellite jamming technology;<br />
. collisions between space bodies;<br />
. kinetic energy weapons;<br />
. space-to-ground attack weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;</span><br />
. space planes<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> that can transit and fight ‘‘up or down’’ in the upper atmosphere or space;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>high-power laser weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>high-power microwave weapon systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>particle-beam weapons; and<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>electromagnetic pulse<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.78</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies. The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not, </span>it is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the blinding of a U.S. satellite mean they are achieving some success.<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 </span>The Chinese see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they would probably use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.81</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. </span>As the PLA modernizes its<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (</span>C4SIR) systems, it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, </span>an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons or a deeper crisis<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">For example, </span>four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, in Wuhan, </span>have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.82 In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88</span><br />
The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>One possible reaction by the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike against China’s strategic missile forces<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Space Deterrence</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Conclusions</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First, </span>in the event of conflict with the PLA, military operations carried out across all the domains of war, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, are likely. Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions. </span>There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;97 </span>the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. </span>The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance. </span>No such dialogue has taken place with China. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures.</span><br />
Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. To this end, the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. </span>As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, </span>and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>Lack of knowledge about the PLA, internal docs and new dual use capabilities mean we have to assume the worst- even the CCP indicates intent to weaponize space</strong><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Space Review, 10/31 </span></strong></span><span style="text-decoration: none;">(Danny Houpt for the Space Review, “</span>A new policy typology to better understand the goals of China’s space program” on October 31, 2011 from <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/1</a>, AKaz)<br />
Military space missions Little is known about the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) actual capability to wage war in space. What has been demonstrated, however, including the 2007 ASAT<span style="color: green;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/2" rel="nofollow">test</a></span>and reports of China blinding US intelligence satellites, has caused much consternation across the world. One aspect of Chinese military aspirations in space that has been studied is the internal publications of the PLA and its stated views on space doctrine. Increasingly, these writings have accepted the inevitability of the weaponization of space and called for appropriate preparations to be made to successfully wage war in space. Given the dual-use nature of most space technology, it is no surprise that China’s military uses of space are advancing commensurately with its civilian and commercial programs. First of all, China is widely known to have an array of intelligence satellites for space reconnaissance and surveillance. The Ziyuan Earth observation satellite is known to be one of these, but China has also fielded the Fanhui Shi Weixing, or Retrievable Satellite, which drops canisters of film from space.15 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">China’s ongoing microsatellite program has sparked some of the most concern abroad. Aside from intelligence satellites, microsatellites have many potential offensive uses such as maneuvering in range of an adversary’s satellite and either latching on—a “parasitic microsat”—to disrupt proper functions, or merely exploding within range of a target satellite to destroy it. Furthermore, the ability to deploy a constellation of microsatellites on short notice, a capability China may already possess with its Kaituozhe launch<span style="color: green;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/2" rel="nofollow">vehicle</a></span>, denies the deterrence factor that could otherwise prevent offensive attacks on an adversary’s space assets for fear of retaliation.</span> China’s rocket technology also has proven offensive military use in space: the ability to shoot down enemy assets in space through direct ascent attacks. China demonstrated such ability in 2007, which has been the impetus for much of the recent speculation about China’s military space aspirations. Despite political blowback from this test (it resulted in a 20 percent increase in the total amount of trackable space debris in low Earth orbit), China may still be pursuing ASAT technologies.16In January 2010 China conducted a successful test of its ground-based midcourse missile interception technology. This test used technology similar to its 2007 ASAT test and, as exemplified by the US Navy-led Operation Burnt Frost that intercepted the satellite USA 193, missile defense technology can serve ASAT ends. In addition to these hard-kill capabilities, China has the capability to use soft-kill measures to neutralize adversary’s space assets. China is known to have the means to jam satellite communication and GPS receivers and is developing directed energy ASATs, including high-powered microwave and particle beam weapons.17The US Department of Defense (DoD), in their annual report to Congress on China’s military modernization, also notes that China is developing ground-based laser ASATs, the beginnings of which may have already been demonstrated. In 2006 the director of the National Reconnaissance Office, Donald Kerr, substantiated reports that China used a ground-based laser to dazzle a US spy satellite over its territory. Although this laser could not do any long-term damage, similar techniques and capabilities used to track and dazzle this satellite could be coupled with more powerful ground-based lasers to destroy space assets. Some reports actually indicate China has already tested and deployed a ground-based ASAT laser that can target assets in LEO.18 Despite the array of activity the PLA conducts in and through space, they seem to lack a specific doctrine for the employment of their space capabilities and have not made public any substantial plans for military uses of space. In lieu of a formal declaration on space, there is a growing literature from <strong>within</strong> the PLA ranks that may be forming the basis for what later becomes stated—or unstated—PLA space doctrine. These authors generally hold the same assumptions about space, including the inevitability that space will be a domain of war in the future.19Many also acknowledge that establishing space dominance will be crucial to fully exploiting wartime necessities such as control of airspace and secure command and control.20 Three internal Chinese sources are largely cited <strong>as being the defining PLA space doctrine writings</strong>:<em>Space War</em>by Colonel Li Daguang;<em>On Space Operations</em>by Colonel Jia Junming; and<em>Joint Space War Campaigns</em>by Colonel Yuan Zelu.21Colonel Li highlights many specific recommendations to develop the PLA’s space fighting capabilities, including fielding offensive capabilities capable of “destroying or temporarily incapacitating all enemy space vehicles that fly in space above our sovereign territory.” Other recommendations include focusing development on land-based anti-satellite weapons and anti-satellite satellites as well as “assassin’s mace” space weapons that could deal a crippling blow to an enemy. Particularly important to foreign perceptions of China, these writings also call for China to combine military and civilian technology and integrate peacetime and wartime facilities. Other authors on the subject promote such actions as: fielding sea-launched anti-satellite weapons, attacking GPS with high energy laser weapons, fielding stealthy space satellites and weapons, and seeking the ability to attack terrestrial targets from space. Kevin Pollpeter, summing up the view of most Chinese authors writing on the subject, writes, “<strong>The development of space technology will inevitably lead to the militarization of space and space militarization will lead to confrontation in space</strong>. As the struggle over air and space control is becoming the new focal point of war, space will become the main battlefield of future wars.”22Pollpeter also notes that throughout his extensive review of Chinese space writings, there were no rebuttals to the view that China will inevitability develop and use counterspace weapons. These views also seem to be held by some in the upper echelons of the PLA. In November 2009, PLA Air Force (PLAAF) commander Xu Qiliang stated in an interview with the PLA Daily newspaper, an official government publication, that the militarization of space is a “historical inevitability” and called on the PLAAF to develop offensive and defensive capabilities in space.23Xu is not only the head of the PLAAF, but as of 2007 was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (CCCP) and a member of the Central Military Commission (CMC)—two primary policy decision making bodies in China. The Foreign Ministry tried to backtrack on Xu’s comments days later by reiterating that China has “all along upheld the peaceful use of outer space,” and would not be part of a space arms race.24However, Xu did not personally retract his statements and, given his elite government position, this interview could actually be exemplary of how some of China’s top official’s views space. Indeed, there is some indication the CCCP acknowledges the need to prepare for the weaponization of space. In December 2010, the official publication of the CCCP, the Qiushi Journal, on its website released an article that spoke to China’s perspectives on space war: China's missiles can directly attack the military satellites, which usually orbit at an altitude less than 10,000 kilometers...China should make efforts to develop space weapons as soon as possible, as this is the most effective military means of attacking the U.S. If we can eventually fire missiles from a satellite, the U.S. will find that it has nowhere to hide; it will find itself entirely exposed to the attack radius of Chinese weaponry…Vigorously strengthening the building of our space military forces should be not only the focus of our national defense, but also the most powerful weapon to deter U.S. military blackmail.25 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">After the article was translated into English, the original Chinese version was altered to state that the views were those of the authors only. In a society well versed in controlling media and hiding military intentions,</span> it is interesting the Chinese government is allowing these and other perspectives to be published containing such inflammatory language on space warfare. This suggests that perhaps the views are not condemned or are being floated as trial balloons to gauge foreign response.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">III. Chinese Counterspace: Kryptonite to U.S. Military Space Edge</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">China still weaker than the U.S. in space logistical capabilities(communications, surveillance</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, etc.), </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">according to the expert panel: Despite pockets of considerable capabilities, China has weak or moderate military space capabilities in other areas</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. China has few communications satellites available for military purposes, even assuming that the PLA would appropriate Chinese government-controlled assets during a crisis. That weakness could be lessened given its reliance on low-bandwidth devices and its strong underground internet cable network in local conflicts: Many PLA military platforms have modest bandwidth requirements, which, when combined with the PLA’s heavy reliance on buried fiber-optic military communications networks, may offset this disadvantage in the context of a potential, near-term U.S.-China contingency on China’s periphery. But at present, the nation would be at a disadvantage in long range conflicts with the U.S.: However, naval forces at sea and ground forces operating outside the Chinese mainland (even as close as Taiwan) would still require secure, mobile communications for military functions such as command and control. The report suggests </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">China may invest in new satellite or drone capabilities to remedy that weakness</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">In the near term,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> though the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">U.S.'s advantage could be negated by China's</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> cyberprowess and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">investigation into &quot;hard&quot; counterspace options</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> (pg. 218): </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">China's counterspace programs seek the capability to compromise, disrupt, deny, degrade, deceive, or destroy U.S. space assets</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">These efforts could prevent the U.S. military’s use of space for functions such as communications; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; and guided weapons applications</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">This opinion is reinforced with quotes from top military leaders (pg. 218): Notwithstanding China’s increasing reliance on space for military and civil purposes, Chinese military planners still view space assets as an attractive target.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Ambassador Schulte testified that with &quot;geography the way it is, we are probably always going to find ourselves more reliant on space than [China] . . . so for the foreseeable future, that’s an asymmetry they’re going to look to exploit as they pursue an antiaccess/area denial approach.&quot; According to General Deptula, &quot;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Continued Chinese investment in the design, development, deployment and employment of space and counterspace systems will increasingly challenge our traditional space dominance</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and could dramatically reduce our freedom of action in the event of a conflict in the region.&quot; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The report points to China preparing a</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> two pronged approach to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">attack the U.S.'s space capabilties</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The first approach is to use traditional attacks like missiles or orbitters to physically assault enemy satellites (the so-called &quot;hard&quot; attack)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.

PLA is isolated from the Chinese govt<br />
MacDonald, 11 <strong>- Senior Director, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program, U.S. Institute of Peace (Bruce, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA”, 5/11, lexis)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>One characteristic of too many wars in the last century is that they are the result of miscalculation that ignites the tinder of fundamental geopolitical tensions. Averting major power conflict requires skillful management of tensions by senior leaders of the major powers<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. China has become much more internationally sophisticated, though with important exceptions, in its dealings with the rest of the world than has been true in the past, and this is reflected in its civilian leadership. Unfortunately, </span>the PLA's senior officer corps<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> trails its civilian counterparts in this respect. They have much less interaction with foreign official and travel abroad much less frequently than their U.S. counterparts. This means that the PLA overall </span>views world events from a less knowledgeable and sophisticated perspective, a danger in this increasingly complex world, and could explain, for example, the political &quot;tonedeafness&quot; of the PLA in the manner they conducted their 2007 ASAT test.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>This PLA problem becomes more serious when one realizes that the PLA is organizationally separate from the rest of the Chinese government, and reports only to the Central Military Commission,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> currently chaired by President Hu Jintao. President Hu, and his likely successors, have no significant military background, and the majority of the CMC's members are top PLA officers, suggesting that civilian oversight of major military decisions and consideration of their larger implications are not as carefully reviewed as in the U.S. government. Normally this would not be too great a concern, but </span>in a crisis this could be dangerous. Add to this the fact that China has no equivalent of our National Security Council, a critically important body for coordinating our security decisionmaking, and one comes away concerned about the relative insularity of the PLA in the Chinese power structure<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In a crisis, the PLA probably cannot be counted on to show as sophisticated a sense of judgment as one would hope any country's military leaders, even an enemy's, to show. All these problems and many more pose potential threats to internal political stability andCommunist Party control, providing ample opportunity for crisis and conflict in the years ahead<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overview of The Strategic Landscape of Space</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Space assets<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and the communications and cyber links that enable them to function, </span>are the means by which essential national security information is either generated, transmitted, or both. This information is the lifeblood of U.S. conventional military superiority and plays a key role in U.S. strategic nuclear posture as well<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As such, </span>these space related assets represent extraordinarily appealing targets in any future conflict, and their relative vulnerability can provide dangerously attractive incentives in a crisis to preempt, escalating to war<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Resisting this temptation to attack may be morally virtuous but could be strategically unwise: </span>going first in a space conflict with a nearpeer space adversary appears to offer many advantages, while absorbing such a strike, with all its attendant destruction of military capabilities, and then responding to the attack against an opponent fully expecting such a response, appears to be militarily and strategically quite undesirable.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As technology advances, the ways of interfering with, disrupting, or destroying information streams in space or supporting space systems will likely increase, as will U.S. and others' dependence upon such systems. Providing defensive options for U.S. space assets should be pursued where appropriate, but most space observers believe that offense has the advantage in space over defense, as General Cartwright observed last May. Cartwright also noted that the challenging issues that space poses has made the Space Posture Review &quot;the most difficult of all the defense reviews&quot; the Obama Administration has undertaken.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The overall U.S. goal in space should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States and its allies, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. and allied security. </span>The United States has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This need not mean that China and others must perforce be disadvantaged by such an arrangement - there should be ample opportunity for many countries to benefit and prosper from a properly crafted system of space management.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>There is an inherent risk of strategic instability when relatively modest defense efforts create disproportionate danger to an adversary, as with</strong><br />
<strong>space offense. And there is a serious risk of crisis instability in space when &quot;going first&quot; pays off<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> - destroying an adversary's satellites before he destroys yours. We don't know what would happen in a crisis, but </span>the potential for space instability seems high and likely to grow.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites<span style="font-size: 9pt;">, facilities or services; </span>the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets</strong>.<br />
<strong>One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> on the US homeland or an attack </span>that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, </span>other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US<span style="font-size: 9pt;">.44</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Although a major attack on the US is not likely, </span>the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculationthat the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike<span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span>The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, </span>the Chinese might seek to disrupt or destroy regional space capabilities as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a <em>fait accompli</em><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.45</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “</span>Space capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> are no longer nice to have, but </span>are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.”51 </span>The failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets.</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, </span>successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. </span>A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>Satellite communication links to worldwide deployed forces are critical capabilities in protecting US security, sovereignty, and military combat capability.</strong><br />
<strong>The inability to detect and assess space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems or conduct probing attacks on US space systems<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Today, </span>other nations are working to developnew weapons to counter US dominance and to take the lead in<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—</span>informationwar<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The current </span>coverage gaps in our space surveillance network<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset </span>makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons <span style="font-size: 6pt;">without our knowledge.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Finally, </span>without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> to counter an attack against US space assets</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is </span>to deter an attack on US space assets<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. </span>A senior officer in US Strat<span style="font-size: 6pt;">egic </span>Com<span style="font-size: 6pt;">mand recently </span>stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.57 </span></strong><br />

<strong>Marshall, 8 - NASA Ames Research Center (Will, Astropolitics, 6:154–199, “REDUCING THE VULNERABILITY OF SPACE ASSETS: A</strong><br />
<strong>MULTITIERED MICROSATELLITE CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE,” Ebsco Political Science)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Space assets are one of the most critical ‘‘Achilles’ heels’’ of the current military capability of the United States (U.S.). This is for two reasons: (1) the U.S. military space systems—in particular reconnaissance, navigation, signals intelligence, early warning, and communications systems—are critical to modern military warfare and intelligence; and (2) space systems are inherently vulnerable to attack. This combination is understood at the highest levels and was espoused in the ‘‘Rumsfeld Space Commission’’ with talk of a ‘‘Space Pearl Harbor.’’1 Whether one agrees with the tone, this is a genuine security problem for the U.S. in need of a near-term solution. While there have been numerous papers, and much media and academic attention, in the space security discussion focused on promoting or criticizing space-based weapons,2 there have been far fewer papers and studies offering constructive ways forward that deal with these genuine security concerns in a broader sense.3</strong><br />
<strong>The central motivation for this paper is to put forward one key element—the satellite architecture—in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. space assets. It is hoped that this idea, together with others like it, should stimulate and contribute to a debate on more constructive ways forward for how to achieve space security in the post-Cold war world.</strong><br />
<strong>Importance of Space Assets</strong><br />
<strong>For better or worse, it is clear that the U.S. military is to some significant extent dependent on its key satellites, which number about 86–105 operational satellites at present. These satellites constitute a significant part of the eyes, ears, and central nervous system of the modern military.4 A practical example that helps to illustrate this is the case of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. First, the decision to go was based in part on satellite imagery and signals intelligence from satellites; whether or not it was interpreted or used correctly is a separate issue. Second, the planning and operation were facilitated by satellite imagery. Third, many planes, ships, tanks, and units’ positions were known through Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and even most munitions were guided by GPS. Fourth, the operation was commanded from the U.S. in large part through the use of communications satellites. Perhaps more importantly than any of the functions in the Iraq example, early warning (EW) satellites are the U.S.’s and Russia’s first warning of nuclear missile attack. As Gray classified, space assets have moved from being ‘‘useful and important’’ to an ‘‘indispensable adjunct’’ in the military over the last decade.5</strong><br />
<strong>Space assets are definitely used a great deal by the U.S. military, but that does not mean necessarily as strong a dependence as Gray implies. The loss of U.S. space assets could range in its effect anywhere from a loss to the U.S. military in practical operations, to being catastrophic to U.S. security. The former would entail a reduction in operational effectiveness or speed, but fundamentally supposes that back-up systems and/or redundancy allow a near continuation of military capability. The latter scenario would entail an effective disablement of the U.S. military capability from normal operations. In reality, the significance lies between these boundaries, but this is a topic that could benefit from further research.</strong><br />

<strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">Paul Kennedy was probably right: the US will go the way of all great powers — down. The individual dramas of the past decade — the September 2001 terrorist attacks, prolonged wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis — have delivered the world a message: US primacy is in decline. This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline, but it encompasses a trend that appears to be negative and perhaps alarming. Although the US still possesses incomparable military prowess and its economy remains the world’s largest, the once seemingly indomitable chasm that separated America from anyone else is narrowing. Thus, the global distribution of power is shifting, and the inevitable result will be a world that is less peaceful, liberal and prosperous, burdened by a dearth of effective conflict regulation</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts. However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid. As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">.</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that America’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">. Free </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">. A world without American hegemony is one where great power wars re-emerge, the liberal international system is supplanted by an authoritarian one, and trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy. </span></strong><br />

Commitment to ORS is vital to eterrence by denial – it will prevent attacks against US space assets<br />
Sejba, 10 <strong>- USAF Congressional Budget Liaison Officer Budget and Appropriations Liaison Directorate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget Secretary of the Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC (Timothy, “ Deterrence for Space: Is Operationally Responsive Space Part of the Solution?”, High Frontier, May, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf</a>)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The space domain,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> often referred to as “The High Frontier,” </span>no longer is a sanctuary outside the reach of foreign intervention. The threat to space systems and their capabilities is broad, ranging from reversible effects such as jamming or blinding, to more destructive means such as anti-satellite weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is now time to take actions for the </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">sake of space</span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and assure its continued contributions across the full spectrum of military operations. </span>Given the criticality of space to not only our military power, but also our economic power, it is time we develop policies and field capabilities to deter future adversaries from attempting to degrade, deny, or destroy space capabilities and services<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The asymmetric advantages enabled by space can no longer be assumed and as a result, a new National Security Strategy for space must be forged, one that combines deterrence with basic protection capabilities never before afforded our space systems. Yet, space deterrence is not an “all in” strategy, nor can it reduce the risk of attack to zero.1 </span>Should aspects of deterrence fail, we must take steps to defend and protect our space systems and the critical global services they provide<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Operationally responsive space (ORS) by definition is “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of joint force commanders’ needs.”2 Dissected further, one key word stands out: </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">assured </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">… being sufficiently robust, timely, agile, adaptive, and resilient, to achieve desired outcomes with a high degree of certainty.3 So </span>while ORS intends to provide operational and tactical support to the joint warfighter, its true value will be the assurance it provides as a credible strategic <em>deterrent</em> against space attacks.</strong><br />
<strong>As a deterrent, ORS provides access to existing capabilities, or rapid deployment and employment of new capabilities, denying the benefits our adversaries may seek by attacking our space capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Through timely and accurate intelligence, we can work to understand our adversaries’ intent and armed with this knowledge, we gain the opportunity to influence their decision-making calculus<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Understanding intent, coupled with credible and timely ORS capabilities, can effectively deny or greatly reduce the benefits they seek by attacking the asymmetric advantages enabled by space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ORS provides a responsiveness that will allow the commander, US Strategic Command (CDR USSTRATCOM), to respond and support our combatant commands real-time and near-term requirements. To support these requirements, </span>ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space. In fact, </span>a deterrence strategy that includes the threat of punishment<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form, mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy; a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy </span>is not directly applicable to space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.6</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Instead,deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries (against their most prized assets<span style="font-size: 8pt;">);9 </span>and encourage their restraint<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></strong><br />
<strong>A New Focus of Deterrence</strong><br />
<strong><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">What does deterrence look like in the 21</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">st </span></em><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">century? The US has not yet figured that out, said Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear.</span></em></strong><br />
<strong><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Sandra I. Erwin, </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Future of War—How the Game is Changing</span></em></strong><br />
<strong><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">… Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.… </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ US National Security Strategy, 2006</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making.”10 In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. </span>Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations even in a contested environment.</strong><br />
<strong>Deny the Benefits—ORS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Examples</strong><br />
<strong><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) view of space: Space shifting from enabler to key battleground. Space characterized as important because it contributes to information dominance; space now described as important in its own right….many in the PLA see space as a likely future arena for conflict.</span></em></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ Space and PRC National Security,’ Dean Cheng, China specialist, The Heritage Foundation, 8 October 2008.12</span></strong><br />
<strong>The purpose to benefit denial is to convince an adversary that their intent will not be achieved, or have little to no value. Today, our ability to field ORS capabilities is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Instead, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency. However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “</span>our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”14</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Moving forward, </span>to be a true deterrent, ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). </span>Tier 1 and Two ORS capabilities can be deployed and employed rapidly, within hours to days. The cost for Tier 1 includes implementing new concept of operations for deployed on-orbit systems, or the rapid, low cost launch and deployment of systems intended to augment existing systems for Tier 2<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ,,39 Further, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">the DoD's Plan for Operationally Responsive Space highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness and adaptability to the threat</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42 The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43 The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44 While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Field-ready systems would provide a credible defensive deterrent against existing and likely Chinese offensive anti-satellite actions.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement. Space Situational Awareness </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy. The U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Although the U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (SSN) network, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> the</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> February 10, 2009 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Improved SSA also allows the U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Intelligence Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States. Preplanned Satellite Actions </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting to an anti-satellite attack. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">orbital maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the anti-satellite weapon</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target. Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">If a conflict looks to be inevitable, they could decide to rapidly execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. If the conflict escalates into a conventional war, the single maneuver may buy the U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">enough time to execute a kinetic strike that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets. Variable and Rapid Launch Capability </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The current United States Department of Defense launch complex does not have the capability to rapidly replenish satellites in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48 Small Satellites </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The United States must also make a move towards smaller satellites that use a common bus and architecture</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">A single launch vehicle could then deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the rapid establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict or replenishment of an old one</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Having numerous small satellites ready to launch can also lesson the need to perform defensive orbital maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">small satellites are inherently harder to track whether by radar or optical telescopes</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites. Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe. Decreased Dependence on Space Systems The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission. Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">defense against the long term radiation effects must focus on hardening all future satellites against nuclear explosions. Without hardening, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite replenishment could take months and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites. Institutional Changes Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user. Transparency </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The above actions may deter China from further pursuing its anti-satellite programs, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Engagement </span><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic· missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO. Additionally, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.53 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that can damage satellite systems</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”56 Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply. CONCLUSION The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57 Council on Foreign Relations </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degrade US military capabilities in a conflict with China. The United States should rely on a defensive space strategy to deter Chinese anti-satellite actions. The strategy must include robust space situational awareness, preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58</span></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Responses</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">Satellites can be defended against some kinds of direct kinetic attacks</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. They can be moved out of range of the attacker’s terminal engagement sensors, if there is enough warning and accurate track of the interceptor and enough understanding of the kill mechanism, and if the satellite has been designed to withstand the loads created by the movement. There may be ways to confuse or defeat the sensors used to detect and track the target satellite, either in initial acquisition or in terminal engagement. The target might also be protected by active defenses, although with intercept occurring only about ten minutes after launch, the defenses will probably need to be directed energy rather than kinetic weapons. </span><span style="color: #231f20;">Either case would require precise situational awareness—exact information about the technology and operation of the attack—together with major advances in command and control for the defenses</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">Even without enemy action, satellites in orbit might provide less space support than needed. Satellites might be lost to collisions with debris or other objects; or essential components might fail.</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;"> Or it may be that prewar planning proved inaccurate, that more support is needed to meet unforeseen needs, or that demand for space support at the outbreak of crisis proves much greater than had been anticipated.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">These problems are not remedied by defenses; instead, they call for a supplemental capability, to augment capacity to meet surging needs and to replace lost or failed sensors</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. Some of this supplemental capability might be found already in orbit: the communications and intelligence satellites of commercial entities and allied governments. While not all of the products of these systems will be militarily useful to the U.S.—and probably none will possess the capability of analogous U.S. government systems—the diversity of information they could provide and the speed with which it could be available would surely prove advantageous.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">More capable systems, fully compatible with U.S. forces and fully under U.S. control, could in principle be stored in orbit; the engineering requirements for long-term storage and return to full operation seem well understood</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. At the same time, these systems might themselves suffer on-orbit misadventures, might potentially be targeted, and might prove useless in the face of unforeseen needs. Still, this approach offers the fastest, and probably the most expensive, path to the most capable supplementary systems.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">Supplements might be provided more cheaply and more reliably if they were stored on the ground, ready to be launched in response to the developing needs of joint force commanders. </span><span style="color: #231f20;">If these supplemental systems could be launched and brought into operation quickly enough, the time required for adversaries to detect, track, and assess them might deter antisatellite attacks completely</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. If launched before hostilities began, </span><span style="color: #231f20;">these supplements would confront adversaries with the need to prepare revised and more complicated plans for attacks in space, perhaps with less confidence that all important systems were in the crosshairs</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">If launched as replacements for satellites </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">initially lost to enemy action, the supplements would shrink the advantage that was sought in attacking the original satellites. If the U.S. </span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">coupled its supplemental replacements with vigorous offensive counterspace actions of its own, an enemy’s initial attacks would leave the U.S. with a diminished yet effective set of space assets and the enemy with none. All in all, </span><span style="color: #231f20;">being able to supplement or restore needed capability in orbit would likely prove a stabilizing and deterring influence; not being destructive weapons themselves, the supplements could scarcely be considered escalatory</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">An active region of the sun that blasted out powerful solar storms four days in a row last week likely isn't done yet, scientists say</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Officially, the flare-spouting region is called sunspot 1283. But space weather experts have dubbed it &quot;Old Faithful,&quot; after the famous geyser in the United States' Yellowstone National Park that goes off like clockwork. And the solar Old Faithful should erupt again before it dissipates, researchers said. &quot;It still has a fair amount of complexity,&quot; said solar physicist C. Alex Young of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. &quot;So we still have a pretty good chance of seeing some more stuff from this one.&quot; An active sunspot Sunspots are temporary dark patches on the solar surface caused by intense magnetic activity. Some last for hours before disappearing; others linger for days, weeks or even months. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">Powerful solar storms often erupt from sunspots. These include radiation-flinging solar flares and phenomena known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) — massive clouds of solar plasma that can streak through space at up to 3 million mph</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (5 million kph). </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">From Sept. 5-8, sunspot 1283 produced four big flares and three CMEs</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Two of the flares were X-class events and two were M-class flares. (</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">Strong solar flares are classified according to a three-tiered system: X-class are the most powerful</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, M-class are of medium strength and C-class are the weakest.) While the rapid motion previously observed in sunspot 1283 seems to have died down a bit, Young said, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">the sunspot looks poised to erupt again sometime soon</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">&quot;There's a good probability that we're still going to see at least another M-class flare, possibly another X-class flare,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">&quot; Young told SPACE.com. It's not uncommon for sunspots to pop off a number of powerful flares in quick succession the way 1283 has done, he added. That seems to be the natural order of things. &quot;When you see one big flare, your chances of seeing another one are pretty good,&quot; Young said.

That's not to say scientists aren't making progress. Indeed, they've learned a lot about solar eruptions lately, Young said. And the knowledge base will continue to grow, he added, as a fleet of sun-watching spacecraft beam home more and more observations of Earth's star. &quot;We're really in a great time right now in terms of the data that we have,&quot; Young said, citing the contributions of spacecraft such as NASA's STEREO and Solar Dynamics Observatory, as well as SOHO, a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency. &quot;It's going to be pretty exciting, from a solar physics and a space weather point of view.&quot; All of these eyes on the sun should be treated to quite a show over the next several years. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">Solar activity has been ramping up over the last few months as the sun works toward a maximum in its 11-year activity cycle. Scientists expect the peak of the current cycle, which is known as Solar Cycle 24, to come in 2013. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the past, solar storms have caused billions of dollars of commercial satellites to malfunction and die prematurely. A Great solar storm has the power to destroy many space assets (Space Station, Space Shuttle, LEO Satellites, GEO Satellites, Off World Missions) simultaneously. In our technology driven society, satellites play an important role in communications. The loss of satellites can affect: major news wire service feeds, network television, satellite television and cable programming, nationwide radio service, weather data, cell phone service, pagers, automated teller machines, gas station credit card handling services, airline weather tracking services, earthquake monitoring network, blackberries, GPS navigation service, and critical military &amp; airline communications. And this list grows longer every day. Current commercial satellites are light-weight, sophisticated, built at the lowest cost using off-the-shelf electronics. 3 This current low cost approach makes new satellite design more vulnerable to damage from solar storms due to less radiation hardening. A high-energy particle from an SPE can penetrate the wall of a satellite and deposit sufficient charge to cause an electrical upset to a circuit switch, false command, memory state change or loss. 1 As the nuclear particles collide within the spacecraft, they release electrons that build up an internal dielectric charge. This static charge can destroy circuitry on electronic boards. The particles can also change data and instructions stored in computer memory. Only deaths with “day, month and year” listed were used in this analysis.Impact, 2007 James A. Marusek 21 Some of the memory damage is soft causing Single Event Upset (SEU). Generally, this anomaly can be corrected by a computer reboot. But some of the damage can be hard causing unrepairable physical damage to the junction of the microcircuit. These types of failures can be fatal.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">What would happen if the technology our modern military depends upon were to suddenly be compromised? The military Global Positioning System (GPS) is just one technology heavily relied upon for a variety of critical US military operations. Military GPS systems are responsible for increasing weapons accuracy, and therefore decreasing the number of warheads and military personnel required to take down a target or complete a mission. The GPS system was first introduced in the 1970s for military usage exclusively. GPS has since expanded into the commercial market – just about every new vehicle is introduced with a built in GPS, and standalone GPS systems can be added to older model vehicles easily – which makes constant innovation possible, but also lowers the high standards often demanded for the testing of military technology. Today, military GPS technology is so prevalent that John Pike of Globalsecurity.org claimed it is absolutely vital to American military functions; every military moving vehicle uses GPS. At least 100 U.S. military defense systems rely on GPS: aircrafts, ships, armored vehicles, bombs and artillery shells. In addition to GPS guided weapons systems, the Army also</span> uses GPS units as patrol and location tracking tools for military service members in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />

Last October, around Halloween, the Sun produced a solar storm that was one of the largest ever recorded, and was strong enough to raise some concerns about the safety of Earth’s satellites. According to a recent paper published in Space Weather, such concern may well be justified. If its conclusions are correct, then a solar storm the size of one that was observed in 1859 could potentially kill several weather, telecommunications, and military satellites in less than a year. Here’s where the danger lies: most satellites, at least at some point in their orbits, fly through the inner radiation belt surrounding the Earth (aka the Van Allen Belt). The inner radiation belt, like it says on the tin, comprises quite a bit of intense radiation. However, satellites are shielded from that radiation, and the intensity of the radiation in the inner belt is relatively stable. That’s because it’s in large part shielded from high-energy particles by the plasmasphere, which is a cloud of plasma that is part of the Earth’s magnetosphere. Usually, when a solar storm hits, most of the radiation either hits the outer radiation belt or the plasmaphere. When the plasmasphere gets hit, some of the plasma dissipates, making it smaller, but that dissipation prevents too much intense radiation from hitting the inner belt. During the Halloween storms, observations showed that there was significant erosion of the plasmasphere. Not enough to let significant radiation into the inner belt, but enough that the study authors wanted to take a closer look at the data. Based on observational data of solar storms, the radiation belts, and the plasmasphere during past years, the authors were able to successfully model the Halloween solar storm. They then modeled a solar storm with the intensity of the Carrington Solar Storm, which took place in 1859 and is estimated to have been about four times stronger than the Halloween storms. When the Carrington storm was modeled, the results showed that the plasmasphere was eroded to the point that much more radiation reached the inner belt than is normally the case. Moreover, the intensity produced “waves” of strong radiation continually moving through the inner belt. Based on their models, the authors suggest that the high radiation intensity of the inner belt could persist for as long as a decade. That intensity would likely swamp the radiation shielding on a typical satellite, and the authors estimate that most would be rendered inoperable within a year after the storm. The loss of satellites as a result of a solar storm would be an economic catastrophe – we rely on satellites for a large portion of our day to day lives, even when we don’t realize it. The researchers hope to continue their work modeling radiation from solar storms, with an eye towards better and more accurate predictions, as well as looking for ways to diminish the impacts of such storms. In the meantime, the authors suggest that satellite engineers incorporate the potential for intensification of the inner radiation belt in their radiation mitigation strategies. That strikes me as a good idea.<br />

If America now tries to pull back from the world stage, it will leave a dangerous power vacuum.

<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">As for the accidental factor of nuclear war, both the U.S. and Russia have ‘‘launch on warning’’ systems that send off rockets before confirmation that a nuclear attack is underway; thus, especially during a time of tensions, a massive nuclear war could take place within only 30 min after a warning—even if the warning is false. This scenario has almost happened on several occasions in the past. It was only because of individual human judgments, which disbelieved the false warnings, that nuclear war did not happen, but if the human judgment had indeed interpreted the warnings according to protocol, an allout nuclear war would surely have taken place.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Try and pursue a strategy of deterrence by denial. Deny the adversary the bene-fits of attacking your satellite systems by installing, whenever possible, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">passive defenses on satellites, such as hardening</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> against electromagnetic pulse attacks, measures to make jamming more difficult, and ablative </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">shielding to help satellites both withstand</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> ac-tual </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">physical attacks and survive space debris</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">impacts. Eventually, as individual threats become more defined, active defenses should also be seriously considered, although this will be much further in the future. In tandem with passive defenses, develop and accelerate programs for rapid launch of satellites to reconstitute lost systems and to bol-ster constellations in times of crisis. Also needed are spare satellites in storage here on earth that can be launched at short notice. While the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) program is seeking to address these issues with the use of small satellites, efforts should also be made to speed up the time it takes to place larger satellites and more traditional systems that are being used in orbit. I suggest that we </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">prioritize space situational awareness programs in order to build as quickly as possible a comprehensive picture of the space environment, some-thing that we are severely lacking today. If policy makers and commanders possess the ability to differentiate between purposeful attacks and the hazards of the natural space environment, then the potential for misperception and miscalculation is dramatically reduced. Furthermore, effective deterrence is strengthened by the fact that space situational awareness could potentially indicate the nature and origins of any attempted at-tack on a satellite, something that would be very challenging given that there are many ways in which one can attack a satellite,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> including cyber.</span><br />

(Space.com) Magnetic storms set off by the sun could pose a bigger threat than thought to weather, communication, military and other satellites close to Earth, with a potentially devastating economic impact, scientists suggest. In the new study, researchers found that solar radiation can energize a belt of high-energy particles that surrounds Earth more dramatically than previously believed. The study focused on the possible effects of a particularly strong magnetic storm on the Van Allen radiation belts, the dangerous rings of high-energy particles that girdle the Earth. The belts are split into two distinct zones. The outer belt, which is made up of electrons, reaches from about 15,800 to 31,600 miles (25,500 to 51,000 kilometers) above the surface, while the inner belt, which consists of a mix of electrons and protons, reaches from about 4,000 to 8,000 miles (6,400 to 12,800 km) above. Scientists had known the outer belt could become far more intense during geomagnetic storms caused by high-energy particles spewed by the sun, such as the storm that supercharged Earth's northern lights display Monday night (Sept. 26). However, they have long thought such storms do not affect the inner belt. Now computer simulations suggest that during a &quot;superstorm&quot; -- which has occurred in the past and is likely to recur in the future ? the electrons in the inner belt, too, could become energized. Near-Earth radiation could then remain dramatically more intense for several years afterward. &quot;The increase in radiation in the inner zone may last for up to a decade and continue damaging satellites for years after a very strong storm,&quot; study lead author Yuri Shprits, a space physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told SPACE.com. This radiation would damage satellites in that zone and potentially cut their lifetimes by five-sixths or more. [Related: Space Radiation to Rise for Astronauts, Airline Passengers] &quot;It would not destroy all satellites at once,&quot; Shprits said. &quot;However, at least according to our calculations, a very strong storm can increase the radiation dose in the inner zone by a factor of 10, and within a few years we may lose a significant portion of the satellites that traverse the inner zone.&quot; In terms of new strategies that might be needed to protect satellite systems, &quot;it's hard to say,&quot; Shprits said. &quot;First of all, we need to estimate risks and estimate cost. If cost is too high, we may want to accept the risks and start getting ready to replenish the fleet in the case of such event.&quot; &quot;There are a number of rather expensive strategies that can be used to mitigate the risk, including redundancy in electronics and increased shielding,&quot; he added. &quot;Zero risk means infinite cost.&quot; Two missions to study the radiation belts are planned for 2012, Shprits noted: NASA's Radiation Belt Storm Probe will observe radiation belts in the equatorial plane, while Moscow State University's LOMONOSOV mission, with UCLA-built instruments on board, will observe radiation belts at low altitudes. The scientists detailed their findings online in the Aug. 25 issue of the journal Space Weather.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Department of Defense defined ORS as “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of Joint Force Commanders needs”61 but the concept has its naysayers. </span>Future funding and senior leadership support will demonstrate the necessity of implementing the ORS concept. The President’s Fiscal Year 2010 budget request significantly diminished the ORS budget<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The $112.9 million request would </span>reduce the FY 2009’s appropriations by $83.7 million<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (42.5%). HASC added $23.4 million to the ORS budget to fund remaining development and launch costs of the ORS-1 satellite. The Fiscal Year 2011 budget is still in work, however the FY11 Air Force Posture Statement stated a request of $94 million, almost 9% of the total space-related budget, for the ORS program. These on-demand space vehicles will only augment or temporarily replace large satellite systems, so they will most likely not have all the capabilities of the more complex spacecraft but they should have enough survivability and operational mission requirements to serve as temporary solutions</span>. The ORS concept is sound and funded, but to be effective it must be delivered to the user efficiently on-time and on-budget.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This innovative way of doing business in space starts with a revolutionary alteration in the current military space</span><br />

ORS is inevitable – other space powers will do it if the US doesn’t<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Wertz, 8 </span>- president of Microcosm, a space technology small business in Los Angeles, and the general chairman for the first five Responsive Space Conferences (James, “It’s time to get our ORS in gear,” The Space Review, 1/7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1032/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1032/1</a>)<br />
<br />
Can the US overcome bureaucratic impediments in order to make it happen?<br />
Here we would have to say that no one knows. It may or may not occur for all of the reasons that Dwayne Day has clearly pointed out. The need for ORS has been formalized for some years in the <em>Operationally Responsive Spacelift Mission Need Statement</em> (ORS MNS) of December 20, 2001. But that does not mean that it will actually come about. There are a variety of entrenched interests and organizational sandboxes arrayed against ORS, or trying to reshape it in their own image. This is, of course, the same process that has brought us $32 billion in cost overruns in the ten largest DoD space programs according to a 2007 <em>Aviation Week</em> article. We would have to conclude that the odds of success are slim, but not zero. In many past technology developments, it has been Congress that has made things happen. That may or may not occur here.<br />
One thing seems clear: if ORS doesn’t happen in the US, it will certainly happen elsewhere. According to a DoD 2007 assessment, the Chinese have already announced a near-term goal of launching satellites within hours of demand. The Russians have been able to do so for years. The Europeans are well ahead of the US in a formalized process for creating low-cost space missions. The rest of the world will move ahead with the capability to respond rapidly to changing world events, irrespective of whether the US chooses to do so.<br />

[SatNews] New capabilities will be delivered to combatant commanders in short order...<br />
Air Force Space Command provided ORS-1 for early COCOM acceptance and entry into trial period, signifying the start of the satellite’s year-long mission under the direction of the 1st Space Operations Squadron and U.S. Strategic Command who will operate and task the satellite in direct support of USCENTCOM, September 29th. Since its launch June 29, the ORS-1 spacecraft has undergone an exhaustive checkout from component initialization to sensor calibration and system characterization. The satellite features a modified version of the Senior Year Electro-optical Reconnaissance System-2 sensor currently flown on the U-2 aircraft and was developed to address a U.S. Central Command need for enhanced battlespace awareness. The satellite, which was developed as a partnership between the ORS Office and SMC’s Space Development and Test Directorate, uses an existing payload and bus structure to deliver new capabilities to the combatant commander in record time. ORS-1 was developed from an initial concept to an operational capability in just under three years. “The entire government and contractor team worked tremendously hard to meet CENTCOM's need and deliver ORS-1 in record time, and we are very proud of the capabilities ORS-1 is providing to CENTCOM today,” said Col. Carol Welsch, acting director for the Space Development and Test Directorate. “This success would not have been possible without the outstanding teamwork between the ORS Office, SMC, 50th Space Wing, Goodrich, ATK, Orbital Sciences Corp. and Lockheed Martin. I'm inspired by the dedication of this team and look forward to applying lessons from our ORS-1 experience on future responsive space programs.” &quot;This transition is an important step toward providing operational capabilities to support our deployed Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines,” said Dr. Peter Wegner, director of the Operationally Responsive Space Office. “I am extremely proud of the teamwork exhibited by the government and contractors.&quot;<br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">Space assets are vulnerable- makes attacks inev</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Rendleman, 10 –[</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science]</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The 11 January 2007 test of a Chinese ground-based, direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) kinetic-kill interceptor against one of their own defunct weather satellites generated considerable angst across the United States space community. </span>The 2007 test demonstrated that the importance of space capabilities is also their Achilles heel, that is, their deadly weakness in spite of overall strength; it is far too easy to neutralize space systems and their power<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. In the broad strategic context, </span>space capabilities have their own set of unique, inherent vulnerabilities<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, which are largely the result of orbital mechanics. </span>This invites destruction, damage, and even just mischief delivered by even the least significant adversary<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. However, other nations may seek to deny U.S. advantages in space through a variety of negation and prevention actions.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Negation Threats</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Satellite systems consist not only of spacecraft, each with their own payload and bus, but also a supporting infrastructure—ground control stations, tracking and control links, commonly referred to as the tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&amp;C) links, data links, launch facilities, and an industrial base. Each of these components is at risk to threats of physical and cyber attack, and sabotage, and can be negated, simultaneously or each in detail. The satellite payload, bus, links, and infrastructure can be negated by using a variety of permanent or reversible means to achieve one of the five possible effects, known as the ‘‘five Ds’’—deception, disruption, denial, degradation, and destruction.5</span><br />
Space-based threats proliferate as a result of the ever-growing global availability of technology and access to the space domain. There are huge incentives for states to invest in and use space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, and the spread of space technologies has occurred. States with sufficient resources can now reach out to space and ‘‘touch’’ satellites through a variety of means, and achieve one and even more of the five Ds. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Spacecraft are vulnerable to direct ascent weapons as demonstrated by the Chinese ASAT test, and to a variety of other groundbased, airborne, and space-based ASAT technologies. Direct-ascent launched, or orbit-based nuclear devices, can be detonated, generating radiation and other lethal effects to destroy unshielded electronics over a wide lethal range. Co-orbital ASATs could be employed, comparable to the old Soviet system that was tested extensively in the 1970s and early 80s. In a less likely scenario, space-borne mines can also be deployed in close proximity to spacecraft, or exploded to generate debris clouds that destructively engage whole classes of satellites in the same orbital plane or in crossing orbits. Ground, space-based, or airborne lasers could be used by adversaries to wreak havoc. Blinding operations could be executed and inflict effects ranging from temporary ‘‘dazzling’’ to permanent burnout of optical or other sensors with intense energy bursts.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Ground systems, supporting communications, and their nodes, are vulnerable to diverse land, sea, or air kinetic attacks, including sabotage. Unprotected systems are also susceptible to electronic attack through jamming and electromagnetic deception techniques. Jammers emit signals that mask or prevent reception of desired signals; these methods can disrupt uplinks, downlinks, and even cross-links. By disabling the means of command and control, and data communications, jammers render satellites inoperable or unavailable. Electromagnetic deception techniques can be employed to confuse systems; this could include sending false, but deceptively plausible, commands that cause spacecraft to perform damaging or wasteful maneuvers, modify databases or execute configuration changes, or otherwise destroy it.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Similarly, supporting terrestrial ground stations, computer networks, and links are vulnerable to information operation and cyber attacks. These attacks could involve directing global denial of service tasks, injecting fake commands, malicious software and viruses into the space system, performing unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of sensitive information (data interception), and causing unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of network information, services, and databases.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">In sum, there is a wide span of kinetic and other types of attacks an adversary could consider and employ. There is potential that even non-state actors can access some of these technologies and space systems, and achieve several of the five Ds; however, it is unlikely they can obtain and then employ a full-spectrum of these means and achieve all of these effects. Conducting an attack within the space domain involves a rather substantial investment to develop, acquire, operate, and sustain needed shooter, sensor, and command and control systems. Given the scope and commitment needed to affect such a move, an on-orbit attack would probably be made only in the context of a larger strategic struggle, perhaps as a prelude to or part of early combat operations. On the other hand, inexpensive jamming technology is available to even the poorest potential adversaries. As such, jamming poses the most used and growing threat to space systems. Some argue that jamming also carries with it implicit political and legal sanctions since no major space power has moved to ban or make even temporary and reversible jamming illegal. This may change now that a number of nations have banned together to object to recent Iranian satellite jamming.6 Cyber adversaries and criminals are also beginning to hone their craft. They present an evolving threat to space systems; and like jamming, cyber threats can be developed and deployed for only modest investments.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention Threats</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention actions generally involve economic, political, informational, and diplomatic instruments of national power. For example, an extremely large creditor nation could employ its considerable economic clout and leverage in an attempt to compel or blackmail the United States to not license or permit imaging of its territory, preventing its use, and reducing its exposure to such observation. The creditor nation could seek to accomplish its objective by destabilizing the world market place. It could refuse to purchase treasury offerings that underpin the burgeoning U.S. fiscal and trade deficits, perhaps arguing that remote sensing, especially commercial remote sensing, of its territory infringes on its territorial and sovereign rights, or that it constitutes ‘‘unlawful’’ industrial espionage, and is thus, an unfair trade practice.7 Commercial remote sensing systems are nowan important resource for the United States Government and its national security needs. U.S. Government orders help sustain and stabilize the remote sensing industry,8 and any limitations on activities, whether for U.S. Government customers or commercial ones, imposed in response to external economic threats could evolve to cause problems. In an alternative scenario, a state, acting through political allies and proxies, could exert considerable influence and dominance to affect a change in U.S. law. This change could restrict licensing of commercial remote sensing imagery, restricting the market place and impacting business models for producers.9</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">As a diplomatic prevention example, adversaries could attempt to use international forums and treaties to deny frequency rights needed by U.S. military or intelligence satellites by making spurious ‘‘paper satellite’’ filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). ‘‘Paper satellites’’ involve ITU applications for satellite orbital slots, many for ‘‘speculative’’ systems that will never leave Earth. These filings can block access to scarce spectrum and orbital resources.10 The ability to place communications and other satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) positions could be held at risk. Some characterize some of these types of actions as a form of ‘‘lawfare.’’ ‘‘The term lawfare describes the growing use of international law claims, usually factually or legally meritless, as a tool of war. The goal is to gain a moral advantage over your enemy in the court of world opinion, and potentially a legal advantage in national and international tribunals.’’11</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention actions taken to hobble U.S. space systems are not armed attacks. As is discussed later, the use of force is only authorized under the United Nations (UN) Charter in response to an armed attack, or upon authorization of the UN Security Council. As such, using armed force to deter and defeat prevention actions involving political or diplomatic subterfuge or intrigue may be unlawful under international law. Creative alternative solutions must therefore be found to assure access to space when facing these types of threats.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Implications for U.S. Space Strategy</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">The wide span of threats poses profound implications</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> for U.S. space strategy and its execution. First, unlike the Cold War era, </span>the U<span style="font-size: 5pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">tates </span>now confronts a wide array of global actors, all operating with different motivations and incentives, some of which could become potential adversaries who can attack or threaten space capabilities<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. These state and non-state adversaries exhibit a wide array of political, economic, technical, and social differences. </span>Having many potential adversaries makes each of them harder to understand. This complicates efforts to understand motivations and to influence perceptions for deterrence purposes<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>These differences, in turn, increase the likelihood of misperception, undercutting strategies to protect access to space capabilities. When one’s attention is divided, deterrent measures that are appropriate for one target may not be useful, or even counterproductive, for another<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. This requires tailored intelligence efforts, information operations, and transparency efforts in order to avoid or minimize disputes and prevent problems.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Second, the broad array of adversaries exhibit widely varying risk-taking behaviors. Risk-taking behavior can strongly influence an adversary’s perception of a situation. Understanding this phenomenon can lead to better ways of influencing those perceptions. Unfortunately, </span>potential adversaries may not care that space systems offer tremendous value and capabilities to all nations, or care whether conflict in space could create space debris that could cost all nations access to the domain. <span style="font-size: 5pt;">A strategy to assure continuing access to space assets must therefore be sufficiently flexible to address both risk-averse and risk-taking adversaries. Indeed, potential adversaries may shift from risk-taking to risk-adverse over a relatively short period of time. China may fit in this category. Within a decade or two, it will have its own extensive space-based communications, navigation, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellite constellations, all of which will be integrated into its military operations. No doubt, China will embrace that evolution and become very reliant on space capabilities; this will shift it from an asymmetric competitor to one similar to the United States or Russia. Third, with the demise of the Soviet Union, some political commentators and critics described the United States as a ‘‘hyperpower’’ not just a ‘‘superpower.’’ 12 Though buffeted by recent events involving Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and the 2008 global financial meltdown, U.S. military supremacy continues. But, that </span>supremacy does not make or guarantee a successful space strategy.Adversaries may believe they have a higher stake than the United States in the outcome of a particular crisis or conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>Alternatively, the United States stake in the crisis may not be commensurate with the possible cost of involvement by the United States military and the rest of its national security apparatus. The first alternative may encourage mischief by adversaries; the second discourages U.S. action. As a result, adversaries may find threats of U.S. action in response to hostile acts affecting U.S. access to space systems to be non-credible<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Fourth, </span>while the United States has produced superlative space capabilities, it has not produced enough systems ready to survive the new kinetic, exotic, jamming, and cyber threat environment<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. The vulnerability exists because the spacecraft developed and deployed today are in many ways the same as those originally fielded during the Cold War. During that epic struggle, there was a tacit and then explicit understanding that each superpower would not attack and overwhelm the other’s space systems, except in the direst of circumstances, perhaps during the throes of a nuclear conflagration. Indeed, a number of agreements between the superpowers adopted the understanding and ruled out interference with national technical means, including space assets. </span>This belief in the superiority of space systems and power blinds the United States to the inherent strategic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in these systems. This, predictably, can now be exploited by potential adversaries, such as China, who, with their recent ASAT test, appear more willing to fully explore the technologies needed to expand the limits of conventional war to include the space domain<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Consequently, by historically and diplomatically reducing the threat, engineering of some satellite threat detection, attack avoidance, and other defense subsystems have not matured enough so that they are sophisticated, nimble, and robust enough to counter new 21st Century adversary attack capabilities.</span><br />

<strong>Wortzel, 8</strong> - Colonel, United States Army (Retired) (Larry, Astropolitics, 6:112–137, “THE CHINESE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY<br />
AND SPACE WARFARE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
The PLA is exploring in theoretical research, basic research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.77 </span>These include<span style="font-size: 5pt;">:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>satellite jamming technology;<br />
. collisions between space bodies;<br />
. kinetic energy weapons;<br />
. space-to-ground attack weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;</span><br />
. space planes<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> that can transit and fight ‘‘up or down’’ in the upper atmosphere or space;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>high-power laser weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>high-power microwave weapon systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>particle-beam weapons; and<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>electromagnetic pulse<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.78</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies. The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not, </span>it is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the blinding of a U.S. satellite mean they are achieving some success.<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 </span>The Chinese see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they would probably use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.81</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. </span>As the PLA modernizes its<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (</span>C4SIR) systems, it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, </span>an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons or a deeper crisis<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">For example, </span>four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, in Wuhan, </span>have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.82 In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88</span><br />
The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>One possible reaction by the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike against China’s strategic missile forces<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Space Deterrence</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Conclusions</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First, </span>in the event of conflict with the PLA, military operations carried out across all the domains of war, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, are likely. Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions. </span>There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;97 </span>the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. </span>The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance. </span>No such dialogue has taken place with China. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures.</span><br />
Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. To this end, the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. </span>As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, </span>and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>PLA is isolated from the Chinese govt</strong><br />
<strong>MacDonald, 11</strong> - Senior Director, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program, U.S. Institute of Peace (Bruce, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA”, 5/11, lexis)<br />
<br />
One characteristic of too many wars in the last century is that they are the result of miscalculation that ignites the tinder of fundamental geopolitical tensions. Averting major power conflict requires skillful management of tensions by senior leaders of the major powers<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. China has become much more internationally sophisticated, though with important exceptions, in its dealings with the rest of the world than has been true in the past, and this is reflected in its civilian leadership. Unfortunately, </span>the PLA's senior officer corps<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> trails its civilian counterparts in this respect. They have much less interaction with foreign official and travel abroad much less frequently than their U.S. counterparts. This means that the PLA overall </span>views world events from a less knowledgeable and sophisticated perspective, a danger in this increasingly complex world, and could explain, for example, the political &quot;tonedeafness&quot; of the PLA in the manner they conducted their 2007 ASAT test.<br />
<br />
This PLA problem becomes more serious when one realizes that the PLA is organizationally separate from the rest of the Chinese government, and reports only to the Central Military Commission,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> currently chaired by President Hu Jintao. President Hu, and his likely successors, have no significant military background, and the majority of the CMC's members are top PLA officers, suggesting that civilian oversight of major military decisions and consideration of their larger implications are not as carefully reviewed as in the U.S. government. Normally this would not be too great a concern, but </span>in a crisis this could be dangerous. Add to this the fact that China has no equivalent of our National Security Council, a critically important body for coordinating our security decisionmaking, and one comes away concerned about the relative insularity of the PLA in the Chinese power structure<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
In a crisis, the PLA probably cannot be counted on to show as sophisticated a sense of judgment as one would hope any country's military leaders, even an enemy's, to show. All these problems and many more pose potential threats to internal political stability andCommunist Party control, providing ample opportunity for crisis and conflict in the years ahead<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overview of The Strategic Landscape of Space</span><br />
<br />
Space assets<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and the communications and cyber links that enable them to function, </span>are the means by which essential national security information is either generated, transmitted, or both. This information is the lifeblood of U.S. conventional military superiority and plays a key role in U.S. strategic nuclear posture as well<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As such, </span>these space related assets represent extraordinarily appealing targets in any future conflict, and their relative vulnerability can provide dangerously attractive incentives in a crisis to preempt, escalating to war<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Resisting this temptation to attack may be morally virtuous but could be strategically unwise: </span>going first in a space conflict with a nearpeer space adversary appears to offer many advantages, while absorbing such a strike, with all its attendant destruction of military capabilities, and then responding to the attack against an opponent fully expecting such a response, appears to be militarily and strategically quite undesirable.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As technology advances, the ways of interfering with, disrupting, or destroying information streams in space or supporting space systems will likely increase, as will U.S. and others' dependence upon such systems. Providing defensive options for U.S. space assets should be pursued where appropriate, but most space observers believe that offense has the advantage in space over defense, as General Cartwright observed last May. Cartwright also noted that the challenging issues that space poses has made the Space Posture Review &quot;the most difficult of all the defense reviews&quot; the Obama Administration has undertaken.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The overall U.S. goal in space should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States and its allies, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. and allied security. </span>The United States has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This need not mean that China and others must perforce be disadvantaged by such an arrangement - there should be ample opportunity for many countries to benefit and prosper from a properly crafted system of space management.</span><br />
<br />
There is an inherent risk of strategic instability when relatively modest defense efforts create disproportionate danger to an adversary, as with<br />
space offense. And there is a serious risk of crisis instability in space when &quot;going first&quot; pays off<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> - destroying an adversary's satellites before he destroys yours. We don't know what would happen in a crisis, but </span>the potential for space instability seems high and likely to grow.<br />

<strong>Burke, 6</strong> – Lt Col, USAF, command space professional with operational experience in missile operations, space surveillance, space control, missile warning, and command and control (Alan, “SPACE THREAT WARNING: FOUNDATION FOR SPACE SUPERIORITY, AVOIDING A SPACE PEARL HARBOR,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www.afresearch.org/skins/RIMS/display.aspx?moduleid=be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153&amp;mode=user&amp;action=researchproject&amp;objectid=07acf878-3a5f-4a2c-8259-4a34c0717e9b" rel="nofollow">https://www.afresearch.org/skins/RIMS/display.aspx?moduleid=be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153&amp;mode=user&amp;action=researchproject&amp;objectid=07acf878-3a5f-4a2c-8259-4a34c0717e9b</a>)<br />
<br />
The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites<span style="font-size: 9pt;">, facilities or services; </span>the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets<strong>.</strong><br />
One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> on the US homeland or an attack </span>that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, </span>other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US<span style="font-size: 9pt;">.44</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">Although a major attack on the US is not likely, </span>the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculationthat the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike<span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span>The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, </span>the Chinese might seek to disrupt or destroy regional space capabilities as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a <em>fait accompli</em><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.45</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “</span>Space capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> are no longer nice to have, but </span>are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.”51 </span>The failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets.<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, </span>successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. </span>A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>Satellite communication links to worldwide deployed forces are critical capabilities in protecting US security, sovereignty, and military combat capability.<br />
The inability to detect and assess space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems or conduct probing attacks on US space systems<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Today, </span>other nations are working to developnew weapons to counter US dominance and to take the lead in<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—</span>informationwar<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The current </span>coverage gaps in our space surveillance network<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset </span>makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons <span style="font-size: 6pt;">without our knowledge.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Finally, </span>without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> to counter an attack against US space assets</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is </span>to deter an attack on US space assets<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. </span>A senior officer in US Strat<span style="font-size: 6pt;">egic </span>Com<span style="font-size: 6pt;">mand recently </span>stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.57 </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Spacefaring prowess is a common attribute of the dominant powers in the world today</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">. Special attention must be paid to so-called rogue states that have access to space-related technology and may even be spacefaring but do not have the conventional forces to achieve their policy aims.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Those aims tend to be very intense, and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">these players may seek space weapons as an asymmetric hedge against spacefaring adversaries</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> who may try to coerce them. The dominant military powers in the world, some of whom are potential adversaries, also tend to be the dominant spacefaring states. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Because of the economic benefits and exponential enhancements that spacepower delivers to terrestrial warfighting, those states are under increasing pressure to defend their space systems and to counter those of their potential adversaries. This may lead to a space weapons race and an immediate escalation of hostilities to &quot;wipe the skies&quot; of enemy satellites should war break out between two or more dominant military space powers</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.29 When assessing the interplay between the spectrum of conflict and the spectrum of belligerents, it may be the case that war between two weak actors will not likely extend into space. However, if the power is perceived to be disparate, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">a weak actor is far more likely to use space weapons against a powerful state as an asymmetric defensive move</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.30 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">A powerful state may counter</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the space systems in use by a weaker adversary, but it is likely to do so by placing diplomatic pressure on commercial vendors, or executing attacks on their ground stations, or launching highly selective covert attacks on the satellites they use by employing temporary and reversible means. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Should two dominant spacefaring powers go directly to war with each other with intense motives, both will find it critical to preserve their space systems and will consider it a dangerous liability to allow their enemy to exploit theirs. Given the ability of spacepower to cut the fog and friction of war while connecting military forces at the tactical, operational, and strategic level, it is likely that space systems will be primary targets that will be negated in the opening moves of war.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The fight for space is likely to be intense and brief. Temporary means of negation will likely switch to permanent methods of destruction to remove doubt in the minds of commanders.</span><br />

<strong>That kills heg</strong><br />
Marshall, 8 - NASA Ames Research Center (Will, Astropolitics, 6:154–199, “REDUCING THE VULNERABILITY OF SPACE ASSETS: A<br />
MULTITIERED MICROSATELLITE CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
Space assets are one of the most critical ‘‘Achilles’ heels’’ of the current military capability of the United States (U.S.). This is for two reasons: (1) the U.S. military space systems—in particular reconnaissance, navigation, signals intelligence, early warning, and communications systems—are critical to modern military warfare and intelligence; and (2) space systems are inherently vulnerable to attack. This combination is understood at the highest levels and was espoused in the ‘‘Rumsfeld Space Commission’’ with talk of a ‘‘Space Pearl Harbor.’’1 Whether one agrees with the tone, this is a genuine security problem for the U.S. in need of a near-term solution. While there have been numerous papers, and much media and academic attention, in the space security discussion focused on promoting or criticizing space-based weapons,2 there have been far fewer papers and studies offering constructive ways forward that deal with these genuine security concerns in a broader sense.3<br />
The central motivation for this paper is to put forward one key element—the satellite architecture—in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. space assets. It is hoped that this idea, together with others like it, should stimulate and contribute to a debate on more constructive ways forward for how to achieve space security in the post-Cold war world.<br />
Importance of Space Assets<br />
For better or worse, it is clear that the U.S. military is to some significant extent dependent on its key satellites, which number about 86–105 operational satellites at present. These satellites constitute a significant part of the eyes, ears, and central nervous system of the modern military.4 A practical example that helps to illustrate this is the case of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. First, the decision to go was based in part on satellite imagery and signals intelligence from satellites; whether or not it was interpreted or used correctly is a separate issue. Second, the planning and operation were facilitated by satellite imagery. Third, many planes, ships, tanks, and units’ positions were known through Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and even most munitions were guided by GPS. Fourth, the operation was commanded from the U.S. in large part through the use of communications satellites. Perhaps more importantly than any of the functions in the Iraq example, early warning (EW) satellites are the U.S.’s and Russia’s first warning of nuclear missile attack. As Gray classified, space assets have moved from being ‘‘useful and important’’ to an ‘‘indispensable adjunct’’ in the military over the last decade.5<br />
Space assets are definitely used a great deal by the U.S. military, but that does not mean necessarily as strong a dependence as Gray implies. The loss of U.S. space assets could range in its effect anywhere from a loss to the U.S. military in practical operations, to being catastrophic to U.S. security. The former would entail a reduction in operational effectiveness or speed, but fundamentally supposes that back-up systems and/or redundancy allow a near continuation of military capability. The latter scenario would entail an effective disablement of the U.S. military capability from normal operations. In reality, the significance lies between these boundaries, but this is a topic that could benefit from further research.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">Paul Kennedy was probably right: the US will go the way of all great powers — down. The individual dramas of the past decade — the September 2001 terrorist attacks, prolonged wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis — have delivered the world a message: US primacy is in decline. This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline, but it encompasses a trend that appears to be negative and perhaps alarming. Although the US still possesses incomparable military prowess and its economy remains the world’s largest, the once seemingly indomitable chasm that separated America from anyone else is narrowing. Thus, the global distribution of power is shifting, and the inevitable result will be a world that is less peaceful, liberal and prosperous, burdened by a dearth of effective conflict regulation</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts. However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid. As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that America’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">. Free </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">. A world without American hegemony is one where great power wars re-emerge, the liberal international system is supplanted by an authoritarian one, and trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy. </span><br />

<strong>Commitment to ORS is vital to eterrence by denial – it will prevent attacks against US space assets</strong><br />
<strong>Sejba, 10</strong> - USAF Congressional Budget Liaison Officer Budget and Appropriations Liaison Directorate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget Secretary of the Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC (Timothy, “ Deterrence for Space: Is Operationally Responsive Space Part of the Solution?”, High Frontier, May, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
The space domain,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> often referred to as “The High Frontier,” </span>no longer is a sanctuary outside the reach of foreign intervention. The threat to space systems and their capabilities is broad, ranging from reversible effects such as jamming or blinding, to more destructive means such as anti-satellite weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is now time to take actions for the </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">sake of space</span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and assure its continued contributions across the full spectrum of military operations. </span>Given the criticality of space to not only our military power, but also our economic power, it is time we develop policies and field capabilities to deter future adversaries from attempting to degrade, deny, or destroy space capabilities and services<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The asymmetric advantages enabled by space can no longer be assumed and as a result, a new National Security Strategy for space must be forged, one that combines deterrence with basic protection capabilities never before afforded our space systems. Yet, space deterrence is not an “all in” strategy, nor can it reduce the risk of attack to zero.1 </span>Should aspects of deterrence fail, we must take steps to defend and protect our space systems and the critical global services they provide<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Operationally responsive space (ORS) by definition is “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of joint force commanders’ needs.”2 Dissected further, one key word stands out: </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">assured </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">… being sufficiently robust, timely, agile, adaptive, and resilient, to achieve desired outcomes with a high degree of certainty.3 So </span>while ORS intends to provide operational and tactical support to the joint warfighter, its true value will be the assurance it provides as a credible strategic <em>deterrent</em> against space attacks.<br />
As a deterrent, ORS provides access to existing capabilities, or rapid deployment and employment of new capabilities, denying the benefits our adversaries may seek by attacking our space capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Through timely and accurate intelligence, we can work to understand our adversaries’ intent and armed with this knowledge, we gain the opportunity to influence their decision-making calculus<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Understanding intent, coupled with credible and timely ORS capabilities, can effectively deny or greatly reduce the benefits they seek by attacking the asymmetric advantages enabled by space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ORS provides a responsiveness that will allow the commander, US Strategic Command (CDR USSTRATCOM), to respond and support our combatant commands real-time and near-term requirements. To support these requirements, </span>ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations.</span><br />
Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space. In fact, </span>a deterrence strategy that includes the threat of punishment<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form, mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy; a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy </span>is not directly applicable to space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.6</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space.</span><br />
Instead,deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries (against their most prized assets<span style="font-size: 8pt;">);9 </span>and encourage their restraint<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
A New Focus of Deterrence<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">What does deterrence look like in the 21</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">st </span></em><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">century? The US has not yet figured that out, said Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Sandra I. Erwin, </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Future of War—How the Game is Changing</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">… Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.… </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ US National Security Strategy, 2006</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making.”10 In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. </span>Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations even in a contested environment.<br />
Deny the Benefits—ORS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Examples<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) view of space: Space shifting from enabler to key battleground. Space characterized as important because it contributes to information dominance; space now described as important in its own right….many in the PLA see space as a likely future arena for conflict.</span></em><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ Space and PRC National Security,’ Dean Cheng, China specialist, The Heritage Foundation, 8 October 2008.12</span><br />
The purpose to benefit denial is to convince an adversary that their intent will not be achieved, or have little to no value. Today, our ability to field ORS capabilities is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Instead, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency. However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “</span>our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”14</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Moving forward, </span>to be a true deterrent, ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). </span>Tier 1 and Two ORS capabilities can be deployed and employed rapidly, within hours to days. The cost for Tier 1 includes implementing new concept of operations for deployed on-orbit systems, or the rapid, low cost launch and deployment of systems intended to augment existing systems for Tier 2<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ,,39 Further, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">the DoD's Plan for Operationally Responsive Space highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness and adaptability to the threat</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42 The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43 The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44 While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Field-ready systems would provide a credible defensive deterrent against existing and likely Chinese offensive anti-satellite actions.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement. Space Situational Awareness </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy.

As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Improved SSA also allows the U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Intelligence Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States. Preplanned Satellite Actions </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting to an anti-satellite attack. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">orbital maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the anti-satellite weapon</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target. Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">If a conflict looks to be inevitable, they could decide to rapidly execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. If the conflict escalates into a conventional war, the single maneuver may buy the U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">enough time to execute a kinetic strike that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets. Variable and Rapid Launch Capability </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The current United States Department of Defense launch complex does not have the capability to rapidly replenish satellites in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48 Small Satellites </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The United States must also make a move towards smaller satellites that use a common bus and architecture</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">A single launch vehicle could then deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the rapid establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict or replenishment of an old one</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Having numerous small satellites ready to launch can also lesson the need to perform defensive orbital maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">small satellites are inherently harder to track whether by radar or optical telescopes</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites. Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe. Decreased Dependence on Space Systems The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission. Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">defense against the long term radiation effects must focus on hardening all future satellites against nuclear explosions. Without hardening, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite replenishment could take months and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites. Institutional Changes Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user. Transparency </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The above actions may deter China from further pursuing its anti-satellite programs, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Engagement </span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic· missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO. Additionally, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.53 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that can damage satellite systems</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”56 Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply. CONCLUSION The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57 Council on Foreign Relations </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degrade US military capabilities in a conflict with China. The United States should rely on a defensive space strategy to deter Chinese anti-satellite actions. The strategy must include robust space situational awareness, preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Responses</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">Satellites can be defended against some kinds of direct kinetic attacks</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. They can be moved out of range of the attacker’s terminal engagement sensors, if there is enough warning and accurate track of the interceptor and enough understanding of the kill mechanism, and if the satellite has been designed to withstand the loads created by the movement. There may be ways to confuse or defeat the sensors used to detect and track the target satellite, either in initial acquisition or in terminal engagement. The target might also be protected by active defenses, although with intercept occurring only about ten minutes after launch, the defenses will probably need to be directed energy rather than kinetic weapons. </span><span style="color: #231f20;">Either case would require precise situational awareness—exact information about the technology and operation of the attack—together with major advances in command and control for the defenses</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">Even without enemy action, satellites in orbit might provide less space support than needed. Satellites might be lost to collisions with debris or other objects; or essential components might fail.</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;"> Or it may be that prewar planning proved inaccurate, that more support is needed to meet unforeseen needs, or that demand for space support at the outbreak of crisis proves much greater than had been anticipated.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">These problems are not remedied by defenses; instead, they call for a supplemental capability, to augment capacity to meet surging needs and to replace lost or failed sensors</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. Some of this supplemental capability might be found already in orbit: the communications and intelligence satellites of commercial entities and allied governments. While not all of the products of these systems will be militarily useful to the U.S.—and probably none will possess the capability of analogous U.S. government systems—the diversity of information they could provide and the speed with which it could be available would surely prove advantageous.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">More capable systems, fully compatible with U.S. forces and fully under U.S. control, could in principle be stored in orbit; the engineering requirements for long-term storage and return to full operation seem well understood</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. At the same time, these systems might themselves suffer on-orbit misadventures, might potentially be targeted, and might prove useless in the face of unforeseen needs. Still, this approach offers the fastest, and probably the most expensive, path to the most capable supplementary systems.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">Supplements might be provided more cheaply and more reliably if they were stored on the ground, ready to be launched in response to the developing needs of joint force commanders. </span><span style="color: #231f20;">If these supplemental systems could be launched and brought into operation quickly enough, the time required for adversaries to detect, track, and assess them might deter antisatellite attacks completely</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. If launched before hostilities began, </span><span style="color: #231f20;">these supplements would confront adversaries with the need to prepare revised and more complicated plans for attacks in space, perhaps with less confidence that all important systems were in the crosshairs</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">If launched as replacements for satellites </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">initially lost to enemy action, the supplements would shrink the advantage that was sought in attacking the original satellites. If the U.S. </span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">coupled its supplemental replacements with vigorous offensive counterspace actions of its own, an enemy’s initial attacks would leave the U.S. with a diminished yet effective set of space assets and the enemy with none. All in all, </span><span style="color: #231f20;">being able to supplement or restore needed capability in orbit would likely prove a stabilizing and deterring influence; not being destructive weapons themselves, the supplements could scarcely be considered escalatory</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>A stable, predictable funding stream is vital to ORS technology development</strong><br />
<span class="apple-converted-space"><strong><span style="color: #101010;">Dinerman, 6</span></strong></span>– DOD space consultant, and <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">senior editor at the Hudson Institute’s New York branch (Taylor, The Space Review, “</span></em>Tactical IR satellites: operationally responsive spacecraft?,” 8/7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/675/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/675/1</a><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The </span>troops on the ground need information they can use in a timely and easily understood format<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Simply to provide them, or division or brigade intelligence staffs that support them, with raw satellite data is probably worse than useless. </span>The next generations of US Army and Marine Corps units are going to require information that can be integrated into their “network-centric” information systems<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Imagery from space-based infrared sensors that are specifically designed for tactical utility should be part of these networks.<br />
This is a mission for a future constellation of small “operationally responsive” satellites.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Part of the constellation should be kept in orbits that take them over places such as south Lebanon or the Afghan-Pakistani border where we can assume that there will be trouble for a long time to come. These should be carefully calibrated on a constant basis, so that their positioning information is ultra-precise. Other satellites can be kept on the ground ready to be launched at relatively short notice to supplement the ones on orbit over the world’s trouble spots, or they could be launched to cover unexpected outbreaks of fighting.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A model for the way such a program could be run is GPS, which, over almost three decades, has gone from prototypes to sets of more and more sophisticated and capable satellites. These spacecraft have, on the whole, been both cost effective and free of the kinds of nasty and expensive surprises that have plagued SBIRS and other Air Force satellite programs.</span><br />
An operationally responsive tactical IR satellite system would have to be both affordable and based on proven and reliable technology. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The first generation of such satellites may not have all the desired features, but if properly designed—with the right filters and the right level of multi- or hyper-spectral sensitivity—such craft would give the ground forces a valuable early operational capability.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To make the program affordable it would have to be designed to use already existing bus and power supply systems and probably also an in-service communications architecture. </span>It would have to be light enough to be launched on a Delta 2 or on a future operationally responsive spacelift vehicle. Most important of all, the funding stream<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>no matter how much or how little—would have to be predictable so that the contractors would have the incentive to plan for the long term<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This would be the most difficult part of the program since it would mean asking Congress to give up part of its power over the annual budget cycle.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Another way to keep the program affordable would be to keep the early requirements to a minimum. The first versions should be strictly for ground force use only, with perhaps some applications for Marine Corps amphibious warfare requirements. Only after the system has proven itself should the program be allowed to move on to develop air-to-ground sensor-to-shooter loops.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Ultimately a constellation of a dozen or so spacecraft in orbit, backed up by a similar number on the ground, would be ideal for the early versions of the full system. The ground segments will have to be as simple and as inexpensive as possible since it will need to be deployed with more than fifty Army and Marine brigade-sized units as well as with higher headquarters.</span><br />
If the idea of operationally responsive space means anything, it means that the military space forces<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, particularly Air Force Space Command, </span>are ready to give priority to supporting the troops on the front lines worldwide. Enhancing the combat effectiveness of the Army and the Marines and helping to save American lives should be the highest goal<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Clausewitz put it, “The object of fighting is the destruction or defeat of the enemy.” </span>The more that military space contributes directly to that objective, the better for the troops on the ground and for America as a whole.<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: none;">An active region of the sun that blasted out powerful solar storms four days in a row last week likely isn't done yet, scientists say</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Officially, the flare-spouting region is called sunspot 1283. But space weather experts have dubbed it &quot;Old Faithful,&quot; after the famous geyser in the United States' Yellowstone National Park that goes off like clockwork. And the solar Old Faithful should erupt again before it dissipates, researchers said. &quot;It still has a fair amount of complexity,&quot; said solar physicist C. Alex Young of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. &quot;So we still have a pretty good chance of seeing some more stuff from this one.&quot; An active sunspot Sunspots are temporary dark patches on the solar surface caused by intense magnetic activity. Some last for hours before disappearing; others linger for days, weeks or even months. </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">Powerful solar storms often erupt from sunspots. These include radiation-flinging solar flares and phenomena known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) — massive clouds of solar plasma that can streak through space at up to 3 million mph</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (5 million kph). </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">From Sept. 5-8, sunspot 1283 produced four big flares and three CMEs</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Two of the flares were X-class events and two were M-class flares. (</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">Strong solar flares are classified according to a three-tiered system: X-class are the most powerful</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, M-class are of medium strength and C-class are the weakest.) While the rapid motion previously observed in sunspot 1283 seems to have died down a bit, Young said, </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">the sunspot looks poised to erupt again sometime soon</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">&quot;There's a good probability that we're still going to see at least another M-class flare, possibly another X-class flare,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">&quot; Young told SPACE.com. It's not uncommon for sunspots to pop off a number of powerful flares in quick succession the way 1283 has done, he added. That seems to be the natural order of things. &quot;When you see one big flare, your chances of seeing another one are pretty good,&quot; Young said.

That's not to say scientists aren't making progress. Indeed, they've learned a lot about solar eruptions lately, Young said. And the knowledge base will continue to grow, he added, as a fleet of sun-watching spacecraft beam home more and more observations of Earth's star. &quot;We're really in a great time right now in terms of the data that we have,&quot; Young said, citing the contributions of spacecraft such as NASA's STEREO and Solar Dynamics Observatory, as well as SOHO, a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency. &quot;It's going to be pretty exciting, from a solar physics and a space weather point of view.&quot; All of these eyes on the sun should be treated to quite a show over the next several years. </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">Solar activity has been ramping up over the last few months as the sun works toward a maximum in its 11-year activity cycle.

<br />
Every 11 years, solar activity intensifies, and the next peak in activity is scheduled for 2013. The most significant storm on record hit in 1859, illuminating the night sky in light and shorting telegraph systems worldwide. Sparks shocked operators and set paper aflame. Today, space weather of that magnitude would be a significant problem for spacecraft, astronauts and planes flying in high altitudes because they would encounter radiation from solar material. Such conditions also would interfere with modern high-frequency radio communications and GPS navigation. The nation has become increasingly dependent on communications and location-based technologies, including smart phones, electronic financial transactions and power grids, so the impact would be far greater than it was in 1859, federal officials said. &quot;The whole thing about going into another active period of solar activity is: It's going to happen. We just don't know when, we don't know the severity of it, but we know it has happened,&quot; FEMA Administrator W. Craig Fugate said in June at the U.S. government's annual space weather conference, which focused on critical infrastructure protection. &quot;This isn't just a hypothetical what-if. We actually know. We have seen these events occur before, so this isn't something that we've got to go convince people that this might happen. It has happened. We're just fortunate that the frequency is not that great.&quot;<br />

In the past, solar storms have caused billions of dollars of commercial satellites to malfunction and die prematurely. A Great solar storm has the power to destroy many space assets (Space Station, Space Shuttle, LEO Satellites, GEO Satellites, Off World Missions) simultaneously. In our technology driven society, satellites play an important role in communications. The loss of satellites can affect: major news wire service feeds, network television, satellite television and cable programming, nationwide radio service, weather data, cell phone service, pagers, automated teller machines, gas station credit card handling services, airline weather tracking services, earthquake monitoring network, blackberries, GPS navigation service, and critical military &amp; airline communications. And this list grows longer every day. Current commercial satellites are light-weight, sophisticated, built at the lowest cost using off-the-shelf electronics. 3 This current low cost approach makes new satellite design more vulnerable to damage from solar storms due to less radiation hardening. A high-energy particle from an SPE can penetrate the wall of a satellite and deposit sufficient charge to cause an electrical upset to a circuit switch, false command, memory state change or loss. 1 As the nuclear particles collide within the spacecraft, they release electrons that build up an internal dielectric charge. This static charge can destroy circuitry on electronic boards. The particles can also change data and instructions stored in computer memory. Only deaths with “day, month and year” listed were used in this analysis.Impact, 2007 James A. Marusek 21 Some of the memory damage is soft causing Single Event Upset (SEU). Generally, this anomaly can be corrected by a computer reboot. But some of the damage can be hard causing unrepairable physical damage to the junction of the microcircuit. These types of failures can be fatal.<br />

What would happen if the technology our modern military depends upon were to suddenly be compromised? The military Global Positioning System (GPS) is just one technology heavily relied upon for a variety of critical US military operations. Military GPS systems are responsible for increasing weapons accuracy, and therefore decreasing the number of warheads and military personnel required to take down a target or complete a mission. The GPS system was first introduced in the 1970s for military usage exclusively. GPS has since expanded into the commercial market – just about every new vehicle is introduced with a built in GPS, and standalone GPS systems can be added to older model vehicles easily – which makes constant innovation possible, but also lowers the high standards often demanded for the testing of military technology. Today, military GPS technology is so prevalent that John Pike of Globalsecurity.org claimed it is absolutely vital to American military functions; every military moving vehicle uses GPS. At least 100 U.S. military defense systems rely on GPS: aircrafts, ships, armored vehicles, bombs and artillery shells. In addition to GPS guided weapons systems, the Army also uses GPS units as patrol and location tracking tools for military service members in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />

Last October, around Halloween, the Sun produced a solar storm that was one of the largest ever recorded, and was strong enough to raise some concerns about the safety of Earth’s satellites. According to a recent paper published in Space Weather, such concern may well be justified. If its conclusions are correct, then a solar storm the size of one that was observed in 1859 could potentially kill several weather, telecommunications, and military satellites in less than a year. Here’s where the danger lies: most satellites, at least at some point in their orbits, fly through the inner radiation belt surrounding the Earth (aka the Van Allen Belt). The inner radiation belt, like it says on the tin, comprises quite a bit of intense radiation. However, satellites are shielded from that radiation, and the intensity of the radiation in the inner belt is relatively stable. That’s because it’s in large part shielded from high-energy particles by the plasmasphere, which is a cloud of plasma that is part of the Earth’s magnetosphere. Usually, when a solar storm hits, most of the radiation either hits the outer radiation belt or the plasmaphere. When the plasmasphere gets hit, some of the plasma dissipates, making it smaller, but that dissipation prevents too much intense radiation from hitting the inner belt. During the Halloween storms, observations showed that there was significant erosion of the plasmasphere. Not enough to let significant radiation into the inner belt, but enough that the study authors wanted to take a closer look at the data. Based on observational data of solar storms, the radiation belts, and the plasmasphere during past years, the authors were able to successfully model the Halloween solar storm. They then modeled a solar storm with the intensity of the Carrington Solar Storm, which took place in 1859 and is estimated to have been about four times stronger than the Halloween storms. When the Carrington storm was modeled, the results showed that the plasmasphere was eroded to the point that much more radiation reached the inner belt than is normally the case. Moreover, the intensity produced “waves” of strong radiation continually moving through the inner belt. Based on their models, the authors suggest that the high radiation intensity of the inner belt could persist for as long as a decade. That intensity would likely swamp the radiation shielding on a typical satellite, and the authors estimate that most would be rendered inoperable within a year after the storm. The loss of satellites as a result of a solar storm would be an economic catastrophe – we rely on satellites for a large portion of our day to day lives, even when we don’t realize it. The researchers hope to continue their work modeling radiation from solar storms, with an eye towards better and more accurate predictions, as well as looking for ways to diminish the impacts of such storms. In the meantime, the authors suggest that satellite engineers incorporate the potential for intensification of the inner radiation belt in their radiation mitigation strategies. That strikes me as a good idea.<br />

(Space.com) Magnetic storms set off by the sun could pose a bigger threat than thought to weather, communication, military and other satellites close to Earth, with a potentially devastating economic impact, scientists suggest. In the new study, researchers found that solar radiation can energize a belt of high-energy particles that surrounds Earth more dramatically than previously believed. The study focused on the possible effects of a particularly strong magnetic storm on the Van Allen radiation belts, the dangerous rings of high-energy particles that girdle the Earth. The belts are split into two distinct zones. The outer belt, which is made up of electrons, reaches from about 15,800 to 31,600 miles (25,500 to 51,000 kilometers) above the surface, while the inner belt, which consists of a mix of electrons and protons, reaches from about 4,000 to 8,000 miles (6,400 to 12,800 km) above. Scientists had known the outer belt could become far more intense during geomagnetic storms caused by high-energy particles spewed by the sun, such as the storm that supercharged Earth's northern lights display Monday night (Sept. 26). However, they have long thought such storms do not affect the inner belt. Now computer simulations suggest that during a &quot;superstorm&quot; -- which has occurred in the past and is likely to recur in the future ? the electrons in the inner belt, too, could become energized. Near-Earth radiation could then remain dramatically more intense for several years afterward. &quot;The increase in radiation in the inner zone may last for up to a decade and continue damaging satellites for years after a very strong storm,&quot; study lead author Yuri Shprits, a space physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told SPACE.com. This radiation would damage satellites in that zone and potentially cut their lifetimes by five-sixths or more. [Related: Space Radiation to Rise for Astronauts, Airline Passengers] &quot;It would not destroy all satellites at once,&quot; Shprits said. &quot;However, at least according to our calculations, a very strong storm can increase the radiation dose in the inner zone by a factor of 10, and within a few years we may lose a significant portion of the satellites that traverse the inner zone.&quot; In terms of new strategies that might be needed to protect satellite systems, &quot;it's hard to say,&quot; Shprits said. &quot;First of all, we need to estimate risks and estimate cost. If cost is too high, we may want to accept the risks and start getting ready to replenish the fleet in the case of such event.&quot; &quot;There are a number of rather expensive strategies that can be used to mitigate the risk, including redundancy in electronics and increased shielding,&quot; he added. &quot;Zero risk means infinite cost.&quot; Two missions to study the radiation belts are planned for 2012, Shprits noted: NASA's Radiation Belt Storm Probe will observe radiation belts in the equatorial plane, while Moscow State University's LOMONOSOV mission, with UCLA-built instruments on board, will observe radiation belts at low altitudes. The scientists detailed their findings online in the Aug. 25 issue of the journal Space Weather.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Apart from the general approach to security it recommends, the strategy does make two specific comments worthy of note. The first is a reminder that “cyberspace” is an official military &quot;domain&quot; (though not in the networking sense). Cyberspace therefore sits right beside air, land, maritime, and space domains, making it the military's fifth official operating environment. </span>As for threats from hackers and foreign governments, those of course are many—the DOD says that its networks are “probed millions of times every day, and successful penetrations have led to the loss of thousands of files from US networks and those of US allies and industry partners.” But the “most pervasive” threat isn't a hack attack that might somehow launch nuclear missiles and start a war<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (as in the old <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Wargames</span></em> movie</span>); it's intellectual property. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In this case, the military isn't talking about Hollywood films, but about espionage. “</span>Every year, an amount of intellectual property larger than that contained in the Library of Congress is stolen from networks maintained by US businesses, universities, and government departments and agencies,<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> says the strategy. “As military strength ultimately depends on economic vitality, sustained intellectual property losses erode both US military effectiveness and national competitiveness in the global economy.”</span><br />

Although offense is the dominant form of war in space today, this will not always be the case. Defense is possible. Three principles will likely guide the development of future space defenses.<br />
First, <em>if you can't see it, you can't hit it</em>. Satellites are already getting smaller—too small for most space surveillance networks to detect and track. This trend will likely continue not only as a matter of cost savings, but also as a matter of stealthy defense. Avoiding detection includes maneuvering satellites to undisclosed wartime orbits.<br />
Second, <em>all warfare is based on deception</em>.34 Potential adversaries collect intelligence on each other's space systems and make their estimates based on their intelligence assessments. Action must be taken to deceive potential adversaries into underestimating the value of critical systems and overestimating the value of inconsequential systems. In addition, the use of wartime-only modes of operation, frequencies, and other unanticipated behaviors will further complicate an adversary's problems.<br />
Third, <em>there is strength in numbers</em>. <em>The age of the capital satellites is over</em>. Employing only one or two large, very expensive satellites to fulfill a critical mission area, such as reconnaissance, is foolish. Future space systems must be large constellations of smaller, cheaper, and, in many cases, lower-fidelity systems swarming in various orbits that exploit ground processing to derive high-fidelity solutions. In addition, swarms improve global access and presence.<br />

 <strong>Lack of knowledge about the PLA, internal docs and new dual use capabilities mean we have to assume the worst- even the CCP indicates intent to weaponize space</strong><br />

Military space missions Little is known about the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) actual capability to wage war in space. What has been demonstrated, however, including the 2007 ASAT<span style="color: green;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/2" rel="nofollow">test</a></span>and reports of China blinding US intelligence satellites, has caused much consternation across the world. One aspect of Chinese military aspirations in space that has been studied is the internal publications of the PLA and its stated views on space doctrine. Increasingly, these writings have accepted the inevitability of the weaponization of space and called for appropriate preparations to be made to successfully wage war in space. Given the dual-use nature of most space technology, it is no surprise that China’s military uses of space are advancing commensurately with its civilian and commercial programs. First of all, China is widely known to have an array of intelligence satellites for space reconnaissance and surveillance. The Ziyuan Earth observation satellite is known to be one of these, but China has also fielded the Fanhui Shi Weixing, or Retrievable Satellite, which drops canisters of film from space.15 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">China’s ongoing microsatellite program has sparked some of the most concern abroad. Aside from intelligence satellites, microsatellites have many potential offensive uses such as maneuvering in range of an adversary’s satellite and either latching on—a “parasitic microsat”—to disrupt proper functions, or merely exploding within range of a target satellite to destroy it. Furthermore, the ability to deploy a constellation of microsatellites on short notice, a capability China may already possess with its Kaituozhe launch<span style="color: green;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/2" rel="nofollow">vehicle</a></span>, denies the deterrence factor that could otherwise prevent offensive attacks on an adversary’s space assets for fear of retaliation.</span> China’s rocket technology also has proven offensive military use in space: the ability to shoot down enemy assets in space through direct ascent attacks. China demonstrated such ability in 2007, which has been the impetus for much of the recent speculation about China’s military space aspirations. Despite political blowback from this test (it resulted in a 20 percent increase in the total amount of trackable space debris in low Earth orbit), China may still be pursuing ASAT technologies.16In January 2010 China conducted a successful test of its ground-based midcourse missile interception technology. This test used technology similar to its 2007 ASAT test and, as exemplified by the US Navy-led Operation Burnt Frost that intercepted the satellite USA 193, missile defense technology can serve ASAT ends. In addition to these hard-kill capabilities, China has the capability to use soft-kill measures to neutralize adversary’s space assets. China is known to have the means to jam satellite communication and GPS receivers and is developing directed energy ASATs, including high-powered microwave and particle beam weapons.17The US Department of Defense (DoD), in their annual report to Congress on China’s military modernization, also notes that China is developing ground-based laser ASATs, the beginnings of which may have already been demonstrated. In 2006 the director of the National Reconnaissance Office, Donald Kerr, substantiated reports that China used a ground-based laser to dazzle a US spy satellite over its territory. Although this laser could not do any long-term damage, similar techniques and capabilities used to track and dazzle this satellite could be coupled with more powerful ground-based lasers to destroy space assets. Some reports actually indicate China has already tested and deployed a ground-based ASAT laser that can target assets in LEO.18 Despite the array of activity the PLA conducts in and through space, they seem to lack a specific doctrine for the employment of their space capabilities and have not made public any substantial plans for military uses of space. In lieu of a formal declaration on space, there is a growing literature from <strong>within</strong> the PLA ranks that may be forming the basis for what later becomes stated—or unstated—PLA space doctrine. These authors generally hold the same assumptions about space, including the inevitability that space will be a domain of war in the future.19Many also acknowledge that establishing space dominance will be crucial to fully exploiting wartime necessities such as control of airspace and secure command and control.20 Three internal Chinese sources are largely cited <strong>as being the defining PLA space doctrine writings</strong>:<em>Space War</em>by Colonel Li Daguang;<em>On Space Operations</em>by Colonel Jia Junming; and<em>Joint Space War Campaigns</em>by Colonel Yuan Zelu.21Colonel Li highlights many specific recommendations to develop the PLA’s space fighting capabilities, including fielding offensive capabilities capable of “destroying or temporarily incapacitating all enemy space vehicles that fly in space above our sovereign territory.” Other recommendations include focusing development on land-based anti-satellite weapons and anti-satellite satellites as well as “assassin’s mace” space weapons that could deal a crippling blow to an enemy. Particularly important to foreign perceptions of China, these writings also call for China to combine military and civilian technology and integrate peacetime and wartime facilities. Other authors on the subject promote such actions as: fielding sea-launched anti-satellite weapons, attacking GPS with high energy laser weapons, fielding stealthy space satellites and weapons, and seeking the ability to attack terrestrial targets from space. Kevin Pollpeter, summing up the view of most Chinese authors writing on the subject, writes, “<strong>The development of space technology will inevitably lead to the militarization of space and space militarization will lead to confrontation in space</strong>. As the struggle over air and space control is becoming the new focal point of war, space will become the main battlefield of future wars.”22Pollpeter also notes that throughout his extensive review of Chinese space writings, there were no rebuttals to the view that China will inevitability develop and use counterspace weapons. These views also seem to be held by some in the upper echelons of the PLA. In November 2009, PLA Air Force (PLAAF) commander Xu Qiliang stated in an interview with the PLA Daily newspaper, an official government publication, that the militarization of space is a “historical inevitability” and called on the PLAAF to develop offensive and defensive capabilities in space.23Xu is not only the head of the PLAAF, but as of 2007 was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (CCCP) and a member of the Central Military Commission (CMC)—two primary policy decision making bodies in China. The Foreign Ministry tried to backtrack on Xu’s comments days later by reiterating that China has “all along upheld the peaceful use of outer space,” and would not be part of a space arms race.24However, Xu did not personally retract his statements and, given his elite government position, this interview could actually be exemplary of how some of China’s top official’s views space. Indeed, there is some indication the CCCP acknowledges the need to prepare for the weaponization of space. In December 2010, the official publication of the CCCP, the Qiushi Journal, on its website released an article that spoke to China’s perspectives on space war: China's missiles can directly attack the military satellites, which usually orbit at an altitude less than 10,000 kilometers...China should make efforts to develop space weapons as soon as possible, as this is the most effective military means of attacking the U.S. If we can eventually fire missiles from a satellite, the U.S. will find that it has nowhere to hide; it will find itself entirely exposed to the attack radius of Chinese weaponry…Vigorously strengthening the building of our space military forces should be not only the focus of our national defense, but also the most powerful weapon to deter U.S. military blackmail.25 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">After the article was translated into English, the original Chinese version was altered to state that the views were those of the authors only. In a society well versed in controlling media and hiding military intentions,</span> it is interesting the Chinese government is allowing these and other perspectives to be published containing such inflammatory language on space warfare. This suggests that perhaps the views are not condemned or are being floated as trial balloons to gauge foreign response.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Department of Defense defined ORS as “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of Joint Force Commanders needs”61 but the concept has its naysayers. </span>Future funding and senior leadership support will demonstrate the necessity of implementing the ORS concept. The President’s Fiscal Year 2010 budget request significantly diminished the ORS budget<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The $112.9 million request would </span>reduce the FY 2009’s appropriations by $83.7 million<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (42.5%). HASC added $23.4 million to the ORS budget to fund remaining development and launch costs of the ORS-1 satellite. The Fiscal Year 2011 budget is still in work, however the FY11 Air Force Posture Statement stated a request of $94 million, almost 9% of the total space-related budget, for the ORS program. These on-demand space vehicles will only augment or temporarily replace large satellite systems, so they will most likely not have all the capabilities of the more complex spacecraft but they should have enough survivability and operational mission requirements to serve as temporary solutions</span>. The ORS concept is sound and funded, but to be effective it must be delivered to the user efficiently on-time and on-budget.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This innovative way of doing business in space starts with a revolutionary alteration in the current military space</span><br />

Forecast International projects that the worldwide military satellite market will be worth $42.5 billion, based on production of 180 military satellites, from 2011-2020. Thirty-five satellite programs are covered in the company's &quot;The Market for Military Satellites&quot; study, which notes that these orbiting systems play a significant role in modern military operations, particularly in the U.S., which relies heavily on communications and reconnaissance to achieve its goals on the battlefield. &quot;With the increased focus on battlefield networking, communications satellite capacity is critical,&quot; said William Ostrove, aerospace systems analyst and author of the report. Satellites are also used for navigation and weather forecasting. The analysis addresses some of the difficulties facing the market as a result of tight government budgets worldwide. &quot;Governments are faced with large debt, and are reducing spending plans in response,&quot; said Ostrove. With respect to military satellites, budget cuts will be felt the most in the U.S., where satellite manufacturers have long enjoyed lucrative development and production contracts.According to the study, the tougher budget environment is prompting the U.S. to focus on production of already-developed satellites, rather than on development of revolutionary new technology. The U.S. Department of Defense will also place more emphasis on smaller, inexpensive satellites under a concept known as Operationally Responsive Space (ORS).<br />
<br />
ORS is inevitable – other space powers will do it if the US doesn’t<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Wertz, 8 </span>- president of Microcosm, a space technology small business in Los Angeles, and the general chairman for the first five Responsive Space Conferences (James, “It’s time to get our ORS in gear,” The Space Review, 1/7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1032/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1032/1</a>)<br />
<br />
Can the US overcome bureaucratic impediments in order to make it happen?<br />
Here we would have to say that no one knows. It may or may not occur for all of the reasons that Dwayne Day has clearly pointed out. The need for ORS has been formalized for some years in the <em>Operationally Responsive Spacelift Mission Need Statement</em> (ORS MNS) of December 20, 2001. But that does not mean that it will actually come about. There are a variety of entrenched interests and organizational sandboxes arrayed against ORS, or trying to reshape it in their own image. This is, of course, the same process that has brought us $32 billion in cost overruns in the ten largest DoD space programs according to a 2007 <em>Aviation Week</em> article. We would have to conclude that the odds of success are slim, but not zero. In many past technology developments, it has been Congress that has made things happen. That may or may not occur here.<br />
One thing seems clear: if ORS doesn’t happen in the US, it will certainly happen elsewhere. According to a DoD 2007 assessment, the Chinese have already announced a near-term goal of launching satellites within hours of demand. The Russians have been able to do so for years. The Europeans are well ahead of the US in a formalized process for creating low-cost space missions. The rest of the world will move ahead with the capability to respond rapidly to changing world events, irrespective of whether the US chooses to do so.<br />

<strong>The advantage is deterrence</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Current satellites are vulnerable- wrecks deterrence and invites space attack</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Rendleman, 10</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> - </span>Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The 11 January 2007 test of a Chinese ground-based, direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) kinetic-kill interceptor against one of their own defunct weather satellites generated considerable angst across the United States space community. </span>The 2007 test demonstrated that the importance of space capabilities is also their Achilles heel, that is, their deadly weakness in spite of overall strength; it is far too easy to neutralize space systems and their power<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. In the broad strategic context, </span>space capabilities have their own set of unique, inherent vulnerabilities<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, which are largely the result of orbital mechanics. </span>This invites destruction, damage, and even just mischief delivered by even the least significant adversary<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. However, other nations may seek to deny U.S. advantages in space through a variety of negation and prevention actions.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Negation Threats</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Satellite systems consist not only of spacecraft, each with their own payload and bus, but also a supporting infrastructure—ground control stations, tracking and control links, commonly referred to as the tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&amp;C) links, data links, launch facilities, and an industrial base. Each of these components is at risk to threats of physical and cyber attack, and sabotage, and can be negated, simultaneously or each in detail. The satellite payload, bus, links, and infrastructure can be negated by using a variety of permanent or reversible means to achieve one of the five possible effects, known as the ‘‘five Ds’’—deception, disruption, denial, degradation, and destruction.5</span><br />
Space-based threats proliferate as a result of the ever-growing global availability of technology and access to the space domain. There are huge incentives for states to invest in and use space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, and the spread of space technologies has occurred. States with sufficient resources can now reach out to space and ‘‘touch’’ satellites through a variety of means, and achieve one and even more of the five Ds. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Spacecraft are vulnerable to direct ascent weapons as demonstrated by the Chinese ASAT test, and to a variety of other groundbased, airborne, and space-based ASAT technologies. Direct-ascent launched, or orbit-based nuclear devices, can be detonated, generating radiation and other lethal effects to destroy unshielded electronics over a wide lethal range. Co-orbital ASATs could be employed, comparable to the old Soviet system that was tested extensively in the 1970s and early 80s. In a less likely scenario, space-borne mines can also be deployed in close proximity to spacecraft, or exploded to generate debris clouds that destructively engage whole classes of satellites in the same orbital plane or in crossing orbits. Ground, space-based, or airborne lasers could be used by adversaries to wreak havoc. Blinding operations could be executed and inflict effects ranging from temporary ‘‘dazzling’’ to permanent burnout of optical or other sensors with intense energy bursts.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Ground systems, supporting communications, and their nodes, are vulnerable to diverse land, sea, or air kinetic attacks, including sabotage. Unprotected systems are also susceptible to electronic attack through jamming and electromagnetic deception techniques. Jammers emit signals that mask or prevent reception of desired signals; these methods can disrupt uplinks, downlinks, and even cross-links. By disabling the means of command and control, and data communications, jammers render satellites inoperable or unavailable. Electromagnetic deception techniques can be employed to confuse systems; this could include sending false, but deceptively plausible, commands that cause spacecraft to perform damaging or wasteful maneuvers, modify databases or execute configuration changes, or otherwise destroy it.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Similarly, supporting terrestrial ground stations, computer networks, and links are vulnerable to information operation and cyber attacks. These attacks could involve directing global denial of service tasks, injecting fake commands, malicious software and viruses into the space system, performing unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of sensitive information (data interception), and causing unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of network information, services, and databases.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">In sum, there is a wide span of kinetic and other types of attacks an adversary could consider and employ. There is potential that even non-state actors can access some of these technologies and space systems, and achieve several of the five Ds; however, it is unlikely they can obtain and then employ a full-spectrum of these means and achieve all of these effects. Conducting an attack within the space domain involves a rather substantial investment to develop, acquire, operate, and sustain needed shooter, sensor, and command and control systems. Given the scope and commitment needed to affect such a move, an on-orbit attack would probably be made only in the context of a larger strategic struggle, perhaps as a prelude to or part of early combat operations. On the other hand, inexpensive jamming technology is available to even the poorest potential adversaries. As such, jamming poses the most used and growing threat to space systems. Some argue that jamming also carries with it implicit political and legal sanctions since no major space power has moved to ban or make even temporary and reversible jamming illegal. This may change now that a number of nations have banned together to object to recent Iranian satellite jamming.6 Cyber adversaries and criminals are also beginning to hone their craft. They present an evolving threat to space systems; and like jamming, cyber threats can be developed and deployed for only modest investments.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention Threats</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention actions generally involve economic, political, informational, and diplomatic instruments of national power. For example, an extremely large creditor nation could employ its considerable economic clout and leverage in an attempt to compel or blackmail the United States to not license or permit imaging of its territory, preventing its use, and reducing its exposure to such observation. The creditor nation could seek to accomplish its objective by destabilizing the world market place. It could refuse to purchase treasury offerings that underpin the burgeoning U.S. fiscal and trade deficits, perhaps arguing that remote sensing, especially commercial remote sensing, of its territory infringes on its territorial and sovereign rights, or that it constitutes ‘‘unlawful’’ industrial espionage, and is thus, an unfair trade practice.7 Commercial remote sensing systems are nowan important resource for the United States Government and its national security needs. U.S. Government orders help sustain and stabilize the remote sensing industry,8 and any limitations on activities, whether for U.S. Government customers or commercial ones, imposed in response to external economic threats could evolve to cause problems. In an alternative scenario, a state, acting through political allies and proxies, could exert considerable influence and dominance to affect a change in U.S. law. This change could restrict licensing of commercial remote sensing imagery, restricting the market place and impacting business models for producers.9</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">As a diplomatic prevention example, adversaries could attempt to use international forums and treaties to deny frequency rights needed by U.S. military or intelligence satellites by making spurious ‘‘paper satellite’’ filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). ‘‘Paper satellites’’ involve ITU applications for satellite orbital slots, many for ‘‘speculative’’ systems that will never leave Earth. These filings can block access to scarce spectrum and orbital resources.10 The ability to place communications and other satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) positions could be held at risk. Some characterize some of these types of actions as a form of ‘‘lawfare.’’ ‘‘The term lawfare describes the growing use of international law claims, usually factually or legally meritless, as a tool of war. The goal is to gain a moral advantage over your enemy in the court of world opinion, and potentially a legal advantage in national and international tribunals.’’11</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention actions taken to hobble U.S. space systems are not armed attacks. As is discussed later, the use of force is only authorized under the United Nations (UN) Charter in response to an armed attack, or upon authorization of the UN Security Council. As such, using armed force to deter and defeat prevention actions involving political or diplomatic subterfuge or intrigue may be unlawful under international law. Creative alternative solutions must therefore be found to assure access to space when facing these types of threats.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Implications for U.S. Space Strategy</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">The wide span of threats poses profound implications</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> for U.S. space strategy and its execution. First, unlike the Cold War era, </span>the U<span style="font-size: 5pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">tates </span>now confronts a wide array of global actors, all operating with different motivations and incentives, some of which could become potential adversaries who can attack or threaten space capabilities<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. These state and non-state adversaries exhibit a wide array of political, economic, technical, and social differences. </span>Having many potential adversaries makes each of them harder to understand. This complicates efforts to understand motivations and to influence perceptions for deterrence purposes<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>These differences, in turn, increase the likelihood of misperception, undercutting strategies to protect access to space capabilities. When one’s attention is divided, deterrent measures that are appropriate for one target may not be useful, or even counterproductive, for another<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. This requires tailored intelligence efforts, information operations, and transparency efforts in order to avoid or minimize disputes and prevent problems.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Second, the broad array of adversaries exhibit widely varying risk-taking behaviors. Risk-taking behavior can strongly influence an adversary’s perception of a situation. Understanding this phenomenon can lead to better ways of influencing those perceptions. Unfortunately, </span>potential adversaries may not care that space systems offer tremendous value and capabilities to all nations, or care whether conflict in space could create space debris that could cost all nations access to the domain. <span style="font-size: 5pt;">A strategy to assure continuing access to space assets must therefore be sufficiently flexible to address both risk-averse and risk-taking adversaries. Indeed, potential adversaries may shift from risk-taking to risk-adverse over a relatively short period of time. China may fit in this category. Within a decade or two, it will have its own extensive space-based communications, navigation, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellite constellations, all of which will be integrated into its military operations. No doubt, China will embrace that evolution and become very reliant on space capabilities; this will shift it from an asymmetric competitor to one similar to the United States or Russia. Third, with the demise of the Soviet Union, some political commentators and critics described the United States as a ‘‘hyperpower’’ not just a ‘‘superpower.’’ 12 Though buffeted by recent events involving Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and the 2008 global financial meltdown, U.S. military supremacy continues. But, that </span>supremacy does not make or guarantee a successful space strategy.Adversaries may believe they have a higher stake than the United States in the outcome of a particular crisis or conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>Alternatively, the United States stake in the crisis may not be commensurate with the possible cost of involvement by the United States military and the rest of its national security apparatus. The first alternative may encourage mischief by adversaries; the second discourages U.S. action. As a result, adversaries may find threats of U.S. action in response to hostile acts affecting U.S. access to space systems to be non-credible<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Fourth, </span>while the United States has produced superlative space capabilities, it has not produced enough systems ready to survive the new kinetic, exotic, jamming, and cyber threat environment<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. The vulnerability exists because the spacecraft developed and deployed today are in many ways the same as those originally fielded during the Cold War. During that epic struggle, there was a tacit and then explicit understanding that each superpower would not attack and overwhelm the other’s space systems, except in the direst of circumstances, perhaps during the throes of a nuclear conflagration. Indeed, a number of agreements between the superpowers adopted the understanding and ruled out interference with national technical means, including space assets. </span>This belief in the superiority of space systems and power blinds the United States to the inherent strategic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in these systems. This, predictably, can now be exploited by potential adversaries, such as China, who, with their recent ASAT test, appear more willing to fully explore the technologies needed to expand the limits of conventional war to include the space domain<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Consequently, by historically and diplomatically reducing the threat, engineering of some satellite threat detection, attack avoidance, and other defense subsystems have not matured enough so that they are sophisticated, nimble, and robust enough to counter new 21st Century adversary attack capabilities.</span><br />

<br />
<strong>Deterrence by punishment fails because we lack defenses and states could act through terrorist proxies</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Rendleman, 10</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> - </span>Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The strategy to deter nuclear attack worked throughout the Cold War; the Soviet Union was powerful, but it was also a rational adversary. For this reason, the United States worked hard to understand the culture, goals, incentives, and ideals of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was also open to, and reciprocated, U.S. diplomatic engagement overtures. </span>The United States has gained great advantage through development and integration of space capabilities. This has forced potential adversaries to evolve techniques to neutralize this superiority<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Attacks on U.S. space systems can be performed through terrorist proxies, third parties, or covert acts that offer perpetrators plausible deniability for damage inflicted<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The United States now confronts a diverse set of adversaries, and their rogue leaders are arguably much more risk prone, or perhaps<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, just oxymoronic, </span>acting deliberately reckless. These adversaries know full well the importance of space capabilities to U.S. diplomatic, military, and economic success. They see that attacking and disrupting space capabilities presents a significant opportunity to deny U.S. national objectives, to retain or expand their own relative power, and to compensate for their own lack of conventional strength<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
Deterrence has failed throughout history ‘‘because the object of deterring measures fails to notice them, does not find the measures credible, or is pursuing an agenda sufficiently important enough to its interests that it is prepared to ignore the deterrence attempt<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.’’30 </span>Given this, the United States cannot depend solely on deterrence to secure itself. It must prepare for the possibility that its measures could fail. Therefore, defenses should also be deployed<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; though the extent of these should be measured and balanced against their utility, and measured by projected costs, lost opportunity costs, likely effectiveness, and effects obtained in the end.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Deterrence and defense tasks are inexorably linked to each other. As noted by Robert Butterworth, ‘‘Defenses offer protection, while deterrence threatens punishment. </span>Defenses can succeed whether the enemy believes in them or not<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.’’31 There are a number of active and passive defensive capabilities that can be developed and deployed to protect space systems, particularly against kinetic-kill ASATs and jammers.</span><br />

<strong>China has the incentive to attack our assets- doctrine, spending and assets prove it escalates</strong><br />
<strong>Wortzel, 8</strong> - Colonel, United States Army (Retired) (Larry, Astropolitics, 6:112–137, “THE CHINESE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY<br />
AND SPACE WARFARE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
The PLA is exploring in theoretical research, basic research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.77 </span>These include<span style="font-size: 5pt;">:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>satellite jamming technology;<br />
. collisions between space bodies;<br />
. kinetic energy weapons;<br />
. space-to-ground attack weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;</span><br />
. space planes<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> that can transit and fight ‘‘up or down’’ in the upper atmosphere or space;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>high-power laser weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>high-power microwave weapon systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>particle-beam weapons; and<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>electromagnetic pulse<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.78</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies. The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not, </span>it is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the blinding of a U.S. satellite mean they are achieving some success.<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 </span>The Chinese see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they would probably use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.81</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. </span>As the PLA modernizes its<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (</span>C4SIR) systems, it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, </span>an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons or a deeper crisis<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">For example, </span>four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, in Wuhan, </span>have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.82 In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88</span><br />
The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>One possible reaction by the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike against China’s strategic missile forces<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Space Deterrence</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Conclusions</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First, </span>in the event of conflict with the PLA, military operations carried out across all the domains of war, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, are likely. Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions. </span>There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;97 </span>the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. </span>The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance. </span>No such dialogue has taken place with China. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures.</span><br />
Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. To this end, the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. </span>As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, </span>and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>The risk of crisis instability and miscalc is high – the PLA is isolated from the Chinese government</strong><br />
<strong>MacDonald, 11</strong> - Senior Director, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program, U.S. Institute of Peace (Bruce, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA”, 5/11, lexis)<br />
<br />
One characteristic of too many wars in the last century is that they are the result of miscalculation that ignites the tinder of fundamental geopolitical tensions. Averting major power conflict requires skillful management of tensions by senior leaders of the major powers<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. China has become much more internationally sophisticated, though with important exceptions, in its dealings with the rest of the world than has been true in the past, and this is reflected in its civilian leadership. Unfortunately, </span>the PLA's senior officer corps<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> trails its civilian counterparts in this respect. They have much less interaction with foreign official and travel abroad much less frequently than their U.S. counterparts. This means that the PLA overall </span>views world events from a less knowledgeable and sophisticated perspective, a danger in this increasingly complex world, and could explain, for example, the political &quot;tonedeafness&quot; of the PLA in the manner they conducted their 2007 ASAT test.<br />
<br />
This PLA problem becomes more serious when one realizes that the PLA is organizationally separate from the rest of the Chinese government, and reports only to the Central Military Commission,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> currently chaired by President Hu Jintao. President Hu, and his likely successors, have no significant military background, and the majority of the CMC's members are top PLA officers, suggesting that civilian oversight of major military decisions and consideration of their larger implications are not as carefully reviewed as in the U.S. government. Normally this would not be too great a concern, but </span>in a crisis this could be dangerous. Add to this the fact that China has no equivalent of our National Security Council, a critically important body for coordinating our security decisionmaking, and one comes away concerned about the relative insularity of the PLA in the Chinese power structure<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
In a crisis, the PLA probably cannot be counted on to show as sophisticated a sense of judgment as one would hope any country's military leaders, even an enemy's, to show. All these problems and many more pose potential threats to internal political stability andCommunist Party control, providing ample opportunity for crisis and conflict in the years ahead<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overview of The Strategic Landscape of Space</span><br />
<br />
Space assets<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and the communications and cyber links that enable them to function, </span>are the means by which essential national security information is either generated, transmitted, or both. This information is the lifeblood of U.S. conventional military superiority and plays a key role in U.S. strategic nuclear posture as well<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As such, </span>these space related assets represent extraordinarily appealing targets in any future conflict, and their relative vulnerability can provide dangerously attractive incentives in a crisis to preempt, escalating to war<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Resisting this temptation to attack may be morally virtuous but could be strategically unwise: </span>going first in a space conflict with a nearpeer space adversary appears to offer many advantages, while absorbing such a strike, with all its attendant destruction of military capabilities, and then responding to the attack against an opponent fully expecting such a response, appears to be militarily and strategically quite undesirable.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As technology advances, the ways of interfering with, disrupting, or destroying information streams in space or supporting space systems will likely increase, as will U.S. and others' dependence upon such systems. Providing defensive options for U.S. space assets should be pursued where appropriate, but most space observers believe that offense has the advantage in space over defense, as General Cartwright observed last May. Cartwright also noted that the challenging issues that space poses has made the Space Posture Review &quot;the most difficult of all the defense reviews&quot; the Obama Administration has undertaken.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The overall U.S. goal in space should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States and its allies, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. and allied security. </span>The United States has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This need not mean that China and others must perforce be disadvantaged by such an arrangement - there should be ample opportunity for many countries to benefit and prosper from a properly crafted system of space management.</span><br />
<br />
There is an inherent risk of strategic instability when relatively modest defense efforts create disproportionate danger to an adversary, as with<br />
space offense. And there is a serious risk of crisis instability in space when &quot;going first&quot; pays off<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> - destroying an adversary's satellites before he destroys yours. We don't know what would happen in a crisis, but </span>the potential for space instability seems high and likely to grow.<br />
<br />
<strong>Causes miscalc</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Burke, 6</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> – </span>Lt Col, USAF, command space professional with operational experience in missile operations, space surveillance, space control, missile warning, and command and control (Alan, “SPACE THREAT WARNING: FOUNDATION FOR SPACE SUPERIORITY, AVOIDING A SPACE PEARL HARBOR,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www.afresearch.org/skins/RIMS/display.aspx?moduleid=be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153&amp;mode=user&amp;action=researchproject&amp;objectid=07acf878-3a5f-4a2c-8259-4a34c0717e9b" rel="nofollow">https://www.afresearch.org/skins/RIMS/display.aspx?moduleid=be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153&amp;mode=user&amp;action=researchproject&amp;objectid=07acf878-3a5f-4a2c-8259-4a34c0717e9b</a>)<br />
<br />
The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites<span style="font-size: 9pt;">, facilities or services; </span>the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets<strong>.</strong><br />
One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> on the US homeland or an attack </span>that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, </span>other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US<span style="font-size: 9pt;">.44</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">Although a major attack on the US is not likely, </span>the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculationthat the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span>The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, </span>the Chinese might seek to disrupt or destroy regional space capabilities as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a <em>fait accompli</em><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.45</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “</span>Space capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> are no longer nice to have, but </span>are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.”51 </span>The failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets.<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, </span>successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. </span>A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>Satellite communication links to worldwide deployed forces are critical capabilities in protecting US security, sovereignty, and military combat capability.<br />
The inability to detect and assess space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems or conduct probing attacks on US space systems<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Today, </span>other nations are working to developnew weapons to counter US dominance and to take the lead in<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—</span>informationwar<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The current </span>coverage gaps in our space surveillance network<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset </span>makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons <span style="font-size: 6pt;">without our knowledge.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Finally, </span>without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> to counter an attack against US space assets</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is </span>to deter an attack on US space assets<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. </span>A senior officer in US Strat<span style="font-size: 6pt;">egic </span>Com<span style="font-size: 6pt;">mand recently </span>stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.57 </span><br />

<strong>Prevents rogue states from destroying space assets</strong><br />
<strong>Smith, 11</strong> – USAF Colonel, Director of the Air Force Space and Cyber Center at Air University. He served in the Pentagon’s National Security Space Office as the Chief of the Future Concepts shop (M.V., Toward a Theory of Space Power: Selected Essays, February, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Spacefaring prowess is a common attribute of the dominant powers in the world today. Special attention must be paid to so-called rogue states that have access to space-related technology and may even be spacefaring but do not have the conventional forces to achieve their policy aims. Those aims tend to be very intense, and these players may seek space weapons as an asymmetric hedge against spacefaring adversaries who may try to coerce them.<br />
The dominant military powers in the world, some of whom are potential adversaries, also tend to be the dominant spacefaring states. Because of the economic benefits and exponential enhancements that spacepower delivers to terrestrial warfighting, those states are under increasing pressure to defend their space systems and to counter those of their potential adversaries. This may lead to a space weapons race and an immediate escalation of hostilities to &quot;wipe the skies&quot; of enemy satellites should war break out between two or more dominant military space powers.29<br />
When assessing the interplay between the spectrum of conflict and the spectrum of belligerents, it may be the case that war between two weak actors will not likely extend into space. However, if the power is perceived to be disparate, a weak actor is far more likely to use space weapons against a powerful state as an asymmetric defensive move.30 A powerful state may counter the space systems in use by a weaker adversary, but it is likely to do so by placing diplomatic pressure on commercial vendors, or executing attacks on their ground stations, or launching highly selective covert attacks on the satellites they use by employing temporary and reversible means.<br />
Should two dominant spacefaring powers go directly to war with each other with intense motives, both will find it critical to preserve their space systems and will consider it a dangerous liability to allow their enemy to exploit theirs. Given the ability of spacepower to cut the fog and friction of war while connecting military forces at the tactical, operational, and strategic level, it is likely that space systems will be primary targets that will be negated in the opening moves of war. The fight for space is likely to be intense and brief. Temporary means of negation will likely switch to permanent methods of destruction to remove doubt in the minds of commanders.<br />

<strong>Loss of space assets will annihilate US hegemony</strong><br />
Marshall, 8 - NASA Ames Research Center (Will, Astropolitics, 6:154–199, “REDUCING THE VULNERABILITY OF SPACE ASSETS: A<br />
MULTITIERED MICROSATELLITE CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
Space assets are one of the most critical ‘‘Achilles’ heels’’ of the current military capability of the United States (U.S.). This is for two reasons: (1) the U.S. military space systems—in particular reconnaissance, navigation, signals intelligence, early warning, and communications systems—are critical to modern military warfare and intelligence; and (2) space systems are inherently vulnerable to attack. This combination is understood at the highest levels and was espoused in the ‘‘Rumsfeld Space Commission’’ with talk of a ‘‘Space Pearl Harbor.’’1 Whether one agrees with the tone, this is a genuine security problem for the U.S. in need of a near-term solution. While there have been numerous papers, and much media and academic attention, in the space security discussion focused on promoting or criticizing space-based weapons,2 there have been far fewer papers and studies offering constructive ways forward that deal with these genuine security concerns in a broader sense.3<br />
The central motivation for this paper is to put forward one key element—the satellite architecture—in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. space assets. It is hoped that this idea, together with others like it, should stimulate and contribute to a debate on more constructive ways forward for how to achieve space security in the post-Cold war world.<br />
Importance of Space Assets<br />
For better or worse, it is clear that the U.S. military is to some significant extent dependent on its key satellites, which number about 86–105 operational satellites at present. These satellites constitute a significant part of the eyes, ears, and central nervous system of the modern military.4 A practical example that helps to illustrate this is the case of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. First, the decision to go was based in part on satellite imagery and signals intelligence from satellites; whether or not it was interpreted or used correctly is a separate issue. Second, the planning and operation were facilitated by satellite imagery. Third, many planes, ships, tanks, and units’ positions were known through Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and even most munitions were guided by GPS. Fourth, the operation was commanded from the U.S. in large part through the use of communications satellites. Perhaps more importantly than any of the functions in the Iraq example, early warning (EW) satellites are the U.S.’s and Russia’s first warning of nuclear missile attack. As Gray classified, space assets have moved from being ‘‘useful and important’’ to an ‘‘indispensable adjunct’’ in the military over the last decade.5<br />
Space assets are definitely used a great deal by the U.S. military, but that does not mean necessarily as strong a dependence as Gray implies. The loss of U.S. space assets could range in its effect anywhere from a loss to the U.S. military in practical operations, to being catastrophic to U.S. security. The former would entail a reduction in operational effectiveness or speed, but fundamentally supposes that back-up systems and/or redundancy allow a near continuation of military capability. The latter scenario would entail an effective disablement of the U.S. military capability from normal operations. In reality, the significance lies between these boundaries, but this is a topic that could benefit from further research.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Hegemony solves multiple scenarios for extinction- any alternative is worse</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Kagan 7</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">[Robert, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund, “End of Dreams, Return of History”, Hoover Institution - Stanford U, in Policy Review, No 144, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/8552512.html#n10" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/8552512.html#n10</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as “No. 1” and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying — its regional as well as its global predominance. </span>Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;"> destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic.It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. </span>Nations would compete<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;"> for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe ’s stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that ’s not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of </span>power in the world since World War II, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;"> which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world ’s great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. </span>War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;"> true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China ’s neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene — even if it remained the world’s most powerful nation — could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe — if it adopted what some call a strategy of “offshore balancing” — this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, “offshore” role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more “even-handed” policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel ’s aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn ’t change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. </span>The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran.<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;"> The world hasn ’t changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to “normal” or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.</span><br />

<strong>Commitment to ORS is vital to deterrence by denial – it will prevent attacks against US space assets</strong><br />
<strong>Sejba, 10</strong> - USAF Congressional Budget Liaison Officer Budget and Appropriations Liaison Directorate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget Secretary of the Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC (Timothy, “ Deterrence for Space: Is Operationally Responsive Space Part of the Solution?”, High Frontier, May, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
The space domain,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> often referred to as “The High Frontier,” </span>no longer is a sanctuary outside the reach of foreign intervention. The threat to space systems and their capabilities is broad, ranging from reversible effects such as jamming or blinding, to more destructive means such as anti-satellite weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is now time to take actions for the </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">sake of space</span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and assure its continued contributions across the full spectrum of military operations. </span>Given the criticality of space to not only our military power, but also our economic power, it is time we develop policies and field capabilities to deter future adversaries from attempting to degrade, deny, or destroy space capabilities and services<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The asymmetric advantages enabled by space can no longer be assumed and as a result, a new National Security Strategy for space must be forged, one that combines deterrence with basic protection capabilities never before afforded our space systems. Yet, space deterrence is not an “all in” strategy, nor can it reduce the risk of attack to zero.1 </span>Should aspects of deterrence fail, we must take steps to defend and protect our space systems and the critical global services they provide<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Operationally responsive space (ORS) by definition is “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of joint force commanders’ needs.”2 Dissected further, one key word stands out: </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">assured </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">… being sufficiently robust, timely, agile, adaptive, and resilient, to achieve desired outcomes with a high degree of certainty.3 So </span>while ORS intends to provide operational and tactical support to the joint warfighter, its true value will be the assurance it provides as a credible strategic <em>deterrent</em> against space attacks.<br />
As a deterrent, ORS provides access to existing capabilities, or rapid deployment and employment of new capabilities, denying the benefits our adversaries may seek by attacking our space capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Through timely and accurate intelligence, we can work to understand our adversaries’ intent and armed with this knowledge, we gain the opportunity to influence their decision-making calculus<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Understanding intent, coupled with credible and timely ORS capabilities, can effectively deny or greatly reduce the benefits they seek by attacking the asymmetric advantages enabled by space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ORS provides a responsiveness that will allow the commander, US Strategic Command (CDR USSTRATCOM), to respond and support our combatant commands real-time and near-term requirements. To support these requirements, </span>ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations.</span><br />
Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space. In fact, </span>a deterrence strategy that includes the threat of punishment<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form, mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy; a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy </span>is not directly applicable to space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.6</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space.</span><br />
Instead,deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries (against their most prized assets<span style="font-size: 8pt;">);9 </span>and encourage their restraint<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
A New Focus of Deterrence<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">What does deterrence look like in the 21</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">st </span></em><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">century? The US has not yet figured that out, said Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Sandra I. Erwin, </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Future of War—How the Game is Changing</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">… Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.… </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ US National Security Strategy, 2006</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making.”10 In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. </span>Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations even in a contested environment.<br />
Deny the Benefits—ORS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Examples<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) view of space: Space shifting from enabler to key battleground. Space characterized as important because it contributes to information dominance; space now described as important in its own right….many in the PLA see space as a likely future arena for conflict.</span></em><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ Space and PRC National Security,’ Dean Cheng, China specialist, The Heritage Foundation, 8 October 2008.12</span><br />
The purpose to benefit denial is to convince an adversary that their intent will not be achieved, or have little to no value. Today, our ability to field ORS capabilities is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Instead, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency. However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “</span>our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”14</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Moving forward, </span>to be a true deterrent, ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). </span>Tier 1 and Two ORS capabilities can be deployed and employed rapidly, within hours to days. The cost for Tier 1 includes implementing new concept of operations for deployed on-orbit systems, or the rapid, low cost launch and deployment of systems intended to augment existing systems for Tier 2<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>Expanding ORS will deter attacks against US space assets</strong><br />

<br />
The U<span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span>has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. </span>The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that </span>efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities.<span style="font-size: 6pt;">,,39 Further, </span>the DoD's <em>Plan for Operationally Responsive Space</em> highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness and adaptability to the threat<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1 implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , </span>ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. </span>Field-ready systems would provide a credible defensive deterrent against existing and likely Chinese offensive anti-satellite actions.<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Space Situational Awareness</span><br />
Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy. The U<span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span>must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>Although the U<span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span>maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (SSN) network, </span>it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space<span style="font-size: 6pt;">;</span> the<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> February 10, 2009 </span>collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. </span>Improved SSA also allows the U<span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span>to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Intelligence</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Preplanned Satellite Actions</span><br />
Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting to an anti-satellite attack. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These </span>orbital maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the anti-satellite weapon<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. </span>If a conflict looks to be inevitable, they could decide to rapidly execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. If the conflict escalates into a conventional war, the single maneuver may buy the U<span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span>enough time to execute a kinetic strike that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program.<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Variable and Rapid Launch Capability</span><br />
The current United States Department of Defense launch complex does not have the capability to rapidly replenish satellites in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Small Satellites</span><br />
The United States must also make a move towards smaller satellites that use a common bus and architecture<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>A single launch vehicle could then deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the rapid establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict or replenishment of an old one<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 </span>Having numerous small satellites ready to launch can also lesson the need to perform defensive orbital maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Finally, </span>small satellites are inherently harder to track whether by radar or optical telescopes<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Decreased Dependence on Space Systems</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, </span>defense against the long term radiation effects must focus on hardening all future satellites against nuclear explosions. Without hardening, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite replenishment could take months and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Institutional Changes</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Transparency</span><br />
The above actions may deter China from further pursuing its anti-satellite programs, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<strong>Engagement</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic· missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Additionally, </span>the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.53 </span>Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, </span>proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, </span>these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that can damage satellite systems<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. “</span>A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.”56</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">CONCLUSION</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Council on Foreign Relations</span><br />
The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degrade US military capabilities in a conflict with China. The United States should rely on a defensive space strategy to deter Chinese anti-satellite actions. The strategy must include robust space situational awareness, preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. </span>The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58</span><br />

<span style="color: black; font-size: 6pt;">Responses</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">Satellites can be defended against some kinds of direct kinetic attacks</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. They can be moved out of range of the attacker’s terminal engagement sensors, if there is enough warning and accurate track of the interceptor and enough understanding of the kill mechanism, and if the satellite has been designed to withstand the loads created by the movement. There may be ways to confuse or defeat the sensors used to detect and track the target satellite, either in initial acquisition or in terminal engagement. The target might also be protected by active defenses, although with intercept occurring only about ten minutes after launch, the defenses will probably need to be directed energy rather than kinetic weapons. </span><span style="color: #231f20;">Either case would require precise situational awareness—exact information about the technology and operation of the attack—together with major advances in command and control for the defenses</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">Even without enemy action, satellites in orbit might provide less space support than needed. Satellites might be lost to collisions with debris or other objects; or essential components might fail.</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;"> Or it may be that prewar planning proved inaccurate, that more support is needed to meet unforeseen needs, or that demand for space support at the outbreak of crisis proves much greater than had been anticipated.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">These problems are not remedied by defenses; instead, they call for a supplemental capability, to augment capacity to meet surging needs and to replace lost or failed sensors</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. Some of this supplemental capability might be found already in orbit: the communications and intelligence satellites of commercial entities and allied governments. While not all of the products of these systems will be militarily useful to the U.S.—and probably none will possess the capability of analogous U.S. government systems—the diversity of information they could provide and the speed with which it could be available would surely prove advantageous.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">More capable systems, fully compatible with U.S. forces and fully under U.S. control, could in principle be stored in orbit; the engineering requirements for long-term storage and return to full operation seem well understood</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. At the same time, these systems might themselves suffer on-orbit misadventures, might potentially be targeted, and might prove useless in the face of unforeseen needs. Still, this approach offers the fastest, and probably the most expensive, path to the most capable supplementary systems.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">Supplements might be provided more cheaply and more reliably if they were stored on the ground, ready to be launched in response to the developing needs of joint force commanders. </span><span style="color: #231f20;">If these supplemental systems could be launched and brought into operation quickly enough, the time required for adversaries to detect, track, and assess them might deter antisatellite attacks completely</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. If launched before hostilities began, </span><span style="color: #231f20;">these supplements would confront adversaries with the need to prepare revised and more complicated plans for attacks in space, perhaps with less confidence that all important systems were in the crosshairs</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">If launched as replacements for satellites </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">initially lost to enemy action, the supplements would shrink the advantage that was sought in attacking the original satellites. If the U.S. </span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">coupled its supplemental replacements with vigorous offensive counterspace actions of its own, an enemy’s initial attacks would leave the U.S. with a diminished yet effective set of space assets and the enemy with none. All in all, </span><span style="color: #231f20;">being able to supplement or restore needed capability in orbit would likely prove a stabilizing and deterring influence; not being destructive weapons themselves, the supplements could scarcely be considered escalatory</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>Small satellites make successful attacks against US assets impossible</strong><br />
<strong>Smith, 11</strong> – USAF Colonel, Director of the Air Force Space and Cyber Center at Air University. He served in the Pentagon’s National Security Space Office as the Chief of the Future Concepts shop (M.V., Toward a Theory of Space Power: Selected Essays, February, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Although offense is the dominant form of war in space today, this will not always be the case. Defense is possible. Three principles will likely guide the development of future space defenses.<br />
First, <em>if you can't see it, you can't hit it</em>. Satellites are already getting smaller—too small for most space surveillance networks to detect and track. This trend will likely continue not only as a matter of cost savings, but also as a matter of stealthy defense. Avoiding detection includes maneuvering satellites to undisclosed wartime orbits.<br />
Second, <em>all warfare is based on deception</em>.34 Potential adversaries collect intelligence on each other's space systems and make their estimates based on their intelligence assessments. Action must be taken to deceive potential adversaries into underestimating the value of critical systems and overestimating the value of inconsequential systems. In addition, the use of wartime-only modes of operation, frequencies, and other unanticipated behaviors will further complicate an adversary's problems.<br />
Third, <em>there is strength in numbers</em>. <em>The age of the capital satellites is over</em>. Employing only one or two large, very expensive satellites to fulfill a critical mission area, such as reconnaissance, is foolish. Future space systems must be large constellations of smaller, cheaper, and, in many cases, lower-fidelity systems swarming in various orbits that exploit ground processing to derive high-fidelity solutions. In addition, swarms improve global access and presence.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">A stable, predictable funding stream is vital to ORS technology development</span></strong><br />
<span class="apple-converted-space"><strong><span style="color: #101010;">Dinerman, 6</span></strong></span>– DOD space consultant, and <em><span style="font-family: Georgia;">senior editor at the Hudson Institute’s New York branch (Taylor, The Space Review, “</span></em><span style="color: black;">Tactical IR satellites: operationally responsive spacecraft?,” 8/7, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/675/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/675/1</a><br />
<br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">The </span><span style="color: black;">troops on the ground need information they can use in a timely and easily understood format</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Simply to provide them, or division or brigade intelligence staffs that support them, with raw satellite data is probably worse than useless. </span><span style="color: black;">The next generations of US Army and Marine Corps units are going to require information that can be integrated into their “network-centric” information systems</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="color: black;">Imagery from space-based infrared sensors that are specifically designed for tactical utility should be part of these networks.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">This is a mission for a future constellation of small “operationally responsive” satellites.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> Part of the constellation should be kept in orbits that take them over places such as south Lebanon or the Afghan-Pakistani border where we can assume that there will be trouble for a long time to come. These should be carefully calibrated on a constant basis, so that their positioning information is ultra-precise. Other satellites can be kept on the ground ready to be launched at relatively short notice to supplement the ones on orbit over the world’s trouble spots, or they could be launched to cover unexpected outbreaks of fighting.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">A model for the way such a program could be run is GPS, which, over almost three decades, has gone from prototypes to sets of more and more sophisticated and capable satellites. These spacecraft have, on the whole, been both cost effective and free of the kinds of nasty and expensive surprises that have plagued SBIRS and other Air Force satellite programs.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">An operationally responsive tactical IR satellite system would have to be both affordable and based on proven and reliable technology. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">The first generation of such satellites may not have all the desired features, but if properly designed—with the right filters and the right level of multi- or hyper-spectral sensitivity—such craft would give the ground forces a valuable early operational capability.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">To make the program affordable it would have to be designed to use already existing bus and power supply systems and probably also an in-service communications architecture. </span><span style="color: black;">It would have to be light enough to be launched on a Delta 2 or on a future operationally responsive spacelift vehicle. Most important of all, the funding stream</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">—</span><span style="color: black;">no matter how much or how little—would have to be predictable so that the contractors would have the incentive to plan for the long term</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. This would be the most difficult part of the program since it would mean asking Congress to give up part of its power over the annual budget cycle.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Another way to keep the program affordable would be to keep the early requirements to a minimum. The first versions should be strictly for ground force use only, with perhaps some applications for Marine Corps amphibious warfare requirements. Only after the system has proven itself should the program be allowed to move on to develop air-to-ground sensor-to-shooter loops.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Ultimately a constellation of a dozen or so spacecraft in orbit, backed up by a similar number on the ground, would be ideal for the early versions of the full system. The ground segments will have to be as simple and as inexpensive as possible since it will need to be deployed with more than fifty Army and Marine brigade-sized units as well as with higher headquarters.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">If the idea of operationally responsive space means anything, it means that the military space forces</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, particularly Air Force Space Command, </span><span style="color: black;">are ready to give priority to supporting the troops on the front lines worldwide. Enhancing the combat effectiveness of the Army and the Marines and helping to save American lives should be the highest goal</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. As Clausewitz put it, “The object of fighting is the destruction or defeat of the enemy.” </span><span style="color: black;">The more that military space contributes directly to that objective, the better for the troops on the ground and for America as a whole.</span><br />

<br />
An active region of the sun that blasted out powerful solar storms four days in a row last week<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> likely </span>isn't done yet,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> scientists say</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Officially, the flare-spouting region is called sunspot 1283. But space weather experts have dubbed it &quot;Old Faithful,&quot; after the famous geyser in the United States' Yellowstone National Park that goes off like clockwork. And the solar Old Faithful should erupt again before it dissipates, researchers said. &quot;It still has a fair amount of complexity,&quot; said solar physicist C. Alex Young of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. &quot;So we still have a pretty good chance of seeing some more stuff from this one.&quot; An active sunspot Sunspots are temporary dark patches on the solar surface caused by intense magnetic activity. Some last for hours before disappearing; others linger for days, weeks or even months. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Powerful solar storms often erupt from sunspots. These include radiation-flinging solar flares and phenomena known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) — massive clouds of solar plasma that can streak through space at up to 3 million mph</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> (5 million kph). </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">From Sept. 5-8, sunspot 1283 produced four big flares and three CMEs</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Two of the flares were X-class events and two were M-class flares. (</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Strong solar flares are classified according to a three-tiered system: X-class are the most powerful</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, M-class are of medium strength and C-class are the weakest.) While the rapid motion previously observed in sunspot 1283 seems to have died down a bit, Young said, </span>the sunspot looks poised to erupt again sometime soon<span style="color: black;">. </span>&quot;There's a good probability that we're still going to see at least another M-class flare, possibly another X-class flare<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">&quot; Young told SPACE.com. It's not uncommon for sunspots to pop off a number of powerful flares in quick succession the way 1283 has done, he added. That seems to be the natural order of things. &quot;When you see one big flare, your chances of seeing another one are pretty good,&quot; Young said.

[Sun's Wrath: Worst Solar Storms in History] </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">So researchers are working hard to better understand sun storms, with the aim of one day being able to predict them with a great deal of accuracy and a long lead time. But they're not there yet</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;We still have a long way to go to really have the kind of forecasting capabilities that we have with terrestrial weather,&quot; Young said. That's not to say scientists aren't making progress. Indeed, they've learned a lot about solar eruptions lately, Young said. And the knowledge base will continue to grow, he added, as a fleet of sun-watching spacecraft beam home more and more observations of Earth's star. &quot;We're really in a great time right now in terms of the data that we have,&quot; Young said, citing the contributions of spacecraft such as NASA's STEREO and Solar Dynamics Observatory, as well as SOHO, a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency. &quot;It's going to be pretty exciting, from a solar physics and a space weather point of view.&quot; All of these eyes on the sun should be treated to quite a show over the next several years</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Solar activity has been ramping up over the last few months as the sun works toward a maximum in its 11-year activity cycle. Scientists expect the peak of the current cycle, which is known as Solar Cycle 24, to come in 2013.<br />

In the past, solar storms have caused billions of dollars of commercial satellites to malfunction and die prematurely. A Great solar storm has the power to destroy many space assets (Space Station, Space Shuttle, LEO Satellites, GEO Satellites, Off World Missions) simultaneously. In our technology driven society, satellites play an important role in communications. The loss of satellites can affect: major news wire service feeds, network television, satellite television and cable programming, nationwide radio service, weather data, cell phone service, pagers, automated teller machines, gas station credit card handling services, airline weather tracking services, earthquake monitoring network, blackberries, GPS navigation service, and critical military &amp; airline communications. And this list grows longer every day. Current commercial satellites are light-weight, sophisticated, built at the lowest cost using off-the-shelf electronics. 3 This current low cost approach makes new satellite design more vulnerable to damage from solar storms due to less radiation hardening. A high-energy particle from an SPE can penetrate the wall of a satellite and deposit sufficient charge to cause an electrical upset to a circuit switch, false command, memory state change or loss. 1 As the nuclear particles collide within the spacecraft, they release electrons that build up an internal dielectric charge. This static charge can destroy circuitry on electronic boards. The particles can also change data and instructions stored in computer memory. Only deaths with “day, month and year” listed were used in this analysis.Impact, 2007 James A. Marusek 21 Some of the memory damage is soft causing Single Event Upset (SEU). Generally, this anomaly can be corrected by a computer reboot. But some of the damage can be hard causing unrepairable physical damage to the junction of the microcircuit. These types of failures can be fatal.<br />

<br />
What would happen if the technology our modern military depends upon were to suddenly be compromised? The military Global Positioning System (GPS) is just one technology heavily relied upon for a variety of critical US military operations. Military GPS systems are responsible for increasing weapons accuracy, and therefore decreasing the number of warheads and military personnel required to take down a target or complete a mission. The GPS system was first introduced in the 1970s for military usage exclusively. GPS has since expanded into the commercial market – just about every new vehicle is introduced with a built in GPS, and standalone GPS systems can be added to older model vehicles easily – which makes constant innovation possible, but also lowers the high standards often demanded for the testing of military technology. Today, military GPS technology is so prevalent that John Pike of Globalsecurity.org claimed it is absolutely vital to American military functions; every military moving vehicle uses GPS. At least 100 U.S. military defense systems rely on GPS: aircrafts, ships, armored vehicles, bombs and artillery shells. In addition to GPS guided weapons systems, the Army also uses GPS units as patrol and location tracking tools for military service members in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">Last October, around Halloween, the Sun produced a solar storm that was one of the largest ever recorded, and was strong enough to raise some concerns about the safety of Earth’s satellites.<span style="color: black;"> According to a recent paper published in Space Weather, </span>such concern may well be justified<span style="color: black;">. If its conclusions are correct, then a </span>solar storm the size of one that was observed in 1859 could potentially kill several weather, telecommunications, and military satellites in less than a year<span style="color: black;">. Here’s where the danger lies: </span>most satellites, at least at some point in their orbits, fly through the inner radiation belt surrounding the Earth<span style="color: black;"> (aka the Van Allen Belt). The inner radiation belt, like it says on the tin, comprises quite a bit of intense radiation. However, satellites are shielded from that radiation, and the intensity of the radiation in the inner belt is relatively stable. That’s because it’s in large part shielded from high-energy particles by the plasmasphere, which is a cloud of plasma that is part of the Earth’s magnetosphere. Usually, </span>when a solar storm hits, most of the radiation either hits the outer radiation belt or the plasmaphere. When the plasmasphere gets hit, some of the plasma dissipates, making it smaller, but that dissipation prevents too much intense radiation from hitting the inner belt.<span style="color: black;"> During the Halloween storms, observations showed that there was significant erosion of the plasmasphere. Not enough to let significant radiation into the inner belt, but enough that the study authors wanted to take a closer look at the data. Based on observational data of solar storms, the radiation belts, and the plasmasphere during past years, the authors were able to successfully model the Halloween solar storm. They then modeled a solar storm with the intensity of the Carrington Solar Storm, which took place in 1859 and is estimated to have been about four times stronger than the Halloween storms. When the Carrington storm was modeled, the results showed that the plasmasphere was eroded to the point that much more radiation reached the inner belt than is normally the case. Moreover, the intensity produced “waves” of strong radiation continually moving through the inner belt. Based on their models, the authors suggest that the </span>high radiation intensity of the inner belt could persist for as long as a decade. That intensity would likely swamp the radiation shielding on a typical satellite, and<span style="color: black;"> the authors estimate that most </span>would be rendered inoperable<span style="color: black;"> within a year after the storm. </span>The loss of satellites as a result of a solar storm would be an economic catastrophe – we rely on satellites for a large portion of our day to day lives, <span style="color: black;">even when we don’t realize it. The researchers hope to continue their work modeling radiation from solar storms, with an eye towards better and more accurate predictions, as well as looking for ways to diminish the impacts of such storms. In the meantime, the authors suggest that satellite engineers incorporate the potential for intensification of the inner radiation belt in their radiation mitigation strategies. That strikes me as a good idea. </span></span><br />
<strong>Economic collapse causes global war</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">As they deal with a collapsing world economy, policymakers in Washington and around the globe must not forget that </span>when a depression strikes, war can follow. Nowhere is this truer than in Asia, the most heavily armed region on earth and riven with ancient hatreds and territorial rivalries<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>Collapsing trade flows can lead to political tension, nationalist outbursts, growing distrust, and ultimately, military miscalculation<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. The result would be disaster on top of an already dire situation.</span><br />
No one should think that Asia is on the verge of conflict. But it is also important to remember what has helped keep the peace in this region for so long. Phenomenal growth rates in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, China and elsewhere since the 1960s have naturally turned national attention inward, to development and stability<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. This has gradually led to increased political confidence, diplomatic initiatives, and in many nations the move toward more democratic systems. America has directly benefited as well, and not merely from years of lower consumer prices, but also from the general conditions of peace in Asia.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Yet </span>policymakers need to remember that even during these decades of growth, moments of economic shock<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, such as the 1973 Oil Crisis, </span>led to instability and bursts of terrorist activity in Japan, while the uneven pace of growth in China has led to tens of thousands of armed clashes in the poor interior of the country.<br />
Now imagine such instability multiplied region-wide.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> The economic collapse Japan is facing, and China's potential slowdown, dwarfs any previous economic troubles, including the 1998 Asian Currency Crisis. Newly urbanized workers rioting for jobs or living wages, conflict over natural resources, further saber-rattling from North Korea, all can take on lives of their own. This is the nightmare of governments in the region, and particularly of democracies from newer ones like Thailand and Mongolia to established states like Japan and South Korea. How will overburdened political leaders react to internal unrest? What happens if Chinese shopkeepers in Indonesia are attacked, or a Japanese naval ship collides with a Korean fishing vessel? Quite simply, </span>Asia's political infrastructure may not be strong enough to resist the slide towards confrontation and conflict.<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">This would be a political and humanitarian disaster turning the clock back decades in Asia. </span>It would almost certainly drag America in<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> at some point, as well. First of all, </span>we have alliance responsibilities to Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines should any of them come under armed attack<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Failure on our part to live up to those responsibilities could mean the end of America's credibility in Asia. Secondly, peace in Asia has been kept in good measure by the continued U.S. military presence since World War II. There have been terrible localized conflicts, of course, but nothing approaching a systemic conflagration like the 1940s. Today, such a conflict would be far more bloody, and </span>it is unclear if the American military, already stretched too thin by wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, could contain the crisis<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Nor is it clear that the American people, worn out from war and economic distress, would be willing to shed even more blood and treasure for lands across the ocean.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The result could be a historic changing of the geopolitical map in the world's most populous region. Perhaps China would emerge as the undisputed hegemon. Possibly democracies like Japan and South Korea would link up to oppose any aggressor. India might decide it could move into the vacuum. All of this is guess-work, of course, but it has happened repeatedly throughout history. There is no reason to believe we are immune from the same types of miscalculation and greed that have destroyed international systems in the past.</span><br />

Redundancy and Reconstitution is key to protect satellite systems<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">CBS 9-28</span><span style="color: black;">-11-[September 28, 2011 1:06 PM PRINT TEXT -“Satellites threatened by sun &quot;superstorms&quot; By Charles Q.

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">(Space.com) </span>Magnetic storms set off by the sun could pose a bigger threat than thought to weather, communication, military and other satellites close to Earth, with a potentially devastating economic impact, scientists suggest<span style="color: black;">. </span>In the new study, researchers found that solar radiation can energize a belt of high-energy particles that surrounds Earth more dramatically than previously believed<span style="color: black;">. The study focused on the possible effects of a particularly strong magnetic storm on the Van Allen radiation belts, the dangerous rings of high-energy particles that girdle the Earth. The belts are split into two distinct zones. The outer belt, which is made up of electrons, reaches from about 15,800 to 31,600 miles (25,500 to 51,000 kilometers) above the surface, while the inner belt, which consists of a mix of electrons and protons, reaches from about 4,000 to 8,000 miles (6,400 to 12,800 km) above. Scientists had known the outer belt could become far more intense during geomagnetic storms caused by high-energy particles spewed by the sun, such as the storm that supercharged Earth's northern lights display Monday night (Sept. 26). However, they have long thought such storms do not affect the inner belt. Now computer simulations suggest </span>that during a &quot;superstorm&quot; -- which has occurred in the past and is likely to recur in the future<span style="color: black;"> ? </span>the electrons in the inner belt, too, could become energized<span style="color: black;">. </span>Near-Earth radiation could then remain dramatically more intense for several years afterward. &quot;The increase in radiation in the inner zone may last for up to a decade and continue damaging satellites for years after a very strong storm<span style="color: black;">,&quot; study lead author Yuri Shprits, a space physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told SPACE.com. </span>This radiation would damage satellites in that zone and potentially cut their lifetimes by five-sixths or more<span style="color: black;">. [Related: Space Radiation to Rise for Astronauts, Airline Passengers] &quot;It would not destroy all satellites at once,&quot; Shprits said. &quot;However, at least according to our calculations, </span>a very strong storm can increase the radiation dose in the inner zone by a factor of 10, and within a few years we may lose a significant portion of the satellites that traverse the inner zone.<span style="color: black;">&quot; </span>In terms of new strategies that might be needed to protect satellite systems<span style="color: black;">, &quot;it's hard to say,&quot; Shprits said. &quot;First of all, we need to estimate risks and estimate cost. </span>If cost is too high, we may want to accept the risks and start getting ready to replenish the fleet in the case of such event<span style="color: black;">.&quot; &quot;There are a number of rather expensive strategies that can be used to mitigate the risk, including redundancy in electronics and increased shielding,&quot; he added. &quot;Zero risk means infinite cost.&quot; Two missions to study the radiation belts are planned for 2012, Shprits noted: NASA's Radiation Belt Storm Probe will observe radiation belts in the equatorial plane, while Moscow State University's LOMONOSOV mission, with UCLA-built instruments on board, will observe radiation belts at low altitudes. The scientists detailed their findings online in the Aug. 25 issue of the journal Space Weather. </span></span><br />
Hardening key to preventing solar storms<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">THE SPACE REVIEW ’08</span> (The Space Review is an online publication devoted to in-depth articles, commentary, and reviews regarding all aspects of space exploration: science, technology, policy, business, and more)&lt; <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:7888:http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1553/2 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1553/2" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1553/2</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:7888 -->&gt;<br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">As the likelihood of a geomagnetic storm far exceeds that of an incapacitating multi-megaton EMP strike, it is sensible to give priority to investing in that hardening that would protect the electrical grid from E3 (and geomagnetic) type disturbances, as compared to E1. To quote the NAS study [25], “With respect to the entire grid, remedial measures to reduce GIC levels are needed and are cost-effective. The installation of supplemental transformer neutral ground resistors to reduce GIC flows is relatively inexpensive, has low engineering trade-offs, and can produce 60-70 percent reductions of GIC levels for storms of all sizes.”<span style="color: black;"> Improved education and situational awareness of grid operators is also called for: “regional system operators require initial and continuing training to understand their assigned roles and responsibilities in protecting the power system during solar events using new tools.” Instituting new design codes that would help reduce geomagnetically induced current (GIC) flows in the power grid during a storm are also called for. Dr. Radasky and Mr. Kappenman have also outlined similar avenues for hardening the grid against E3 and geomagnetic storms for the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology. Other experts advocate </span>improved cabling (e.g. industrial RS-485 cabling) in combination with improved external transient voltage suppressors to protect against the faster pulses.<span style="color: black;"> Specific methodologies for protecting against the lower priority fast EMP transients have been outlined in Cold War era (1984) NAS report “Evaluation of Methodologies for Estimating Vulnerability to Electromagnetic Pulse Effects”. [27] </span>Of course, protecting and hardening critical infrastructure from geomagnetic storms (and EMP) would also offer protection against some cyber-threats, sabotage, and natural disasters, like severe storms or hurricanes.<span style="color: black;"> However, any modernization and hardening of the electrical grid should also be done with an eye towards future renewable power sources that may eventually be fed into the grid. Last year’s stimulus bill specifically allocates $11 billion to DOE for “for smart grid activities, including to modernize the electric grid.” And a recent NAS study, “America’s Energy Future: Technology and Transformation” proposes an “expansion and modernization of the nation’s electrical transmission and distribution systems [that] would enhance reliability and security, accommodate changes in load growth and electricity demand, and enable the deployment of new energy efficiency and supply technologies, especially intermittent wind and solar energy</span>”. It would be sensible if such improvements in the electric grid should were focused, at least partially, on reducing vulnerabilities to geomagnetic storms (and, by extension, EMP). However, hardening the grid, and making it “smarter” may work at cross purposes, and should be carefully coordinated. A peer-reviewed study of the most sensible and secure path for incorporating renewable power sources ought to be a priority.</span><br />

HASC added $23.4 million to the ORS budget to fund remaining development and launch costs of the ORS-1 satellite. The Fiscal Year 2011 budget is still in work, however the FY11 Air Force Posture Statement stated a request of $94 million, almost 9% of the total space-related budget, for the ORS program. These on-demand space vehicles will only augment or temporarily replace large satellite systems, so they will most likely not have all the capabilities of the more complex spacecraft but they should have enough survivability and operational mission requirements to serve as temporary solutions</span>. The ORS concept is sound and funded, but to be effective it must be delivered to the user efficiently on-time and on-budget.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This innovative way of doing business in space starts with a revolutionary alteration in the current military space</span><br />

Forecast International projects that the worldwide military satellite market will be worth $42.5 billion, based on production of 180 military satellites, from 2011-2020. Thirty-five satellite programs are covered in the company's &quot;The Market for Military Satellites&quot; study, which notes that these orbiting systems play a significant role in modern military operations, particularly in the U.S., which relies heavily on communications and reconnaissance to achieve its goals on the battlefield. &quot;With the increased focus on battlefield networking, communications satellite capacity is critical,&quot; said William Ostrove, aerospace systems analyst and author of the report. Satellites are also used for navigation and weather forecasting. The analysis addresses some of the difficulties facing the market as a result of tight government budgets worldwide. &quot;Governments are faced with large debt, and are reducing spending plans in response,&quot; said Ostrove. With respect to military satellites, budget cuts will be felt the most in the U.S., where satellite manufacturers have long enjoyed lucrative development and production contracts.According to the study, the tougher budget environment is prompting the U.S. to focus on production of already-developed satellites, rather than on development of revolutionary new technology. The U.S. Department of Defense will also place more emphasis on smaller, inexpensive satellites under a concept known as Operationally Responsive Space (ORS).<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The 11 January 2007 test of a Chinese ground-based, direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) kinetic-kill interceptor against one of their own defunct weather satellites generated considerable angst across the United States space community. </span>The 2007 test demonstrated that the importance of space capabilities is also their Achilles heel, that is, their deadly weakness in spite of overall strength; it is far too easy to neutralize space systems and their power<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. In the broad strategic context, </span>space capabilities have their own set of unique, inherent vulnerabilities<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, which are largely the result of orbital mechanics. </span>This invites destruction, damage, and even just mischief delivered by even the least significant adversary<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. However, other nations may seek to deny U.S. advantages in space through a variety of negation and prevention actions.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Negation Threats</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Satellite systems consist not only of spacecraft, each with their own payload and bus, but also a supporting infrastructure—ground control stations, tracking and control links, commonly referred to as the tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&amp;C) links, data links, launch facilities, and an industrial base. Each of these components is at risk to threats of physical and cyber attack, and sabotage, and can be negated, simultaneously or each in detail. The satellite payload, bus, links, and infrastructure can be negated by using a variety of permanent or reversible means to achieve one of the five possible effects, known as the ‘‘five Ds’’—deception, disruption, denial, degradation, and destruction.5</span><br />
Space-based threats proliferate as a result of the ever-growing global availability of technology and access to the space domain. There are huge incentives for states to invest in and use space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, and the spread of space technologies has occurred. States with sufficient resources can now reach out to space and ‘‘touch’’ satellites through a variety of means, and achieve one and even more of the five Ds. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Spacecraft are vulnerable to direct ascent weapons as demonstrated by the Chinese ASAT test, and to a variety of other groundbased, airborne, and space-based ASAT technologies. Direct-ascent launched, or orbit-based nuclear devices, can be detonated, generating radiation and other lethal effects to destroy unshielded electronics over a wide lethal range. Co-orbital ASATs could be employed, comparable to the old Soviet system that was tested extensively in the 1970s and early 80s. In a less likely scenario, space-borne mines can also be deployed in close proximity to spacecraft, or exploded to generate debris clouds that destructively engage whole classes of satellites in the same orbital plane or in crossing orbits. Ground, space-based, or airborne lasers could be used by adversaries to wreak havoc. Blinding operations could be executed and inflict effects ranging from temporary ‘‘dazzling’’ to permanent burnout of optical or other sensors with intense energy bursts.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Ground systems, supporting communications, and their nodes, are vulnerable to diverse land, sea, or air kinetic attacks, including sabotage. Unprotected systems are also susceptible to electronic attack through jamming and electromagnetic deception techniques. Jammers emit signals that mask or prevent reception of desired signals; these methods can disrupt uplinks, downlinks, and even cross-links. By disabling the means of command and control, and data communications, jammers render satellites inoperable or unavailable. Electromagnetic deception techniques can be employed to confuse systems; this could include sending false, but deceptively plausible, commands that cause spacecraft to perform damaging or wasteful maneuvers, modify databases or execute configuration changes, or otherwise destroy it.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Similarly, supporting terrestrial ground stations, computer networks, and links are vulnerable to information operation and cyber attacks. These attacks could involve directing global denial of service tasks, injecting fake commands, malicious software and viruses into the space system, performing unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of sensitive information (data interception), and causing unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of network information, services, and databases.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">In sum, there is a wide span of kinetic and other types of attacks an adversary could consider and employ. There is potential that even non-state actors can access some of these technologies and space systems, and achieve several of the five Ds; however, it is unlikely they can obtain and then employ a full-spectrum of these means and achieve all of these effects. Conducting an attack within the space domain involves a rather substantial investment to develop, acquire, operate, and sustain needed shooter, sensor, and command and control systems. Given the scope and commitment needed to affect such a move, an on-orbit attack would probably be made only in the context of a larger strategic struggle, perhaps as a prelude to or part of early combat operations. On the other hand, inexpensive jamming technology is available to even the poorest potential adversaries. As such, jamming poses the most used and growing threat to space systems. Some argue that jamming also carries with it implicit political and legal sanctions since no major space power has moved to ban or make even temporary and reversible jamming illegal. This may change now that a number of nations have banned together to object to recent Iranian satellite jamming.6 Cyber adversaries and criminals are also beginning to hone their craft. They present an evolving threat to space systems; and like jamming, cyber threats can be developed and deployed for only modest investments.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention Threats</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention actions generally involve economic, political, informational, and diplomatic instruments of national power. For example, an extremely large creditor nation could employ its considerable economic clout and leverage in an attempt to compel or blackmail the United States to not license or permit imaging of its territory, preventing its use, and reducing its exposure to such observation. The creditor nation could seek to accomplish its objective by destabilizing the world market place. It could refuse to purchase treasury offerings that underpin the burgeoning U.S. fiscal and trade deficits, perhaps arguing that remote sensing, especially commercial remote sensing, of its territory infringes on its territorial and sovereign rights, or that it constitutes ‘‘unlawful’’ industrial espionage, and is thus, an unfair trade practice.7 Commercial remote sensing systems are nowan important resource for the United States Government and its national security needs. U.S. Government orders help sustain and stabilize the remote sensing industry,8 and any limitations on activities, whether for U.S. Government customers or commercial ones, imposed in response to external economic threats could evolve to cause problems. In an alternative scenario, a state, acting through political allies and proxies, could exert considerable influence and dominance to affect a change in U.S. law. This change could restrict licensing of commercial remote sensing imagery, restricting the market place and impacting business models for producers.9</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">As a diplomatic prevention example, adversaries could attempt to use international forums and treaties to deny frequency rights needed by U.S. military or intelligence satellites by making spurious ‘‘paper satellite’’ filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). ‘‘Paper satellites’’ involve ITU applications for satellite orbital slots, many for ‘‘speculative’’ systems that will never leave Earth. These filings can block access to scarce spectrum and orbital resources.10 The ability to place communications and other satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) positions could be held at risk. Some characterize some of these types of actions as a form of ‘‘lawfare.’’ ‘‘The term lawfare describes the growing use of international law claims, usually factually or legally meritless, as a tool of war. The goal is to gain a moral advantage over your enemy in the court of world opinion, and potentially a legal advantage in national and international tribunals.’’11</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention actions taken to hobble U.S. space systems are not armed attacks. As is discussed later, the use of force is only authorized under the United Nations (UN) Charter in response to an armed attack, or upon authorization of the UN Security Council. As such, using armed force to deter and defeat prevention actions involving political or diplomatic subterfuge or intrigue may be unlawful under international law. Creative alternative solutions must therefore be found to assure access to space when facing these types of threats.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Implications for U.S. Space Strategy</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">The wide span of threats poses profound implications</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> for U.S. space strategy and its execution. First, unlike the Cold War era, </span>the U<span style="font-size: 5pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">tates</span>now confronts a wide array of global actors, all operating with different motivations and incentives, some of which could become potential adversaries who can attack or threaten space capabilities<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. These state and non-state adversaries exhibit a wide array of political, economic, technical, and social differences. </span>Having many potential adversaries makes each of them harder to understand. This complicates efforts to understand motivations and to influence perceptions for deterrence purposes<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>These differences, in turn, increase the likelihood of misperception, undercutting strategies to protect access to space capabilities. When one’s attention is divided, deterrent measures that are appropriate for one target may not be useful, or even counterproductive, for another<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. This requires tailored intelligence efforts, information operations, and transparency efforts in order to avoid or minimize disputes and prevent problems.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Second, the broad array of adversaries exhibit widely varying risk-taking behaviors. Risk-taking behavior can strongly influence an adversary’s perception of a situation. Understanding this phenomenon can lead to better ways of influencing those perceptions. Unfortunately, </span>potential adversaries may not care that space systems offer tremendous value and capabilities to all nations, or care whether conflict in space could create space debris that could cost all nations access to the domain. <span style="font-size: 5pt;">A strategy to assure continuing access to space assets must therefore be sufficiently flexible to address both risk-averse and risk-taking adversaries. Indeed, potential adversaries may shift from risk-taking to risk-adverse over a relatively short period of time. China may fit in this category. Within a decade or two, it will have its own extensive space-based communications, navigation, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellite constellations, all of which will be integrated into its military operations. No doubt, China will embrace that evolution and become very reliant on space capabilities; this will shift it from an asymmetric competitor to one similar to the United States or Russia. Third, with the demise of the Soviet Union, some political commentators and critics described the United States as a ‘‘hyperpower’’ not just a ‘‘superpower.’’ 12 Though buffeted by recent events involving Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and the 2008 global financial meltdown, U.S. military supremacy continues. But, that </span>supremacy does not make or guarantee a successful space strategy.Adversaries may believe they have a higher stake than the United States in the outcome of a particular crisis or conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>Alternatively, the United States stake in the crisis may not be commensurate with the possible cost of involvement by the United States military and the rest of its national security apparatus. The first alternative may encourage mischief by adversaries; the second discourages U.S. action. As a result, adversaries may find threats of U.S. action in response to hostile acts affecting U.S. access to space systems to be non-credible<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Fourth, </span>while the United States has produced superlative space capabilities, it has not produced enough systems ready to survive the new kinetic, exotic, jamming, and cyber threat environment<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. The vulnerability exists because the spacecraft developed and deployed today are in many ways the same as those originally fielded during the Cold War. During that epic struggle, there was a tacit and then explicit understanding that each superpower would not attack and overwhelm the other’s space systems, except in the direst of circumstances, perhaps during the throes of a nuclear conflagration. Indeed, a number of agreements between the superpowers adopted the understanding and ruled out interference with national technical means, including space assets. </span>This belief in the superiority of space systems and power blinds the United States to the inherent strategic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in these systems. This, predictably, can now be exploited by potential adversaries, such as China, who, with their recent ASAT test, appear more willing to fully explore the technologies needed to expand the limits of conventional war to include the space domain<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Consequently, by historically and diplomatically reducing the threat, engineering of some satellite threat detection, attack avoidance, and other defense subsystems have not matured enough so that they are sophisticated, nimble, and robust enough to counter new 21st Century adversary attack capabilities.</span><br />

<strong>Conflict over space is inevitable – history proves</strong><br />
<strong>Smith</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Colonel and PhD in IR, </span><strong>11</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (M.V., Colonel, PhD in Politics and IR @ University of Reading, Citing Colin Gray, “Chapter 17: Security and Spacepower, Part of “Toward a Theory of Spacepower,” Edited by Charles Lutes and Peter Hays, National Defense University Press, <span style="font-size: 11pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf</a></span>, EMM)</span><br />
<br />
It is a rule in strategy, one derived empirically from the evidence of two and a half millennia, that anything of great strategic importance to one belligerent, for that reason has to be worth attacking by others<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And </span>the greater the importance, the greater has to be the incentive to damage<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, disable, capture</span>, or destroy it. In the bluntest of statements: space warfare is a certainty in the future because the use of space in war has become vital. . . . Regardless of public sentimental or environmentally shaped attitudes towards space as the pristine final frontier, space warfare is coming.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">20 </span>The strategic value of space to states is not in question. Advanced spacefaring states are already reliant—and moving toward dependence—on space-derived services <span style="font-size: 8pt;">for activities across every sector of their societies. Spacepower is becoming critical to their styles of warfighting. Likewise, </span>the injury that can be caused to such states by menacing their space systems can be considerable. Given these incentives, the beast of war will either break its chains all at once or stretch them slowly over time.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">21 </span><br />

<strong>Deterrence by punishment fails because we lack defenses and states could act through terrorist proxies</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Rendleman, 10</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> - </span>Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The strategy to deter nuclear attack worked throughout the Cold War; the Soviet Union was powerful, but it was also a rational adversary. For this reason, the United States worked hard to understand the culture, goals, incentives, and ideals of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was also open to, and reciprocated, U.S. diplomatic engagement overtures. </span>The United States has gained great advantage through development and integration of space capabilities. This has forced potential adversaries to evolve techniques to neutralize this superiority<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Attacks on U.S. space systems can be performed through terrorist proxies, third parties, or covert acts that offer perpetrators plausible deniability for damage inflicted<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The United States now confronts a diverse set of adversaries, and their rogue leaders are arguably much more risk prone, or perhaps<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, just oxymoronic, </span>acting deliberately reckless. These adversaries know full well the importance of space capabilities to U.S. diplomatic, military, and economic success. They see that attacking and disrupting space capabilities presents a significant opportunity to deny U.S. national objectives, to retain or expand their own relative power, and to compensate for their own lack of conventional strength<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
Deterrence has failed throughout history ‘‘because the object of deterring measures fails to notice them, does not find the measures credible, or is pursuing an agenda sufficiently important enough to its interests that it is prepared to ignore the deterrence attempt<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.’’30 </span>Given this, the United States cannot depend solely on deterrence to secure itself. It must prepare for the possibility that its measures could fail. Therefore, defenses should also be deployed<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; though the extent of these should be measured and balanced against their utility, and measured by projected costs, lost opportunity costs, likely effectiveness, and effects obtained in the end.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Deterrence and defense tasks are inexorably linked to each other. As noted by Robert Butterworth, ‘‘Defenses offer protection, while deterrence threatens punishment. </span>Defenses can succeed whether the enemy believes in them or not<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.’’31 There are a number of active and passive defensive capabilities that can be developed and deployed to protect space systems, particularly against kinetic-kill ASATs and jammers.</span><br />

<strong>Wortzel, 8</strong> - Colonel, United States Army (Retired) (Larry, Astropolitics, 6:112–137, “THE CHINESE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY<br />
AND SPACE WARFARE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
The PLA is exploring in theoretical research, basic research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.77 </span>These include<span style="font-size: 5pt;">:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>satellite jamming technology;<br />
. collisions between space bodies;<br />
. kinetic energy weapons;<br />
. space-to-ground attack weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;</span><br />
. space planes<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> that can transit and fight ‘‘up or down’’ in the upper atmosphere or space;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>high-power laser weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>high-power microwave weapon systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>particle-beam weapons; and<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>electromagnetic pulse<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.78</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies. The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not, </span>it is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the blinding of a U.S. satellite mean they are achieving some success.<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 </span>The Chinese see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they would probably use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.81</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. </span>As the PLA modernizes its<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (</span>C4SIR) systems, it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, </span>an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons or a deeper crisis<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">For example, </span>four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, in Wuhan, </span>have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.82 In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88</span><br />
The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>One possible reaction by the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike against China’s strategic missile forces<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Space Deterrence</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Conclusions</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First, </span>in the event of conflict with the PLA, military operations carried out across all the domains of war, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, are likely. Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions. </span>There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;97 </span>the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. </span>The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance. </span>No such dialogue has taken place with China. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures.</span><br />
Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span>By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. To this end, the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. </span>As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, </span>and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>The risk of crisis instability and miscalc is high – the PLA is isolated from the Chinese government</strong><br />
<strong>MacDonald, 11</strong> - Senior Director, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program, U.S. Institute of Peace (Bruce, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA”, 5/11, lexis)<br />
<br />
One characteristic of too many wars in the last century is that they are the result of miscalculation that ignites the tinder of fundamental geopolitical tensions. Averting major power conflict requires skillful management of tensions by senior leaders of the major powers<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. China has become much more internationally sophisticated, though with important exceptions, in its dealings with the rest of the world than has been true in the past, and this is reflected in its civilian leadership. Unfortunately, </span>the PLA's seniorofficer corps<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> trails its civilian counterparts in this respect. They have much less interaction with foreign official and travel abroad much less frequently than their U.S. counterparts. This means that the PLA overall </span>views world events from a lessknowledgeable and sophisticated perspective, a danger in this increasingly complex world, and could explain, for example, the political &quot;tonedeafness&quot; of the PLA in the manner they conducted their 2007 ASAT test.<br />
<br />
This PLA problem becomes more serious when one realizes that the PLA is organizationally separate from the rest of the Chinese government, and reports only to the Central Military Commission,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> currently chaired by President Hu Jintao. President Hu, and his likely successors, have no significant military background, and the majority of the CMC's members are top PLA officers, suggesting that civilian oversight of major military decisions and consideration of their larger implications are not as carefully reviewed as in the U.S. government. Normally this would not be too great a concern, but </span>in a crisis this could be dangerous. Add to this the fact that China has no equivalent of our National Security Council, a critically important body for coordinating our security decisionmaking, and one comes away concerned about the relative insularity of the PLA in the Chinese power structure<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
In a crisis, the PLA probably cannot be counted on to show as sophisticated a sense of judgment as one would hope any country's military leaders, even an enemy's, to show. All these problems and many more pose potential threats to internal political stability andCommunist Party control, providing ample opportunity for crisis and conflict in the years ahead<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Overview of The Strategic Landscape of Space</span><br />
<br />
Space assets<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and the communications and cyber links that enable them to function, </span>are the means by which essential national security information is either generated, transmitted, or both. This information is the lifeblood of U.S. conventional military superiority and plays a key role in U.S. strategic nuclear posture as well<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As such, </span>these space related assets represent extraordinarily appealing targets in any future conflict, and their relative vulnerability can provide dangerously attractive incentives in a crisis to preempt, escalating to war<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Resisting this temptation to attack may be morally virtuous but could be strategically unwise: </span>going first in a space conflict with a nearpeer space adversary appears to offer many advantages, while absorbing such a strike, with all its attendant destruction of military capabilities, and then responding to the attack against an opponent fully expecting such a response, appears to be militarily and strategically quite undesirable.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">As technology advances, the ways of interfering with, disrupting, or destroying information streams in space or supporting space systems will likely increase, as will U.S. and others' dependence upon such systems. Providing defensive options for U.S. space assets should be pursued where appropriate, but most space observers believe that offense has the advantage in space over defense, as General Cartwright observed last May. Cartwright also noted that the challenging issues that space poses has made the Space Posture Review &quot;the most difficult of all the defense reviews&quot; the Obama Administration has undertaken.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The overall U.S. goal in space should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States and its allies, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. and allied security. </span>The United States has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This need not mean that China and others must perforce be disadvantaged by such an arrangement - there should be ample opportunity for many countries to benefit and prosper from a properly crafted system of space management.</span><br />
<br />

<strong><span style="color: black;">Burke, 6</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> – </span>Lt Col, USAF, command space professional with operational experience in missile operations, space surveillance, space control, missile warning, and command and control (Alan, “SPACE THREAT WARNING: FOUNDATION FOR SPACE SUPERIORITY, AVOIDING A SPACE PEARL HARBOR,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www.afresearch.org/skins/RIMS/display.aspx?moduleid=be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153&amp;mode=user&amp;action=researchproject&amp;objectid=07acf878-3a5f-4a2c-8259-4a34c0717e9b" rel="nofollow">https://www.afresearch.org/skins/RIMS/display.aspx?moduleid=be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153&amp;mode=user&amp;action=researchproject&amp;objectid=07acf878-3a5f-4a2c-8259-4a34c0717e9b</a>)<br />
<br />
The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites<span style="font-size: 9pt;">, facilities or services; </span>the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets<strong>.</strong><br />
One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> on the US homeland or an attack </span>that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, </span>other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US<span style="font-size: 9pt;">.44</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">Although a major attack on the US is not likely, </span>the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculationthat the US was vulnerable to a nuclear firststrike<span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span>The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, </span>the Chinese might seek to disrupt or destroy regional space capabilities as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a <em>fait accompli</em><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.45</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “</span>Space capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> are no longer nice to have, but </span>are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.”51 </span>The failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets.<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, </span>successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. </span>A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>Satellite communication links to worldwide deployed forces are critical capabilities in protecting US security, sovereignty, and military combat capability.<br />
The inability to detect and assess space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems or conduct probing attacks on US space systems<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Today, </span>other nations are working to developnew weapons to counter US dominance and to take the lead in<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—</span>informationwar<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The current </span>coverage gaps in our space surveillance network<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset </span>makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons <span style="font-size: 6pt;">without our knowledge.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Finally, </span>without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> to counter an attack against US space assets</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is </span>to deter an attack on US space assets<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. </span>A senior officer in US Strat<span style="font-size: 6pt;">egic </span>Com<span style="font-size: 6pt;">mand recently </span>stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.57 </span><br />

<strong>Prevents rogue states from destroying space assets</strong><br />
<strong>Smith, 11</strong> – USAF Colonel, Director of the Air Force Space and Cyber Center at Air University. He served in the Pentagon’s National Security Space Office as the Chief of the Future Concepts shop (M.V., Toward a Theory of Space Power: Selected Essays, February, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Spacefaring prowess is a common attribute of the dominant powers in the world today. Special attention must be paid to so-called rogue states that have access to space-related technology and may even be spacefaring but do not have the conventional forces to achieve their policy aims. Those aims tend to be very intense, and these players may seek space weapons as an asymmetric hedge against spacefaring adversaries who may try to coerce them.<br />
The dominant military powers in the world, some of whom are potential adversaries, also tend to be the dominant spacefaring states. Because of the economic benefits and exponential enhancements that spacepower delivers to terrestrial warfighting, those states are under increasing pressure to defend their space systems and to counter those of their potential adversaries. This may lead to a space weapons race and an immediate escalation of hostilities to &quot;wipe the skies&quot; of enemy satellites should war break out between two or more dominant military space powers.29<br />
When assessing the interplay between the spectrum of conflict and the spectrum of belligerents, it may be the case that war between two weak actors will not likely extend into space. However, if the power is perceived to be disparate, a weak actor is far more likely to use space weapons against a powerful state as an asymmetric defensive move.30 A powerful state may counter the space systems in use by a weaker adversary, but it is likely to do so by placing diplomatic pressure on commercial vendors, or executing attacks on their ground stations, or launching highly selective covert attacks on the satellites they use by employing temporary and reversible means.<br />
Should two dominant spacefaring powers go directly to war with each other with intense motives, both will find it critical to preserve their space systems and will consider it a dangerous liability to allow their enemy to exploit theirs. Given the ability of spacepower to cut the fog and friction of war while connecting military forces at the tactical, operational, and strategic level, it is likely that space systems will be primary targets that will be negated in the opening moves of war. The fight for space is likely to be intense and brief. Temporary means of negation will likely switch to permanent methods of destruction to remove doubt in the minds of commanders.<br />

<strong>Loss of space assets will annihilate US hegemony</strong><br />
Marshall, 8 - NASA Ames Research Center (Will, Astropolitics, 6:154–199, “REDUCING THE VULNERABILITY OF SPACE ASSETS: A<br />
MULTITIERED MICROSATELLITE CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
Space assets are one of the most critical ‘‘Achilles’ heels’’ of the current military capability of the United States (U.S.). This is for two reasons: (1) the U.S.military space systems—in particular reconnaissance, navigation, signals intelligence, early warning, and communications systems—are critical to modern military warfare and intelligence; and (2) space systems are inherently vulnerable to attack. This combination is understood at the highest levels and was espoused in the ‘‘Rumsfeld Space Commission’’ with talk of a ‘‘Space Pearl Harbor.’’1 Whether one agrees with the tone, this is a genuine security problem for the U.S. in need of a near-term solution. While there have been numerous papers, and much media and academic attention, in the space security discussion focused on promoting or criticizing space-based weapons,2 there have been far fewer papers and studies offering constructive ways forward that deal with these genuine security concerns in a broader sense.3<br />
The central motivation for this paper is to put forward one key element—the satellite architecture—in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. space assets. It is hoped that this idea, together with others like it, should stimulate and contribute to a debate on more constructive ways forward for how to achieve space security in the post-Cold war world.<br />
Importance of Space Assets<br />
For better or worse, it is clear that the U.S. military is to some significant extent dependent on its key satellites, which number about 86–105 operational satellites at present. These satellites constitute a significant part of the eyes, ears, and central nervous system of the modern military.4 A practical example that helps to illustrate this is the case of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. First, the decision to go was based in part on satellite imagery and signals intelligence from satellites; whether or not it was interpreted or used correctly is a separate issue. Second, the planning and operation were facilitated by satellite imagery. Third, many planes, ships, tanks, and units’ positions were known through Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and even most munitions were guided by GPS. Fourth, the operation was commanded from the U.S. in large part through the use of communications satellites. Perhaps more importantly than any of the functions in the Iraq example, early warning (EW) satellites are the U.S.’s and Russia’s first warning of nuclear missile attack. As Gray classified, space assets have moved from being ‘‘useful and important’’ to an ‘‘indispensable adjunct’’ in the military over the last decade.5<br />
Space assets are definitely used a great deal by the U.S. military, but that does not mean necessarily as strong a dependence as Gray implies. The loss of U.S. space assets could range in its effect anywhere from a loss to the U.S. military in practical operations, to being catastrophic to U.S. security. The former would entail a reduction in operational effectiveness or speed, but fundamentally supposes that back-up systems and/or redundancy allow a near continuation of military capability. The latter scenario would entail an effective disablement of the U.S. military capability from normal operations. In reality, the significance lies between these boundaries, but this is a topic that could benefit from further research.<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Kagan 7</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">[Robert, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund, “End of Dreams, Return of History”, Hoover Institution - Stanford U, in Policy Review, No 144, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/8552512.html#n10" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/8552512.html#n10</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as “No. 1” and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying — its regional as well as its global predominance. </span>Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic.It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. </span>Nations would compete<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe ’s stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that ’s not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of </span>power in the world since World War II, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world ’s great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. </span>War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China ’s neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene — even if it remained the world’s most powerful nation — could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe — if it adopted what some call a strategy of “offshore balancing” — this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, “offshore” role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more “even-handed” policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel ’s aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn ’t change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. </span>The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran.<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> The world hasn ’t changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to “normal” or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.</span><br />

<strong>Commitment to ORS is vital to deterrence by denial – it will prevent attacks against US space assets</strong><br />
<strong>Sejba, 10</strong> - USAF Congressional Budget Liaison Officer Budget and Appropriations Liaison Directorate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget Secretary of the Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC (Timothy, “ Deterrence for Space: Is Operationally Responsive Space Part of the Solution?”, High Frontier, May, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
The space domain,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> often referred to as “The High Frontier,” </span>no longer is a sanctuary outside the reach of foreign intervention. The threat to space systems and their capabilities is broad, ranging from reversible effects such as jamming or blinding, to more destructive means such as anti-satellite weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is now time to take actions for the </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">sake of space</span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and assure its continued contributions across the full spectrum of military operations. </span>Given the criticality of space to not only our military power, but also our economic power, it is time we develop policies and field capabilities to deter future adversaries from attempting to degrade, deny, or destroy space capabilities and services<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The asymmetric advantages enabled by space can no longer be assumed and as a result, a new National Security Strategy for space must be forged, one that combines deterrence with basic protection capabilities never before afforded our space systems. Yet, space deterrence is not an “all in” strategy, nor can it reduce the risk of attack to zero.1 </span>Should aspects of deterrence fail, we must take steps to defend and protect our space systems and the critical global services they provide<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Operationally responsive space (ORS) by definition is “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of joint force commanders’ needs.”2 Dissected further, one key word stands out: </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">assured </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">… being sufficiently robust, timely, agile, adaptive, and resilient, to achieve desired outcomes with a high degree of certainty.3 So </span>while ORS intends to provide operational and tactical support to the joint warfighter, its true value will be the assurance it provides as a credible strategic <em>deterrent</em> against space attacks.<br />
As a deterrent, ORS provides access to existing capabilities, or rapid deployment and employment of new capabilities, denying the benefits our adversaries may seek by attacking our space capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Through timely and accurate intelligence, we can work to understand our adversaries’ intent and armed with this knowledge, we gain the opportunity to influence their decision-making calculus<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Understanding intent, coupled with credible and timely ORS capabilities, can effectively deny or greatly reduce the benefits they seek by attacking the asymmetric advantages enabled by space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ORS provides a responsiveness that will allow the commander, US Strategic Command (CDR USSTRATCOM), to respond and support our combatant commands real-time and near-term requirements. To support these requirements, </span>ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations.</span><br />
Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space. In fact, </span>a deterrence strategy that includes the threat of punishment<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form, mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy; a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy </span>is not directly applicable to space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.6</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space.</span><br />
Instead,deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries (against their most prized assets<span style="font-size: 8pt;">);9 </span>and encourage their restraint<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
A New Focus of Deterrence<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">What does deterrence look like in the 21</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">st </span></em><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">century? The US has not yet figured that out, said Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Sandra I. Erwin, </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Future of War—How the Game is Changing</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">… Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.… </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ US National Security Strategy, 2006</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making.”10 In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. </span>Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations even in a contested environment.<br />
Deny the Benefits—ORS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Examples<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) view of space: Space shifting from enabler to key battleground. Space characterized as important because it contributes to information dominance; space now described as important in its own right….many in the PLA see space as a likely future arena for conflict.</span></em><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ Space and PRC National Security,’ Dean Cheng, China specialist, The Heritage Foundation, 8 October 2008.12</span><br />
The purpose to benefit denial is to convince an adversary that their intent will not be achieved, or have little to no value. Today, our ability to field ORS capabilities is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Instead, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency. However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “</span>our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”14</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Moving forward, </span>to be a true deterrent, ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). </span>Tier 1 and Two ORS capabilities can be deployed and employed rapidly, within hours to days. The cost for Tier 1 includes implementing new concept of operations for deployed on-orbit systems, or the rapid, low cost launch and deployment of systems intended to augment existing systems for Tier 2<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>Small satellites and reconstitution gives the US the ability to prevail in a space conflict</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">RESPONSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE</span><br />
A robust and responsive space infrastructure enables a spacefaring nation to present agile responses to<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> man-made </span>threats, debris, and changes in the space environment<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A responsive space infrastructure augments the other pillars of space assurance and provides a needed back-up in event of their failure. According to Lawrence Cooper:</span><br />
Responsive space is the ability to put a satellite payload into orbit shortly after making the decision to launch. It includes the ability to replace failed satellites quickly<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, to re-attempt a launch after an aborted try, </span>and to respond to operational requirements to satisfy national security interests<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Responsive space provides the means for assured access to space. An objective goal for responsive space could be operating the satellite in hours to days from the decision to launch vice the current paradigm of months to years. Responsive space creates the possibility of adding an additional dimension to the United States’ space power by increasing the robustness of military and commercial satellite systems. </span>By pursuing a strategy of responsive space, space systems become less vulnerable<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not from harder systems or active countermeasures, but through ubiquity. </span>Such a strategy pushes satellites to become less expensive and lighter; launch services more versatile and responsive; and satellite operations become faster and more flexible. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">If industry makes it simpler and quicker to place satellites in orbit, the satellites also become less vulnerable because any damage or shortfalls can be replaced on short notice; and operations become more flexible because supplementary capability is always available.77</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Much of the early emphasis for responsive space was on implementing transformational process changes in the way space systems are acquired and operated. While the term ‘‘transformational’’ no longer holds the e´lan it once held in the early 2000s, when the then Office of Force Transformation championed funding and concept development for responsive space, proponents place great value on how these proposed systems have the potential to provide tremendous flexibility and options to decision makers and commanders.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This responsiveness theme has understandably been picked up in the DOD Plan for Operationally Responsive Space (ORS). Its formulation focuses on assuring availability of timely and needed space capabilities for joint force commanders, delivering these warfighting needs through a three-tier construct—from hours-to-days, weeks-to-months, and then to no more than one year. The DOD approach also acknowledges needs to reconstitute, augment, or surge space capabilities in event of conflict.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">However, </span>as structured, the current ORS program stops short of pushing credible long-term acquisition approaches needed for a space strategy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As stated in Joint Publication 3–14, Space Operations, ‘‘Strategic or long-term needs are not a primary focus of ORS.’’78 The rationale also suffers because its construct is based, in part, on false premises. First, the descriptive term ‘‘responsive space’’ implies that the space community has not been responsive to warfighter needs. This has not been the case, and senior U.S. military space leaders have argued indignantly against this conclusion in various conferences and forums. They contend that the space community has been responsive in satisfying warfighter needs, as the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and elsewhere have borne out. Second, the rationale implies warfighters need the space community to develop and sustain the capability to deliver new, just-in-time technologies, or solutions to satisfy battlefield and battlespace needs. The practical business and budgeting realities of indulging the second purported need have not been comprehensively explored.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">No doubt, </span>military and national space systems are needed to survive a space ‘‘Pearl Harbor,’’ to reconstitute those systems to ensure they are available to support the warfighter<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. ‘‘Reconstitution refers to plans and operations for replenishing lost or diminished space capabilities. This includes repositioning, reconfiguring unaffected and surviving assets, augmenting capabilities with civil and commercial capabilities, and replacing lost assets.’’79 </span>If such capabilities can be developed, they would allow the United States to respond to an adversary attack by rapidly replacing or reconfiguring systems destroyed or degraded by enemy action.This would also ensure that during periods of increased tension or conflict, the United States would be able to launch and deploy new or replacement space assets and capabilities, and also augment the systems already on orbit.<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Instead of using a pure reconstitution approach, </span>the United States could choose instead to change its satellite designs to small single-purpose vehicles deployed in large distributed constellations to obtain continuous Earth coverage. This would effect a profound acquisition strategy change for the DOD and its civil counterparts<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as heretofore they have focused on acquiring much larger flagship-class satellites, each dubbed a ‘‘Battlestar Galactica.’’ The DOD has experimented with small satellites, but usually only to demonstrate new technologies.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As noted in this paper’s discussion of space protection and defenses, </span>large constellation architectures can offer a good measure of redundancy. This, in turn, could deny an adversary an opportunity to target only a few critical on-orbit satellites. Creating and sustaining large constellations will require responsive and more affordable launch capabilities, technology, infrastructure, and organization<span style="font-size: 8pt;">s. The operations must be fully integrated to ensure system survivability. </span>Responsive spacelift must include launch capabilities with improved mobility attributes, and must also be able to provide the proliferation needed to reduce adversary opportunities to target systems, while they are in a launch preparation phase<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, to assure continued access, satellite operations must be conducted to sustain on-orbit capabilities, and, as needed, activate on-orbit spares.</span><br />

<strong>Expanding ORS will deter attacks against US space assets</strong><br />

<br />
The U<span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span>has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. </span>The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that </span>efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities.<span style="font-size: 6pt;">,,39 Further, </span>the DoD's <em>Plan for Operationally Responsive Space</em> highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness and adaptability to the threat<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1 implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , </span>ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. </span>Field-ready systems would provide a credible defensive deterrent against existing and likely Chinese offensive anti-satellite actions.<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Space Situational Awareness</span><br />
Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy. The U<span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span>must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>Although the U<span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span>maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (SSN) network, </span>it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space<span style="font-size: 6pt;">;</span> the<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> February 10, 2009 </span>collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. </span>Improved SSA also allows the U<span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span>to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Intelligence</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Preplanned Satellite Actions</span><br />
Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting to an anti-satellite attack. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These </span>orbital maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the anti-satellite weapon<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. </span>If a conflict looks to be inevitable, they could decide to rapidly execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. If the conflict escalates into a conventional war, the single maneuver may buy the U<span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span>enough time to execute a kinetic strike that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program.<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Variable and Rapid Launch Capability</span><br />
The current United States Department of Defense launch complex does not have the capability to rapidly replenish satellites in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Small Satellites</span><br />
The United States must also make a move towards smaller satellites that use a common bus and architecture<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>A single launch vehicle could then deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the rapid establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict or replenishment of an old one<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 </span>Having numerous small satellites ready to launch can also lesson the need to perform defensive orbital maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Finally, </span>small satellites are inherently harder to track whether by radar or optical telescopes<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Decreased Dependence on Space Systems</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, </span>defense against the long term radiation effects must focus on hardening all future satellites against nuclear explosions. Without hardening, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite replenishment could take months and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Institutional Changes</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Transparency</span><br />
The above actions may deter China from further pursuing its anti-satellite programs, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<strong>Engagement</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic· missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Additionally, </span>the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.53 </span>Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, </span>proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, </span>these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that can damage satellite systems<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. “</span>A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.”56</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">CONCLUSION</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Council on Foreign Relations</span><br />
The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degrade US military capabilities in a conflict with China. The United States should rely on a defensive space strategy to deter Chinese anti-satellite actions. The strategy must include robust space situational awareness, preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. </span>The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58</span><br />

<span style="color: #231f20;">Satellites can be defended against some kinds of direct kinetic attacks</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. They can be moved out of range of the attacker’s terminal engagement sensors, if there is enough warning and accurate track of the interceptor and enough understanding of the kill mechanism, and if the satellite has been designed to withstand the loads created by the movement. There may be ways to confuse or defeat the sensors used to detect and track the target satellite, either in initial acquisition or in terminal engagement. The target might also be protected by active defenses, although with intercept occurring only about ten minutes after launch, the defenses will probably need to be directed energy rather than kinetic weapons. </span><span style="color: #231f20;">Either case would require precise situational awareness—exact information about the technology and operation of the attack—together with major advances in command and control for the defenses</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">Even without enemy action, satellites in orbit might provide less space support than needed. Satellites might be lost to collisions with debris or other objects; or essential components might fail.</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;"> Or it may be that prewar planning proved inaccurate, that more support is needed to meet unforeseen needs, or that demand for space support at the outbreak of crisis proves much greater than had been anticipated.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20;">These problems are not remedied by defenses; instead, they call for a supplemental capability, to augment capacity to meet surging needs and to replace lost or failed sensors</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. Some of this supplemental capability might be found already in orbit: the communications and intelligence satellites of commercial entities and allied governments. While not all of the products of these systems will be militarily useful to the U.S.—and probably none will possess the capability of analogous U.S. government systems—the diversity of information they could provide and the speed with which it could be available would surely prove advantageous.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">More capable systems, fully compatible with U.S. forces and fully under U.S. control, could in principle be stored in orbit; the engineering requirements for long-term storage and return to full operation seem well understood</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. At the same time, these systems might themselves suffer on-orbit misadventures, might potentially be targeted, and might prove useless in the face of unforeseen needs. Still, this approach offers the fastest, and probably the most expensive, path to the most capable supplementary systems.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">Supplements might be provided more cheaply and more reliably if they were stored on the ground, ready to be launched in response to the developing needs of joint force commanders. </span><span style="color: #231f20;">If these supplemental systems could be launched and brought into operation quickly enough, the time required for adversaries to detect, track, and assess them might deter antisatellite attacks completely</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">. If launched before hostilities began, </span><span style="color: #231f20;">these supplements would confront adversaries with the need to prepare revised and more complicated plans for attacks in space, perhaps with less confidence that all important systems were in the crosshairs</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">If launched as replacements for satellites </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">initially lost to enemy action, the supplements would shrink the advantage that was sought in attacking the original satellites. If the U.S. </span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">coupled its supplemental replacements with vigorous offensive counterspace actions of its own, an enemy’s initial attacks would leave the U.S. with a diminished yet effective set of space assets and the enemy with none. All in all, </span><span style="color: #231f20;">being able to supplement or restore needed capability in orbit would likely prove a stabilizing and deterring influence; not being destructive weapons themselves, the supplements could scarcely be considered escalatory</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>Small satellites make successful attacks against US assets impossible</strong><br />
<strong>Smith, 11</strong> – USAF Colonel, Director of the Air Force Space and Cyber Center at Air University. He served in the Pentagon’s National Security Space Office as the Chief of the Future Concepts shop (M.V., Toward a Theory of Space Power: Selected Essays, February, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Although offense is the dominant form of war in space today, this will not always be the case. Defense is possible. Three principles will likely guide the development of future space defenses.<br />
First, <em>if you can't see it, you can't hit it</em>. Satellites are already getting smaller—too small for most space surveillance networks to detect and track. This trend will likely continue not only as a matter of cost savings, but also as a matter of stealthy defense. Avoiding detection includes maneuvering satellites to undisclosed wartime orbits.<br />
Second, <em>all warfare is based on deception</em>.34 Potential adversaries collect intelligence on each other's space systems and make their estimates based on their intelligence assessments. Action must be taken to deceive potential adversaries into underestimating the value of critical systems and overestimating the value of inconsequential systems. In addition, the use of wartime-only modes of operation, frequencies, and other unanticipated behaviors will further complicate an adversary's problems.<br />
Third, <em>there is strength in numbers</em>. <em>The age of the capital satellites is over</em>. Employing only one or two large, very expensive satellites to fulfill a critical mission area, such as reconnaissance, is foolish. Future space systems must be large constellations of smaller, cheaper, and, in many cases, lower-fidelity systems swarming in various orbits that exploit ground processing to derive high-fidelity solutions. In addition, swarms improve global access and presence.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The plan discourages attacks from happening in the first place </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Schendzielos, 2008</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Kurt, Major in the U.S. Air Force, School of Advanced Military Studies, “Protection in Space: A Self-Defense Acquisition Priority for U.S. Satellites”, April 30, <span style="font-size: 11pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA485553" rel="nofollow">http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA485553</a></span>)</span><br />
The first and most obvious advantage of developing timely and responsive satellite defenses is that America’s critical space capability would be preserved. Some of the technologies like increasing redundancy or whipple bumpers and nanotechnology can provide additional protection not only against ASATs but against a whole host of natural electromagnetic and projectile events that occur every day. Since nature can sometimes represent the biggest threat to the largest number of U.S. satellites, the additional protection ensures the availability of space exploitation when needed. The expeditionary nature of the American military depends greatly upon space for command and control, and modern military battlefields almost require precision weapons, many of which are also dependent upon space assets. Unfettered space support is necessary for the U.S. military to continue to function as it has over the past decade and predicted to do so in the future. Many of the technologies presented as possible near-term candidates have been developed for terrestrial application. Just as the technology transfer can go from air assets to space assets, so can the applications of some of the technologies developed for protecting satellites. The miniaturization and autonomous processing that will inevitably precipitate from micro- and nano-satellite development can greatly aid unmanned aircraft development in addition to other air, sea, and ground platforms.163 Aircraft could be made lighter and more capable. Ships could conserve space for additional supplies and ground vehicles could be made more reliable and have more room to carry additional equipment or supplies. Nanotechnology shielding could produce new means of concealing military vehicles from a vast array of sensors including from electronic sniffers.164 Just as the space race of the 1960s produced a great deal of spin off technologies, not just for NASA, but for the U.S. military and for the civilian population as well. Similar spin offs can be reasonably expected from developing effective satellite ASAT defense.<br />
Lastly, building an overwhelming defense may actually discourage adversary nations from pursuing offensive capabilities against the U.S.165 “If a weapon is vulnerable, yet capable of dramatically affecting the outcome of a conflict, the state that possesses it has an even more powerful incentive to employ the weapon early on in a conflict”166 Conversely, if a weapon is vulnerable and not capable of affecting the outcome of a conflict, which satellite self-defensewould achieve against current generation ASATS, then there would be little motivation to resort to ASATs.<br />
It has been noted that often treaties designed to limit the research, development or production of an offensive space capability are simply a means to try to balance the overwhelming advantage of one nation over another. Much of the motivation for treaty proposals concerning banning ASATs and space weaponization are presented by nations who do not have a large stake in space, but would like to curb the disparate advantage enjoyed by the major space powers. Producing an overwhelming space defense may actually cause the Chinese and other space adversaries to negotiate and seriously abide by effective and lasting prohibitions against ASATs and space weapons.167<br />

<strong><span style="color: black;">A stable, predictable funding stream is vital to ORS technology development</span></strong><br />
<span class="apple-converted-space"><strong><span style="color: #101010;">Dinerman, 6</span></strong></span>– DOD space consultant, and <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">senior editor at the Hudson Institute’s New York branch (Taylor, The Space Review, “</span></em><span style="color: black;">Tactical IR satellites: operationally responsive spacecraft?,” 8/7, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/675/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/675/1</a><br />
<br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">The </span><span style="color: black;">troops on the ground need information they can use in a timely and easily understood format</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Simply to provide them, or division or brigade intelligence staffs that support them, with raw satellite data is probably worse than useless. </span><span style="color: black;">The next generations of US Army and Marine Corps units are going to require information that can be integrated into their “network-centric” information systems</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="color: black;">Imagery from space-based infrared sensors that are specifically designed for tactical utility should be part of these networks.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">This is a mission for a future constellation of small “operationally responsive” satellites.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> Part of the constellation should be kept in orbits that take them over places such as south Lebanon or the Afghan-Pakistani border where we can assume that there will be trouble for a long time to come. These should be carefully calibrated on a constant basis, so that their positioning information is ultra-precise. Other satellites can be kept on the ground ready to be launched at relatively short notice to supplement the ones on orbit over the world’s trouble spots, or they could be launched to cover unexpected outbreaks of fighting.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">A model for the way such a program could be run is GPS, which, over almost three decades, has gone from prototypes to sets of more and more sophisticated and capable satellites. These spacecraft have, on the whole, been both cost effective and free of the kinds of nasty and expensive surprises that have plagued SBIRS and other Air Force satellite programs.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">An operationally responsive tactical IR satellite system would have to be both affordable and based on proven and reliable technology. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">The first generation of such satellites may not have all the desired features, but if properly designed—with the right filters and the right level of multi- or hyper-spectral sensitivity—such craft would give the ground forces a valuable early operational capability.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">To make the program affordable it would have to be designed to use already existing bus and power supply systems and probably also an in-service communications architecture. </span><span style="color: black;">It would have to be light enough to be launched on a Delta 2 or on a future operationally responsive spacelift vehicle. Most important of all, the funding stream</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">—</span><span style="color: black;">no matter how much or how little—would have to be predictable so that the contractors would have the incentive to plan for the long term</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. This would be the most difficult part of the program since it would mean asking Congress to give up part of its power over the annual budget cycle.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Another way to keep the program affordable would be to keep the early requirements to a minimum. The first versions should be strictly for ground force use only, with perhaps some applications for Marine Corps amphibious warfare requirements. Only after the system has proven itself should the program be allowed to move on to develop air-to-ground sensor-to-shooter loops.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Ultimately a constellation of a dozen or so spacecraft in orbit, backed up by a similar number on the ground, would be ideal for the early versions of the full system. The ground segments will have to be as simple and as inexpensive as possible since it will need to be deployed with more than fifty Army and Marine brigade-sized units as well as with higher headquarters.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">If the idea of operationally responsive space means anything, it means that the military space forces</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, particularly Air Force Space Command, </span><span style="color: black;">are ready to give priority to supporting the troops on the front lines worldwide. Enhancing the combat effectiveness of the Army and the Marines and helping to save American lives should be the highest goal</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. As Clausewitz put it, “The object of fighting is the destruction or defeat of the enemy.” </span><span style="color: black;">The more that military space contributes directly to that objective, the better for the troops on the ground and for America as a whole.</span><br />

ORS is a program for launching satellites quickly and at low cost – it covers both launch system and satellite development<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Wertz, 8</span> - president of Microcosm, a space technology small business in Los Angeles, and the general chairman for the first five Responsive Space Conferences (James, “It’s time to get our ORS in gear,” The Space Review, 1/7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1032/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1032/1</a>)<br />
<br />
First, a bit of background. ORS officially consists of three tiers:<br />
<ul><li>Tier 1: Rapidly exploit existing assets</li><li>Tier 2: Rapidly launch low-cost satellites from inventory</li><li>Tier 3: Rapidly and economically develop and build new satellites</li></ul>For the official definition of what all this means, read the DoD <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.responsivespace.com/ors/reference/ORS_Plan.pdf" rel="nofollow">//ORS Report to Congress//</a> of April 17, 2007. (It can be downloaded from the Responsive Space website, <span style="color: #003366;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.responsivespace.com/" rel="nofollow">www.responsivespace.com</a></span>. This site also has all of the technical papers from the first five Responsive Space conferences that provide the technical background for most of the ORS work to date.) However, for the purpose of looking at ORS in the broader, non-bureaucratic context, I’ll argue that ORS consists of launching satellites quickly (i.e., within a few hours of a previously unidentified demand) and at low cost (less than $20–$25 million for the launch, payload, spacecraft bus, and one year of operations, but not including the non-recurring development cost). This is Tier 2 in the government terminology, although the government hasn’t yet bought into the cost or time numbers.<br />
<br />
ORS includes small spacecraft, rapid launch capabilities, and satellite replacement<br />

<br />
Despite some incongruent elements, the common thread throughout all these definitions is the use of small, spacecraft quickly launched when needed to support joint forces. A major justification, though not mentioned consistently in many ORS definitions, is the reconstitution of incapacitated spacecraft.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ORS is inevitable – other space powers will do it if the US doesn’t<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Wertz, 8 </span>- president of Microcosm, a space technology small business in Los Angeles, and the general chairman for the first five Responsive Space Conferences (James, “It’s time to get our ORS in gear,” The Space Review, 1/7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1032/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1032/1</a>)<br />
<br />
Can the US overcome bureaucratic impediments in order to make it happen?<br />
Here we would have to say that no one knows. It may or may not occur for all of the reasons that Dwayne Day has clearly pointed out. The need for ORS has been formalized for some years in the <em>Operationally Responsive Spacelift Mission Need Statement</em> (ORS MNS) of December 20, 2001. But that does not mean that it will actually come about. There are a variety of entrenched interests and organizational sandboxes arrayed against ORS, or trying to reshape it in their own image. This is, of course, the same process that has brought us $32 billion in cost overruns in the ten largest DoD space programs according to a 2007 <em>Aviation Week</em> article. We would have to conclude that the odds of success are slim, but not zero. In many past technology developments, it has been Congress that has made things happen. That may or may not occur here.<br />
One thing seems clear: if ORS doesn’t happen in the US, it will certainly happen elsewhere. According to a DoD 2007 assessment, the Chinese have already announced a near-term goal of launching satellites within hours of demand. The Russians have been able to do so for years. The Europeans are well ahead of the US in a formalized process for creating low-cost space missions. The rest of the world will move ahead with the capability to respond rapidly to changing world events, irrespective of whether the US chooses to do so.<br />

RLVs cut launch costs by 90%<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Collins and Tanaguchi 97</span> (1997, Patrick Collins and H. Tanaguchi, Space Future,“The Promise of Reusable Launch Vehicles for SPS”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/the_promise_of_reusable_launch_vehicles_for_sps.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/the_promise_of_reusable_launch_vehicles_for_sps.shtml</a> , FS)<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: none;">However, with the end of the Cold War, taxpayers' willingness to pay for the activities of government space agencies has been declining, and their budgets are being cut. This has led space agencies to acknowledge that launch costs are too high: Mr Goldin, the administrator of NASA, even stated that the US space industry should &quot;...hang their heads in shame&quot; because they have not developed a new rocket engine for 25 years (1). This revival of interest in developing re-usable launch vehicles with much lower launch costs has created a growing body of opinion that, with appropriate technology development, reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) could be developed with operating costs of 10% of today's costs or less. Some of the more important projects under way are described briefly in the following section. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 13px;">Nuclear test ban ratification. China signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in 1996 and has not yet ratified it, partly because the U. S. Senate rejected it in 1999. However, U.S. missile defense and space weaponization plans make it politically difficult for China to consider ratification.The cessation of nuclear weapons test explosions and all other nuclear explosions, as called for in the CTBT, would constrain qualitative improvement of China’s existing nuclear weapons and the development of new advanced weapons. In the event of a continuing challenge from the United States, China would need further nuclear tests to avoid a major degradation or neutralization of their limited retaliatory capability. For example, China may need additional nuclear tests to reduce the size of new warheads as needed for deployment of MIRVed missiles or complicated decoys. The development of maneuvering warheads would also require tests.145 </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 13px;">Already, some Chinese scientists and arms control experts believe that China made significant sacrifices in signing the CTBT, arguing that the CTBT places more direct constraints on China’s nuclear weapons program than on the weapons programs of other states.146 However, to achieve the goal of complete prohibition and eventual destruction of nuclear weapons, China decided to sign the treaty despite its drawbacks. Many Chinese question why other nations, including China, should care about an international agreement such as the CTBT when the United States, in pursuing its own absolute security, damages the security of other nations and expresses no interest in international treaties. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 13px;">The United States is key to progress. But the US Senate's highly partisan 1999 rejection of the CTBT, the opposition of the Bush administration, and the reluctance of the nine other CTBT hold-outs have left the treaty to languish. It never enjoyed formal entry into force and this inaction has left the door open to renewed nuclear testing. The new Senate leadership should make <strong>reinvigoration of the global nonproliferation regime</strong> a high priority. Ratifying the CTBT could provide a <strong>centerpiece</strong> to demonstrating a change in leadership: the US rejoining the rest of the world to promote international cooperative agreements, from reducing global warming to keeping lethal WMD material out of the hands of criminals and terrorists. This can't happen too soon. North Korea has marched through the open door with its first underground test of an atomic device. There is widespread agreement that the test has escalated tension in the region and raised the stakes in the stand-off with the United States. It could also destroy the prospects for the CTBT and open the floodgates to more nuclear-armed states. While we welcome the current agreement with Pyonyang which may ultimately eliminate the North Korean nuclear program, and lead to a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, the details of implementation have yet to be worked out, and already, strong conservative opposition to the agreement is beginning to appear. The door to an alternative way forward is also still open, and the United States could seize the <strong>moral high ground</strong> by leading the world through it. If President Bush were to press the Senate to reconsider and support ratification of the treaty, it could be part of a far-reaching strategy for <strong>shoring up the North Korean agreement</strong>, peacefully <strong>tackling the Iranian nuclear program</strong> and <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif';">for</span>preventing a world with <strong>40 or more nuclear weapons.</strong> The North Korean and Iranian nuclear crises exemplify an increasing number of damaging developments that make it clear that the non-proliferation system needs to be <strong>strengthened</strong> and updated, not neglected or discarded. The international community must not only work together to develop more effective diplomatic approaches towards North Korea and Iran, but it must also apply stricter international safeguards on all nuclear programs, prevent the spread of uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing, secure a global halt to the production of fissile material for weapons purposes, take new steps to reduce the number and role of nuclear weapons and achieve the entry into force of the CTBT. If, in 1963, at the height of the Cold War, the US, UK, and USSR could negotiate a limited test ban treaty. Why can't we ratify a comprehensive treaty now? Were we less threatened then? Are Iran and North Korea greater threats to the United States than was the USSR? The CTBT is vital to a system of security that <strong>does not rely on nuclear weapons</strong>. Its entry into force would put a <strong>cap on the nuclear age</strong>. Posturing for domestic politics and insisting on a macho attitude in international relations has dangerous long-term implications, both for America and the rest of the world. Since the Bush administration has come to power, global non-proliferation has gone into a holding pattern at best, a <strong>tailspin at worst</strong>. That can only lead to a world overpopulated with nuclear weapons and a <strong>nuclear war sooner or later</strong>. The consequences do not bear thinking about. So it is vital that CTBT supporters put the treaty back on the American and European political agenda and move to secure ratification by other key states.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 13px;">This analysis must take into account the effects on other states of a decision by the US to modernize its nuclear arsenal. Too many people, especially those connected with the American defense establishment, seem to ignore the vast majority of states that are neither close allies nor sworn adversaries of the US. These states vehemently reject the discriminatory nature of the nonproliferation regime and are urging the US and other nuclear-armed states to live up to their commitments to work towards disarmament. Even when it comes to US adversaries, Senator Kyl and Mr. Perle overstate their case. They state that “a robust American nuclear force is an essential discouragement to nuclear proliferators.” Yet, the United States’ huge nuclear arsenal failed to deter North Korea’s and Iran’s nuclear programs and has done nothing to help it resolve these crises. President Obama stated this week in Moscow that it is essential for the US to lead the world by example. He correctly believes that if there is to be the required international support for a much-needed strengthening of the nonproliferation regime the US must take its disarmament commitments seriously. Ratification of the CTBT before the 2010 NPT Review Conference should be a top priority.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">As is well understood, the space policies of the Bush administration were decidedly oriented toward military security concerns and independent action. The 2006 National Space Policy unabashedly proclaimed the U.S. intention to maintain a dominant position in space indefinitely. This policy orientation dismissed multilateral cooperation as impinging on U.S. “freedom of action,” throwing weight instead behind a wide range of technology development initiatives founded on the assumption that deployment of weapons in space was, if not already factual, certainly inevitable.2 U.S. commercial and civil engagement was overshadowed by these security concerns, expressed through the tightening of export control restrictions inhibiting a broad range of technology sharing. Once again, U.S. space policy was subsumed by other national priorities, in this case dominated by military security concerns.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">This background is essential for appreciating how </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">the space policies of the Obama administration are beginning to genuinely break new trails</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">The U.S. National Space Policy issued in June 2010 has been widely recognized for its cooperative and multilateraltone</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">, including as explicit near-term goals the expansion of international cooperation on all activities and pursuing international as well as national measures to enhance space stability. </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Particularly notable are the document’s emphasis on orienting U.S. “leadership” toward fostering international cooperation</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">, and its references, in its concluding section, to cooperation with other states and non-state actors in the pursuit of national security space objectives.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">Less broadly noticed was this policy’s clarity and coherence in articulating a vision for U.S. space activities on its own terms. The document is organized around core principles, subsidiary goals and implementing guidelines that exceed its predecessors in delineating a longer-term direction for U.S. space policy that is integrated with, rather than derivative of, broader U.S. global aims.4 The policy also was generated and issued far earlier in the tenure of the administration than either of its predecessors, indicating an increased prioritization of attention to space policy at higher levels of policy-making.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">To some degree,</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';"> a turn toward multilateral cooperation in U.S. space policy was to be expected</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">. China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision increased awareness of the challenge of space debris and the need for better global information sharing on space situational awareness (SSA).5 Also, </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">new budget realitiesand unpromising technological developments have scaled back ambitions in some quarters for solving U.S. space security concernswith new independent capabilities</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">. Finally, the Obama administration has pursued a more cooperative disposition across a wide range of global policy challenges, from Iranian nuclear ambitions to global climate change. But the improved clarity of vision in the 2010 Space Policy suggests that the emphasis on fostering global cooperation on space-related activities is more grounded in deliberate foresight than sailing the prevailing political winds.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">The 2011 National Security Space Strategy</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">, released February 4, </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">is best interpreted against this background of the Obama administration’s turn toward both greater international space cooperation</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">and greater attention to space policy in general. This first-of-its-kind strategic statement culminates a congressionally mandated space posture review.6 The initial section portraying the strategic environment to which U.S. security policy must be responsive highlights the growing problems of space debris, orbital congestion and coordination among a growing number of space actors — not state-based security threats per se. The Security Space Strategy features the objective of a “stable space environment in which nations exercise shared responsibility.”7 Specific provisions intended to implement this strategy, relevant to the preceding observations, include:8 </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">• The strategy presents a full section on “Partnering with Responsible Nations, International Organizations, and Commercial Firms.” This category is not wholly multilateral in the traditional sense, displaying a symbiosis of alliance-building and collective cooperation not always carefully distinguished; i.e., “The United States will lead in building coalitions of like-minded space-faring nations and, where appropriate, work with international institutions to do so.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">• The strategy intends to “encourage responsible behavior in space and lead by the power of example,” a significant observation given the tendency of U.S. policy-makers (as noted above) not to expect quid pro quo responses to cooperative gestures. Also, </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">the strategy states the U.S. “will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, and <em>norms of behavior for responsible space operations</em>.”</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;"> [italics added] In the context of the section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression,” the strategy similarly intends to “support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space” as well as “pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint,” along with other measures. </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">This emphasis on norm-building and the role of example suggests a near-term endorsement of the development of “codes of conduct” for space activities</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;"> (such as the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct, discussed below), </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">whether or not such concord leads to more formal arms control arrangements </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">in the longer-term.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">• The Department of Defense is directed to “foster cooperative SSA relationships</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">,” and to “expand provision of </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">safety of flight services to U.S. Government agencies, other nations, and commercial firms.” Greater SSA information sharing has been a key suggestion for fostering international cooperation; the U.S. possesses globally superior SSA capabilities, but restricts the sharing of this information on the basis of national security concerns.9 Hence, this nominal commitment is significant in its own right.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">• </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">The strategy commits to reforming export controls.</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">“In particular, as new opportunities arise for international collaboration, a revised export control system will better enable the domestic firms competing for these contracts.” As noted above, the oppressive impact of current U.S. export controls not only impinges on U.S. commercial space actors but also epitomizes the high degree to which U.S. policy has subsumed commercial and civil interests to national security concerns. The strategy appears to acknowledge this connection and commit to remedy it.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">• The most assertive passages of the statement are moderated with community-building intent. For example, the strategy’s section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression” concludes that the U.S. “will retain the right and capabilities to respond in self-defense, should deterrence fail,” but immediately adds that the U.S. “will use force in a manner that is consistent with longstanding principles of international law, treaties to which the United States is a party, and the inherent right of self defense.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">• The concluding and most conflict-oriented section of the strategy opens by noting that “some actors may still believe counterspace actions could provide military advantage.” Counterspace capabilities, unarticulated in the document, include ASATs, ground-based directed energy weapons and satellite transmission jamming. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy Gregory Schulte explained at the strategy’s rollout that China is a principal concern in this regard, but so is the proliferation of these technologies: “If Ethiopia can jam a commercial satellite, you have to worry what others can do.”10 This section of the strategy does not, however, call for maintaining options to develop complementary space conflict capabilities.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">Rather, the strategy asserts that the U.S. “must be prepared to ‘fight through’ a degraded environment,” and identifies “resilience” and “space protection” as the key criteria.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective, highlighting those elements expressing consistency with the 2010 National Space Policy’s bend toward fostering greater international collaboration. Perhaps </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">as striking </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">as the prevalence of such passages, however, </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">is the absence of expressed intention — even couched in hedging language — to sustain or expand</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;"> the kind of </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">independent space-based military capabilities</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;"> that were the centerpiece of the prior administration’s aims (if not its accomplishments). Again, to some extent this turn in tone is overdetermined by extenuating global circumstances. But one must still be struck by the degree to which developments such as the Chinese ASAT test have not ignited the kind of response one might have anticipated only a few short years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its sends concerning U.S. policy toward the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">.12 The strategy did not explicitly endorse this EU initiative, but Mr. Schulte, at the February 4 presentation of the strategy, highlighted the initiative “as a potential way” to promote “transparency and confidence-building measures, which tend to be voluntary as opposed to legally binding.” A week earlier, Rose Gottemoeller, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, stated at the Conference on Disarmament that the administration was nearing a decision on whether the U.S. would sign on to the code, and what modifications might be required in order to do so.13 As U.S. interest in the Code of Conduct has increased, debates over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">These policy movements toward multilateral engagement and commitment to behavioral standards (even if non-binding) mark a sharp departure from the stiff resistance tocurtailing U.S. “freedom of action” in the previous administration</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">, and have accordingly generated resistance from congressional opponents on just those terms. Prior to the release of the National Security Space Strategy, a group of 37 Republican senators led by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl issued a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concern over a potential multilateral commitment that might limit development and/or deployment of space-based missile defense interceptors and ASAT-defeating systems.14 Critics also decried the strategy’s emphasis on “the old fallacious assumption that the power of example will prevent adversaries from doing the United States harm,” and endorsed maintaining the goal of U.S. retention of a “dominant position in military and intelligence space capabilities.”15 In fact, the administration’s warming toward normative commitments in general — and the EU Code of Conduct in particular — are in part intended to forestall pressure for more formal and binding measures that would definitively cut off the “hedge” of unilateral U.S. weapons development options.16 The balance of U.S. debate may have shifted toward greater international cooperation, but the terms of the debate remain the same.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">In sum, </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing in U.S. policy toward greater global engagement but also,</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;"> and more importantly, </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">a step toward greater long-term coherence in thinking concerning the core goals of U.S. space activities</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">. Even supporters of the general directions of the strategy noted its more-than-expected breadth of thought.17 But if this reading is sound, the strategy is still but one step on a long road, and ongoing debates over the role of U.S. space policy vis-à-vis broader national security interests will insure that road is bumpy. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that more specific guidelines for military implementation of the strategy remain to be developed.18 Many devils may lurk in these details. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Space’s militarization</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;"> — its use as a medium to support military operations — </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">has existed for more than four decades</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;">. Since the height of the Cold War, </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">satellites have monitored nuclear tests and other military activities and facilitated global communications, mapping, and other activities with both military and scientific purposes. Yet space has yet to be weaponized, in that it is not yet a theater for warfare or for the placement of arms, and it remains a global commons open to any actor with the means to access it</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;">. 36 To a large degree, </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">this openness can be credited to a robust set of international agreements that effectively codify space as a global commons.</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;"> When space first became accessible to humanity in the 1950s, the United States proposed an agreement establishing orbits as common spaces beyond traditional conceptions of sovereignty. The Soviet Union initially disagreed, arguing that its sovereign claim over its territorial air space extended to orbit and beyond. Once Moscow saw the benefit of sending satellites into orbit to spy on the West, its conceptions of its sovereign interests changed, and the USSR agreed to establish space as, in effect, a global commons. Although several arms-control agreements helped to solidify space as a commons, the most comprehensive existing international agreement on the use of space is the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">It defines space as an area beyond claims of state sovereignty, but it has a limited focus on military matters — beyond banning weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on any celestial body, and prohibiting the use of celestial bodies for military bases or the testing of weapons. U.S. policy has consistently embraced space as a global commons</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;"> “by all nations for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of all humanity.” 37 Yet the United States has also defended space as a legitimate medium for defense and intelligence activities. The 2006 National Space Policy reinforced an American commitment to the “exploration and use of outer space by all nations for peaceful purposes, and for the benefit of all humanity,” rejected claims of national sovereignty, and reaffirmed the “rights of passage through and operations in space without interference.” On the issue of military objectives, it was quite clear, asserting: The United States considers space capabilities — including the ground and space segments and supporting links — vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities, and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing the capabilities intended to do so; take those actions necessary to protect its space capabilities; respond to interference; and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests. 38</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;">The possibility of space becoming another forum for warfare has long been a fear of the international community. Although many treaties have addressed weapons in space, space actors have been testing the limits of these treaties more and more frequently. </span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">The U</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;">nited </span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">St</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;">ates </span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">has stated that space warfare is inevitable. This possibility isespecially troubling because the global economy depends heavily on outer space.

<span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">A buildup of space weapons might begin with noble intentions of 'peace through strength' deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that '… the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use'.33 This drift toward usage is strengthened by a strategic fact elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, 'anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand'.34 The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent 'dual capability' of spaceborne weapon components. As Marc Vidricaire, Delegation of Canada to the UN Conference on Disarmament, explains: 'If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land'. 35 To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors can also be used as orbiting 'Death Stars', capable of sending munitions hurtling through the Earth's atmosphere. The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense 'use or lose' pressure into strategic calculations, with the spectre of split-second attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting Death Stars with automated 'hair trigger' devices. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict. </span><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8px;">Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed 'complexly interactive, tightly coupled' industrial systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other's flawless performance. According to Perrow, this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail. As Perrow explains, '[t]he odd term &quot;normal accident&quot; is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable'.36</span><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-family: 'georgia','serif';">Deployment of space weapons with pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to 'normal accidents'. It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to retired Lt. Col. Robert M. Bowman, 'even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage — even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!'. 37 In the same Star Wars technology touted as a quintessential tool of peace, defence analyst David Langford sees one of the most destabilizing offensive weapons ever conceived: 'One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people'.38 Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that any nation subjected to space weapon attack would retaliate with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Another unpredictable driving force that needs to be considered is adversary exploitation of space vulnerabilities via the cyber domain. Through cyberspace, enemies (both state and non-state actors) will target industry, academia, government, as well as the military in the air, land, maritime, and space domains.86 One of the easiest ways to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy the utility of space assets is to attack or sabotage the associated ground segments through cyberspace.87 The ground segment includes telemetry, tracking, and commanding of space assets and space-launch functions. Ground stations are an extremely critical piece of a satellites continued operation. However, many satellite tracking and control stations are lightly guarded and many satellite communications, launch, data reception, and control facilities are described in numerous open-source materials making the ground segment extremely vulnerable to cyber attack.88 Anattack on a fixed ground facility can stop data transmission, render launch facilities unusable, and prevent control of satellites.89 Thus, rendering affected orbiting satellites inoperative from the communication disruption and creating a risk to other active satellites and a potential for additional orbital debris. A single incident or a small number of incidents couldsignificantly impact space systems for years.90</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;">It is obvious that </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">American space systems do have inherent vulnerabilities</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;">.

<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">These dilemmas are widely, but not universally, recognized. Together with the widespread public antipathy to elevating humankind's worst practices into space, they help explain why the flight-testing and deployment of dedicated space weapons have not become commonplace. These capabilities are certainly not difficult to acquire, as they are decades old. Indeed, tests of dedicated ASAT weapons have periodically occurred, and such systems were deployed for short periods during the Cold War. If the weaponization of space were inevitable, it surely would have occurred when the United States and the Soviet Union went to extraordinary lengths to compete in so many other realms. The weaponization of space has not occurred to date and is not inevitable in the future because of strong public resistence to the idea of weapons in space, and because most national leaders have long recognized that this would open a Pandora's box that would be difficult to close.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;">Prevent Crisis Escalation. </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Communication between the U.S. and China on space issues has been limited.</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;"> Accordingly, </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">there is a great deal of misinterpretation, misrepresentation and poor assumptions made by each side as to their respective intentions in space</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;">. The U.S. must not assume it understands the intentions of China and should strive to learn more from China through study and personal interaction. Two Congressmen, Reps. Mark Kirk and Rick Larsen reinforce this idea. They serve as cochairs of the U.S.-China Working Group in the House of Representatives (as of Jan 2006). The working group was formed in Jun 2005 to raise awareness about China among Congressional members and advise them on how to work with the country. Rep.

Although these treaties were arguably the result of a common understanding that national survival was at stake, lessons learned can and should be effectively applied in other situations.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11px;">Strategic dialogue also helps to “put a face to the name” and increase familiarity between both parties.

Some states, </span>notably China and the Russian Federation, have intensified their demands for the CD to undertake negotiations to prevent the weaponization of space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>In June 2002, the Russian Federation and China<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, together with Indonesia, Belarus, Viet Nam, Zimbabwe and Syria, </span>co-sponsored a working paper on ‘Possible Elements for a Future International Legal Agreement on the Prevention of the Deployment of Weapons in Outer Space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects’.45 Consisting of thirteen articles, </span>the working paper was laid out as a draft treaty with the object of stimulating the early start of substantive discussions in the CD on the issue of PAROS<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.46 </span>The preamble stated that ‘only a treaty-based prohibition of the deployment of weapons in outer space and the prevention of the threat or use of force against outer space objects can eliminate the emerging threat of an arms race in outer space and ensure the security for outer space assets of all countries which is an essential condition for the maintenance of world peace’.<br />

 <strong>US multilateral leadership is creating a framework against weaponization</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">As is well understood, the space policies of the Bush administration were decidedly oriented toward military security concerns and independent action. The 2006 National Space Policy unabashedly proclaimed the U.S. intention to maintain a dominant position in space indefinitely. This policy orientation dismissed multilateral cooperation as impinging on U.S. “freedom of action,” throwing weight instead behind a wide range of technology development initiatives founded on the assumption that deployment of weapons in space was, if not already factual, certainly inevitable.2 U.S. commercial and civil engagement was overshadowed by these security concerns, expressed through the tightening of export control restrictions inhibiting a broad range of technology sharing. Once again, U.S. space policy was subsumed by other national priorities, in this case dominated by military security concerns.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">This background is essential for appreciating how </span>the space policies of the Obama administration are beginning to genuinely break new trails<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>The U.S. National Space Policy issued in June 2010 has been widely recognized for its cooperative and multilateral tone<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, including as explicit near-term goals the expansion of international cooperation on all activities and pursuing international as well as national measures to enhance space stability. </span>Particularly notable are the document’s emphasis on orienting U.S. “leadership” toward fostering international cooperation<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, and its references, in its concluding section, to cooperation with other states and non-state actors in the pursuit of national security space objectives.3</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Less broadly noticed was this policy’s clarity and coherence in articulating a vision for U.S. space activities on its own terms. The document is organized around core principles, subsidiary goals and implementing guidelines that exceed its predecessors in delineating a longer-term direction for U.S. space policy that is integrated with, rather than derivative of, broader U.S. global aims.4 The policy also was generated and issued far earlier in the tenure of the administration than either of its predecessors, indicating an increased prioritization of attention to space policy at higher levels of policy-making.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">To some degree,</span> a turn toward multilateral cooperation in U.S. space policy was to be expected<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision increased awareness of the challenge of space debris and the need for better global information sharing on space situational awareness (SSA).5 Also, </span>new budget realities and unpromising technological developments have scaled back ambitions in some quarters for solving U.S. space security concerns with new independent capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Finally, the Obama administration has pursued a more cooperative disposition across a wide range of global policy challenges, from Iranian nuclear ambitions to global climate change. But the improved clarity of vision in the 2010 Space Policy suggests that the emphasis on fostering global cooperation on space-related activities is more grounded in deliberate foresight than sailing the prevailing political winds.</span><br />
The 2011 National Security Space Strategy<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, released February 4, </span>is best interpreted against this background of the Obama administration’s turn toward both greater international space cooperation<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and greater attention to space policy in general. This first-of-its-kind strategic statement culminates a congressionally mandated space posture review.6 The initial section portraying the strategic environment to which U.S. security policy must be responsive highlights the growing problems of space debris, orbital congestion and coordination among a growing number of space actors — not state-based security threats per se. The Security Space Strategy features the objective of a “stable space environment in which nations exercise shared responsibility.”7 Specific provisions intended to implement this strategy, relevant to the preceding observations, include:8 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">• The strategy presents a full section on “Partnering with Responsible Nations, International Organizations, and Commercial Firms.” This category is not wholly multilateral in the traditional sense, displaying a symbiosis of alliance-building and collective cooperation not always carefully distinguished; i.e., “The United States will lead in building coalitions of like-minded space-faring nations and, where appropriate, work with international institutions to do so.”</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">• The strategy intends to “encourage responsible behavior in space and lead by the power of example,” a significant observation given the tendency of U.S. policy-makers (as noted above) not to expect quid pro quo responses to cooperative gestures. Also, </span>the strategy states the U.S. “will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, and <em>norms of behavior for responsible space operations</em>.”<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> [italics added] In the context of the section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression,” the strategy similarly intends to “support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space” as well as “pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint,” along with other measures. </span>This emphasis on norm-building and the role of example suggests a near-term endorsement of the development of “codes of conduct” for space activities<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (such as the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct, discussed below), </span>whether or not such concord leads to more formal arms control arrangements <span style="font-size: 6pt;">in the longer-term.</span><br />
• The Department of Defense is directed to “foster cooperative SSA relationships<span style="font-size: 6pt;">,” and to “expand provision of </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">safety of flight services to U.S. Government agencies, other nations, and commercial firms.” Greater SSA information sharing has been a key suggestion for fostering international cooperation; the U.S. possesses globally superior SSA capabilities, but restricts the sharing of this information on the basis of national security concerns.9 Hence, this nominal commitment is significant in its own right.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">• </span>The strategy commits to reforming export controls.<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> “In particular, as new opportunities arise for international collaboration, a revised export control system will better enable the domestic firms competing for these contracts.” As noted above, the oppressive impact of current U.S. export controls not only impinges on U.S. commercial space actors but also epitomizes the high degree to which U.S. policy has subsumed commercial and civil interests to national security concerns. The strategy appears to acknowledge this connection and commit to remedy it.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">• The most assertive passages of the statement are moderated with community-building intent. For example, the strategy’s section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression” concludes that the U.S. “will retain the right and capabilities to respond in self-defense, should deterrence fail,” but immediately adds that the U.S. “will use force in a manner that is consistent with longstanding principles of international law, treaties to which the United States is a party, and the inherent right of self defense.”</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">• The concluding and most conflict-oriented section of the strategy opens by noting that “some actors may still believe counterspace actions could provide military advantage.” Counterspace capabilities, unarticulated in the document, include ASATs, ground-based directed energy weapons and satellite transmission jamming. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy Gregory Schulte explained at the strategy’s rollout that China is a principal concern in this regard, but so is the proliferation of these technologies: “If Ethiopia can jam a commercial satellite, you have to worry what others can do.”10 This section of the strategy does not, however, call for maintaining options to develop complementary space conflict capabilities.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Rather, the strategy asserts that the U.S. “must be prepared to ‘fight through’ a degraded environment,” and identifies “resilience” and “space protection” as the key criteria.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective, highlighting those elements expressing consistency with the 2010 National Space Policy’s bend toward fostering greater international collaboration. Perhaps </span>as striking <span style="font-size: 6pt;">as the prevalence of such passages, however, </span>is the absence of expressed intention — even couched in hedging language — to sustain or expand<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the kind of </span>independent space-based military capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that were the centerpiece of the prior administration’s aims (if not its accomplishments). Again, to some extent this turn in tone is overdetermined by extenuating global circumstances. But one must still be struck by the degree to which developments such as the Chinese ASAT test have not ignited the kind of response one might have anticipated only a few short years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 </span><br />
The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its sends concerning U.S. policy toward the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.12 The strategy did not explicitly endorse this EU initiative, but Mr. Schulte, at the February 4 presentation of the strategy, highlighted the initiative “as a potential way” to promote “transparency and confidence-building measures, which tend to be voluntary as opposed to legally binding.” A week earlier, Rose Gottemoeller, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, stated at the Conference on Disarmament that the administration was nearing a decision on whether the U.S. would sign on to the code, and what modifications might be required in order to do so.13 As U.S. interest in the Code of Conduct has increased, debates over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. </span><br />
These policy movements toward multilateral engagement and commitment to behavioral standards (even if non-binding) mark a sharp departure from the stiff resistance to curtailing U.S. “freedom of action” in the previous administration<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, and have accordingly generated resistance from congressional opponents on just those terms. Prior to the release of the National Security Space Strategy, a group of 37 Republican senators led by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl issued a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concern over a potential multilateral commitment that might limit development and/or deployment of space-based missile defense interceptors and ASAT-defeating systems.14 Critics also decried the strategy’s emphasis on “the old fallacious assumption that the power of example will prevent adversaries from doing the United States harm,” and endorsed maintaining the goal of U.S. retention of a “dominant position in military and intelligence space capabilities.”15 In fact, the administration’s warming toward normative commitments in general — and the EU Code of Conduct in particular — are in part intended to forestall pressure for more formal and binding measures that would definitively cut off the “hedge” of unilateral U.S. weapons development options.16 The balance of U.S. debate may have shifted toward greater international cooperation, but the terms of the debate remain the same.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">In sum, </span>the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing in U.S. policy toward greater global engagement but also,<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and more importantly, </span>a step toward greater long-term coherence in thinking concerning the core goals of U.S. space activities<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Even supporters of the general directions of the strategy noted its more-than-expected breadth of thought.17 But if this reading is sound, the strategy is still but one step on a long road, and ongoing debates over the role of U.S. space policy vis-à-vis broader national security interests will insure that road is bumpy. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that more specific guidelines for military implementation of the strategy remain to be developed.18 Many devils may lurk in these details. </span><br />

<br />
Space’s militarization<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> — its use as a medium to support military operations — </span>has existed for more than four decades<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Since the height of the Cold War, </span>satellites have monitored nuclear tests and other military activities and facilitated global communications, mapping, and other activities with both military and scientific purposes. Yet space has yet to be weaponized, in that it is not yet a theater for warfare or for the placement of arms, and it remains a global commons open to any actor with the means to access it<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 36 To a large degree, </span>this openness can be credited to a robust set of international agreements that effectively codify space as a global commons.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> When space first became accessible to humanity in the 1950s, the United States proposed an agreement establishing orbits as common spaces beyond traditional conceptions of sovereignty. The Soviet Union initially disagreed, arguing that its sovereign claim over its territorial air space extended to orbit and beyond. Once Moscow saw the benefit of sending satellites into orbit to spy on the West, its conceptions of its sovereign interests changed, and the USSR agreed to establish space as, in effect, a global commons. Although several arms-control agreements helped to solidify space as a commons, the most comprehensive existing international agreement on the use of space is the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. </span>It defines space as an area beyond claims of state sovereignty, but it has a limited focus on military matters — beyond banning weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on any celestial body, and prohibiting the use of celestial bodies for military bases or the testing of weapons. U.S. policy has consistently embraced space as a global commons<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “by all nations for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of all humanity.” 37 Yet the United States has also defended space as a legitimate medium for defense and intelligence activities. The 2006 National Space Policy reinforced an American commitment to the “exploration and use of outer space by all nations for peaceful purposes, and for the benefit of all humanity,” rejected claims of national sovereignty, and reaffirmed the “rights of passage through and operations in space without interference.” On the issue of military objectives, it was quite clear, asserting: The United States considers space capabilities — including the ground and space segments and supporting links — vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities, and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing the capabilities intended to do so; take those actions necessary to protect its space capabilities; respond to interference; and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests. 38</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;To be sure, not deploying weapons in space is no guarantee that potentially hostile nations (such as China) will not develop and deploy ASATs. </span>However, it is virtuallycertain<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span>deploying U.S. weapons in space will lead to the development and deployment of ASATs to counter such weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; notes a new policy brief by the Cato Institute.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">[1]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27 </span>China and Russia long have been worried about possible U.S. breakout on space-based weaponry<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Officials<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from both countries have </span>expressed concern<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that the </span>U.S. missile defense program is aimed<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not at what Moscow and Beijing see as a non-credible threat from rogue-nation ballistic missiles, but rather </span>at launching a long-term U.S. effort to dominate space. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Both Russia and China also are key proponents of negotiations at the UN Conference on Disarmament to expand the 1967 Outer Space Treaty to ban all types of weapons. The effort to start talks known as PAROS, for &quot;prevention of an arms race in outer space,&quot; has been stalled due in large part to the objection of the United States. For example, in November 2000, the United States was one of three countries (the others were Israel and Micronesia) to refuse to vote for a UN resolution citing the need for steps to prevent the arming of space.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">[1]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28 </span>It is inconceivable<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that either </span>Russia or China would allow the U<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited</span> S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span>to become the sole nation with space-based weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;</span>Once a nation embarks down the road to gain a huge asymmetric advantage, the natural tendency of others is to close that gap. An arms race tends to develop an inertia of its own<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; writes Air Force Lt. Col. Bruce M. DeBlois, in a 1998 article in Airpower Journal.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">[1]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">29 </span>Chinese moves<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to put weapons in space </span>would trigger<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> regional rival </span>India to consider the same<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in turn, </span>spurring Pakistan<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to strive for parity with India. </span>Even U.S.allies in Europe might feel pressure<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to &quot;keep up with the Joneses.&quot; It is quite easy to imagine the course of a new arms race in space that would be nearly as destabilizing as the atomic weapons race proved to be. </span>Such a strategic-level space race could have negative consequences for U.S. security<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the long run that would outweigh the obvious (and tremendous) short-term advantage of being the first with space-based weapons. </span>There would be direct economic costs to sustaining orbital weapon systems and keeping ahead of opponents intent on matching U.S. space-weapon capabilities — <span style="font-size: 8pt;">raising the proverbial question of whether we would be starting a game we might not be able to win. (It should be remembered that the attacker will always have an advantage in space warfare, in that space assets are inherently static, moving in predictable orbits. </span>Space weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, just like satellites, </span>have inherent vulnerabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.) Again, the price tag of space</span> w<span style="font-size: 8pt;">eapons systems would not be trivial — with maintenance costs a key issue. For example, it now costs commercial firms between $300 million and $350 million to replace a single satellite that has a lifespan of about 15 years, according to Ed Cornet, vice president of Booz Allen and Hamilton consulting firm.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">[1]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">30 </span>Many experts also argue there would be costs, both economic and strategic, stemming from the need to counter other asymmetric challenges from those who could not afford to be participants in the race itself.Threatened nations or non-state actors might well look to terrorism using chemical or biological agents as one alternative.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The possibility of space becoming another forum for warfare has long been a fear of the international community. Although many treaties have addressed weapons in space, space actors have been testing the limits of these treaties more and more frequently. </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">The U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">St</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ates </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">has stated that space warfare is inevitable. This possibility isespecially troubling because the global economy depends heavily on outer space. National defense, global communications, an ever growing commercial space industry, international flights, and the internet all depend on satellites orbiting in outer space. These satellites make obvious first targets for any space arms race.

<span style="color: #0d0d0d;">A buildup of space weapons might begin with noble intentions of 'peace through strength' deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that '… the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use'.33 This drift toward usage is strengthened by a strategic fact elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, 'anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand'.34 The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent 'dual capability' of spaceborne weapon components. As Marc Vidricaire, Delegation of Canada to the UN Conference on Disarmament, explains: 'If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land'. 35 To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors can also be used as orbiting 'Death Stars', capable of sending munitions hurtling through the Earth's atmosphere. The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense 'use or lose' pressure into strategic calculations, with the spectre of split-second attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting Death Stars with automated 'hair trigger' devices. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict. </span><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 6pt;">Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed 'complexly interactive, tightly coupled' industrial systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other's flawless performance. According to Perrow, this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail. As Perrow explains, '[t]he odd term &quot;normal accident&quot; is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable'.36</span><span style="color: #0d0d0d;">Deployment of space weapons with pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to 'normal accidents'. It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to retired Lt. Col. Robert M. Bowman, 'even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage — even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!'. 37 In the same Star Wars technology touted as a quintessential tool of peace, defence analyst David Langford sees one of the most destabilizing offensive weapons ever conceived: 'One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people'.38 Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that any nation subjected to space weapon attack would retaliate with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Dr. Karl Mueller, a former Air Force analyst now at RAND, writes:. </span>The United States would <strong>not be able to maintain unchallenged hegemony in the weaponization of space,</strong> and while a space-weapons race would threaten international stability, it would be even more dangerous to U.S. security and relative power projection capability, due to other states’ significant ability and probably inclination to balance symmetrically and asymmetrically against ascendant U.S. power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.2 On the other hand, a space race cannot be ruled out as a likely outcome—especially given that many countries with much fewer economic and technical resources than the United States are already going to space</span>. A strategic-level space race could have negative consequences for U.S. security in the long run that could outweigh any short-term advantage of being the first with space-based weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In particular, it would be costly in dollar terms to sustain orbital weapon systems and stay ahead of opponents intent on matching U.S. space-weapon capabilities. The price tag of space-weapon systems and protective measures would not be trivial for anyone choosing to pursue them— with maintenance costs a key issue.</span><br />

<br />
The other related negative side effect of the inherent vulnerability of orbiting weapons is the pressure to use them first. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The strategic dynamic of space-based weapons could perhaps be compared to that of nuclear intercontinental 30 ballistic missiles— offense-dominant weapons with inherent vulnerabilities (fixed sites). </span>This is a recipe for instability<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as the United States and Soviet Union soon found in their nuclear competition. </span>Spurring other nations to acquire spacebased weapons, either ASATs or weapons aimed at terrestrial targets, would undercut the ability of U.S. forces to operate freely on the ground on a global basis and thus negate what today is a unique advantage of being the world’s only military superpowe<strong>r</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.3 </span>Along with military assets in space, U.S. commercial satellites would also become targets (especially because the U.S. military is heavily reliant on commercial providers, particularly in communications).

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">A further related difficulty is the sometimes exaggerated rhetoric used by advocates of missile defense in the United States. While aimed at a domestic audience, it is heard furtherafield and can, ironically, provide ammunition to BMD’s most strident and vociferous opponents. A particular culprit in this regard is the U.S. Air Force Space Command, whose website and doctrine publications are routinely cited by organizations opposed to missile defense as evidence of the malign purposes behind BMD.62 Bush’s determination to provide for missile defense of the national territory was given added impetus by the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington in September 2001.63 This reinforced European views on the inevitability of missile defense deployment. As Colin Gray puts it, “. . . that homeland defense is now a hardy perennial among American strategic desiderata, virtually regardless of wider considerations, has come to be accepted in Europe as a fact of trans-Atlantic political life.”64 American policies by now had forced many European governments, especially the British, to examine the issue more closely. While the extent of missile proliferation became increasingly apparent, the end of the ABM Treaty also demonstrated that many of the fears about its demise were ill-founded. The British Foreign Office stated that one of its objectives in its relationship with the United States was to ensure that “. . . Missile Defense is pursued in a way which protects UK interests and minimizes divisions within NATO.”65 How far British thinking has moved on was shown by a statement from the new Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw: “. . . we in this country have long recognized the case, in appropriate circumstances, for measures of missile defence.”66 He added that: “There is an overwhelming case for missile defense in principle . . . Our view is that the United States is fully entitled to want to develop systems of missile defence.”67 This is a dramatic, if little-noticed, shift in British official thinking which since the 1960s had consistently viewed missile defense as destabilizing. By no means were all public figures convinced, however, as one Labour backbencher asked the government about the “first-strike” potential of missile defense.68 But by early 2002 the British Government, if not 12 all its supporters or the general public, had become fully reconciled to the prospect of a limited missile defense of North America. The debate in Europe, and especially in Britain, has therefore moved on from “whether” to “when” and “how” missile defenses are to be deployed.69 This process has been aided by the readiness of the present U.S. administration to consult its allies in a way that its predecessor appeared not to. The ability of the U.S. Government to secure further offensive arms reductions with the Russians also met another consistent European objective. Working against this trend, however, has been what is perceived as evidence of American unilateralism in regard to other international treaties such as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the International Criminal Court, and the Kyoto Climate Change Protocol. Though many of these issues do not impinge directly on missile defense, they do, in many eyes, indicate a U.S. willingness to act in defiance of the “world community.” To some extent, fears that missile defense will not work have been replaced by fears that it will, thereby allowing the United States even greater freedom to act unilaterally, heedless of the wishes and interests of others.70</span><br />

 The United States federal government should offer a “Zero Ballistic Missile” defense initiative to all open and willing nations which bans ground and space based ballistic missiles. Signature to this agreement should be conditioned on the removal of all ballistic missiles with ranges greater than 500 kilometers from the signing nation(s).<br />
<br />
A global ban on ballistic missiles solves—doesn’t hinder US deterrence and still allows us to attack rogue states<br />
Andreasen 4—national security consultant and lectures at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs (Steve, “ Reagan Was Right: Let’s Ban Ballistic Missiles,” Survival, vol. 46, no. 1, Spring 2004, ingenta, DA: 7/27/2011<em>JLENART) **NOTE—ZBM stands for Zero Ballistic Missiles. It is a policy Reagan tried to implement during his administration in 1986.</em><br />
<br />
<em>During the Reagan administration, ZBM proponents argued that American security could be assured in a world without ballistic missiles (but still a potentially hostile Soviet Union) through reliance on bombers and cruise missiles that incorporated the latest in ‘stealth’ technology. In short, bombers and cruise missiles utilising stealth technology would, by themselves, be effective instruments of deterrence and retaliation. Seventeen years after Reykjavik, the same points remain valid. ZBM will enhance the importance of nuclear long-range heavy bombers, as well as nuclear-armed cruise missiles, both air-based and sea-based (currently in storage though deployable), as the core of the US nuclear deterrent force. But the ability of the United States to execute a devastating nuclear strike against any potential adversary using air-breathing weapons would remain robust; while that strike might be delayed in comparison to a ballistic missile strike, it could not be denied. As is the case with the current US nuclear force, it would effectively deter those who can be deterred. And while greater reliance on air-breathing systems (in particular, cruise missiles) for deterrence could raise new concerns over the potential proliferation of these systems outside the US and Russia, in practice, this problem exists, and could well grow, with or without ZBM. Moreover, the security benefits of ZBM in a US–Russia context would be substantial. Global ZBM could reduce the incentive for either the US or Russia to strike the other first with nuclear weapons, as well as eliminate the most effective tools for such a strike – ballistic missiles. ZBM would reduce the risk of an accidental or unauthorised launch by unravelling the dangerous nexus between thousands of US and Russian ballistic missile warheads that can hit the other within 30 minutes of launch; huge gaps in Russia’s early warning system; and the substantial and increasing capability of the US to launch a devastating first strike. ZBM would also greatly simplify the challenge of missile defence, in two ways. First, the need for a ‘thick’ defence against ballistic missiles with ranges greater than 500km would be greatly reduced as ZBM was implemented. While there may still be a rationale for deploying defences against systems banned by ZBM as insurance against a potential cheat or non-participant, these defences are likely to be less extensive and less costly, freeing up resources for other defence missions. Second, missile defence could focus on the threat from short-range missiles not banned by global ZBM – that is, missiles with ranges less than 500km. For the foreseeable future, defences against shorter-range missiles whose warheads have lower re-entry velocities are likely to be more effective than defences against ‘faster-flying’ longerrange systems, which typically are harder to shoot down. ZBM could also have a very positive impact on US–Russian political relations, as it would dramatically reduce – symbolically and in practice – the nuclear component of the relationship. As was the case in 1986, there will be vocal opposition in the United States to the idea of giving up ICBMs and SLBMs, no matter what might be gained as part of a global accord. In an age where pre-emption is enshrined as the national security strategy of the United States, some will argue that global ZBM would remove one option for pre-empting threats from a rogue state or terrorist group – that is, a US first strike using ICBMs or SLBMs. Indeed, the Pentagon is now exploring the possibility of arming long-range ballistic missiles with conventional instead of nuclear warheads to make them more usable. For the same reason, some are now advocating the development of a low-yield nuclear warhead for ICBMs and SLBMs. There are, however, real arguments against the use of ICBMs or SLBMs – whether nuclear or conventional – against terrorists or rogue states. At the top of the list, US policy for decades has been to increase the threshold for using these horrific weapons; arming them with conventional or low-yield nuclear warheads would send a different message. Moreover, under global ZBM, the United States would maintain a full menu of credible options for pre-empting rogue states or terrorists, including precision guided munitions (conventional or nuclear) delivered by heavy bombers, tactical aircraft, attack submarines, bombs and cruise missiles.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Long-range ballistic missiles are the most fearsome weapons invented—massive attacks would cause global catastrophe</em><br />
<em>Andreasen 4—national security consultant and lectures at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs (Steve, “ Reagan Was Right: Let’s Ban Ballistic Missiles,” Survival, vol. 46, no. 1, Spring 2004, ingenta, DA: 7/27/2011</em>JLENART)<br />
<br />
Ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads remain the most fearsome weapon system ever devised. One missile fired in anger or by accident or miscalculation could produce tens of millions of casualties within minutes; a few tens of missiles could destroy a society and trigger a global conflagration. As is the case with any weapons technology, one can always fall back on the argument that the ‘genie is out of the bottle’ and nothing can, or should, be done to reduce the potential for catastrophe; or make the argument that it is political factors, not weapon systems, that are the key to conflict resolution and threat reduction (the geopolitical equivalent of the American gun-advocate’s slogan, ‘guns don’t kill people, people kill people’). But if the United States under President Reagan’s leadership was prepared to consider the elimination of its entire offensive ballistic missile force in 1986, at the height of the Cold War, in exchange for the elimination of Soviet offensive ballistic missiles, it is worth re-examining the merits of such a proposal – this time, applied globally.<br />

 Russia would agree—ZBM improves Russia’s strategic position and they would still keep most of their nuclear weapons<br />
Andreasen 4—national security consultant and lectures at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs (Steve, “ Reagan Was Right: Let’s Ban Ballistic Missiles,” Survival, vol. 46, no. 1, Spring 2004, ingenta, DA: 7/27/2011//JLENART) **NOTE—ZBM stands for Zero Ballistic Missiles. It is a policy Reagan tried to implement during his administration in 1986.<br />
<br />
One fact, however, underscores the possible attraction of a global ZBM regime to Moscow: every ICBM and SLBM not under Russian command today – whether American, British, French or Chinese – is a threat to Russia. A global ZBM regime would at least simplify, if not improve, Russia’s strategic position. Moreover, even with the elimination of offensive ballistic missiles, Russia would retain a sizeable nuclear force, one that could not be eliminated, or dismissed, by any potential adversary, including the United States. How Russia would evaluate these tradeoffs – including the possibility of having to redirect resources away from its ongoing ballistic missile modernisation into bombers and cruise missiles – remains uncertain.<br />

 <br />
Empirics prove China says yes—they are focusing on economic issues and the agreement would allow China to maintain their nuclear deterrence<br />
Andreasen 4—national security consultant and lectures at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs (Steve, “ Reagan Was Right: Let’s Ban Ballistic Missiles,” Survival, vol. 46, no. 1, Spring 2004, ingenta, DA: 7/27/2011//JLENART) **NOTE—ZBM stands for Zero Ballistic Missiles. It is a policy Reagan tried to implement during his administration in 1986.<br />
<br />
Perhaps even more difficult than gaining Russian support for global ZBM would be gaining the agreement of the middle-ranking nuclear powers – China, the UK and France. In the absence of a substantial investment in long-range bombers, submarines and cruise missiles, China would give up the extremely limited capability it has today to strike the territory of the United States with nuclear weapons. At the same time, the United States would maintain a nuclear strike capability against the Chinese mainland. Could China be convinced such an ‘unequal’ agreement was in its national interests? Intuitively, the answer would seem to be a resoundi<br />
ng ‘no’, but historical example suggests otherwise. For at least two decades, China has had the ability to deploy a larger and more capable force of ICBMs against the United States. Instead, China has committed its resources towards economic growth and improving its military position in Asia, in particular with respect to Taiwan. The domestic economic imperative is unlikely to change in China, barring a dramatic change in the leadership’s priorities (or the leadership itself). Moreover, even under global ZBM, China would retain the ability to conduct nuclear strikes throughout Asia, using aircraft, bombs and short-range ballistic missiles not banned by the agreement (a major incentive for China). Under these circumstances, China might well conclude it can maintain a sufficient nuclear deterrent – in particular, if each of the other major nuclear powers was committed to global ZBM. The case of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) also suggests that China might agree to a global ban on ballistic missiles. During CTBT negotiations, it was clear that China had a great deal to gain from additional nuclear tests; but when the United States, Russia, Britain, and France – joined by the vast majority of the international community – made clear their determination to conclude the Treaty, China curtailed its test programme, cut the best deal it could and became the second signatory.<br />

<br />
Both the US and Russia have had years of experience – and success – monitoring the elimination of offensive ballistic missiles and their launchers under START. Both countries would be capable of monitoring permitted space-launch vehicles and ballistic missile defence systems, though an inspection regime would be required to guard against ‘breakout’ and provide confidence that these systems were not armed with nuclear or conventional warheads. A global ZBM regime would, however, introduce new challenges, and require cooperation from various states that, to date, have not been open to transparency and inspection of their ballistic missilerelated programmes – notably, China, Britain, France, Israel, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, India, Pakistan and North Korea. Countries with space-launch programmes, such as Japan and Brazil, may also need to be included in an inspection and verification regime.<br />

By far, the most important arms control success of the past year has been the entry-into-force of the New START Treaty with Russia in February. The Treaty responsibly limits the number of strategic nuclear weapons and launchers that the United States and Russia may deploy. When the Treaty is fully implemented, it will result in the lowest number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads since the 1950s, the first full decade of the nuclear age. The implementation of the Treaty is well underway. We have exchanged data on our strategic nuclear facilities and forces. This information forms the foundation of the Treaty’s database, which will be updated by the Parties continuously through a notification process and exchanged anew every six months throughout the life of the Treaty. As of April, the Parties began conducting on-site inspections of each other’s Treaty-related facilities.<br />

Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov said the country was developing its own missile defense system. This was his answer to the question what Russia would do if the United States violated the terms of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START-3).On Wednesday, the Federation Council has ratified the treaty. The senators supported the amendments to the treaty during its ratification by the Duma deputies. These amendments describe the conditions of Russia's withdrawal from the treaty. The first one has to do with a violation of its provisions by the United States. The second is the development of missile defense systems by the Americans that would qualitatively change the situation in this area, and would significantly violate national security and defense capability of Russia. The &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; also include the adoption by the U.S. of weapons systems with strategic non-nuclear equipment without it being discussed by a bilateral consultative committee, reports RIA Novosti.<br />

<strong>START prevents accidental nuclear war</strong><br />

The START Treaty has led to significant reductions in the U.S. and Russian Cold War nuclear stockpiles. According to data from the State Department, the United States had more than 10,500 accountable warheads deployed on an estimated 2,250 delivery vehicles and Russia had more than 10,000 accountable warheads deployed on 2,500 delivery vehicles in September 1990, prior to the treaty’s entrance into force. During the Cold War, each one of these 20,000 U.S. and Russian nuclear warheads was maintained on a hair trigger alert, keeping the world’s two superpowers locked in a dangerous military posture, known as mutually assured destruction. The risk of nuclear war was real and posed an existential threat to both countries as well as the world. Beyond the threat of an intentional attack, there was a possibility of inadvertent war from an unauthorized or accidental launch. Although data on Russian nuclear incidents are unavailable, according to conservative figures from the Department of Defense, there were 32 nuclear weapons incidents involving U.S. nuclear weapons between 1950 and 1980 – twenty of which, experts say, could have started an accidental nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia.<span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dpc.senate.gov/docs/fs-111-2-30.html#_edn7" rel="nofollow">[7</a>]</span> With the implementation of the START, both sides have markedly reduced their stockpiles – and markedly reduced the risk of nuclear war. As of July 2009, the United States had 5,916 accountable warheads on 1,188 delivery vehicles and Russia had 3,897 accountable warheads on 809 delivery vehicles. These mutual reductions have ensured stability in our nuclear relationship, while significantly contributing to American, Russian, and global security.<span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dpc.senate.gov/docs/fs-111-2-30.html#_edn8" rel="nofollow">[8</a>]</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The US is fully satisfied with</span>the implementation of the provisions of <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the New START treaty with Russia</span> where it comes to <span style="font-size: 11pt;">regular information exchanges between the two countries about the state of their nuclear arsenals</span> and their precise location. In a sign of <span style="font-size: 11pt;">growing confidence between the onetime Cold War foes</span>, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the Americans recently showed one of their strategic bombers to </span>a team of visiting <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Russian specialists</span>. Russia, in turn, showcased part of its own armory to American experts. The New START nuclear arms reductions treaty, signed by Presidents Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama in Prague on April 8, took effect in February 2011 after being ratified by Russian and American MPs.<br />

<strong>U.S. and Russia show commitment to START</strong><br />
Sally <strong>Rountree</strong> 01 Apr <strong>2011</strong> The Prague Agenda: The New START’s Next Steps <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uspolicy.be/headline/prague-agenda-new-start%E2%80%99s-next-steps" rel="nofollow">http://www.uspolicy.be/headline/prague-agenda-new-start%E2%80%99s-next-steps</a><br />
Washington — <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The New START treaty </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">not only </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">represents a commitment by the United States and Russia</span> toward nuclear disarmament, but also strengthens the reset between Washington and Moscow “that is helping us to address the most urgent proliferation threats we face in Iran and North Korea,” National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon says. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (<span style="font-size: 11pt;">START</span>), signed April 8, 2010, by President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">marks the first major arms reduction pact since the last days of the Cold War</span>. Keynoting the Carnegie International Nuclear Policy Conference meeting in Washington on March 29, Donilon outlined the next steps to establish missile-defense cooperation. Referencing President Obama’s vision for achieving the “peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons” in a speech the president delivered in Prague in 2009, Donilon presented the Obama administration’s plans to advance each of the four dimensions of the president’s agenda. To reduce the number and role of nuclear weapons<span style="font-size: 11pt;">, the United States recently exchanged data with Russia on nuclear facilitiesunder the auspices of the Bilateral Consultative Commission, the treaty’s implementing body</span>, currently meeting in Geneva. On-site inspections conducted under the treaty will soon follow. Once the treaty is fully implemented, Donilon said, it will mark the lowest number of deployed nuclear warheads since the 1950s, the first full decade of the nuclear age.<br />

The Russians are expected to say, in commentary to be released after ratification, that it does. “They are welcome to interpret any language of the treaty as they want, but that interpretation is not legally binding on the United States,” Micah Zenko, a fellow at the<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/council_on_foreign_relations/index.html?inline=nyt-org" rel="nofollow">Council on Foreign Relations</a>, said in a telephone interview.

Article V, Section 3 of the text states: &quot;Each Party shall not convert and shall not use ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) launchers and SLBM (submarine-launched ballistic missile) launchers for placement of missile defense interceptors therein. Each Party further shall not convert and shall not use launchers of missile defense interceptors for placement of ICBMs and SLBMs therein. This provision shall not apply to ICBM launchers that were converted prior to signature of this Treaty for placement of missile defense interceptors therein.&quot; This section makes clear that the treaty does indeed constrain one possible way for the U.S. to develop missile defense capabilities. This may not be the way the current administration envisions developing its missile defense system, but that isn't what Tauscher claimed. (A White House fact sheet issued March 26 is more accurate in stating, &quot;The Treaty does not contain any constraints on testing, development or deployment of <em>current</em> or <em>planned</em> U.S. missile defense programs...&quot; [emphasis added].) Conversion of offensive ICBMs has been done in the past: there are five Minuteman III ICBMs at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California that were converted into defensive interceptors. These have been grandfathered into the treaty in the section noted above, but additional conversion of launchers into interceptors, which is arguably the fastest way to develop such a defensive capability should an urgent need arise, is now forbidden under this new agreement. That <em>constrains</em> our missile defense programs, plain and simple.<br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">Having the national networks deployed and getting them interconnected is not the end of the story – usually real operating environment demands the ability to flexibly reconfigure the network, provide increased bandwidth between particular nodes on the network or connect new nodes to the network. Multiple nations, operating in a relatively small area, have diverse requirements for the use of electromagnetic spectrum, necessary for operation of their sensors and wireless communications. This is all about the network management. Taking into account the growing bandwidth demand, it is most likely that opportunities, provided by rather rapidly evolving communications technologies, will be behind the user requirements. Therefore implementation of the net-centric concepts would require an efficient use of network resources, and this is the place, where network management will play its very important role. Network management within national domains is quite a challenging issue (Donnelly, 2005). However, within the multinational environment, it requires even more effort. First of all, in the recent years, we cannot observe any significant improvement in defining multinational networks’ architecture. For instance, NATO Consultation, Command and Control Board and its sub-committees are working on NATO Information Infrastructure (NII), which is supposed to address the Alliance’s Network Enabled Capabilities architectural issues, but at present stage, it doesn’t seem that architectural developments are turning towards the real net centric approach. </span><br />

Asymmetric Threats to Counter NCW <span style="text-decoration: none;">The term “asymmetric”, when referring to strategies in warfare, is</span> often <span style="text-decoration: none;">intended to describe attacks launched by a weaker, or less-well-equipped enemy, as they learn to exploit a stronger opponent’s vulnerabilities</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Tech</span>nology <span style="text-decoration: none;">has provided an asymmetric advantage for U.S. forces in recent conflicts</span>. However, asymmetry sometimes leads to unanticipated outcomes. For example, <span style="text-decoration: none;">video images showing the overwhelming power of the U.S. military in recent urban conflicts have been on display in the global news media. Such images</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">resulting from</span> the <span style="text-decoration: none;">tech</span>nological efficiency of U.S. forces, <span style="text-decoration: none;">may have given terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda added power to spread rhetoric, recruit more members, and gain more indigenous loyalty</span>.<span style="font-size: 7pt;">46</span> <span style="text-decoration: none;">Asymmetric countermeasures may</span> include actions taken by an enemy to <span style="text-decoration: none;">bypass NCW sensors</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">or to negate the usefulness of high tech</span>nology <span style="text-decoration: none;">weapons. Some</span> examples may <span style="text-decoration: none;">include</span> (1) <span style="text-decoration: none;">suicide bombings</span>; (2) <span style="text-decoration: none;">hostile forces intermingling with civilians used as shields</span>; (3) <span style="text-decoration: none;">irregular fighters and close-range snipers that swarm to attack, and then disperse quickly</span>; (4) <span style="text-decoration: none;">use of bombs to spread “dirty” radioactive material, or</span> (5) <span style="text-decoration: none;">chemical or biological weapons</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Persons associated with terrorist groups</span> are sometimes found to have <span style="text-decoration: none;">receive</span>d <span style="text-decoration: none;">advanced education in high-tech</span>nology, <span style="text-decoration: none;">and may also have knowledge</span> of <span style="text-decoration: none;">how to use tech</span>nology <span style="text-decoration: none;">in an asymmetric attack against the supporting infrastructure for NCW</span>.<span style="font-size: 7pt;">47</span> For example, <span style="text-decoration: none;">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</span>, who was arrested in 2003 for possible links with Al Qaeda, reportedly <span style="text-decoration: none;">studied engineering at a university in North Carolina.

Some PLA authors see space conflict as a natural evolution of military technology, and space weapons as desirable for China, though others appear to adopt a more deterrence-oriented framework for these weapons. Some in the PLA directly connect Chinese doctrine on strategic nuclear forces with that on space weapons, urging the same “minimum deterrence” doctrine.4 Chinese leader Mao Zedong was explicitly quoted on China’s 1975 nuclear policy: “We will not attack unless we are attacked. If we are attacked, we will certainly counterattack.”<br />

One important drawback of current U.S. space policy is its explicit rejection of space arms control. The U.S. literally was alone in the UN and elsewhere on space arms control issues, which eroded our international leadership in this area with our allies and allowed Russia and China to credibly mischaracterize our stance as provocative and hostile. The Bush administration was interested in voluntary steps on code of conduct, rules of road, and especially space debris, which was commendable but needed more emphasis than it received. My colleague Michael Krepon has done fine work on the code of conduct issue over the years; I highly recommend it to this Subcommittee and believe it offers a good early opportunity for U.S. diplomatic leadership in space.<br />

<strong>Chinese dependence on space means it won’t attack</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Watts, 11 -</strong> Senior Fellow, Center for Strategic &amp; Budgetary Assessments (Barry, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA; COMMITTEE: SENATE U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION,” 5/11, lexis)<br />
<br />
<br />
Chinese appreciation of the vital role information will play in future hitech local wars has two main ramifications. The first is that, from a modernization perspective, the PLA has no choice but to invest in the capability to get information for its forces from space. It is not unreasonable to suspect that, without some inflight target updates, a DF21D reentry vehicle, even with terminal guidance, might be hardpressed to hit a U.S. aircraft carrier operating hundreds of miles off the Chinese coast. After all, during a notional fiveminute DF21D time of flight, a U.S. carrier moving at 25 knots could change its position by some two nautical miles, and radiofrequency aerosol obscurants could defeat the warhead's radar terminal guidance. China's emerging ASBM capability, therefore, is likely to require inflight target updates, and Chinese writings indicate that these updates will come from satellites.<br />
<br />
These observations about the dependence of the DF21D ASBM on spacebased sensors raise an important point about U.S. perceptions of PLA approaches to space systems in the event of a conflict with the United States. A frequent move by the China team in U.S. war games has been to mount attacks early on to deny the use of satellites to both sides on the premise that U.S. forces have more to lose than China's. If, however, the 2nd Artillery Corps needs information from overhead sensors to carry out its own missions in time of war, the strategy may not make as much sense as war games have tended to suggest. Selectively dazzling or blinding U.S. EO satellites as they come into view over Chinese territory with groundbased lasers is one thing. Rendering LEO unusable for all nations either by generating debris from multiple kinetic attacks on U.S. reconnaissance satellites, 10 or by detonating a nuclear weapon above the mesosphere to charge up the Earth's van Allen radiation belts, is another. Both are essentially &quot;Samson&quot; options.<br />

In the face of this growing Chinese military space challenge, it is easy to assume the worst about Chinese intentions. China seeks to be able to prevail militarily at some point in the future should conflict come, but they see the United States as militarily superior to them and thus would be unlikely to consciously provoke any military conflict. While we should guard against a worst case, we should not treat it as a given. I do not believe China or the PLA is spoiling for a fight with the United States - China has come too far to want to place their substantial economicachievements at risk unless they faced an extraordinary threat to their national security. In addition, China faces serious demographic realities over the next couple of decades, where their ratio of workers to retirees will shrink substantially (the result of their onechild policy), which further underscores China's need for stability and continued economic growth for years to come. China also has additional needs, and vulnerabilities:<br />
<br />
-- Growing environmental problems and water shortages with no obvious solutions that are growing irritants to the public;<br />
<br />
-- A relentless search for new sources of manufacturing inputs;<br />
<br />
-- An increasingly restive working class that is making new demands for higher wages and political freedoms;<br />
<br />
-- A nondemocratic oneparty system that leaves its senior leadership constantly looking over its shoulder at possible challenges to its authority, especially in the aftermath of the &quot;Arab Spring&quot;;<br />
<br />
-- Growing citizen anger against corruption and cronyism that seems impossible for the CCP to root out; and many more.<br />
<br />
These factors are reasons why China is probably not looking for war with the United States, though they also could inadvertently become factors in China's stumbling into a conflict they would ordinarily not want, through miscalculation or distraction.<br />

Even if we are facing the worst case scenario and China is bent on space weaponization<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (entirely inconsistent with its past behavior), </span><strong>the</strong> <strong>reality remains that China can be brought to the negotiating table with appropriate measures and international pressure</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. After all, </span>China clearly remains the far weaker space power vis-à-vis the United States and a space race would be proportionately far more costly to China than the United States. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">But in order for progress to be made, the United States also needs to come to terms with a new reality. China’s ASAT test was a voice of opposition both to the structure of security in space and the U.S. pursuit of military dominance in space at the exclusion of others. And thus, it is actually America’s response to the ASAT test that may be even more important in how the future of space security plays out. </span>China probably has both the technological and financial means to compete with the United States in space over the long term<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>If the United States concludes it must meet a threat with more threat, it may invite a military race in outer space and China may just give it to them.If the United States can muster the political will and leadership to restrain its reaction, there is still hope. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">But flexibility and sacrifice will be essential.</span><br />

Space is an enabler of globalization and of military modernization. China fully intends to be active in both. China is determined not to allow the technology gap between the United States and China to continue to grow unchallenged. The more the United States relies on military technology as the answer to all problems, the more China will look for ways to circumvent those technologies – and defense is much easier and cheaper than offense. The United States must find ways to prevent other countries, specifically China, from gaining a military advantage in space without making its own assets more vulnerable.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It must do so without being put in a position of having to both dominate offensively and defensively, which realistically may be impossible to sustain. </span>Reviewing U.S. efforts regarding strategic communication with China on space up to the present, it can only be concluded that the United States is failing in all areas. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The United States summarily rejects one key premise; does poorly in the other three; and ultimately is less than clear in presenting a message that will likely invoke a positive response from China, or any country. </span>In fact, the basic problem is that it is not even clear what kind of space activity, if any, China could pursue that the United States would consider non-threatening. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Assuming that the strange bedfellows who thwart engagement with China will continue to exert themselves in many functional areas in the near future, including space – and that is likely the case – then at the very least the United States must decide what message it wants to send China, and other countries, about space and do so clearly and consistently. That effort in and of itself would be a very useful. Equally important, administration leadership is crucial toward overcoming opposition and treading softly into space cooperation with China in the non-threatening area of space science, to allow both sides a better understanding of cultural and bureaucratic differences, and there will be many, relevant to working together. Ultimately, however, if the United States is serious about improving its strategic communication, there is no substitute for dialogue. Acknowledging that China and the United States seek different outcomes from dialogue, including China in the talks about the Bush Moon-Mars Initiative – for which there is already precedent – appears a good place to start, as those talks have been at the strategic level. The intent would be to build the trust necessary to work together on more prickly issues. Some people would likely say that it is impossible to build trust with China, as long as it is Communist. But not trying is not in the best interests of the United States. The Pentagon’s 2005 Annual Report on the Military Power of the People’s Republic of China describes China as being at a strategic crossroads. </span>The United States clearly will influence what road China takes into the future, generally and regarding space specifically. The good news for the United States is that it appears that China does not yet have a plan for fully integrating space capabilities into is military doctrine or organizations, or for trying to acquire an asymmetrical advantage in space.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> While Beijing may choose to develop one regardless of U.S. actions, </span>if the United States continues to express a schizophrenic attitude toward both China and space activities, particularly space weapons, almost certainly it will. The United States thus could give China the focus it has been lacking, and push it down a road the United States doesn’t want it to go. Therefore, it is imperative that the United States decide what message it is trying to send about space, and stay on message.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Indeed, in the wake of China’s January 2007 anti-satellite (ASAT) test, many U.S. experts have attempted to identify China’s motives. One driver of China’s military space program is its perception of a forthcoming revolution in military affairs. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) sees space as a new and critical dimension of future warfare. The comment by the commander of the Chinese Air Force captures this perception of the PLA.2 In addition, </span>China’s military space program is seen as part of a broad asymmetric strategy designed to offset conventional U.S. military advantages.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For example, as observed by Ashley J. Tellis in 2007, “China’s pursuit of counterspace capabilities is not driven fundamentally by a desire to protest American space policies, and those of the George W. Bush administration in particular, but is part of a considered strategy designed to counter the overall military capabilities of the United States.”3 Richard J. Adams and Martin E. France, U.S. Air Force officers, contend that “Chinese interests in space weapons do not hinge on winning a potential U.S.-Chinese ASAT battle or participating in a space arms race.” Instead, they argue, </span>China’s military space program is driven by a desire to “counter the space-enabled advantage of U.S. conventional forces.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">”4 This perspective implies that </span>given the predicted U.S. superiority in conventional warfare, China feels compelled to continue its offensive military space program. Inevitably, this perspective sees China as the main instigator of a possible space arms race<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, whether implicitly or explicitly. China’s interpretation of the revolution in military affairs and its quest for asymmetric warfare capabilities are important for understanding the 2007 ASAT test. This article suggests that the Chinese military space program is also influenced by the security dilemma in international relations. Due to the anarchic nature of the world order, “the search for security on the part of state A leads to insecurity for state B which therefore takes steps to increase its security leading in its turn to increased insecurity for state A and so on.”5 </span>The military space relationship between China and the U.S. clearly embodies the tragedy of a security dilemma. In many ways, the current Chinese thinking on space warfare reflects China’s response to the perceived U.S. threat to its national security. This response, in turn, has triggered American suspicion about China’s military intentions in outer space. Thus, the security dilemmain the U.S.-China space relationship has inevitably led to measures and countermeasures.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As Joan Johnson-Freese, a scholar at the Naval War College, observed after the January 2007 ASAT test, </span>China and the U.S. “have been engaged in a dangerous spiral of action-reaction space planning and/or activity<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”</span><br />

<strong>China has been against weaponization for decades- it’s a benign space power so no need to challenge us and it’s white paper says it won’t weaponize</strong><br />

Diplomatic space policy “Space has never been solely, or even primarily, about exploration. It has always been linked to other goals, usually related to foreign policy,” notes space policy expert Joan Johnson-Freese, a point that has not been lost on China. For decades China has held steadfast in its message to the international community that it is against the weaponization of outer space in an attempt to portray itself as a benign space power. Its primary medium for pushing this agenda is the United Nations Conference on Disarmament (CD). In 2008 China and Russia in jointly submitted the “Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, The Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects,” known by the acronym PPWT. This treaty seeks to supplement existing outer space treaties to further secure space as a sanctuary, free from weaponization. Article II of the draft treaty states: States Parties undertake not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying any kind of weapons, not to install such weapons on celestial bodies, and not to station such weapons in outer space in any other manner; not to resort to the threat or use of force against outer space objects; not to assist or encourage other state, groups of state or international organization to participate in activities prohibited by the Treaty.9 This statement is in fact the outcome of years of work on establishing an acceptable legal framework that began as a 2002 working paper China jointly submitted on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS).10Upon release of the PAROS paper in 2002, Hu Xiaodi, Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs of China at the United Nations, said that the weaponization of space “will distract and even derail the peaceful use of outer space and further damage global strategic balance and stability, which is in no one’s interest. Preventing such a danger must be high on the agenda of the international community.”11Interestingly, China’s diplomatic stance has not changed significantly since its 2007 ASAT test. <strong>China’s defense white paper released in March 2011 clearly states that “The Chinese government…opposes any weaponization of outer space and any arms race in outer space,” an</strong>d says it that it is looking forward to discussing its PPWT treaty “at the earliest possible date, in order to conclude a new outer space treaty.”12<br />
<br />
<strong>Empirically, China has used space to attract allies- Iran, Indonesia and Bangladesh are also against weaponizing space</strong><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Space Review, 10/31 </span></strong></span><span style="text-decoration: none;">(Danny Houpt for the Space Review, “</span>A new policy typology to better understand the goals of China’s space program” on October 31, 2011 from <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/1</a>, AKaz)<br />
China also uses <strong>space as a way to attract allies and diplomatic partners</strong>. In 1992, China, along with Pakistan and Thailand, founded the Asia-Pacific Multilateral Cooperation in Space Technology and Applications to promote regional cooperation on space issues. In January 2003 the organization became the Asia-Pacific Multilateral Cooperation in Space (APSCO) and soon expanded membership to a handful of other nations including Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Iran. Space cooperation agreements have continued to multiply and China currently has an extensive list of space agreements and memorandums with countries across Asia and the world. “In sum,” concluded Gregory Metzler, “China’s space program has graduated from a research and development tool to one of diplomacy.”13 China has also become, according to Handberg and Li, a “beacon for other economically and technologically challenged states” who are seeking to make their way into space. China offers lower costs and fewer political restrictions to its space partners than do established spacefaring nations, making China an attractive partner for less advanced states or those that are politically unpalatable to Western space powers. Kevin Pollpeter notes that, “China’s satellite exports are not purely commercial transactions…and cannot be divorced from its diplomatic agenda. It is no coincidence that China’s two satellite export agreements are signed with countries with large oil reserves—Nigeria and Venezuela.”14<br />
