<span style="font-size: 80%;">As air launches have considerable advantages for both commercial and military purposes, several air-launch programmes are under development and corresponding test programmes are being conducted... Due to the existence of air-launch systems for commercial and other military purposes, it would not be possible to verify the non-existence of such systems. Instead, verification of this technology in the framework of an ASAT ban would have to fall back to confidence-building measures, on-site inspections, and verification of non-test and non-use for ASAT purposes.</span>
