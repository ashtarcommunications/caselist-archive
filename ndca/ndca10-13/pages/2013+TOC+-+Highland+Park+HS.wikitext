====South China Sea conflict is inevitable absent cooperation—miscalculation is likely==== 
Adams 10
(Jonathon, senior correspondent to the Global Post; "South China Sea: The coming war?", http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/china/100625/south-china-sea-paracel-spratly-islands-military?page=0,1//HH)
China has built up its small military presence in the Spratlys. It angered Vietnam
AND
there~’s Chinese submarines roaming around as well. So it~’s getting crowded underwater."


====Senkaku makes our brink unique==== 
Bajpaee 12
(Chietigj, doctoral candidate in the Department of War Studies at King~’s College London, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS); "Factors Fuelling China~’s Expanding Maritime Operations", http://www.e-ir.info/2012/07/10/factors-fuelling-chinas-expanding-maritime-operations//HH)
China~’s security interests have traditionally been oriented toward the continental rather than the maritime domain
AND
has also strengthened the PLAN~’s growing capability to support expeditionary operations.~~[vii~~]


====Nuclear war—deterrence doesn~’t apply==== 
**Wittner 11** 
(Lawrence, Emeritus Professor of History at the State University of New York/Albany, author of eight books, the editor or co-editor of another four, and the author of over 250 published articles and book reviews, edited Peace %26 Change, a journal of peace research; "Is a Nuclear War With China Possible?", www.huntingtonnews.net/14446//HH)
While nuclear weapons exist, there remains a danger that they will be used.
AND
that of the world, they should be working to encourage these policies.


====Maritime Domain Awareness solves—facilitates partnerships internationally that promote international stability==== 
**Truver 11**
(Dr. Scott, Director, National Security Programs, Gryphon Technology, research , analysis and engagement efforts; "On the Other Side of the Hill? Global Partnerships for Maritime Domain Awareness…The View from the United States", http://www.mda.gov/2011/11/09/on-the-other-side-of-the-hill//HH)
A GLOBAL FOCUS IS NEEDED, TOO From the US perspective, relationships that have
AND
purpose in countering transnational threats and securing peaceful use of the maritime commons."


====Status quo MDA is insufficient—small boats and gaps undermine the viability of the system==== 
**Singh 10**
(Jaswinder, Indian Navy Captain; "Countering Small Boat Terrorism in Territorial Sea", www.hsdl.org/?view%26did=10996//HH)
As articulated by McCormick, "insurgents always exploit the information advantage, their identity
AND
order to counter the threat of small boat terrorism in the territorial sea.


====The plan is key to vessel tracking—that~’s vital to Maritime Domain Awareness which is failing now==== 
Nachtmann and Pool 11
(Heather and Laticia, both PhD; associates at Bell Engineering Center, UofArkansas; "Maintaining Resilient Inland Waterways via Renewable Energy"//HH)
Achieving awareness of the total maritime domain is challenging due to the vastness of the
AND
operating on inland waterways are not¶ required to be equipped with AIS.


====National Automatic Identification System are critical—ports and costal sea-lanes are the vital internal link==== 
**Neffenger 12**
(Peter, U.S. Coast Guard Deputy Commandant for Operations Vice Admiral; "Written testimony of U.S. Coast Guard Deputy Commandant for Operations Vice Admiral Peter Neffenger for a House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation hearing titled "A Review of Federal Maritime Domain Awareness Programs"", http://www.dhs.gov/news/2012/07/03/written-testimony-us-coast-guard-house-transportation-and-infrastructure//HH)
MDA is facilitated through all-source fusion and analysis from a variety of Coast
AND
with Rescue 21 towers and equipment sites to leverage existing infrastructure and investments.


====Synthetic Aperture Radar integration answers all of your solvency arguments==== 
Alsaedi et al 10
(Waleed, The Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce Stevens Institute of Technology ; "Satellite Applications for Port Security and Resilience", http://www.stevens.edu/csr/fileadmin/csr/SRI_Papers_Presentations/SatelliteTeam_Final_SRI2010Report_.pdf//HH)
In today~’s world we are facing increased threat from terrorist organizations and hostile nations.
AND
likely that the maritime security network would be strengthened by is full implementation.


====Space-based AIS is key—allows for expansion of monitoring to sea-lanes==== 
**Singh 10**
(Jaswinder, Indian Navy Captain; "Countering Small Boat Terrorism in Territorial Sea", www.hsdl.org/?view%26did=10996//HH)
When shuttle astronauts Michael Foreman and Randolph Bresnik flew to the International Space Station during
AND
a particular ship every 15 minutes, says Orbcomm CEO Marc Eisenberg.74


====Plan allows us to monitor 99% of vessels==== 
**Singh 10**
(Jaswinder, Indian Navy Captain; "Countering Small Boat Terrorism in Territorial Sea", www.hsdl.org/?view%26did=10996//HH)
AIS signals can easily be detected from space by a standard AIS receiver for altitudes
AND
and AIS, then these satellites can definitely provide near-real MST.

====Our maritime transportation infrastructure is vulnerable now==== 
Jean2008
Grace v., January, staff writer, National Defense Magazine, "Underwater Killers," p. 28-9, Ebsco Host
***cites Admiral John Christenson, vice commander of the Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command***
The U.S. Navy possesses one of the premier mine-hunting forces
AND
use it with success in various forms, "he told the conference.


====Scenario One is Inland Waterways==== 


====Status quo is insufficient—gaps make the overall system ineffective==== 
Nachtmann and Pool 11
(Heather and Laticia, both PhD, associates at Bell Engineering Center, UofArkansas; "Maintaining Resilient Inland Waterways via Renewable Energy"//HH)
Under current regulations, vessels not on an international voyage are required to use AIS
AND
be disseminated in a timely manner to the agencies responsible for infrastructure protection.



====The plan solves a marine based attack—impact is economic decline==== 
Nachtmann and Pool 11
(Heather and Laticia, both PhD; associates at Bell Engineering Center, UofArkansas; "Maintaining Resilient Inland Waterways via Renewable Energy"//HH)
The Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) program is outlined in the National Plan to
AND
objectives of the maritime security program (National Strategy¶ for Maritime Security):
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Prevent terrorist attacks and criminal or hostile acts</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Protect maritime‐related population centers and critical infrastructures</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Sustaining Resilient Inland Waterways via Renewable Energy 18</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">July 2011</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Minimize damage and expedite recovery</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Safeguard the ocean and its resources</span>


====Maritime commerce is key==== 
**Coble and Larsen 11**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> — Representatives in the U.S. House (Federal News Service 5/24. "Hearing of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee; Subject: "Creating U.S. maritime industry jobs by reducing regulatory burdens"; Chaired by: Representative Howard Coble (R-NC); witnesses: Rear Admiral Kevin Cook, Director of Prevention policy, U.S. Coast Guard; Coast Guard Deputy Judge Advocate General Calvin Lederer; p. L/N</span>
The subcommittee is meeting today to review the Coast Guard~’s regulatory program and examine ways

maritime and port security, enhancing maritime commerce and protecting the marine environment.


====Decine causes war—statistics prove==== 
Royal 10 – Jedediah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, (Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises, Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215)
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
As such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views


====Scenario Two is Ports==== 


====Current port security fails—tech is going over budget, and there isn~’t a strategy for prevention==== 
Clark 11
(Charles S., "Port security technology vetting comes up short in scientists~’ study", Next Gov, [[http://www.nextgov.com/nextgov/ng_20110114_3061.php-http://www.nextgov.com/nextgov/ng_20110114_3061.php]]<span style="font-size: 10pt;">//HH)</span>

Secretary Chertoff previously noted that the U.S. is concerned that small vessels
AND
of the threat will lead to better prevention, preparation, and responses.


====Small boats have the capability====

There are several articles on the current state of the terrorism threat in the maritime
AND
port to shut down and have long term economic and security consequences."71


====Ports are the most likely scenario—current detection fails==== 
**Konkel****05**
Todd, Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University, , "Container Security: Preventing a Nuclear Catastrophe",<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">irps.ucsd.edu/assets/004/5372.pdf, ACC: 9.24.11, p. online</span>
A fundamental factor contributing to the threat of a container-based terrorist attack is
AND
years to improve security at all 361 U.S. seaports.29


====It~’ll escalate==== 
**Ayson****10**

But these two nuclear worlds—a non-state actor nuclear attack and a
AND
consider the United States as a possible perpetrator or encourager of the attack?
