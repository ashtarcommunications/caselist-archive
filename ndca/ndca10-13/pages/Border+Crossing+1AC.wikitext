==**Border Crossing 1AC**== 

=====**We’d like to begin today’s debate round with a description of Enrique Morones who makes regular visits to a graveyard for immigrants who have died in an illegal border crossing near Holtville, California.**=====

=====**<span style="text-decoration: none;">Morones is not alone in his mourning of the dead- new border patrol policies have intentionally diverted paths of illegal immigration into more dangerous crossing areas. </span>**=====

=====**<span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 16px;">Additionally, the divisions between our national borders are not anything cultural or geographical, they are biopolitical. Fear of violence on the borders is used to control entire populations. They exist to divide in our minds our ‘Human’ life from the uncontrolable carnage of what surely exists outside of our borders. </span>**=====

=====**<span style="text-decoration: none;">Modern biopower is dependant on a securitized border to define who is within the realm of human and who is not. This divison justifies any amount of violence towards those outside of the state’s normalized identity.</span>**=====

**Plan – The United States federal government should substantialy increase its investment in transportation infrastructure in the United States by converting all border crossings with remotely operated border crossings.**



=====**Solvency – Remote kiosks undermine the current trend of preventing illegal immigration through deterrence. Here, all human presence on the border is replaced by an honor system with no border agents within miles. Additionally, the kiosks break regularly, ensuring coverage gaps.**=====

=====**The new, and ineffective, remote border system will allow for a reversal of the status quo policy of “prevention through deterrence” that forces illegal immigrants to face a deadly border crossing.
