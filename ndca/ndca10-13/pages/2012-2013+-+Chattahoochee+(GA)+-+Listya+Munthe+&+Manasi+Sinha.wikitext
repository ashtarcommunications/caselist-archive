===Plan Text=== 
The United States Federal Government should provide substantial no-match-required investment for port security.
===Advantage One- Attacks=== 
Terrorism coming now – al queda has regrouped on areas outside of US control
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Miller and Warrick 2/2/2013</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Greg Miller and Joby Warrick, Washington Post, “Although splintered, al-Qaeda finds new life in unstable areas,” [[http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-02-02/world/36698995_1_al-qaeda-qaeda-cia-drone-strikes]])</span>

Pushed to the brink of collapse in its traditional strongholds, al-Qaeda has
AND
al-Qaeda a haven like the one its founders exploited in Afghanistan.

And – Terrorism attempts are inevitable – only hardening our assets solve
**__Davis and Jenkins 2002__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Paul K. Davis – a research leader at RAND and a professor at the RAND Graduate School and Brian Michael Jenkins – served since 1998 as senior adviser to the president of RAND, a nonprofit institution that helps improve policy and decisionmaking through research and analysis, “Deterrence & Influence in Counterterrorism: A Component in the War on al Qaeda,” http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/2005/MR1619.pdf)</span>

OBSTACLES TO DETERRENCE Terrorist Motivations Are Strong However much we may wish it were not
AND
hatreds are passed on successfully to other people, even to children.12

Ports will be targeted - maritime terror resonates with the underlying rationale of global extremist groups
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">__<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Chalk, 2008</span>__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Peter, Senior Political Scientist at RAND, “The Maritime Dimension of International Security Terrorism, Piracy, and Challenges for the United States”, www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2008/RAND_MG697.pdf)</span>

It is also worth bearing in mind that maritime terrorism, to the extent that
AND
extremist Islamist intent 21 and elicit considerable media attention if decisively struck. 22

The threat is real and imminent - we have the tech to solve and we shouldn’t delay
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">__<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Frantz, 12</span>__</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">(Douglas, Washington Post National Security Editor and Deputy Staff Director and Chief Investigator for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, “Port Security: U.S. Fails to meet Deadline for Scanning of Cargo Containers”, Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/port-security-us-fails-to-meet-deadline-for-scanning-of-cargo-containers/2012/07/15/gJQAmgW8mW_story.html) </span>

The administration’s failure to meet the deadline has left some members of Congress and outside
AND
who wants to get a weapon of mass destruction into the United States.”

The nuclear motivation is there; acquisition and delivery are easy
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">__<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bunn, 2010</span>__</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (Matthew, Associate Professor of Public Policy at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard, “Securing the Bomb 2010,” Project on Managing the Atom, Belfer Center, April, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[[http://www.nti.org/e_research/Securing_The_Bomb_2010.pdf]])</span>

Complacency about the threat is perhaps the biggest obstacle to forging the urgent, in
AND
help them or to buy their stolen nuclear material informing the police.19

__Scenario One – Nuclear terrorism__

Nuclear terrorism triggers multiple scenarios for world-ending, global catastrophe
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">__<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Ayson, 2010</span>__</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (Robert, Professor of Strategic Studies at the Victoria University of Wellington, “After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects”, Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, Vol. 33 Iss. 7, July)</span>

But these two nuclear worlds—a non-state actor nuclear attack and a
AND
be admitted that any preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response.

__Scenario Two – Economy__

Port attack creates a nationwide shutdown of ports, causing extreme economic and trade route collapse – causes quick collapse
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">__<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Flynn, 2003</span>__</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (Stephen, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick Senior Fellow in National Security Studies and Director, Council on Foreign Relations Independent Task Force on Homeland Security Imperatives, “The Fragile State of Container Security”, Testimony Before the U.S. Senate, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[[http://www.cfr.org/defensehomeland-security/fragile-state-container-security/p5730]]</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">)</span>

This is why a terrorist attack involving a cargo container could cause such profound economic
AND
—as would much of the freight movements that make up international trade.

It would immediately spillover causing economic gridlock around the world
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">__<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Schanzer and Eyerman, 2010</span>__</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (David H., Associate Professor Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, Joe, Senior Research Methodologist Director, Health Security Program RTI International, “Strategic Risk Management in Government: A Look at Homeland Security”, Homeland Security Council; 3/31, http://www.homelandcouncil.org/pdfs/digital_library_pdfs/ibmstrategicriskmanagementingovt.pdf)</span>

Scenario Three: Direct Attack on a U.S. Seaport Finally, terrorists
AND
shipping for almost every consumer need, would quickly run out of food.

The best studies prove economic collapse causes war
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">__<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Royal, 2010</span>__</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">(Jedediah, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises, in Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215)</span>

Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.

===Advantage Two- Trafficking=== 
Seaports are vital conduits for criminal networks that force humans into sex trafficking. Denied of fundamental dignity, these individuals become enslaved to a system of transportation that moves them from place to place only to be used and dehumanized
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Eski, 2011</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Yarin, Ph.D. candidate at Glasgow University, Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research, “Port of Call: Towards a Criminology of Port Security”, http://crj.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/07/16/1748895811414593.full.pdf)</span>

In June 2000, 58 Chinese illegal immigrants tragically died in the back of a
AND
with and re-enforce each other (Albrecht, 2002: 166).

And – Human trafficking into the United States is running rampant – enforcement measures have been completely inadequate
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">SSN, 2010</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Seaport Security News, "U.S. Port Security Is A Global Issue”, November 23, http://www.seaportsecuritynews.com/?p=212)</span>

Millions of people every year are the victims of human trafficking. Slavery, which
AND
created, steps large and small are being made to combat the crisis.

And – Slavery via human trafficking __IS__ the ultimate impact – survival means nothing if we don’t uphold what we’re surviving for
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Schmitz, 2004</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Joseph, Department of Defense Inspector General, “Implementing the Department of Defense “Zero Tolerance” Policy With Regard to Trafficking in Humans”, September 21, [[http://www.dodig.mil/fo/JES_TIP_Testimony_092104.pdf]])</span>

One might ask why, in the midst of the Global War on Terrorism,
AND
War on Terrorism, but on the very principles that define “survival.”

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">And – Fortunately, port security grants fund improvements that are necessary in the effort to combat human trafficking, but more investment is key </span>
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">PR Newswire, 2011</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/10-years-after-911-security-still-a-top-priority-of-us-ports-128888213.html)</span>

Among the materials Navy SEALS found in Osama Bin Laden's Pakistan hideout were plans showing
AND
job creation and economic prosperity, and important partners in our national defense.”

===Advantage Three- Maritime Domain Awareness=== 
We are close to achieving effective MDA now – coordination through Interagency Operation Centers is critical
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Caldwell, 2012</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Stephen, Director of Homeland Security and Justice Issues, “Maritime Security Coast Guard Needs to Improve Use and Management of Interagency Operations Centers”, February, http://gao.gov/assets/590/588476.pdf)</span>

To protect the nation's ports and waterways, the federal government strives to balance the
AND
and is using WatchKeeper as an important information sharing tool to accomplish this.

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">And – Despite statue, lack of funding has doomed the formation of effective Interagency Operation Centers </span>
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Lipowicz, 2012</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Alice, “Coast Guard info-sharing at ports slow to get started”, Federal Computer Weekly, [[http://fcw.com/Articles/2012/02/14/Coast-Guard-info-sharing-at-ports-slow-to-get-started.aspx?Page=1]])</span>

Six years after Congress passed a law requiring that key U.S. seaports
AND
its sectors have achieved IOCs with full operating capability,” the GAO said.

And – Independently, increased port security funding is necessary for state-of-the-art MDA intelligence capability
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">FEMA, 2012</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Federal Emergency Management Agency, “FY2012 Port Security Grant Program (PSGP_ Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), ttp://www.fema.gov/pdf/government/grant/2012/fy12_psgp_foa.pdf)</span>

PSGP Priorities In addition to these two overarching priorities, the Department has identified the
AND
information sharing agreements and international conventions and treaties will greatly assist enabling MDA.

And – Effective MDA is critical to prevent EMP attacks
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Cooper and Pfaltzgraff, 2010</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Henry, Ph. D from NYU, Director of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, Senior Associate of the National Institute for Public Policy, Robert, Ph. D from the University of Pennsylvania, President of the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, Professor of International Security Studies at the Fletcher School, “Countering the EMP Threat: The Role of Missile Defense”, http://www.ifpa.org/pdf/IWGWhitePaper.pdf)</span>

As noted above, early warning of a pending attack could empower the U.
AND
layered defense against EMP attacks on the United States from off our coasts.

And – EMP attacks outweigh nuclear war
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Gertz, 2005</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Bill, US Seen Vulnerable to Space ‘Pulse’ Attack, Washington Times, November 22, http://www.washtimes.com/national/20051121-103434-8775r.htm)</span>

The United States is highly vulnerable to attack from electronic pulses caused by a nuclear
AND
far more Americans than a nuclear weapon detonated in our most populous city."

===Advantage Four- Solvency=== 
Port security grants are severely underfunded – the plan is key to fill critical infrastructure gaps and ensure effective port security
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">__<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Holmes, 2012</span>__</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (John, Deputy Executive Director, Port of Los Angeles, Testimony of Captain John M. Holmes Deputy Executive Director of Operations Port of Los Angeles Before The United States House of Representatives Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Homeland Security, “Budget Hearing - Federal Emergency Management Agency – Director and State & Local Witnesses”, March 7, http://appropriations.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-112-ap15-jholmes-20120307.pdf, p. 1-2)</span>

Since 9/11, port security has become a top priority for U.
AND
see a degradation of these efforts as a result of grant funding reductions.

Security improvements are ready to be implemented – lack of funding and the cost-share requirement are the only obstacles
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">__<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Kimery, 2012</span>__</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (Anthony, Staff Writer for the Homeland Security Today website, “Security, Port Authorities Associations Urge DHS To Reconsider Port Allocations” published 3/9/2012, http://www.hstoday.us/briefings/grants-funding/single-article/security-port-authorities-associations-urge-dhs-to-reconsider-port-allocations/8e5771ad69aa40aed3ae590bf914477d.html) </span>

This week the Security Industry Association (SIA), along with the American Association of
AND
“Many of these projects are scalable and ready to be implemented now.”

Only the plan’s federal investment solves
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">__<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Wainio, 2012</span>__</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">(Richard, Port Director and CEO, Tampa Port Authority, “House Committee on Homeland Security’s Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications Hearing “Ensuring the Efficiency, Effectiveness and Transparency of Homeland Security Grants (Part II): Stakeholder Perspectives”, April, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt;">[[http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/TPADOCS-.pdf]]</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">)</span>

The plan to consolidate the Port Security Grant Program into one National Preparedness Grant Program
AND
to create a less efficient and less focused approach to funding necessary projects.

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">There is no one-size-fits-all solution – grants allow funds to be tailored to local and specific security needs while being cost share free which is critical to effective port hardening</span>
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">__<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Logistics Management, 2010</span>__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (“U.S. Port Security: A Work in Progress”, July 10, Proquest)</span>

Americas seaports are taking several different paths toward providing shippers with safe and secure commerce
AND
plans and funding should be made available for resiliency and business continuity projects."

The plan solves the problems with the status quo and doesn’t impede on trade
**__<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Stana, 2003</span>__**<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> – Richard, Director of Homeland Security and Justice Issues at the General Accounting Office, Masters Degree from Kent State, ‘Challenges Facing the Department of Homeland Security in Balancing its Border Security and Trade Facilitation Missions’, http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03902t.pdf</span>

**__Information is key to identifying high-risk cargo__**<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Such information can come from </span>
