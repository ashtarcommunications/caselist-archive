==1AC: Debate Quals-All We Do Is Win== 
<span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**In the beginnings of the 21st century, America is facing many challenges. We face a sluggish economy, costly wars, and a deterioration of foreign relations. One way to alleviate these problems is to remove our brave men and women in our military from countries where they are no longer needed. For this reason, David and I strongly affirm the following: “****<span style="color: black;">Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military and/or police presence in one or more of the following: South Korea, Japan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey. </span>**</span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span class="Underline">**<span style="text-decoration: none; textunderline: none;">__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">In light of the recent attacks and provocations made by North Korea, David and I propose the following plan to alleviate tensions on the Korean peninsula and ensure America is not dragged into another costly war: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence by implementing a phased withdrawal of its ground troops in South Korea</span>__</span>**</span></span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span class="Underline">**<span style="text-decoration: none; textunderline: none;">__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Our first observation is the stock issue of inherency: </span>__</span>**</span></span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia;">However, a 2011 study conducted by Bruce Klinger, a Senior Research Fellow for North East Asia atthe Heritage Foundation, has shown that despite US involvement—we can expect more provocations on the premise of factors external to military deterrence such as recession and succession in the North </span>**</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">At the end of 2010, the Korean Peninsula stood on the brink of an abyss of military conflict. North Korea threatened a “nuclear war disaster”.....</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">A</span> <span style="background: yellow; color: black;">miscalculation by either side could spark a destructive conflagration</span><span style="color: black;">.</span> </span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia;">Our second observation is that of significance: </span>**</span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia;">First, according to Doug Bandow, a Senior Fellow at the CATO Institute, on November 24, the recent Yeonpyeong artillery exchange highlights the risk that US military presence entails—he argues that our not only do our forces not deter the North, they actually risk entangling the US in a Korean conflict ensuring escalation and further tensions </span>**</span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Bandow, Nov 24, 2010 – Senior Fellow @ the Cato Institute, former special assistant of foreign affairs to Ronal Reagan, JD from Stanford [Déjà Vu on the Korean Peninsula <span style="color: blue;">[[http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu-the-korean-peninsula-4474]]</span> The Skeptics </span>
<span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="background: yellow; color: black;">With North Korea shelling a</span> <span style="color: black;">South Korean</span> <span style="background: yellow; color: black;">island</span><span style="color: black;">, and Seoul responding in kind,</span> <span style="background: yellow; color: black;">fears of a second Korean War are wafting through Washington</span><span style="color: black;">.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">.....And the </span><span style="color: black;">South is capable of deterring the DPRK and winning any conflict that might erupt.</span> </span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia;">Furthermore, Paul Stares, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, argued in a 2011 article that structural factors such as new actors, air power, recession and succession ensure that those provocations will escalate—the US must withdraw to avoid being drawn in to a conflict that isn’t going to help anyone </span>**</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">Remarkably, despite all the commentary on the current crisis, to say nothing of the obvious stakes involved, scant attention has been given to how tensions might actually escalate rather than dissipate contrary to past experience. Certainly</span> <span style="color: black;">plenty of commentators have warned about how “miscalculation,” .....then</span> <span style="background: yellow; color: black;">additional escalatory pressures could come into play</span> </span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia;">Finally, in a November 2010 article, Stares found that the risks of this escalation would include Asian war, a collapse in the US and global economy, and would deal a significant blow to US-China relations </span>**</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;">The United States has much at stake if</span> <span style="background: yellow; color: black;">future provocations</span> <span style="color: black;">and other military incidents</span> <span style="background: yellow; color: black;">on</span> <span style="color: black;">or around</span> <span style="background: yellow; color: black;">the Korean peninsula escalate <span style="background: yellow;">militarily</span>, threateningthe stability of northeast Asia</span><span style="color: black;">. ....the primary U.S. goal in Korea should be the avoidance of war.</span> </span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span class="Underline">**<span style="text-decoration: none; textunderline: none;">__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">While at a glance it may seem logical to maintain US troops in the region to prevent these problems, our research indicates that in fact the opposite is true, a recent study published in the Odessa American in 2011 gave conclusive evidence that a US withdrawal would be the best way to deal with and prevent the problems we have highlighted, furthermore, it indicates that in the advent of an actual war, South Korea would have the capability of crushing the North, and there is no reason to risk American lives </span>__</span>**</span></span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia;">Aside from just the tensions factor, Leon Hadar, a research fellow at the Cato Institute, reported on November 30 that a US withdrawal will cause China to step in to resolve North Korean aggression </span>**</span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia;">Finally, according to Global Security Newswire on November 29th, China’s involvement is the only way to solve the root cause of North Korean provocations—a US withdrawal would actually be beneficial </span>**</span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia;">Contention 4 is the external advantages to voting affirmative </span>**</span>
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia;">Advantage 1 is regionalism </span>**</span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia;">First, according to the director for the Center for International Affairs, Dr. Srdja Trifkovic, in November 2010, a US withdrawal encourages South Korean independence and regional solutions that would involve China, South Korea, and Japan, allowing the US to pursue a more effective and efficient strategy of offshore balancing </span>**</span>

A strategic anachronism five decades old would thus be finally ended. The above conclusions from October 2008 still stand, word for word.</span>** </span></span>


<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia;">And, according University of Chicago professor, John Mearsheimer in 2011, pursuing a Reagan-like offshore balancing grand strategy is the best way to maintain American leadership and solves a litany of impacts—this is an independent reason for to vote affirmative </span>**</span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span class="Underline">**<span style="text-decoration: none; textunderline: none;">__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Advantage 2 is the economy </span>__</span>**</span></span>
<span style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; vertical-align: baseline;">**<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11pt;">First, eliminating wasteful spending is crucial to fixing the economy—and The Market Financial found in 2010 that the hundreds of billions spent on maintaining foreign military presence could created millions of jobs </span>**</span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Second, in 2010, Detroitbussinessbureau.com stated that even a small Korean war would kill the US and world economies—plan key to prevent a collapse that would shatter our ailing economy </span>**</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Once again, as a result this time of North Korea being fingered for sinking a South Korean Navy vessel, the Cheonan, even the remote possibility of a war on the Korean peninsula of Northeast Asia should be creating a lot more concern than it has in the United States. The concern, raised pointedly not quite a year ago by North Korea’s relentless saber-rattling with rockets and nukes, should not be just among diplomats, military strategists and the White House—but rather by American consumers and the dealers and importers of products made in South Korea. Yes, there should be a universal worry because the Korean peninsula conceivably could again become a meat-grinder of casualties for young American soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines the way it did exactly 60 years ago. Now the U. S. has only 28,000 troops in Korea and is heavily committed – critics say over committed – in Iraq and Afghanistan. </span>**__<span style="background: yellow;">Even if short lasting, a shooting war in Korea would be devastating.......</span>__** __<span style="background: yellow;">would soon find themselves without new products to sell or parts to repair them</span>__<span style="background: yellow; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> And I get the impression from talking to one of the major Korean companies that there is no contingency plan should there be a war. They are too busy cashing in on America’s thirst for their products. So America’s stake in peaceful relations on the Korean peninsula is a lot closer to home than you might think. </span></span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Finally, according to Michael Lind, the Policy Director of the Economic Growth Program at the New America Foundation, history shows us that economic stagnation leads to a plethora of problems including diplomatic rivalries, tensions, and disputes between countries that would have dangerous and potentially fatal consequences for our global economic system </span>**</span>

Fighting on the Korean Peninsula may have stopped with a cease-fire in July 1953, but North and South Korea have remained in a tense state of armed truce ever since, with open warfare just a hair-trigger away. The sinking of the South Korean navy vessel Cheonan on March 26 -- which an international investigation team concluded last week to be the result of a North Korean torpedo attack -- shows how volatile the situation remains between North and South. </span><span style="background: yellow;">There is a real danger of the current war of words....</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">to end the Korean War, not start it anew. </span></span>

===Pakistan Stability Cp=== 
The United States Federal Government Should
-fund international development schemes that benefit businesses and people on both sides of the Indo- Pakistani border.
-encourage Indo-Pakistani trade and investment along the border and Kashmir divide.
-move rapidly to implement high-profile assistance projects and should also reach out on a sustained basis to nontraditional allies in Pakistani society, including business interests, educators, local media, and nongovernmental organizations
-maintain current levels of economic and technical assistance to help military and civilian leaders reconstruct and establish control over areas hard-hit by the flood, including those contested by militant forces. American assistance should also encourage private sector investment in conflict-prone and flood-ravaged regions
-ease trade restrictions on Pakistani textile exports.

This solves the stabilities

* All military personnel must be required to pass rigorous local driving tests and provide adequate insurance coverage for full compensation of damages done to local people in East Asia. Until this requirement can be implemented, the U.S. government must fully compensate local victims when accidents occur.
* SOFAs should be revised to protect host communities against crimes committed by U.S. troops and against environmental contamination from U.S. military operations. This includes the Visiting Forces Agreement with the Philippines, which should be revised to protect the human rights of women and children.
* Congress should pass the Violence Against Women Act II (HR 357/S 51). Title V has provisions that address U.S. military violence overseas.
* The U.S. military should support the research, counseling, and rehabilitation work of NGOs dealing with the negative effects of U.S. military operations. It should also encourage efforts to create employment opportunities for women besides military prostitution.
* The U.S. should take responsibility for Amerasian children. Congress should pass the American Asian Justice Act (HR 1128), an amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act (HR 1128) to facilitate the immigration of Amerasians born in the Philippines, or Japan who were fathered by U.S. citizens. Immigration procedures will need flexibility in documentation requirements.
* The U.S. military should investigate contamination of land and water and should undertake cleanup to acceptable standards. It should conduct research into the health effects of military toxics and should publicize its findings widely in accessible languages.

<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 5pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The centrality of these mutual processes of assurance and deference means that the stability of a hierarchical order is fundamentally related to a collective sense of certainty about the leadership and order of the hierarchy. This certainty is rooted in a combination of material calculations – smaller states' assurance that the expected costs of the dominant state conquering them would be higher than the benefits – and ideational convictions – the sense of legitimacy, derived from shared values and norms that accompanies the super-ordinate state's authority in the social order.

===Korean Identity K=== 

<span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">First is the link: the affirmative demonizes North Korea and portrays it as a threat – they say it’s perfectly ok for the US to have thousands of nuclear weapons but if North Korea has one or two then the entire world goes to hell – this conception of North Korea as dangerous prevents effective solutions to problems and is in itself a violent way of viewing the world</span>

===Womyn Oppression (Rape) Cp=== 
The United States Federal Government Should:
• Promote and honor more women soldiers. The more respect women are shown by the command, the less abuse they will get from their comrades.
• Teach officers and enlistees that rape is torture and a war crime.
• Expel men from the military who attack their female comrades.
• Ban the consumption of pornography.
• Prohibit the use of sexist language by drill instructors.
• Educate officers to insist that women be treated with respect.
• Train military counselors to help male and female soldiers not only with war trauma, but also with childhood abuse and sexual assault.
• Cease admitting soldiers with backgrounds of domestic or sexual violence.

<span style="font-family: Arial;">A. Interpretations</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">First, the word ‘in’ means throughout </span>
<span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Words and Phrases 08 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Permanent Edition, vol. 20a, p. 207) </span><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 8pt;">Colo. 1887. In the Act of 1861 providing that justices of the peace shall have jurisdiction “in” their respective counties to hear and determine all complaints, </span></span>

<span style="color: #0d0d0d;">the word “in” should be construed to mean “throughout”</span><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> such counties. Reynolds v. Larkin, 14, p. 114, 117, 10 Colo. 126.</span>

<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Second, presence must occur within countries</span>
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Dilag, 05</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;"> - Major (Select), United States Air Force (Bayani, “ACCESS ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE IN THAILAND AND THE PHILIPPINES,” [[http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/2005/Mar/05Mar_Dilag.pdf]]) The RAND Corporation undertook a study under the Project AIR FORCE that was sponsored by the Deputy Chief of Staff for Air and Space Operations (AF/XO) that sought to “...examine the political, operational, logistical, and force protection issues associated with overseas basing for the Expeditionary Aerospace Force.”27 The RAND report entitled //A Global Access Strategy for the U.S. Air Force// explores the “pure” basing and access strategies.28 The study covered several issues and variables that may affect other countries’ decision to grant or deny access to the U.S. military. The RAND report distinguished three kinds of access, viz., (1) permanent presence, (2) mission presence, and (3) limited access. “</span></span><span style="color: black;">Permanent presence” is defined</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> by the authors </span><span style="color: black;">as, “The presence of U.S. forces abroad, in bases or facilities that are operated by the U</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="color: black;">S</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="color: black;">either alone or in concert with host countries..</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">.”29 American bases in NATO countries, Japan, Korea, and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba are examples of this kind of basing arrangement. </span><span style="color: black;">“Mission presence” was described as substantial presence in countries </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">for the purpose of an ongoing military mission where there may or may not be treaty commitments.30</span>

<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Third, “Military” includes the Navy, Marines, Army, Air Force, and Coast Guard </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">RANDOM HISTORY, 07 </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">(History website; all authors have at least a BA, many have advanced degrees, “Pluralism, Expansionism, and Democracy: A History of the U.S. Military,” Random History and Word Origins for the Curious Mind, December 14,[[http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/020military.html]]) </span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In many ways, the history of the America’s military is a history of America itself, for it is a projection of America’s political, economic, and institutional issues. U.S. military history is both vast and complex, but its pluralistic military institutions, dual force of professional and citizen soldiers, and commitment to civilian control of the military have been consistent themes. As of 2007, </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11pt;">the term “military” encompasses the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps, which are all under the command of the D</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">epartment </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11pt;">o</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">f </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 11pt;">D</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 8pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">efense. The U.S. president is Commander in Chief of each of these branches and also has authority to assume control of individual state militia or National Guard units. Today, America still stands as the world’s premier military superpower, but it has not always been this way.</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia;">B. Violation—you only remove a subset of military presence in <<INSERT COUNTRY(S)>>, the aff must withdraw troops from all branches of the military to be topical </span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia;">C. Standards— </span>
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">1. Limits—they explode the limits of the topic by allowing them to only remove one type of military presence leading to infinite tiny affs, and minor modifications won’t link to any of the topic disads. </span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">2. Neg ground—our ground here is hosed, they inherently spike out of the major topic disads like deterrence, relations, and withdrawal, takes out links to specific disads like a Navy DA, destroys neg CP ground, and guts in depth solvency debates about each branch of the military T is a voter for fairness and education, default to competing interps because reasonability is arbitrary and leads to a race to the bottom </span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia;">AND 2AC clarification is too late, it makes the aff a moving target and justifies 2AC plan texts, don’t let them get away with it because clarification moots 8 minutes of our speech time and is flat out abusive </span>__

It's bad
Strats- They force us to defend multiple world views this kills our ability to garner offense.
Arg Responsibilities- Neg justifies infinite world views, and leads to non indepth discussion, so the neg just throws poopy at the wall to see what sticks.
Our interpt is either dispo or Preround conditionality.
