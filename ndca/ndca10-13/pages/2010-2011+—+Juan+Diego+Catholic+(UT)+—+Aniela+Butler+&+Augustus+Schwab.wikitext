Observation One is Solvency:

We compete-the plan text mandates a reduction of all counterinsurgency presence-including COIN aircraft.

And the CP solves best, it avoids every internal link to why generic COIN is bad and is sustainable even without other troop presence

===Prosecution=== 

The United States federal government should grant the Republic of Korea the ability to prosecute its soldiers for sexual crimes and pass legislation monitoring and actively preventing prostitution and sex-trafficking near military bases in South Korea. The United States Federal Government should stop all efforts to get jurisdiction over military offenses including waivers from foreign laws and manipulating the facts of a case to get under its jurisdictional control. The United States Federal government should revise the US-JAPAN Status of forces agreement, mandating that Japan has the jurisdiction over crimes committed by US Service men in Japan. The United States federal government will also mandate the Department of Defense cooperate with Non-governmental organizations to stop all violence against women by the armed services in South Korea.

===**//Methodology//**=== 

**//The affirmative makes decisions in the way that they research, and their decision to not experience and collaborate with those whom have experienced the devastation of US militarism, because that is what their aff prescribed to do- their privilege as scholars provides them with the necessity of collaborating with and providing an opportunity for the voiceless to present their voices in your research on their own terms and in their own words- Lack of this kind of research ignores your responsibility- This reenacts forms of domination and colonization on those you claim to speak for and help.//**

===//Zupancic//=== 

//**<span style="color: black;">Victims and violence aren’t the only products of our increasingly traumatic modern world. Indeed, the process of speaking out and speaking against the sources of violence may very well be the defining theme of our age. These discussions, however, continually circulate towards the discussion of particular institutional practices and their mediation of our relationships.</span>**//

//**<span style="color: black;"> In essence, the questions most analyzed in the context of these discussions is not simply how can we assert ourselves as ethical individuals in the world, but instead what particular renegotiations of institutional practices provide us the opportunity to do so.</span>**//

//**<span style="color: black;"> The affirmative poses the question of ethics only insofar as it relates to the domain of politics. Tying ethical reorientation of ourselves with the reorientation of our collective political spheres takes precedent and in the process produces these ethics and our relationship with others merely as a background for political transformations. The affirmative makes the question not how much how we can change ourselves but instead how we can change our institutions to change ourselves. This process produces a mediated relationship that makes genuine ethical engagement impossible.</span>**//

//**<span style="color: black;">The affirmative will respond that the plan and the political play no prominent role in the posture of the 1AC. This, however, is the premise of our whole argument. Their belief that the political must remain in the background nonetheless, in order to generate change is the ultimate sell-out of their ethical commitment. This gesture is intrinsically unethical because it admits from the get-go that the ethical posture itself is insufficient absent its capacity to generate change within the domain of institutional politics.</span>**//

//<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [*1202] Thus, as Derrida puts it, </span>__"ethics enjoins ………………………. basis of something that resembles pure faith.__//

//**<span style="color: black;">The Belief that our activisms must inevitably, inexorably respond to the political conditions of our time through the leveraging of particular institutional appeals is precisely what nullifies our ethical potential. No matter the force of its opposition, the connection of transformation with an appeal to our institutions, mediates our relationships in such a manner that ethical transformation outside this frame of mediation becomes impossible. </span>**//

**<span style="color: black;">For the affirmative, the ethical and the political are one in the same – inseparable. The political domain has become incomplete without ethical intervention and ethical intervention insufficient without political input. This logic is responsible for the genuine corruption of our ethics. Reading ethics through the lens of politics ignores ethical possibilities all around us all the time. The affirmative builds a wall between these ethical possibilities, insisting that they are only possible when our political gestures are transformed.</span>**
