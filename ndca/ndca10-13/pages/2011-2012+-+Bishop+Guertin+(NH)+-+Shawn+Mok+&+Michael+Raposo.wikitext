**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">A. Interpretation---Exploration means to expand human presence to space</span>**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 17.3333px;">Logsdon 9</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">(John, professor of political science at George Washington, former director of the Space Policy Institute, “Fifty Years of Human Spaceflight Why Is There Still a Controversy?,” [[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025875_2010028362.pdf]])</span>
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Exploration as a Compelling Rationale Many believe that the only sustainable rationale for a government-funded program of human spaceflight is to take the lead in exploring the solar system beyond low Earth orbit.20 </span>__The MIT white <span class="Underline">paper provides an insightful definition of exploration: Exploration is a human activity</span>__<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, undertaken by certain cultures at certain times for particular reasons. It has components of national interest, scientific research, and technical innovation, but is defined by none of them. </span>We define__exploration as an expansion of the realm of human experience, bringing people into new places, situations, and environments__<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, expanding and redefining what it means to be human. What is the role of Earth in human life? Is human life fundamentally tied to the earth, or could it survive without the planet? Human presence, and its attendant risk, turns a spaceflight into a story that is compelling to large numbers of people. Exploration also has a moral dimension because it is in effect a cultural conversation on the nature and meaning of human life. </span>__Exploration__<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> by this definition </span>__can only be accomplished by direct human presence__<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and may be deemed worthy of the risk of human life.21 In the wake of the 2003 Columbia accident that took the lives of seven astronauts and the report of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board that criticized the absence of a compelling mission for human spaceflight as “a failure of national leadership,”22 </span>__the U__<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">tates, in January 2004, </span>__adopted a new policy to guide its human spaceflight activities__<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. The policy directed NASA to “implement a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system and beyond” and to “extend human presence across the solar system, starting with a human return to the Moon by the year 2020, in preparation for human exploration of Mars and other destinations.”23 </span>__This policy seems totally consistent with the definition of exploration provided in the MIT white paper__<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. The issue is whether such a policy and its implementation, focusing on human exploration beyond Earth orbit, can provide an adequate and sustainable justification for a continuing program of government-sponsored spaceflight that will make contributions that will outweigh the costs and risks involved to the “primary objectives” of national pride and prestige, and also to some of the several “secondary objectives.” </span>

Observation 1: The status quo is always an option to us or you after the round – proving the CP worse does not logically justify the plan. Logic creates good education and predictable rules.


Observation 2: Presumption remains negative—the CP is less change and a tie goes to the runner.


Observation 3: The CP is non-topical. It violates the word “increase”. The CP decreases funding for space exploration.

Observation 4: The CP competes. It’s mutually exclusive with the aff’s increase. Any permutation severs the increase and proves the resolution is false.


The resolution proposes a controversial policy direction that divides ground. The topic could have said “change space exploration or development” if this was aff ground.

Text: **<span style="background: white; color: black;">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration should substantially increase its deployment of nanosatellites beyond the Earth’s mesosphere through the Multipurpose NanoMissile System. </span>**The National Aeronautics and Space Administration should fund the mission by holding Senior Reviews over extended missions.
Observation 1: The status quo is always an option to us or you after the round – proving the CP worse does not logically justify the plan. Logic creates good education and predictable rules.
Observation 2: Presumption remains negative—the CP is less change and a tie goes to the runner.
Observation 3: The CP is non-topical. It violates the word “increase”. The CP decreases funding for space exploration.

First, though, some background. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">When a mission is first approved</span>, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">its budget includes funds f</span>or operating the spacecraft in flight and initial analysis of the scientific data. The <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">period of flight covered by this budget is known as the prime mission.</span> Once the spacecraft completes the prime mission, there's usually years of life left in it to go to new targets</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (such as the flights of the Deep Impact and Stardust spacecraft to second comets</span><span class="underline">) or to continue collecting science at the prime target</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (such as the rover Opportunity at Mars or Cassini at Saturn). </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">These mission continuations are called extended mission</span>s.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> NASA has to budget substantial funds to operate its many planetary and other science missions in their extended missions. Generally the costs of these extended missions aren't well publicized (likely because NASA and the press reasonably assume few people in the public care). However, we know </span><span class="underline">that <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the Cassini mission in its current extended mission costs about $60M per year</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (probably near the high end) </span><span class="underline">and</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> the EPOXI (formerly the </span><span class="underline">Deep Impact)</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> mission </span><span class="underline">costs about $5M per year</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (probably near the low end). </span><span class="underline">Cassini could operate through 2017, so the rest of its extended mission will cost ~$300M</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (assuming flat budgets). </span><span class="underline">The <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">EPOXI mission will cost around $45M</span> if its fuel holds out for a 2020 asteroid flyby. Compare these costs to the $425M dollar cost of a new Discovery mission. Then consider the list of missions that are in or will enter extended missions in the next two years: Cassini</span> (Saturn) <span class="underline">EPOXI</span> (possible 2020 asteroid flyby) <span class="underline">GRAIL</span> (lunar orbiters) <span class="underline">Kepler</span>* (planet finding space telescope) <span class="underline">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Mars Odyssey Orbiter Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Opportunity Mars Rover MESSENGER</span>** (Mercury orbiter) *Kepler is an Astrophysics Division mission, but it, too, will be up for review **MESSENGER's extended mission was recently approved in a special Senior Review <span class="underline">To <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">decide whether or not to continue funding an extended mission NASA holds Senior Reviews</span>. These panels evaluate the potential scientific return of the extended mission against its costs. The panel can recommend continued funding as planned, enhanced funding, reduced funding, or mission termination. As I understand it, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">NASA provides a budget for of its science divisions for extended missions</span>. The panel needs to recommend the mix of missions and their funding to fit within the budget.</span> <span class="underline">Early in 2012, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a series of Senior Reviews will be held that appears to cover all NASA's planetary</span>, astrophysics, and heliophysics <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">missions</span> that are in or will enter extended missions by 2014.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (I don't know if the Earth science missions will be included in this senior review.) As backdrop to this review, remember that each of these divisions are projected to face flat or declining budgets in the next several years**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">. </span>**<span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; mso-ansi-font-size: 8.0pt;">In addition, NASA will need to find funds in its declining budget from these programs to help fund the completion of the James Webb Space Telescope, the over budget successor to the Hubble Space Telescope.</span></span> The review panels have a tough job. Each of these missions continue to gather data for which there will not be a chance to gather again for many years or even decades. How do you rank, for example, the science that will be enabled by the next 1%* of Mars imaged at 0.3 m resolution by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter against the next 40+ planned Titan flybys by the Cassini spacecraft? (*In it's first four years of operation, the MRO's HiRISE camera imaged about 1% of Mars at this resolution.) </span><span class="underline">While NASA is still waiting to hear (or be able to publicly talk about) its future planetary program budget, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the indications are that the budget for extended missions will be tight. Dollars reserved for extended missions will not be available to fly and build new missions</span>.</span></span>
