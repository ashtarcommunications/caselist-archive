<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 11pt;">Solar flares like the huge one that erupted on the sun early today (Aug. 9) will only become more common as our sun nears its maximum level of activity in 2013, scientists say. Tuesday's flare was the [[http://www.space.com/12580-sun-unleashes-major-solar-flare.html|most powerful sun storm since 2006]], and was rated an X6.9 on the three-class scale for solar storms (X-Class is strongest, with M-Class in the middle and C-Class being the weakest). Flares such as this one could become the norm soon, though, as our [[http://www.space.com/11506-space-weather-sunspots-solar-flares-coronal-mass-ejections.html|sun's 11-year cycle]] of magnetic activity ramps up, scientists explained. The sun is just coming out of a lull, and scientists expect the next peak of activity in 2013. The current cycle, called Solar Cycle 24, began in 2008. "We still are on the upswing with this recent burst of activity," said Phil Chamberlin, a solar scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who is a deputy project scientist for the agency's Solar Dynamics Observatory, a sun-studying satellite that launched in February 2010. "We could definitely in the next year or two see more events like this; there's a potential to see larger events as well."

However, we may not be so fortunate in the future, experts warned.

**We are more vulnerable to the effects of solar storms than ever before**

**Derbyshire 11** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[David, Reporter for Mail Online, 2/22, “Get ready for a 'global Katrina': Biggest ever solar storm could cause power cuts which last for MONTHS” Science and Tech, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1359136/Global-Katrina-Biggest-solar-storm-cause-power-cuts-MONTHS.html]</span>

The world is overdue a ferocious 'space storm' that could knock out communications satellites, ground aircraft and trigger blackouts - causing hundreds of billions of pounds of damage, scientists say. Astronomers today warned that mankind is now more vulnerable to a major solar storm than at any time in history - and that the planet should prepare for a global Katrina-style disaster. A massive eruption of the sun would send waves of radiation and charged particles to Earth, damaging the satellite systems used for synchronising computers, airline navigation and phone networks. If the storm is powerful enough it could even crash stock markets and cause power cuts that last weeks or months, experts told the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The chances of a disruption from space are getting stronger because the sun is entering the most active period of its 11 to 12-year natural cycle. The world got a taster of the sun's explosive power last week when the strongest solar eruption in five years sent a torrent of charged plasma hurtling towards the world at 580 miles per second. The storm created spectacular aurorae and disrupted radio communications. Professor Sir John Beddington, the government's chief scientific adviser, said: 'The issue of space weather has got to be taken seriously. We've had a relatively quiet period of space weather - but we can't expect that quiet period to continue. 'At the same time over that period the potential vulnerability of our systems has increased dramatically, whether it is the smart grid in our electricity systems or the ubiquitous use of GPS in just about everything we use these days. 'The situation has changed. We need to be thinking about the ability both to categorise and explain and give early warning when particular types of space weather are likely to occur.' Solar storms are caused by massive explosions on the sun. The explosions release waves of X-rays and ultraviolet radiation which smash into the Earth within minutes, disrupting radio signals and damaging the electronics of satellites. They are followed ten to 20 minutes later by a burst of energetic particles which cause even more havoc with satellites - and then 15 to 30 hours later by supercharged plasma which collides with Earth's magnetic field. The plasma create the aurora - or Northern Lights - and can induce electrical currents in power lines and cables. Jane Lubchenco, head of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said: 'This is not a matter of if, it is simply a matter of when and how big. 'The last time we had a maximum in the solar cycle, about 10 years ago, the world was a very different place. Cell phones are now ubiquitous; they were certainly around but we didn't rely on them for so many different things. 'Many things that we take for granted today are so much more prone to the process of space weather than was the case in the last solar maximum.' The sun goes through a regular activity cycle about 11 years long on average. The last solar maximum occurred in 2001. Its latest minimum was particularly weak and long lasting. Space storms are not new. The first major solar flare was recorded by British astronomer Richard Carrington in 1859. Other solar geomagnetic storms have been observed in recent decades. One huge solar flare in 1972 cut off long-distance telephone communication in the mid-western state of Illinois, Nasa said. Another similar flare in 1989 'provoked geomagnetic storms that disrupted electric power transmission' and caused blackouts across the Canadian province of Quebec, the U.S. space agency said.

Advanced Composition Explorer ( ACE ) was only built to withstand the effects from ‘average solar flare’, not a ‘significant solar flare’. NASA knows ACE 13-year old sensors will ‘cease to function before a significant solar flare even passes ACE in space’. NASA Advanced Composition Explorer ( ACE ) sensing detectors are now 13-years old, not as sensitive as newer technology detectors today, plus ACE has exceeded its NASA calculated life expectance.

**Contention Two: Solar Storms**
**Scenario one is Miscalc**

**Solar storms cause satellite failure**
**NOAA 2003** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">National Oceanographic and Aeronautics Administration, NOAA Magazine story 98, June 19, “The Growing Importance of Space Weather Information”[[http://www.magazine.noaa.gov/stories/mag93.htm]] </span>
Satellites, astronauts and aircraft carry highly advanced components, which are susceptible to the energetic charged particles and plasmas present in the Sun-Earth environment. [[http://www.magazine.noaa.gov/stories/images/finalsatelliteeffect.gif|Satellites]]: When a satellite travels through an energized environment during geomagnetic storms, the charged particles striking the spacecraft cause various portions of it to be differentially charged, leading to the damage (and possibly failure) of the satellite's electronic systems. Furthermore, as technology has allowed spacecraft components to become smaller, their miniaturized systems have become increasingly vulnerable to the more energetic solar particles, which can cause physical damage to microchips and change software commands in satellite-borne computers. Increased solar activity can also cause the atmosphere to heat and expand. For satellites in low-earth orbit, this atmospheric change can exert increased drag on the satellites, causing them to slow down and change orbit. Unless low-Earth-orbit satellites are routinely boosted to higher orbits, they slowly fall, and could eventually burn up in Earth's atmosphere. Astronauts: Space weather conditions can also be hazardous to humans in space. Astronauts are normally well protected by the shelter of the space station. However, when they venture outside their protective space station, they are vulnerable to the same high doses of particles or radiation as the space station itself. In reality, however, the radiation risk to astronauts is quite small if they work within the Earth's magnetic field and wear layers of protective clothing. Aircraft: Solar proton events can also produce elevated radiation aboard aircraft flying at high altitudes and over long distances. For example, during air travel from New York City to Tokyo, passengers and crew could be exposed to levels of radiation equaling that of a chest X-ray during an intense solar radiation storm. The most intense solar flares, on the other hand, can be as injurious to humans as the low-energy radiation from a nuclear blast. The penetration of high-energy particles into living cells — measured as radiation dose — can lead to chromosome damage and potentially cancer, while larger doses can be fatal. Although the likelihood of these risks is small, monitoring of solar proton events by satellite can help reduce the threats of human exposure.


**Satellite malfunctions are indistinguishable – a harsh space environment will trigger an accidental war**
**Coffelt 5** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">– Colonel in the US Airforce, space operator (Christopher A., “The Best Defense: Charting the Future of US Space Strategy and Policy.” Maxwell AFB, AL: USAF Air University, June 2005. page 95 [[http://ctbtdebate.org/evidence/2338/]])</span>
Those that operate satellite systems and are familiar with space operations know the difficulties in determining the exact cause of many satellite malfunctions or “anomalies.” It is oftentimes difficult if not impossible to determine if satellite failures or problems are due to an everyday system anomaly, a natural event caused by the harsh space environment, the result of unintentional interference, or due to a malicious attack. If the US fields weapons that can interfere with spacecraft, failures on adversary spacecraft may be attributed as a us attack even when no such attack occurred. This would obviously heighten tensions which could escalate into larger conflict, and be quite destabilizing. Moreover, this is already beginning to occur. According to a GAO report, in 1997 “Indonesia intentionally interfered with and denied the services of a commercial satellite belonging to the south pacific island kingdom of Tonga because of a satellite orbital slot dispute.” Attribution of this attack was easy because Indonesia admitted to the attack, but is not likely to be so easy for most cases. Accurate attribution may, however, be irrelevant in future cases where country A merely perceives that a satellite failure or denial is the result of an attack by rival country B. Whether or not an attack actually occurred, the result will be the same as if it had. Increased tensions between the two countries will result, and country A is likely to act/respond, causing a counter reaction by country B and so on. In the end, there will be no proof that the failure was simply a system anomaly, an actual attack by country B, or possibly even an attack by a third party, country C, to instigate a conflict between A and B for their own purposes. Once measures are employed against these spacecraft, it also sets an international precedent for the use of such systems as an accepted, legal form of warfare. One can only expect proliferation of these systems and their use to become more common, as seen in the Indonesian case and others that have occurred since that time. Most importantly, the mere development and deployment of these systems starts the US down the slippery slope of offensive space strategy that may have serious, negative, unintended consequences that make it harder for the us to protect its own systems and access to space.

**30 Minute Timeframe to massive nuclear war**
**Morgan 9**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Dennis Ray Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Yongin Campus - South Korea, Futures, Volume 41, Issue 10, December 2009, Pages 683-693</span>
As for the accidental factor of nuclear war, both the U.S. and Russia have ‘‘launch on warning’’ systems that send off rockets before confirmation that a nuclear attack is underway; thus, especially during a time of tensions, a massive nuclear war could take place within only 30 min after a warning—even if the warning is false. This scenario has almost happened on several occasions in the past. It was only because of individual human judgments, which disbelieved the false warnings, that nuclear war did not happen, but if the human judgment had indeed interpreted the warnings according to protocol, an allout nuclear war would surely have taken place.

**Scenario Two is the Economy**

**Solar storms would destroy communications infrastructure and GPS**
**IBT 11’**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [International Business Times, “Severe Solar Storms Could Disrupt Earth This Decade: NOAA” [[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/194166/20110808/solar-storms-severe-solar-storms-earth-paralyse-carrington-event.htm|__http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/194166/20110808/solar-storms-severe-solar-storms-earth-paralyse-carrington-event.htm__]]]</span>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a federal agency that focuses on the condition of the oceans and atmosphere, said [[@http://hken.ibtimes.com/articles/195225/20110809/nasa-sun-unleashes-an-earth-directed-x6-9-class-solar-flare.htm|a severe solar storm]] could cause global disruptions in GPS systems, power grids, satellite communications, and airline communications. With solar activity expected to peak around 2013, the Sun is entering a particularly active time and big flares like the recent one will likely be common during the next few years. Most solar flares will only cause minor problems with satellites and power grids, but a major flare in the mid-19th century blocked the nascent telegraph system, and some scientists believe that another such event is now overdue. In a huge solar storm back in 1859, telegraph offices worldwide were hit, some telegraph operators reported electric shocks, the telegraph systems malfunctioned and even paper caught fire. It is the strongest solar storm on record and is called the “Carrington Event,” which is named after Richard Carrington, who viewed and reported on the solar flare of Sept. 1, 1859. In 1989, six million people in Quebec, Canada were left without power for several hours when a solar storm took down a power grid. According to a report by the National Research Council in 2008, a solar storm similar to the ones in the past could cause up to $2 trillion dollars in damage across the globe today. The NOAA predicted four “extreme” solar emissions which could threaten the planet this decade. Similarly, [[http://www.ibtimes.com/topics/detail/192/nasa/|NASA]] warned that a peak in the sun's magnetic energy cycle and the number of sun spots or flares around 2013 cofuld enable extremely high radiation levels.

Commercially, the economy of the United States is heavily dependent on space assets in virtually every industry. Communications, Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, agriculture, weather monitoring, and shipment tracking in the manufacturing sector are all indispensable to workings of the market.7, 8 With international economies interwoven across borders and cultures, damage to a critical satellite might pose serious monetary repercussions throughout multiple countries. For example, nearly a decade ago the failure of the Galaxy IV satellite rendered certain communications useless for two days. “The failure of that one satellite left about 80 (to) 90 percent of the 45 million pager customers in the United States without service…and 5400 of 7700 Chevron gas stations without pay-at-the-pump capability.”9

**Economic depression triggers multiple impacts**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Harris and Burrows 9</span> – PhD in European History @ Cambridge and Counselor of the US National Intelligence Council AND Member of the National Intelligence Council’s Long Range Analysis Unit (Mathew J. and Jennifer, “Revisiting the Future: Geopolitical Effects of the Financial Crisis,” April, Washington Quarterly, [[http://www.twq.com/09april/docs/09apr_Burrows.pdf]]]**
Of course, the report encompasses more than economics and indeed believes the future is likely to be the result of a number of intersecting and interlocking forces. With so many possible permutations of outcomes, each with ample Revisiting the Future opportunity for unintended consequences, there is a growing sense of insecurity. Even so, history may be more instructive than ever. While we continue to believe that the Great Depression is not likely to be repeated, the lessons to be drawn from that period include the harmful effects on fledgling democracies and multiethnic societies (think Central Europe in 1920s and 1930s) and on the sustainability of multilateral institutions (think League of Nations in the same period). There is no reason to think that this would not be true in the twenty-first as much as in the twentieth century. For that reason, the ways in which the potential for greater conflict could grow would seem to be even more apt in a constantly volatile economic environment as they would be if change would be steadier. In surveying those risks, the report stressed the likelihood that terrorism and nonproliferation will remain priorities even as resource issues move up on the international agenda. Terrorism’s appeal will decline if economic growth continues in the Middle East and youth unemployment is reduced. For those terrorist groups that remain active in 2025, however, the diffusion of technologies and scientific knowledge will place some of the world’s most dangerous capabilities within their reach. Terrorist groups in 2025 will likely be a combination of descendants of long established groups_inheriting organizational structures, command and control processes, and training procedures necessary to conduct sophisticated attacks and newly emergent collections of the angry and disenfranchised that become self-radicalized, particularly in the absence of economic outlets that would become narrower in an economic downturn. The most dangerous casualty of any economically-induced drawdown of U.S. military presence would almost certainly be the Middle East. Although Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons is not inevitable, worries about a nuclear-armed Iran could lead states in the region to develop new security arrangements with external powers, acquire additional weapons, and consider pursuing their own nuclear ambitions. It is not clear that the type of stable deterrent relationship that existed between the great powers for most of the Cold War would emerge naturally in the Middle East with a nuclear Iran. Episodes of low intensity conflict and terrorism taking place under a nuclear umbrella could lead to an unintended escalation and broader conflict if clear red lines between those states involved are not well established. The close proximity of potential nuclear rivals combined with underdeveloped surveillance capabilities and mobile dual-capable Iranian missile systems also will produce inherent difficulties in achieving reliable indications and warning of an impending nuclear attack. The lack of strategic depth in neighboring states like Israel, short warning and missile flight times, and uncertainty of Iranian intentions may place more focus on preemption rather than defense, potentially leading to escalating crises. 36 Types of conflict that the world continues to experience, such as over resources, could reemerge, particularly if protectionism grows and there is a resort to neo-mercantilist practices. Perceptions of renewed energy scarcity will drive countries to take actions to assure their future access to energy supplies. In the worst case, this could result in interstate conflicts if government leaders deem assured access to energy resources, for example, to be essential for maintaining domestic stability and the survival of their regime. Even actions short of war, however, will have important geopolitical implications. Maritime security concerns are providing a rationale for naval buildups and modernization efforts, such as China’s and India’s development of blue water naval capabilities. If the fiscal stimulus focus for these countries indeed turns inward, one of the most obvious funding targets may be military. Buildup of regional naval capabilities could lead to increased tensions, rivalries, and counterbalancing moves, but it also will create opportunities for multinational cooperation in protecting critical sea lanes. With water also becoming scarcer in Asia and the Middle East, cooperation to manage changing water resources is likely to be increasingly difficult both within and between states in a more dog-eat-dog world.


Scenario Three is Blackouts

Solar storms cause long term blackouts

**For the reasons outlined above, it is highly unlikely that any adversary would choose to—or, in the case of a terrorist cell, even be remotely capable of—carrying out a nuclear EMP strike against the US. However, it is virtually guaranteed that a powerful geomagnetic storm, capable of knocking out a significant section of the US electrical grid, will occur within the next few decades. In fact, this may well happen even within next few years as we approach the next period of elevated solar activity, known as “solar maximum”, which is forecast to peak in 2013. Geomagnetic storms are E3-like: low-intensity but long-lasting and low-frequency coupling to long-lines. The first recorded evidence of space weather effects on technology was in 1847 when currents were registered in electric telegraph wires. Later, in 1859, a major failure of telegraph systems in New England and Europe coincided with a large solar flare called the “Carrington Event”, after astronomer Richard Carrington who witnessed the instigating flare. However, the real modern-era wakeup call to geomagnetic susceptibility of our infrastructure was the (moderate intensity) geomagnetic storm that shut down the entire Hydro Quebec grid in March 1989. There were also reports of computer failures in August of that year in Toronto, Canada (which possibly indicate that the associated geomagnetic activity had considerably faster components than just E3). Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) in long-line power delivery systems are caused by the rate-of-change of the geomagnetic field, just as in an E3 pulse. Thus the severity of such geomagnetic field disturbances is measured in nanotesla per minute (nT/min). Experience with modern-day infrastructure indicates failures can result even at relatively low-threat intensities. For example, the instigating activity associated with the Hydro Quebec collapse mentioned above only reached an intensity of ~480 nT/min. Solar storms on other occasions have been known to produce geomagnetic disturbances of ~2000 nT/min, and a solar storm on May 14–15 in 1921 may have produced a disturbance of 4800 nT/min. [23]. As Mr. Kappenman states [23], “analysis indicates that storms with...excursions of ~2800 nT/min have been observed at geomagnetic latitudes of concern for modern day infrastructures. Further anecdotal evidence suggests that... ~5000 nT/min may have occurred during the Great Geomagnetic Storm of May 1921.” Our electric power grid has continued to become more vulnerable to disruption from geomagnetic storms. To understand the effects of such GIC on the electric grid we may examine the August 2003 Northeast Blackout, which was not geomagnetically induced. (It reportedly originated when high-voltage power lines came in contact with “overgrown trees”.) This outage affected the Northeast US and parts of Canada and more than 200 power plants, including several nuclear plants, were shut down as a result of the electricity cutoff. Other effects included loss of water pressure, possible sewage contamination, gridlock, various other transportation problems (because of secondary effects on railways, airlines, and gas stations), and disruption of oil refineries’ operations. Phone service was stressed due to the high call volume and several radio and television stations went off the air. It is estimated that the one-day blackout cost $7–10 billion in spoiled food, lost production, overtime wages, and other related expenses inflicted on more than one-seventh of the US population. [24] A similar vegetation-induced outage in Europe occurred on September 28, 2003, when “at 3.01 a.m., one of the main north-south transit lines – the Lukmanier transmission line – shut down following a flash-over between a conductor cable and a tree”. The blackout affected about 56 million people although electricity was restored gradually (about 3–6 hours) in most places, and in most cities electricity were powered on again during the morning. Rolling blackouts reportedly continued to affect about 5% of the population for the next two days as repairs were being made. Although the August and September 2003 outage was not geomagnetic in origin, solar outbursts during late October and early November 2003 triggered severe geomagnetic storms, with wide-ranging effects that were described as follows in a 2008 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study [25]: The Sydkraft utility group in Sweden reported that strong geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) over Northern Europe caused transformer problems and even a system failure and subsequent blackout. Radiation storm levels were high enough to prompt NASA officials to issue a flight directive to the [International Space Station] astronauts to take precautionary shelter. Airlines took unprecedented actions in their high latitude routes to avoid the high radiation levels and communication blackout areas. Rerouted flights cost airlines $10,000 to $100,000 per flight. Numerous anomalies were reported by deep space missions and by satellites at all orbits. GSFC Space Science Mission Operations Team indicated that approximately 59% of the Earth and Space science missions were impacted. The storms are suspected to have caused the loss of the $640 million ADEOS-2 spacecraft. On board the ADEOS-2 was the $150 million NASA SeaWinds instrument. Due to the variety and intensity of this solar activity outbreak, most industries vulnerable to space weather experienced some degree of impact to their operations. Even more serious effects can be expected during future powerful geomagnetic storms. To quote the NAS study [25]: Because of the interconnectedness of critical infrastructures in modern society, the impacts of severe space weather events can go beyond disruption of existing technical systems and lead to short-term as well as to long-term collateral socioeconomic disruptions… Collateral effects of a longer-term outage would likely include… disruption of the transportation, communication, banking, and finance systems, and government services; the breakdown of the distribution of potable water owing to pump failure; and the loss of perishable foods and medications because of lack of refrigeration. The resulting loss of services for a significant period of time in even one region of the country could affect the entire nation and have international impacts as well. Our electric power grid has continued to become more vulnerable to disruption from geomagnetic storms. For example, the power delivery system is now operating closer to margin, than in the past. As Kappenman states, “many of the things that we have done to increase operational efficiency and haul power long distances have inadvertently and unknowingly escalated the risks from geomagnetic storms.” The possible extent of a power system collapse from a 4800 nT/min geomagnetic storm (centered at 50° geomagnetic latitude) is shown in The most serious outcome of such power delivery system failures is damage to the transformers, although other critical systems on the grid are also at risk. As the NAS study points out, transformers experience “excessive levels of internal heating brought on by stray flux when GICs cause a transformer’s magnetic core to saturate and to spill flux outside the normal core steel magnetic circuit… previous well-documented cases have involved heating failures that caused melting and burn-through of large-amperage copper windings and leads in these transformers. These multi-ton apparatus generally cannot be repaired in the field, and if damaged in this manner, they need to be replaced with new units, which have manufacture lead times of 12 months or more.” Metatech Corp. estimates that more than 300 large extra-high voltage (EHV) transformers would be exposed to levels of GIC sufficiently high to place these units at risk of failure or permanent damage requiring replacement. In summary, current US grid operational procedures are based largely on limited experience, generally do not reduce GIC flows, and are unlikely to be adequate for historically large disturbance events. Historically large storms have a potential to cause power grid blackouts and transformer damage of unprecedented proportions, long-term blackouts, and lengthy restoration times, and chronic shortages for multiple years are possible [25].**

This is an econ internal – even a few days without electricity collapses the economy

**This worsened the already-anemic state of a U.S. economy that had been hammered by a massive stock-market meltdown and a series of confidencesapping corporate scandals. It hurt Canada, too, weakening our biggest market. So now, just when there are signs of healthy growth in both countries, is the last time you'd want to see a large part of the continent's electric-power network collapse. We can be grateful that the immediate impacts look modest. David Rosenberg, chief North American economist with Merrill Lynch, estimates that the U.S. impact could amount to as much as $30 billion for each day of interrupted activity. That's roughly one percentage point of quarterly economic growth, which means that just a few days could theoretically take economic growth in the third quarter right down to zero. But this is just the first step in his analysis. In reality, most activity was returning to something close to normal by yesterday. More important, Rosenberg says, any losses in August are likely to be recouped in September, much as economic activity rebounds to wipe out most losses after a severe winter storm. But even if we do look back on the great blackout of '03 as a mere hiccup for the economy, there will be little reason for complacency. As Royal Bank economist John Anania notes, the reliability of the power grid is absolutely indispensable in an information-age economy.**

Blackouts cause nuclear plants to meltdown
IB Times 11**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">International Business Times, written by staff reporter, 8/8/11 “Severe Solar Storms could Disrupt Earth this Decade: NOAA” http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/194166/20110808/solar-storms-severe-solar-storms-earth-paralyse-carrington-event.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">htm </span>**
**This is a particular problem in the U.S., especially and poses a severe threat especially in the eastern U.S. Several federal government studies suggest that this extreme solar activity and emissions may result in complete blackouts for years in some areas of the nation. Moreover, there may also be disruption of power supply for years, or even decades, as geomagnetic currents attracted by the storm could debilitate the transformers. Last month, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said U.S. plants affected by a blackout should be able to cope without electricity for atleast eight hours and should have procedures to keep the reactor and spent-fuel pool cool for 72 hours. Nuclear plants depend on standby batteries and backup diesel generators. Most standby power systems would continue to function after a severe solar storm, but supplying the standby power systems with adequate fuel, when the main power grids are offline for years, could become a very critical problem. If the spent fuel rod pools at the country's 104 nuclear power plants lose their connection to the power grid, the current regulations aren't sufficient to guarantee those pools won't boil over -- exposing the hot, zirconium-clad rods and sparking fires that would release deadly radiation. A report by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory said that over the standard 40-year license term of nuclear power plants, solar flare activity enables a 33 percent chance of long-term power loss, a risk that significantly outweighs that of major earthquakes and tsunamis.**

That causes extinction

Wasserman 2001 **<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Harvey – senior editor of the Free Press, October 2001, “America’s Terrorist Nuclear Threat to Itself,” http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2001/10/00_wasserman_nuclear-threat.htm)</span>**
**No sane nation hands to a wartime enemy atomic weapons set to go off within its own homeland, and then lights the fuse. Yet as the bombs and missiles drop on Afghanistan, the certainty of terror retaliation inside America has turned our 103 nuclear power plants into weapons of apocalyptic destruction, just waiting to be used against us. One or both planes that crashed into the World Trade Center on September 11, could have easily obliterated the two atomic reactors now operating at Indian Point, about 40 miles up the Hudson. The catastrophic devastation would have been unfathomable. But those and a hundred other American reactors are still running. Security has been heightened. But all are vulnerable to another sophisticated terror attack aimed at perpetrating the unthinkable. Indian Point Unit One was shut long ago by public outcry. But Units 2 & 3 have operated since the 1970s. Back then there was talk of requiring reactor containment domes to be strong enough to withstand a jetliner crash. But the biggest jets were far smaller than the ones that fly today. Nor did those early calculations account for the jet fuel whose hellish fire melted the critical steel supports that ultimately brought down the Trade Center. Had one or both those jets hit one or both the operating reactors at Indian Point, the ensuing cloud of radiation would have dwarfed the ones at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. The intense radioactive heat within today's operating reactors is the hottest anywhere on the planet. So are the hellish levels of radioactivity. Because Indian Point has operated so long, its accumulated radioactive burden far exceeds that of Chernobyl, which ran only four years before it exploded. Some believe the WTC jets could have collapsed or breached either of the Indian Point containment domes. But at very least the massive impact and intense jet fuel fire would destroy the human ability to control the plants' functions. Vital cooling systems, backup power generators and communications networks would crumble. Indeed, Indian Point Unit One was shut because activists warned that its lack of an emergency core cooling system made it an unacceptable risk. The government ultimately agreed. But today terrorist attacks could destroy those same critical cooling and control systems that are vital to not only the Unit Two and Three reactor cores, but to the spent fuel pools that sit on site. The assault would not require a large jet. The safety systems are extremely complex and virtually indefensible. One or more could be wiped out with a wide range of easily deployed small aircraft, ground-based weapons, truck bombs or even chemical/biological assaults aimed at the operating work force. Dozens of US reactors have repeatedly failed even modest security tests over the years. Even heightened wartime standards cannot guarantee protection of the vast, supremely sensitive controls required for reactor safety. Without continous monitoring and guaranteed water flow, the thousands of tons of radioactive rods in the cores and the thousands more stored in those fragile pools would rapidly melt into super-hot radioactive balls of lava that would burn into the ground and the water table and, ultimately, the Hudson. Indeed, a jetcrash like the one on 9/11 or other forms of terrorist assault at Indian Point could yield three infernal fireballs of molten radioactive lava burning through the earth and into the aquifer and the river. Striking water they would blast gigantic billows of horribly radioactive steam into the atmosphere. Prevailing winds from the north and west might initially drive these clouds of mass death downriver into New York City and east into Westchester and Long Island. But at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, winds ultimately shifted around the compass to irradiate all surrounding areas with the devastating poisons released by the on-going fiery torrent. At Indian Point, thousands of square miles would have been saturated with the most lethal clouds ever created or imagined, depositing relentless genetic poisons that would kill forever. In nearby communities like Buchanan, Nyack, Monsey and scores more, infants and small children would quickly die en masse. Virtually all pregnant women would spontaneously abort, or ultimately give birth to horribly deformed offspring. Ghastly sores, rashes, ulcerations and burns would afflict the skin of millions. Emphysema, heart attacks, stroke, multiple organ failure, hair loss, nausea, inability to eat or drink or swallow, diarrhea and incontinance, sterility and impotence, asthma, blindness, and more would kill thousands on the spot, and doom hundreds of thousands if not millions. A terrible metallic taste would afflict virtually everyone downwind in New York, New Jersey and New England, a ghoulish curse similar to that endured by the fliers who dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagaskai, by those living downwind from nuclear bomb tests in the south seas and Nevada, and by victims caught in the downdrafts from Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. Then comes the abominable wave of cancers, leukemias, lymphomas, tumors and hellish diseases for which new names will have to be invented, and new dimensions of agony will beg description. Indeed, those who survived the initial wave of radiation would envy those who did not. Evacuation would be impossible, but thousands would die trying. Bridges and highways would become killing fields for those attempting to escape to destinations that would soon enough become equally deadly as the winds shifted. Attempts to quench the fires would be futile. At Chernobyl, pilots flying helicopters that dropped boron on the fiery core died in droves. At Indian Point, such missions would be a sure ticket to death. Their utility would be doubtful as the molten cores rage uncontrolled for days, weeks and years, spewing ever more devastation into the eco-sphere. More than 800,000 Soviet draftees were forced through Chernobyl's seething remains in a futile attempt to clean it up. They are dying in droves. Who would now volunteer for such an American task force? The radioactive cloud from Chernobyl blanketed the vast Ukraine and Belarus landscape, then carried over Europe and into the jetstream, surging through the west coast of the United States within ten days, carrying across our northern tier, circling the globe, then coming back again. The radioactive clouds from Indian Point would enshroud New York, New Jersey, New England, and carry deep into the Atlantic and up into Canada and across to Europe and around the globe again and again. The immediate damage would render thousands of the world's most populous and expensive square miles permanently uninhabitable. All five boroughs of New York City would be an apocalyptic wasteland. The World Trade Center would be rendered as unusable and even more lethal by a jet crash at Indian Point than it was by the direct hits of 9/11. All real estate and economic value would be poisonously radioactive throughout the entire region. Irreplaceable trillions in human capital would be forever lost. As at Three Mile Island, where thousands of farm and wild animals died in heaps, and as at Chernobyl, where soil, water and plant life have been hopelessly irradiated, natural eco-systems on which human and all other life depends would be permanently and irrevocably destroyed, Spiritually, psychologically, financially, ecologically, our nation would never recover. This is what we missed by a mere forty miles near New York City on September 11. Now that we are at war, this is what could be happening as you read this. There are 103 of these potential Bombs of the Apocalypse now operating in the United States. They generate just 18% of America's electricity, just 8% of our total energy. As with reactors elsewhere, the two at Indian Point have both been off-line for long periods of time with no appreciable impact on life in New York. Already an extremely expensive source of electricity, the cost of attempting to defend these reactors will put nuclear energy even further off the competitive scale. Since its deregulation crisis, California---already the nation's second-most efficient state---cut further into its electric consumption by some 15%. Within a year the US could cheaply replace virtually with increased efficiency all the reactors now so much more expensive to operate and protect. Yet, as the bombs fall and the terror escalates, Congress is fast-tracking a form of legal immunity to protect the operators of reactors like Indian Point from liability in case of a meltdown or terrorist attack. Why is our nation handing its proclaimed enemies the weapons of our own mass destruction, and then shielding from liability the companies that insist on continuing to operate them? Do we take this war seriously? Are we committed to the survival of our nation? If so, the ticking reactor bombs that could obliterate the very core of our life and of all future generations must be shut down.**

DSCOVR solves for solar storms by providing early warning
Clark 11 **<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Stephen, Reporter for Spaceflight Now, 2/21, “NOAA taps DSCOVR satellite for space weather mission” http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1102/21dscovr/]</span>**
**The White House is requesting $47 million in fiscal year 2012 to convert a climate satellite grounded by politics into an observatory to monitor space weather and warn of solar storms. The Obama administration's budget proposal released last Monday would start the development of a new mission for the Deep Space Climate Observatory, or DSCOVR. The satellite was originally built for climate observations from the L1 libration point, a stable gravity-neutral point a million miles away from Earth. From that location, Earth science sensors on DSCOVR would have a constant view of the day side of the planet. But the L1 point is more commonly used by solar science missions, and it's an ideal location for a spacecraft to sniff out geomagnetic storms before they reach Earth. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would manage the DSCOVR mission as an operational sentinel to give notice of approaching solar storms with potentially calamitous consequences for terrestrial electrical grids, communications, GPS navigation, air travel, satellite operations and human spaceflight. "The FY2012 funds would support the refurbishment of an existing NASA satellite, DSCOVR," said Jane Lubchenco, NOAA's administrator. "This acquisition will allow NOAA to continue to receive vital data to help anticipate and mitigate space weather damage, which could potentially result in costs to the United States of $1 to $2 trillion." NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer, launched in 1997, is the only spacecraft currently providing short-term warnings of geomagnetic storms. ACE is also stationed at the L1 point, giving forecasters about a 40-minute warning of approaching solar events that could disrupt life and economic activity on Earth. ACE is operating 12 years beyond its design life and could fail at any time. The $47.3 million budgeted for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, would support the refurbishment of the DSCOVR spacecraft, which was put in storage at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center when the agency suspended work on the project in 2001. The DSCOVR mission was conceived by former Vice President Al Gore in the late 1990s. Gore envisioned the satellite would beam back live pictures of the Earth 24 hours a day, boosting interest in environmental concerns. Scientists developed observation cameras to collect data on the planet's radiation budget. But Congress and the George W. Bush administration balked at the mission. NASA formally terminated the project in 2005 after spending $97 million. The funding would also permit the Naval Research Laboratory to continue development and construction of a coronal mass ejection imager to fly on the new DSCOVR mission, according to NOAA. After it set mostly untouched for seven years, NASA pulled the refrigerator-sized satellite out of storage in late 2008 for health checks of the spacecraft bus and its science instruments, a ten-channel imager and a radiation-measuring radiometer for Earth observations and a plasma sensor suite to monitor space weather. Artist's concept of the DSCOVR satellite in space. Credit: Scripps Institution of Oceanography NASA was also directed to refurbish the Earth science instruments, and that work is complete or nearing completion, according to Steve Cole, an agency spokesperson. The recent work on the DSCOVR spacecraft was ordered as NOAA considered several replacement options for the aging ACE satellite. Other options included starting from scratch on an entirely new spacecraft and developing a sensor to fly on a commercial satellite. The space agency would ready the DSCOVR spacecraft for flight and the U.S. Air Force would select a launch vehicle. DSCOVR would be ready for launch by late 2013 if NOAA gets full funding this year. NOAA wants to launch the satellite by the time the sun reaches solar maximum, the peak of activity in its up-and-down cycle. Forecasters predict the next solar maximum in 2013.**

DSCOVR is scientifically vital to solar weather prediction

Jr., Administrator of the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (NOAA), 1/28/2010</span>**, **Natural Disasters and Solar Storms: Why Space Weather Matters, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/conrad-c-lautenbacher-phd/natural-disasters-and-sol_b_440128.html]**
**The DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory), replacement spacecraft for ACE, was built to monitor Earth weather and global warming, and also features equipment that can measure -- and help predict -- solar and space weather. DSCOVR was evaluated by the National Academy of Sciences and their report called this mission "strong and scientifically vital." However, due to budgetary concerns, this $100+ million DSCOVR program is at risk as a potpourri of federal environmental, space, defense, and budgetary agencies attempt to pare down federal expenditures. In Congress, efforts to fund space weather in the "Critical Electric Infrastructure Protection Act," which also addresses cyber security, languishes in committee. Space weather remains an under-appreciated challenge. Spacecraft along with other space and ground assets can detect the arrival of these storms; but, without an ACE replacement, there will be no warning in time to prevent potentially catastrophic damage. This is a serious life-threatening matter that demands our attention. We simply cannot afford to let DSCOVR's launch funding be eliminated.**


Contention Three is Climate Conflict

Warming is inevitable – status quo CO2 emissions and oceanic feedbacks
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Solomon et al, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ‘09</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Susan- member of the US National Academy of Sciences, the European Academy of Sciences, and the Academy of Sciences of France, Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Chairman of the IPCC, February 10, “Irreversible climate change due to carbon dioxide emissions” PNAS, Vol 106, http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/01/28/0812721106.full.pdf)</span>**
**Over the 20th century, the atmospheric concentrations of key greenhouse gases increased due to human activities. The stated objective (Article 2) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a low enough level to prevent ‘‘dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.’’ Many studies have focused on projections of possible 21st century dangers (1–3). However, the principles (Article 3) of the UNFCCC specifically emphasize ‘‘threats of serious or irreversible damage,’’ underscoring the importance of the longer term. While some irreversible climate changes such as ice sheet collapse are possible but highly uncertain (1, 4), others can now be identified with greater confidence, and examples among the latter are presented in this paper. It is not generally appreciated that the atmospheric temperature increases caused by rising carbon dioxide concentrations are not expected to decrease significantly even if carbon emissions were to completely cease (5–7) (see Fig. 1). Future carbon dioxide emissions in the 21st century will hence lead to adverse climate changes on both short and long time scales that would be essentially irreversible (where irreversible is defined here as a time scale exceeding the end of the millennium in year 3000; note that we do not consider geo-engineering measures that might be able to remove gases already in the atmosphere or to introduce active cooling to counteract warming). For the same reason, the physical climate changes that are due to anthropogenic carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere today are expected to be largely irreversible. Such climate changes will lead to a range of damaging impacts in different regions and sectors, some of which occur promptly in association with warming, while others build up uner sustained warming because of the time lags of the processes involved. Here we illustrate 2 such aspects of the irreversibly altered world that should be expected. These aspects are among reasons for concern but are not comprehensive; other possible climate impacts include Arctic sea ice retreat, increases in heavy rainfall and flooding, permafrost melt, loss of glaciers and snowpack with attendant changes in water supply, increased intensity of hurricanes, etc. A complete climate impacts review is presented elsewhere (8) and is beyond the scope of this paper. We focus on illustrative adverse and irreversible climate impacts for which 3 criteria are met: (i) observed changes are already occurring and there is evidence for anthropogenic contributions to these changes, (ii) the phenomenon is based upon physical principles thought to be well understood, and (iii) projections are available and are broadly robust across models. Advances in modeling have led not only to improvements in complex Atmosphere–Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) for projecting 21st century climate, but also to the implementation of Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) for millennial time scales. These 2 types of models are used in this paper to show how different peak carbon dioxide concentrations that could be attained in the 21st century are expected to lead to substantial and irreversible decreases in dry-season rainfall in a number of already-dry subtropical areas and lower limits to eventual sea level rise of the order of meters, implying unavoidable inundation of many small islands and low-lying coastal areas. Results Longevity of an Atmospheric CO2 Perturbation. As has long been known, the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere involves multiple processes including rapid exchange with the land biosphere and the surface layer of the ocean through air–sea exchange and much slower penetration to the ocean interior that is dependent upon the buffering effect of ocean chemistry along with vertical transport (9–12). On the time scale of a millennium addressed here, the CO2 equilibrates largely between the atmosphere and the ocean and, depending on associated increases in acidity and in ocean warming (i.e., an increase in the Revelle or ‘‘buffer’’ factor, see below), typically 20% of the added tonnes of CO2 remain in the atmosphere while 80% are mixed into the ocean. Carbon isotope studies provide important observational constraints on these processes and time constants. On multimil- lenium and longer time scales, geochemical and geological processes could restore atmospheric carbon dioxide to its pre- industrial values (10, 11), but are not included here. Fig. 1 illustrates how the concentrations of carbon dioxide would be expected to fall off through the coming millennium if manmade emissions were to cease immediately following an illustrative future rate of emission increase of 2% per year [comparable to observations over the past decade (ref. 13)] up to peak concentrations of 450, 550, 650, 750, 850, or 1,200 ppmv; similar results were obtained across a range of EMICs that were assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (5, 7). This is not intended to be a realistic scenario but rather to represent a test case whose purpose is to probe physical climate system changes. A more gradual reduction of carbon dioxide emission (as is more likely), or a faster or slower adopted rate of emissions in the growth period, would lead to long-term behavior qualitatively similar to that illustrated in Fig. 1 (see also Fig. S1). The example of a sudden cessation of emissions provides an upper bound to how much reversibility is possible, if, for example, unexpectedly damaging climate changes were to be observed. Carbon dioxide is the only greenhouse gas whose falloff displays multiple rather than single time constants (see Fig. S2). Current emissions of major non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as methane or nitrous oxide are significant for climate change in the next few decades or century, but these gases do not persist over time in the same way as carbon dioxide (14). Fig. 1 shows that a quasi-equilibrium amount of CO2 is expected to be retained in the atmosphere by the end of the millennium that is surprisingly large: typically 40% of the peak concentration enhancement over preindustrial values ( 280 ppmv). This can be easily understood on the basis of the observed instantaneous airborne fraction (AFpeak) of 50% of anthropogenic carbon emissions retained during their buildup in the atmosphere, together with well-established ocean chemistry and physics that require 20% of the emitted carbon to remain in the atmosphere on thousand-year timescales [quasi- equilibrium airborne fraction (AFequi), determined largely by the Revelle factor governing the long-term partitioning of carbon between the ocean and atmosphere/biosphere system] (9–11). Assuming given cumulative emissions, EMI, the peak concen- tration, CO2peak (increase over the preindustrial value CO20), and the resulting 1,000-year quasi-equilibrium concentration, CO2equi can be expressed as COpeak 2 = CO02 + AFpeak EMI [1] COequi 2 = CO02 + AFequi EMI [2] so that COequi2 – CO0 2 = AFequi/AFpeak (COpeak 2 – CO02) [3] Given an instantaneous airborne fraction (AFpeak) of 50% during the period of rising CO2, and a quasi-equilbrium airborne factor (AFequi) of 20%, it follows that the quasi-equilibrium enhancement of CO2 concentration above its preindustrial value is 40% of the peak enhancement. For example, if the CO2 concentration were to peak at 800 ppmv followed by zero emissions, the quasi-equilibrium CO2 concentration would still be far above the preindustrial value at 500 ppmv. Additional carbon cycle feedbacks could reduce the efficiency of the ocean and biosphere to remove the anthropogenic CO2 and thereby increase these CO2 values (15, 16). Further, a longer decay time and increased CO2 concentrations at year 1000 are expected for large total carbon emissions (17). Irreversible Climate Change: Atmospheric Warming. Global average temperatures increase while CO2 is increasing and then remain approximately constant (within 0.5 °C) until the end of the millennium despite zero further emissions in all of the test cases shown in Fig. 1. This important result is due to a near balance between the long-term decrease of radiative forcing due to CO2 concentration decay and reduced cooling through heat loss to the oceans. It arises because long-term carbon dioxide removal and ocean heat uptake are both dependent on the same physics of deep-ocean mixing. Sea level rise due to thermal expansion accompanies mixing of heat into the ocean long after carbon dioxide emissions have stopped. For larger carbon dioxide concentrations, warming and thermal sea level rise show greater increases and display transient changes that can be very rapid (i.e., the rapid changes in Fig. 1 Middle), mainly because of changes in ocean circulation (18). Paleoclimatic evidence suggests that additional contributions from melting of glaciers and ice sheets may be comparable to or greater than thermal expansion (discussed further below), but these are not included in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 explores how close the modeled temperature changes are to thermal equilibrium with respect to the changing carbon dioxide concentration over time, sometimes called the realized warming fraction (19) (shown for the different peak CO2 cases). Fig. 2 Left shows how the calculated warmings compare to those expected if temperatures were in equilibrium with the carbon dioxide concentrations vs. time, while Fig. 2 Right shows the ratio of these calculated time-dependent and equilibrium tempera- tures. During the period when carbon dioxide is increasing, the realized global warming fraction is 50–60% of the equilibrium warming, close to values obtained in other models (5, 19). After emissions cease, the temperature change approaches equilib- rium with respect to the slowly decreasing carbon dioxide concentrations (cyan lines in Fig. 2 Right). The continuing warming through year 3000 is maintained at 40–60% of the equilibrium warming corresponding to the peak CO2 concentration (magenta lines in Fig. 2 Right). Related changes in fast-responding atmospheric climate variables such as precipitation, water vapor, heat waves, cloudiness, etc., are expected to occur largely simultaneously with the temperature changes. Irreversible Climate Change: Precipitation Changes. Warming is expected to be linked to changes in rainfall (20), which can adversely affect the supply of water for humans, agriculture, and ecosystems. Precipitation is highly variable but long-term rainfall decreases have been observed in some large regions including, e.g., the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and parts of south- western North America (21–25). Confident projection of future changes remains elusive over many parts of the globe and at small scales. However, well-known physics (the Clausius–Clapeyron law) implies that increased temperature causes increased atmospheric water vapor concentrations, and changes in water vapor transport and the hydrologic cycle can hence be expected (26–28). Further, advances in modeling show that a robust characteristic of anthropogenic climate change is poleward expansion of the Hadley cell and shifting of the pattern of precipitation minus evaporation (P–E) and the storm tracks (22, 26), and hence a pattern of drying over much of the already-dry subtropics in a warmer world ( 15°-40° latitude in each hemi- sphere) (5, 26). Attribution studies suggest that such a drying pattern is already occurring in a manner consistent with models including anthropogenic forcing (23), particularly in the south- western United States (22) and Mediterranean basin (24, 25). We use a suite of 22 available AOGCM projections based upon the evaluation in the IPCC 2007 report (5, 29) to characterize precipitation changes. Changes in precipitation are expected (5, 20, 30) to scale approximately linearly with increasing warming (see Fig. S3). The equilibrium relationship between precipitation and temperature may be slightly smaller (by 15%) than the transient values, due to changes in the land/ ocean thermal contrast (31). On the other hand, the observed 20th century changes follow a similar latitudinal pattern but presently exceed those calculated by AOGCMs (23). Models that include more complex representations of the land surface, soil, and vegetation interactively are likely to display additional feedbacks so that larger precipitation responses are possible. Here we evaluate the relationship between temperature and precipitation averaged for each month and over a decade at each grid point. One ensemble member is used for each model so that all AOGCMs are equally weighted in the multimodel ensemble; results are nearly identical if all available model ensemble members are used. Fig. 3 presents a map of the expected dry-season (3 driest consecutive months at each grid point) precipitation trends per degree of global warming. Fig. 3 shows that large uncertainties remain in the projections for many regions (white areas). How- ever, it also shows that there are some subtropical locations on every inhabited continent where dry seasons are expected to become drier in the decadal average by up to 10% per degree of warming. Some of these grid points occur in desert regions that are already very dry, but many occur in currently more temperate and semiarid locations. We find that model results are more robust over land across the available models over wider areas for drying of the dry season than for the annual mean or wet season (see Fig. S4). The Insets in Fig. 3 show the monthly mean projected precipitation changes averaged over several large regions as delineated on the map. Increased drying of respective dry seasons is projected by 90% of the models averaged over the indicated regions of southern Europe, northern Africa, southern Africa, and southwestern North America and by 80% of the models for eastern South America and western Australia (see Fig. S3). Although given particular years would show exceptions, the long-term irreversible warming and mean rainfall changes as suggested by Figs. 1 and 3 would have important consequences in many regions. While some relief can be expected in the wet season for some regions (Fig. S4), changes in dry-season precipitation in northern Africa, southern Europe, and western Australia are expected to be near 20% for 2 °C warming, and those of southwestern North America, eastern South America, and southern Africa would be 10% for 2 °C of global mean warming. For comparison, the American ‘‘dust bowl’’ was associated with averaged rainfall decreases of 10% over 10–20 years, similar to major droughts in Europe and western Australia in the 1940s and 1950s (22, 32). The spatial changes in precipitation as shown in Fig. 3 imply greater challenges in the distribution of food and water supplies than those with which the world has had difficulty coping in the past. Such changes occurring not just for a few decades but over centuries are expected to have a range of impacts that differ by region. These include, e.g., human water supplies (25), effects on dry-season wheat and maize agriculture in certain regions of rain-fed farming such as Africa (33, 34), increased fire frequency, ecosystem change, and desertification (24, 35–38). Fig. 4 Upper relates the expected irreversible changes in regional dry-season precipitation shown in Fig. 3 to best estimates of the corresponding peak and long-term CO2 concentrations. We use 3 °C as the best estimate of climate sensitivity across the suite of AOGCMs for a doubling of carbon dioxide from preindustrial values (5) along with the regional drying values depicted in Fig. 3 and assuming that 40% of the carbon dioxide peak concentration is retained after 1000 years. Fig. 4 shows that if carbon dioxide were to peak at levels of 450 ppmv, irreversible decreases of 8–10% in dry-season precipitation would be expected on average over each of the indicated large regions of southern Europe, western Australia, and northern Africa, while a carbon dioxide peak value near 600 ppmv would be expected to lead to sustained rainfall decreases of 13–16% in the dry seasons in these areas; smaller but statistically significant irreversible changes would also be expected for southwestern North America, eastern South America, and Southern Africa. Irreversible Climate Change: Sea Level Rise. Anthropogenic carbon dioxide will cause irrevocable sea level rise. There are 2 relatively well-understood processes that contribute to this and a third that may be much more important but is also very uncertain. Warm- ing causes the ocean to expand and sea levels to rise as shown in Fig. 1; this has been the dominant source of sea level rise in the past decade at least (39). Loss of land ice also makes important contributions to sea level rise as the world warms. Mountain glaciers in many locations are observed to be retreating due to warming, and this contribution to sea level rise is also relatively well understood. Warming may also lead to large losses of the Greenland and/or Antarctic ice sheets. Additional rapid ice losses from particular parts of the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have recently been observed (40–42). One recent study uses current ice discharge data to suggest ice sheet contributions of up to 1–2 m to sea level rise by 2100 (42), but other studies suggest that changes in winds rather than warming may account for currently observed rapid ice sheet flow (43), rendering quantitative extrapolation into the future uncertain. In addition to rapid ice flow, slow ice sheet mass balance processes are another mechanism for potential large sea level rise. Paleoclimatic data demonstrate large contributions of ice sheet loss to sea level rise (1, 4) but provide limited constraints on the rate of such processes. Some recent studies suggest that ice sheet surface mass balance loss for peak CO2 concentrations of 400–800 ppmv may be even slower than the removal of manmade carbon dioxide following cessation of emis- sions, so that this loss could contribute less than a meter to irreversible sea level rise even after many thousands of years (44, 45). It is evident that the contribution from the ice sheets could be large in the future, but the dependence upon carbon dioxide levels is extremely uncertain not only over the coming century but also in the millennial time scale. An assessed range of models suggests that the eventual contribution to sea level rise from thermal expansion of the ocean is expected to be 0.2–0.6 m per degree of global warming (5). Fig. 4 uses this range together with a best estimate for climate sensitivity of 3 °C (5) to estimate lower limits to eventual sea level rise due to thermal expansion alone. Fig. 4 shows that even with zero emissions after reaching a peak concentration, irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4–1.0 m is expected if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and as much as 1.9 m for a peak CO2 concentration exceeding 1,000 ppmv. Loss of glaciers and small ice caps is relatively well understood and is expected to be largely complete under sustained warming of, for example, 4 °C within 500 years (46). For lower values of warming, partial remnants of glaciers might be retained, but this has not been examined in detail for realistic representations of glacier shrinkage and is not quantified here. Complete losses of glaciers and small ice caps have the potential to raise future sea level by 0.2–0.7 m (46, 47) in addition to thermal expansion. Further contributions due to partial loss of the great ice sheets of Antarctica and/or Greenland could add several meters or more to these values but for what warming levels and on what time scales are still poorly characterized. Sea level rise can be expected to affect many coastal regions (48). While sea walls and other adaptation measures might combat some of this sea level rise, Fig. 4 shows that carbon dioxide peak concentrations that could be reached in the future for the conservative lower limit defined by thermal expansion alone can be expected to be associated with substantial irreversible commitments to future changes in the geography of the Earth because many coastal and island features would ultimately become submerged. Discussion: Some Policy Implications It is sometimes imagined that slow processes such as climate changes pose small risks, on the basis of the assumption that a choice can always be made to quickly reduce emissions and thereby reverse any harm within a few years or decades. We have shown that this assumption is incorrect for carbon dioxide emissions, because of the longevity of the atmospheric CO2 perturbation and ocean warming. Irreversible climate changes due to carbon dioxide emissions have already taken place, and future carbon dioxide emissions would imply further irreversible effects on the planet, with attendant long legacies for choices made by contemporary society. Discount rates used in some estimates of economic trade-offs assume that more efficient climate mitigation can occur in a future richer world, but neglect the irreversibility shown here. Similarly, understanding of irreversibility reveals limitations in trading of greenhouse gases on the basis of 100-year estimated climate changes (global warming potentials, GWPs), because this metric neglects carbon dioxide’s unique long-term effects. In this paper we have quantified how societal decisions regarding carbon dioxide concentrations that have already occurred or could occur in the coming century imply irreversible dangers relating to climate change for some illustrative populations and regions. These and other dangers pose substantial challenges to humanity and nature, with a magnitude that is directly linked to the peak level of carbon dioxide reached.**

That causes global destabilizing crises that escalate – US military preventative action is key to solve

**The impetus behind these efforts on the part of the U.S. Government in general, and its military in particular, is not totally altruistic. More and more we are awakening to the realization that regional stability is directly impacted by environmental issues. Droughts in Central Africa signify dangers and suffering that will not be contained by political boundaries. When catastrophic events, like the earthquake in Pakistan, the tsunami off of Indonesia, or the hurricane in Honduras, wreak havoc on congested areas, they can destabilize an entire region. Ecological disasters like that we see in the Caspian Sea region threaten to trigger a cataclysmic series of events that could result in human suffering, deprivation and, ultimately, conflict. Doing something now can head off trouble later. Better community planning may prevent migration crises. Exposing, understanding, and preventing the neglect or deliberate abuse of the environment can fend off disaster. In short, environmental disaster is being recognized as a precursor to regional instability; and in today’s world of globalization, regional instability is a precursor to global instability. Fortunately, realization of shared threats and shared concerns has led to initiatives towards regional cooperation in every combatant theater. These initiatives focus on shared means of identification, prevention, mitigation, and (when required) response to both manmade and natural disasters. For almost a decade, the U.S. Army War College’s Center for Strategic Leadership, under the direction of Dr. Kent Hughes Butts, has partnered with the combatant commands, USAID, and organizations like the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Environmental Change and Security Program, to bring together regional representatives around the world to address these issues.4 The types of lessons that have come out of these and similar efforts have reinforced the role of the military not only in disaster response, but in disaster preparedness. Theater Security Cooperation Programs (TSCPs) sponsored by all of the combatant commands have planted the notion that in addition to their traditional skill sets in communication, logistics, and security, the benefits derived from the military’s proficiency in planning and strategic policy development further recommends them to these efforts. A vital component of the combatant commander’s resources towards these ends is his Joint Interagency Coordination Group (JIACG) which houses governmental and, occasionally, nongovernmental representatives from outside of DoD. These representatives serve as key advisers to the combatant commander in understanding and coordinating the combined capabilities of their organization, identifying synergies and efficiencies, and ensuring to a far greater degree their optimal employment in times of crises. In the past, the military has looked upon disaster response as a necessary function, but not one that was particularly welcomed. The concern over diverting attention, manpower, and resources away from the “traditional role” of the uniformed services no doubt served as the foundation for that reticence. But times have clearly changed. Environmental security and disaster prevention, response, and recovery are now looked upon as acceptable military missions in that they are viewed as essential elements of regional stability. Specific programs devoted to these concerns, such as USPACOM’s Disaster Preparedness Mitigation Assessment program, USCENTCOM’s Disaster Prepar edness Program, and USPACOM’s Disaster Relief Response Process are taking shape in every theater.**

Successful military responses fosters international modeling and cooperative efforts for broader climate action
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tussing 2008 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Bert B., Prof of National Security Affairs for the Center for Strategic Leadership at the U.S. Army War College, The Role of the Military in Civil Support, http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/download.cfm?q=862]</span>**
**In emulation of the American effort, other countries’ governments and their militaries are seeking their own civil-military synergies. Most governmental organizations responsible for environment and disaster response are relatively understaffed and under resourced, lacking manpower to undertake the activities necessary to efficiently accomplish these broad-based missions. The military, by working with these organizations, allows them to accomplish a great deal more. In the process, militaries that have been a source of suspicion and fear in earlier times are being rightfully cast as servants and protectors in the eyes of their own people. Finally, developing regional response capabilities to address a set of common concerns may serve as a foundation for other cooperative endeavors. Countries that would otherwise never gather around a negotiation table are currently engaged in regional efforts to forecast, mitigate, and if necessary respond to cataclysmic natural disasters. Constrained resources have themselves provided the impetus for greater cooperation, and a judicious division of labor in preparing for these calamities is being directed at producing synergies and eliminating redundancies in providing for the common needs of a region’s citizenry. As is frequently said, much has been done, and much remains to be done. But as the U.S. Government attempts to come to terms with an evolving list of environmental issues, its military must be counted upon as an essential component to any solution. Before an event, the military represents the most tested entity for operational and strategic planning in the country’s inventory. During the event, our uniformed forces can assume a responsive posture that cannot be duplicated in terms of manpower, capacity, timeliness, or capabilities. Following an event, the armed services will be hard to match in terms of what they bring to the field in restoring essential services, and setting the conditions for long-term recovery. But little of the military’s vast potential in meeting these demands will be effectively brought to bear without understanding on both sides of the civil-military framework of how it should and should not be employed. In the final analysis, the responsibility for that decision lies solely in the camp of the civil authorities.**

**Climate change will likely exacerbate trends such as food insecurity, water scarcity and extreme weather events in the United States and around the world, with significant implications for national and global security. These changes could increase the need for humanitarian and disaster relief, as well as threats to security emanating from already weak or failing states. DOD is currently study­ing locations where climate change could worsen trends such as drought and increased frequency and intensity of storms. DOD recognizes the need to better understand where these trends will be most acute in order to prepare for possible U.S. military deployments to provide humanitarian and disaster assistance, as well as to prepare the mili­tary for possible climate-induced flashpoints.5 National security professionals, and the military in particular, have a vested interest in under­standing how climate change could affect the operating environment in regions where they have personnel, infrastructure and equipment. For instance, changes in the operating environ­ment have the potential to interfere with or incapacitate military installations and equipment vital to mission effectiveness (i.e., the military’s ability to complete its missions), including train­ing ranges, forward operating bases and military aircraft, vehicles and personnel. While understanding climate science is and will continue to be essential to the national security community, the implications of not integrating climate science into regular decision making processes should not be overstated. The U.S. gov­ernment, and in particular the national security community, is resilient and capable of operating under uncertainty and adapting to change. But adapting in response to, rather than in advance of, projected climatic changes would likely be less effective and more costly in both economic and human terms. The military, development and dip­lomatic communities may require long lead times to develop new capabilities, strategies and trained personnel – and position them appropriately – for the future security environment. If these commu­nities do not integrate climate science into their decision making today, they may find themselves less well prepared to meet future challenges.**

**Given the proliferation of new tools (e.g., climate satellites and advanced computer models) and data acquisition systems, there will be no short­age of climate information (especially data related to present conditions and short-term trends). The question for the national security community is whether its unique needs will be met. Since the community has not traditionally based decisions on climate change projections or assessments, there are few processes in place to ensure that the necessary information will be available when it is needed and in a form that is useful. In particular, many national security decision makers require “actionable” data, or data that can be used to generate requirements, plans, strategies, training and materiel. They need to know where to dedicate resources. Actionable climate-related data requires marrying physical and social science data to forecast the national security implications of climate change. While many national security decision makers will find biophysical data useful in order to hedge against specific impacts of climate change (e.g., sea level rise at naval installations), others will need more targeted information about how biophysi­cal changes will influence existing social trends, such as ethnic tensions, economic prosperity and political dissension. DOD noted in the 2010 QDR that, “While climate change alone does not cause conflict, it may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict, placing a burden to respond on civilian institutions and militaries around the world.”28 For example, an important question for operational planners to consider could be how climate change could exacerbate water scarcity in Yemen, and how this might contribute to political unrest, a fractured civil society, al Qaeda recruit­ment and state weakness or failure. Current biophysical climate data lack the level of detail, fidelity or appropriate spatial and temporal scal­ing with social science data necessary to answer many of the types of questions that national secu­rity professionals need to ask.**

**Since 1999, NASA and NOAA have been calling for an integrated Earth-observing system—a network of satellites that, among other things, would consistently measure changes in the Earth’s climate. But that campaign is “languishing,” said a 2010 Government Accountability Office report, and there are “significant gaps in future satellite coverage.”**
**Meanwhile, Earth-observing satellites are subject to constant abuse. Cosmic rays grind on the delicate spectrometers that measure the planet’s radiation. Over time, the satellites stray from their orbit and sink nearer to Earth. The data they collect becomes inconsistent. In short, they have limited life expectancies, and some of NASA’s 14 Earth-observing satellites have already outlived theirs. All of which makes DSCOVR’s decade of dormancy more puzzling. In addition to the continuous macrolevel monitoring of the Earth’s albedo that the satellite would perform, it could also be a crucial component of a larger satellite array. Because DSCOVR would be farther away from Earth than any other satellite, it would be able to see every other satellite in the sky. As a result, other satellites would be able to calibrate their location and sensors against DSCOVR. Moreover, because it would constantly face the moon, which has no atmosphere and thus a constant albedo, it would have a uniquely consistent baseline from which it could calibrate its instruments—and from which other satellites could calibrate as well. In this way, DSCOVR could be the keystone on which present and future space-based Earth-monitoring systems could depend.**

**Obama’s first presidential pardon should be to free a political prisoner, held without trial, rhyme nor reason, in solitary confinement in an air conditioned prison box somewhere outside Washington, DC. The sentence was long-term incarceration by the Bush Administration. The crime was the Administration’s fear of DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory) being a potential climate change whistle-blower and witness to human crimes against Earth. We are not reporting on a human prisoner of course, but a real prisoner nonetheless. DSCOVR has been locked away for the last 7 years, with little explanation for why an already paid for and completed US$100 million high-tech spacecraft should be left un-launched, especially when that spacecraft was designed to detect, measure and monitor Earth’s atmosphere, land and oceans for climate change. The DSCOVR spacecraft was designed to orbit at the L1 Lagrangian point, a gravity-neutral point 937 thousand miles (1.5 million kilometers) from the Earth toward the Sun, from where it could gaze at the entirety of the sunlit side of Earth, 24hours a day, 7 days a week. The mission had multiple objectives but one was to measure Earth’s absorption and emission of heat energy which is largely driven by cloud cover, snow cover, atmospheric conditions and the Earth’s ambient temperature. All these factors affect the albedo, the heat radiation exchange between Earth, the Sun and deep space. The information is critical to calibrate climate models, the ozone layer and global climate change in general. Dr. Jonah Colman, a climate modeler at Los Alamos National Laboratory, said in a Seed Magazine interview that "the availability of DSCOVR for inter-comparison between other measurements" would reconcile discrepancies in data from low-Earth orbit satellites. "Albedo is incredibly important," he added. "It can change quickly, and we currently do not have a direct method for measuring it. DSCOVR would have given us that". Other prominent climatologists also spoke out in its favor. There were some dark moments in DSCOVR’s history, perhaps political intrigue and maybe even some ill-informed engineering decisions, like proposing to launch it from the Space Shuttle instead of an expendable rocket like most other probes that leave Earth’s orbit. DSCOVR started out under another name, Triana, the Columbus' voyage sailor who first sighted the New World. Al Gore supported the project in 1998 hoping that it would broadcast real-time images of Earth to encourage interest in the environment. NASA seemed to cancel the project once and for all, in January 2006, even though the Ukraine offered to launch it for free. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) was interested in having DSCOVR in space to monitor solar activity. The project's future remains uncertain. From the L1 vantage point, the spacecraft would offer an un-interrupted monitoring of Earth, giving scientific data as well as a visual view of Earth so that we could log in to the internet and gaze in wonder at our beautiful planet but also see the harm we are doing to it, ourselves, and our fellow planet’s inhabitants. Satellites in geo-synchronous, or low earth orbit, see only the same portion Earth all the time, or mere snap-shots. The geo-synchronous satellites do not have a very good view angle to include the poles either. DSCOVR would truly have given us a global view of our home world, much like the Apollo 8 astronauts did 40 years ago with their famous Earthrise image that has been credited with giving environmentalism a great boost in the 1970s.**

**The L-1 and L-2 Earth-Sun Lagrange points mark positions where the gravitational pull of the Earth and Sun precisely equals the centripetal force required to rotate with the Earth about the Sun with the same orbital period as the Earth. Therefore, a satellite maintained at or near one of these Lagrange points would keep the same relative position to the Sun and the Earth and be able to observe most points on the planet as the Earth rotates during the day. L-1 and L-2 are of particular interest because a satellite at either location can easily be maintained near the Sun-Earth line and views, respectively, the entire daytime hemisphere or the entire nighttime hemisphere. Synoptic, high temporal-resolution observations would be obtained as every point on the planet transits from sunrise to sunset (L-1) or from sunset to sunrise (L-2). A pair of deep-space observatories, one at L-1 and one at L-2, could simultaneously observe almost the entire Earth's surface and atmosphere. Such unique attributes are incorporated in the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) that will systematically observe climate drivers (radiation, aerosols, ozone, clouds, water vapor) from L-1 in a way not possible with other satellites.**
**The combination of Solar Lagrange Points (SLPs), LEO, and GEO satellites would certainly provide a powerful observational tool as well as enriched data sets for Earth sciences. Such synergism is greatly enhanced when one considers the potential of utilizing LEO, GEO, and SLPs satellites as an integrated observational system. For example, a satellite at L-1 will view the Earth plus the Moon while simultaneously having in its field of view (at one time or another) all Earth-orbiting satellites. This view offers the opportunity to use the Moon as a calibration reference that can in turn be shared with all other Earth observation satellites. In other words, the deep-space observatory can become an important link between LEO and GEO satellites while at the same time providing the data necessary to build an integrated Earth observational system. Such synergism would certainly help advance Earth sciences and greatly enhance the return for the nation's investment in space.**
**A synergistic, integrated system composed of LEO, GEO, and SLPs platforms is likely the way of the future.**

**The L1 and L2 Lagrange points are 1.5 million km from Earth along the Earth-Sun line (Figs. 1, 2). Objects at L1 and L2 experience the same gravitational force as the Earth itself, and thus become new “planets” with the same orbital period as Earth. The points have saddle-point gravitational instabilities, but even current spacecraft have enough fuel and thruster authority to stationkeep for five years or more. From L1 or L2, the Earth occupies almost the same 0.5° FOV as the Sun does from Earth—although slightly smaller since the rim of the Sun is visible from L2 (an advantage for limb scanning!). The full-disk view of the Earth from L1 and L2 holds tremendous potential for Earth science. Both L1 and L2 have been occupied by space science missions, but not by any Earth science mission. NASA’s $100M Triana (http://triana.gsfc.nasa.gov) was to be the first Earth observing platform at L–1, but became mired in political wrangling and now sits in storage with no scheduled launch date. The L1 point is towards the Sun and provides a full-disk view of the sunlit half of the Earth; the L2 point is away from the Sun and provides a complementary view of the night side of the Earth. Twin observatories at L1 and L2 can observe every point on Earth once a minute—true synoptic coverage, the weather forecaster’s dream! (Compare this with the five geostationary weather satellites which view the Earth to 60° latitude once every 15 min, or the 24 polar orbiting satellites required to obtain half-hourly coverage of the whole Earth.) This combination of global synoptic coverage and rapid temporal sampling allows the study of diurnal cycles and short-lived events. Precise long-term calibration using the Moon allows the measurement of delicate global changes unobservable with any current satellites. Not everything can be done from L1 and L2, of course. The antennas required to do microwave or radar remote sensing, for example, would be immense. But ultraviolet, visible, near-IR and thermal-IR remote sensing from L1/L2, while extremely challenging, are all within current technological capabilities. (Indeed, the challenge of measuring from L1/L2 creates technical spinoffs that benefit all spaceborne Earth observation.) Thus, the view to take is that each vantage point will do what it does best: some remote sensing now done from low Earth (LEO) and geostationary (GEO) orbits can better be done from L1/L2, while LEO and GEO are more appropriately used for complex instruments that may not work well so far from Earth. Moreover, some observing tasks are best done by constellations of robot aircraft and Ultra-Long Duration Balloons (ULDB’s). L1 and L2 observatories are essential components of an emerging integrated multi-perspective approach to observing all elements of the Earth system. These multiple perspectives range from at and below the Earth’s surface, to robot aircraft, to ULDB’s, to satellite formations in LEO and GEO, out to L1 and L2. The National Academy report [1] on Triana states: “Perhaps Triana’s most important contribution ... is the potential for using L1 observations of Earth to integrate data from multiple spaceborne as well as surface and airborne platforms in a self-consistent global database... Data from L1 may be useful for cross-calibrating independent observations…(see Fig. 3). Moreover, because of its large spatial coverage and temporal continuity (Fig. 4), data from L1 can be used to fill in data gaps left by other networks and spaceborne platforms”**

Climate migration creates African instability – preventative deployment and international cooperation is key, lack of preventative planning acauses reactive deployment which triggers great power wars

**Deployment of military forces will be limited most likely to two key situations: interdiction operations and migrant processing (including repatriation) operations. Interdiction operations, as noted earlier, are already a common occurrence in many parts of the world. In addition, migrant processing and repatriation operations have occurred in the context of large-scale migration emergencies. The U.S. military response to the Haitian and Cuban exodus of 1994 encompassed both of these elements; consequently, these operations may occur simultaneously in the same region or as part of a single migration episode. A third scenario might be stabilization operations, particularly when a climate change-induced disaster generates the potential for mass migration. Africa, for instance, is expected to assume greater strategic importance to the United States, China and other major powers in the 21st century, primarily because of its oil and other critical resources. However, climate change is also likely to serve as a potential destabilizing force that will complicate engagement between major powers and African states. A report collectively issued in 2005 by key environmental NGOs argued that Africa is on the front line of climate change and that the disruption caused by the phenomenon ‘‘is having a dire effect on many people.’’54 In Nigeria, considered an anchor state in Western Africa, climate variability has helped to induce competition for resources among rival communal groups, thus increasing the potential for violence. Theoretically, effective institutional or military responses could ameliorate the conditions that might spur internal population displacements or acute, disruptive international migration. However, countries have tended to respond to mass migration crises rather than attempt to prevent them. Similarly, states have been willing to fund humanitarian relief rather than engaging in peacekeeping or peacemaking efforts. This may be related to lack of political will; yet by allowing the crisis to grow, states must contend with large-scale migration, which creates its own set of humanitarian challenges, particularly for neighboring states that struggle with their own economic and demographic problems. As the Haitian and Cuban exodus of 1994 demonstrated, large-scale migration events can cause fear and a sense of threat within the receiving state, which can then generate additional political pressure on governments to engage military forces in a reactive manner.**
Great power draw in escalates to global nuclear war

**The Rabid Tiger Project believes that a nuclear war is most likely to start in Africa. Civil wars in the Congo (the country formerly known as Zaire), Rwanda, Somalia and Sierra Leone, and domestic instability in Zimbabwe, Sudan and other countries, as well as occasional brushfire and other wars (thanks in part to "national" borders that cut across tribal ones) turn into a really nasty stew. We've got all too many rabid tigers and potential rabid tigers, who are willing to push the button rather than risk being seen as wishy-washy in the face of a mortal threat and overthrown. Geopolitically speaking, Africa is open range. Very few countries in Africa are beholden to any particular power. South Africa is a major exception in this respect - not to mention in that she also probably already has the Bomb. Thus, outside powers can more easily find client states there than, say, in Europe where the political lines have long since been drawn, or Asia where many of the countries (China, India, Japan) are powers unto themselves and don't need any "help," thank you. Thus, an African war can attract outside involvement very quickly. Of course, a proxy war alone may not induce the Great Powers to fight each other. But an African nuclear strike can ignite a much broader conflagration, if the other powers are interested in a fight. Certainly, such a strike would in the first place have been facilitated by outside help - financial, scientific, engineering, etc. Africa is an ocean of troubled waters, and some people love to go fishing. Asia is a close second, due to the competition of major powers. For example, in an Indo-Paki confrontation, China may be tempted to side with Pakistan, since China and India are major nuclear powers sharing a long border. However, the Asian powers are basically stable internally, at least for now. The things to watch for are domestic economic and political instability in a nuclear power, the spread of nuclear weapons to new countries and new national antagonisms and great-power ties either weak or nonexistent enough to enable opportunistic alliances and destabilization, or strong enough that the great powers feel compelled to follow their client states.**

**SRINAGAR , Jan 18 ([[http://ipsnews.net/|IPS]]) - The declining snow cover and receding glaciers in the Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir could trigger renewed hostilities between India and Pakistan, neighbouring states in the South Asian region that are at odds on a host of issues, experts warn. The two countries share the Indus River, one of the longest rivers in the world. The river rises in southwestern Tibet and flows northwest through the Himalayas. It crosses into the disputed Kashmir region, mending its way to the Indian and Pakistani-administered areas of the territory. Pakistan and India have long been embroiled in a territorial dispute over Kashmir, but have so far managed to uphold a World Bank-mediated Indus Water Treaty (IWT) that provides mechanisms for resolving disputes over water sharing. Any drastic reduction in the availability of water in the region has the potential of causing a war between the hostile south Asian neighbors, experts said. Kashmir is located in the northwest region of the Indian subcontinent. It covers the Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir and the Pakistani-administered northern areas and "Azad" Kashmir province. Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract are occupied by China. Based on scientific findings released last December, the snow cover in Jammu and Kashmir is declining while temperature is rising. The findings were the results of a study conducted by senior scientist H. S. Negi and his colleagues, and were published in the ‘Journal of Earth System Sciences', a bimonthly science publication in India. The findings were based on 20 years worth of climatic condition data, covering the periods 1988-89 and 2007-08, and was undertaken during the winter periods between November and April of 2004–05, 2005–06 and 2006–07, using multi-temporal sensor data. "Snow cover monitoring was carried out to evaluate the region-wise accumulation and ablation pattern of snow cover in the Pir Panjal and Shamshawari ranges of Kashmir valley," said Negi. "The study shows reduction in the areal extent of seasonal snow cover and rising trend of maximum temperature in three winters for the entire Kashmir valley." Negi and his team found that the total snowfall in the winter of 2004-05 was 1,082 centimetres across the valley, which declined to 968 centimetres during the period 2005-06 and reduced further to 961 centimetres between 2006 and 2007. "February, the second month of maximum snowfall, showed rapid fluctuation, with 585 centimetres in 2004-05 compared to 207 centimetres in 2005-06 and 221 centimetres in 2006-07," said the scientists, adding that the temperatures remained more than zero degree Celsius during winters, except for January-February 2004-05 and January 2006 against a normal sub-zero temperature. Unlike the Eastern Himalayan rivers such as the Brahmaputra, which are mainly rain-fed, most of the water that goes to the Indus river comes from snowmelt, which includes glacial melt. Global warming-induced changes in climate patterns have adversely affected, among others, snowmelt runoff patterns. "The Indus water system is the lifeline for Pakistan, as 75 to 80 percent of water flows to Pakistan as melt from the Himalayan glaciers. This glacier melt forms the backbone of irrigation network in Pakistan, with 90 percent of agricultural land being fed by the vastly spread irrigation network in Pakistan, one of the largest in the world," said Dr Irshad Muhammad Khan, executive director of Global Change Impacts Studies Centre in Pakistan. Any disruption of water flow would cause a grave impact on agriculture produce in Pakistan, he said. "Until now, the Indus Water Treaty has worked well, but the impact of climate change would test the sanctity of this treaty," Dr Parvez Amir, a senior economist, told IPS. Under the treaty signed in 1960, the two countries also share five tributaries of the Indus river, namely, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej. The agreement grants Pakistan exclusive rights over waters from the Indus and its westward-flowing tributaries, the Jhelum and Chenab, while the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers were allocated for India's use. "I think it is not only the matter of Indus water treaty between India and Pakistan but also the water-sharing treaties elsewhere in the world such as those in the Middle East that also face a severe threat in the form of climate change," said Dr Amir. According to Prof. Mohammad Sultan, who teaches Geography at Kashmir University, temperature in the region has shown disturbing trends over the last few decades. "From 1950 to 1975, the temperature had shown a cooling trend (0.2 below normal). But after 1975 there has been a warming trend (0.4 degree above normal), and it is continuing," he said. He said precipitation in the lower parts of Kashmir has declined by 1.2 centimetres in lower altitudes and 8 cm in higher altitudes beginning in 1975. "This disturbance is bound to impact the accessibility to water in the future," he said. Transboundary water sharing between India and Pakistan will become an "extremely difficult proposition as surface water would become a scarce commodity with the depletion of water reserves up in the mountains," said Prof Sultan.**

US military is key to solve, otherwise it escalates to a global nuclear war and draws in great powers**

Perhaps nowhere is this more concerning than in South Asia. Aside from floods in Pakistan, consider the ramifications of years of flooding due to the rapid melting of glaciers in the Himalayas. Those mountains are a primary source of water for people in Nepal, India, China, Pakistan, and Bangladesh; flooding damages crops, carries water-borne disease, and forces migration. If the glaciers completely melt, the region's rivers will experience considerably lower flow and could see a far worse fate: "desertification." The Indus River is particularly critical: It's Pakistan's longest river, but it flows from the Himalayas and then through India before reaching Pakistan. Pakistan is guaranteed a certain amount of water through the Indus River Treaty, but India still controls that flow. Add to that tension the risk of rising sea levels forcing the migration of millions of people living along the coastal regions of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh, and the picture turns even darker. If catastrophes resulting from these sorts of climate change aren't handled through multinational cooperation early on, they may spark intense competition for water resources, humanitarian relief, and international aid funds. These threats could also draw into question the territorial integrity of the region's states--among which are three nuclear powers. The United States needs to begin a consultative process with other states' security and relief agencies on how to mount rapid responses to such irregular challenges, or it could face the tricky prospect of deescalating tensions amidst the threat of climate-induced state collapse.The State Department and the Office of Foreign Disaster will have to take the lead on these sorts of challenges, bringing to bear their experience in humanitarian relief and diplomacy. But OFDA and State can't do it alone. Washington needs to give serious attention to the ability of the military services to create global partnerships that can lend credible support to meeting the challenges posed by climate change.
