<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Let’s talk about </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">the Block IIA missile… to go into production in 2015 </span></span>

**Four Internal Links to Chinese Conflict:**
**First is Taiwan**
**China perceives the expansion in coop with Japan over BMD as a threat to Taiwan reunification and its safety from the US – it will devastate relations and stability.**
**<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zhang 5</span></span>** (Hui, Research associate in the Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government., December, “Action/Reaction: U.S. Space Weaponization and China”, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.armscontrol.org/print/1943]]</span>)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A Loss of Strategic Nuclear Deterrent Capability Many </span><span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">… </span></span><span class="boldunderline"> cooperation in research and development of advanced theater missile defense with Japan and potentially with Taiwan</span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>**

**That’s China’s most pressing military concern.**
**<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gates 9</span></span>** (Robert, Secretary of Defense of the US – Head of the DOD, “ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS Military Power of the People’s Republic of China 2009 Office”, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.defense.gov/pubs/pdfs/China_Military_Power_Report_2009.pdf]]</span>)

**Second is Japanese Militarism**
**BMD co-op freaks out China – perception of Japanese militarism – independently causes Korean conflict.**
**<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Roberts 3</span></span>** (Brad, Fellow at the Institute for Defense Analyses., September, “China and Ballistic Missile Defense: 1955 to 2002 and Beyond”, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/china/doctrine/bmd.pdf]]</span>)

**Third is Chinese Modernization**
**US-Japan BMD causes China to develop ballistic missiles—results in vertical and horizontal escalation, destabilizing relations and escalation control**

**Fourth is Chinese Sovereignty**
**BMD threatens Chinese sovereignty – US first strike capabilities leads to dominance over China.**
**<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Chase 10</span></span>** (Michael, Assistant Professor in the Strategy and Policy Department at the United States Naval War College, 4/29, “The U.S.-China Strategic Security Relationship and the Nuclear Posture Review Report”, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.trumanproject.org/posts/2010/05/us-china-strategic-security-relationship-and-nuclear-posture-review-report]]</span>)

**Even if the missile defense fails – China still fears US coercive ability.**
**<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Chase 10</span></span>** (Michael, Assistant Professor in the Strategy and Policy Department at the United States Naval War College, 4/29, “The U.S.-China Strategic Security Relationship and the Nuclear Posture Review Report”, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.trumanproject.org/posts/2010/05/us-china-strategic-security-relationship-and-nuclear-posture-review-report]]</span>,)

**MAD doesn’t apply – BMD creates a perception of natural advantages that eviscerates the theory and causes arms races. Their evidence is optimistic nonsense that doesn’t assume dynamic security dilemmas**
**<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kumar 10</span></span> (A Vinod, Associate Fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi. “The Dragon’s Shield: Intricacies of China’s BMD Capability”,** <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.idsa.in/system/files/IB_ChinasBMDCapability.pdf]]</span>)

<span class="underline">Missile defences were initially seen as an ideal way </span><span class="boldunderline">processes being created and influenced by offensive</span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (or even defensive) </span>**<span class="boldunderline">postures of each other</span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>**

**Plan: The United States federal government should substantially phase out use of private military contractors in Afghanistan.**

One of our most effective means to disrupt terrorist organizations is to shut down their financial support networks. Closing these global networks deprives terrorists of their oxygen supply, their lifeblood -- their finances. Since terrorists rely upon global financial networks to bankroll their attacks, the international community must have a global strategy for denying terrorists access to the financial means to commit atrocities. We must work together with a sense of urgency, and be prepared to see it through for the long-term.
