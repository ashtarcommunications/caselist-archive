Plan
The United States __[[home|federal government]]__ should fully fund the James Webb Space Telescope.

Contention 1 is Science Leadership

The James Webb Space Telescope is on the chopping block in Congress – only reviving it can preserve US science leadership
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Overbye, 7/6/11</span> – the Deputy Science Editor of The New York Times, and the author of //Einstein in Love// [July 6, 2011, Dennis Overbye, “Panel Proposes Killing Webb Space Telescope,” http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/science/07webb.html?_r=1, SM]
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The House Appropriations Committee proposed Wednesday to kill the James AND would bring it home in full living color</span>.”

Abandoning the James Webb will crush U.S. science leadership – the plan is key
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Illingworth, Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the U.C. Observatories, 11</span> – Ph.D, chairs the Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee that advises Congress and NSF, NASA and DOE on the implementation of the science programme developed by the astronomy science community through __[[home|studies]]__ carried out by the National Academy of Sciences [January 21, 2011, Garth Illingworth, letter to Dr. John P.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hubble, and the other ongoing Great Observatories</span> (Chandra AND science mission from the perspective of the JSTAC.

And ditching the Webb will wreck US science leadership by outsourcing our best scientific minds—now is key
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bullock, professor of physics and astronomy at UC Irvine, 9/6/11</span> —director of the Southern California Center for Galaxy Evolution [September 6, 2011, James Bullock, “Reaching for the stars,” LA Times, http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/06/opinion/la-oe-bullock-hubble-telescope-20110906]

Paul Kennedy was probably right: the US will go AND <span style="font-size: 12pt;">will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy. </span>

And science leadership makes hegemony sustainable and solves every global problem
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Coletta, Professor of Poli Sci at the U.S. Air Force Academy, 9</span> – Ph.D. in Political Science, December 1999 Harvard University , Master in Public Policy, 1993 Stanford University , Master in Electrical Engineering, 1989 Stanford University , B.S.E.E., 1988 [September 2009, Damon Coletta, “Science, Technology, and the Quest for International Influence,” http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA536133&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf]
On the one hand, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">leaders of both political parties AND </span>experts serving on the remote frontiers of science.

Unipolarity creates __structural disincentives__ for war—//__theoretical__// and //__empirical__// evidence.

Wohlforth, Daniel Webster Professor of Government at Dartmouth College, holds an M.Phil. and Ph.D. in Political Science from Yale University, 2009 (“Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War,” //World Politics//, Volume 61, Number 1, January, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Project MUSE, p. 29-31)
The upshot is a near scholarly <span style="font-size: 12pt;">consensus that unpolarity’s consequences</span> AND <span style="font-size: 12pt;">under unipolarity are consistent with the theory’s expectations</span>.

U.S. unipolarity is key to prevent great power wars, free trade and econ collapse- small conflicts and balancing may be inevitable but the benefits outweigh the costs
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tammen And Kugler 06</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Ronald L. Tammen, PhD, director of the Mark O.

===Glenbrooks Round 1—1AC=== 


====Plan==== 
The United States federal government should develop beamed thermal propulsion technology that disposes of fissile waste materials beyond the Earth’s mesosphere.


====1AC—Reprocessing Advantage==== 
__Contention 1 is Reprocessing:__

There has been a global shift towards reprocessing technology now making collapse of the non-proliferation regime inevitable

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">For decades, the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 12pt;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 12pt;">had opposed the ambitions AND separated plutonium, thereby undermining the nonproliferation regime</span>.

There are two impacts:
First is proliferation—

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Reprocessing is a series of chemical operations that separates plutonium AND </span>technical consensus needed to site a geological repository.

And rapid proliferation risks nuclear conflict—inexperienced nations will be more likely to use their nukes

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Learning as states gain experience with nuclear weapons is complicated</span>AND <span style="font-size: 12pt;">power, and the preferences of the adopter</span>.

I also agree. This debate asks how likely is AND drop the bomb, untested, on Hiroshima.

And their take-outs are wrong—the motivation and technical capability exist—acquisition is the only barrier

Kennedy School of Government, Harvard Senior Research Associate, Managing the Atom Project [April, 2010, Matthew Bunn, “Securing the Bomb 2010,” http://www.nti.org/e_research/Securing_The_Bomb_2010.pdf]
Complacency about the threat is perhaps the biggest obstacle to AND <span style="font-size: 12pt;">for sure whether they could set it off</span>.

Nuclear terrorism is inevitable due to reprocessing technology—access to fissile material is the only barrier—the plan is key

==Critiques== 

===Taoism=== 

====1NC==== 

Death and misfortune are inevitable – the joy of life comes in accepting things as they are – plans to save the world only bring more suffering
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Slabbert, 01</span> [Jos, Taoist teacher and philosopher, “Tao te Ching: How to Deal with Suffering” http://www.taoism.net/theway/suffer.htm]
Dealing with loss Express yourself completely, then keep quiet AND <span style="font-size: 12pt;">it, the more damage we will do</span>.

The 1AC’s rationalist attempt to anticipate the effects of foreign policy will fail. Emptying oneself of being is a prerequisite to true understanding.
Ralph <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Pettman</span>, Professor in the School of History, Philosophy, Political Science and International Relations at Victoria University of Wellington, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2005</span> (“Taoism And The Concept Of Global Security,” //International Relations of the Asia-Pacific//, Volume 5, Number 1, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Oxford Journals Online, p. 72-75)
How does moving onto Taoist ground, and immersing ourselves AND <span style="font-size: 12pt;">know if we are to understand global security</span>.

Live in the present: looking to the future makes life meaningless and denies any benefits your action would have
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Watts, 1951</span> (Alan, dean of the American Academy of Asian Studies and research fellow at Harvard University, The Wisdom of Insecurity, pg 51-2)

====2NC Overview==== 

Political approaches inevitably fail – spiritual enlightenment is our only hope.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Slabbert, 01</span> [Jos, Taoist teacher and philosopher, “Tao te Ching: How to Deal with Suffering” http://www.taoism.net/theway/suffer.htm]
The inescapable <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The inescapable forms of suffering include the obviousAND very people who should implement and protect it</span>.

====Framework==== 

1. Allowing Taoist thought is necessary to break free from the limits rationalist thinking imposes. Any critique from the perspective of the rationalist is tainted by their own preconceptions.
Ralph <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Pettman</span>, Professor in the School of History, Philosophy, Political Science and International Relations at Victoria University of Wellington, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2005</span> (“Taoism And The Concept Of Global Security,” //International Relations of the Asia-Pacific//, Volume 5, Number 1, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Oxford Journals Online, p. 81-82)
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Taoists do not ‘see’ the concept of global security AND in a sacral context like the Taoist one</span>.

4. An evaluation of our own assumptions is necessary
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kirkland, 98</span> [Russell Kirkland, Associate Professor of Religion (and Asian Studies), “"Responsible Non-Action" In a Natural World: Perspectives from the Nei-Yeh, Chuang-Tzu, and Tao-Te Ching,” 1998, University of Georgia, http://kirkland.myweb.uga.edu/rk/pdf/pubs/ECO.pdf]
But what of modes of human involvement with the world AND <span style="font-size: 12pt;">hubristic conceit that our actions are heroically salvific</span>.

====No Impacts==== 

Good versus bad is a false dichotomy – the subjectivity of values means one can never know.

(John, “Nondual Ecology: In Praise of Wildness and in Search of Harmony with Everything That Moves,” http://spot.colorado.edu/~mcclelr/NondualEcologyLight.htm)
Deep ecology is good, but not always useful in AND end, from the wrong sort of despair.

====AT: Death Bad==== 

1. Calls to save humanity are based on a flawed fear of death and a misunderstanding of the continuous nature of the universe.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kirkland, 98</span> [Russell Kirkland, Associate Professor of Religion (and Asian Studies), “"Responsible Non-Action" In a Natural World: Perspectives from the Nei-Yeh, Chuang-Tzu, and Tao-Te Ching,” 1998, University of Georgia, http://kirkland.myweb.uga.edu/rk/pdf/pubs/ECO.pdf]
But by this definition, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the natural order, which AND </span>state from which he or she originally emerged.

====AT: Predictions==== 

2. Living tomorrow is dying today – even if they accurately save the future, we can’t enjoy it when we get there – that’s our 1nc Watt’s evidence – more evidence.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Watts</span>, dean of the American Academy of Asian Studies and research fellow at Harvard University, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">1951</span>
(Alan, //The Wisdom of Insecurity//, pg 34-6)
This is the typical human problem. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The object AND </span>, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and where death comes at the end</span>.

====AT: You Link to the Critique==== 

1. Voting neg doesn’t require passing judgment only action is attached to achieving desired ends. Inaction is the natural result of emptying yourself of thought and living in the present moment. You are voting neg to avoid action not against the aff. Simply choose not to endorse their call to action. Presumption theory and the Tao agree.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kirkland, 98</span> [Russell Kirkland, Associate Professor of Religion (and Asian Studies), “"Responsible Non-Action" In a Natural World: Perspectives from the Nei-Yeh, Chuang-Tzu, and Tao-Te Ching,” 1998, University of Georgia, http://kirkland.myweb.uga.edu/rk/pdf/pubs/ECO.pdf]

2. The alt doesn’t link – even if it prescribes action it is only after careful meditation.
Ralph <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Pettman</span>, Professor in the School of History, Philosophy, Political Science and International Relations at Victoria University of Wellington, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2005</span> (“Taoism And The Concept Of Global Security,” //International Relations of the Asia-Pacific//, Volume 5, Number 1, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Oxford Journals Online, p. 80-81)
It is at this point that Taoists are most likely AND <span style="font-size: 12pt;">moment he or she wants to prolong</span>. 5

====AT: Inaction Bad==== 

3. A deeper understanding of life precludes intervention
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kirkland</span>, professor of Asian religions and Taoism at the University of Georgia, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2001</span>
(Russell, “'Responsible Non-Action' in a Natural World: Perspectives from the Neiye, Zhuangzi, and Daode jing,” //Daoism and Ecology: Ways within a Cosmic Landscape//, http://kirkland.myweb.uga.edu/rk/pdf/pubs/ECO.pdf)
Solicitude for Non-Human Life in Taoism <span style="font-size: 12pt;">A traditional AND </span>we might call both <span style="font-size: 12pt;">moral and spiritual immaturity</span>.

===Astropolitik=== 

====1NC==== 

The affirmative is confined within a dominant discourse of space control – their discourse of astropolitical control reflects their elevation of technology over politics.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Grondin, 6</span> [David Grondin, Lecturer in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa, 2006, “The (Power) Politics of Space: What IR Theories have to say about American Astro-Political Discourses on Space Weaponisation,” Paper Presented At The Annual Meeting Of The International Studies Association, March 25th, Available Online via All Academic at http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/9/8/6/7/p98679_index.html, Accessed 10-26-2008, p. 25-26]
This line of argument is usually linked to technological capacitiesAND <span style="font-size: 12pt;">or reject it</span>. I choose the latter.

The affirmative is wed to a dangerous technological rationality that depoliticizes society and eliminates constraints on genocidal violence – the constant preparedness for war embodied in the affirmative’s call for space control should be rejected in order to inject democratic accountability into space policy.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Grondin, 7</span> [David Grondin, Lecturer in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa, 2007, “The US Religion of Technology in the Weaponization of Outer Space?

When turning to US national security state technocracy applied to AND <span style="font-size: 12pt;">thus calls for a reconceptualised politics of technology</span>.

Roger Handberg once wrote that 'Space is first of all…then we need to ask: what has informed this process?

====2NC Framework==== 
**First the endless war DA – contesting the aff’s framing of Space is a vital prerequisite to peace – the worst case scenarios imagined by the 1ac are only possible if we abandon critique.**
**Bormann, 6** [Natalie Bormann, Visiting Assistant Professor in The Global Security Program at the Watson Institute at Brown University, 2006, “The Lost Dimension?

How can we make sense of US Space policies?...centered on questions of means and ends (next paper!).5

**Second is good academia – debate is primarily an academic activity. The intellectual signal of the alt outweighs any policy proposal**
**Duvall and Havercroft, 6** [Raymond D. Duvall, Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota, and Jonathan Havercroft, Lecturer in Political Science at the University of Victoria, 2006, “Taking Sovereignty Out of This World: Space Weaponization and the Production of Late-Modern Political Subjects,” Paper Presented At The Annual Meeting Of The International Studies Association, Panel SC08: “Reading Outer Space,” March 22nd-25th, Available Online via All Academic at http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/ 0/9/8/6/8/p98680_index.html, Accessed 10-26-2008, p. 20]

**Third is the Democracy DA – challenging so called government experts is necessary to inject democratic accountability into debates and displace the military’s hands on the levers of power – that’s Grondin. That is necessary to prevent global violence**
**Rawls, 99** [John Rawls, Harvard University James Bryant Conant University Professor Emeritus, 1999, The Law of Peoples, p. 5-7]
This monograph on the Law of Peoples is neither a treatise nor a textbook…basic institutions, these great evils will eventually disappear.

**And reject their interpretation – calls for ‘policy relevance’ only entrench dominant systems of thought – this tunnel vision prevents true education—their interpretation is tainted by the hegemonic discourse reason why all their claims are suspect.**
**Jones, 9** – Lecturer in International Politics in the School of Politics and International Relations at Queen Mary, University of London, former Rose Research Fellow in International Relations at Lady Margaret Hall at Oxford University, holds an MPhil and DPhil from Oxford University [2009, Lee Jones, “International Relations Scholarship and the Tyranny of Policy Relevance,” Journal of Critical Globalisation Studies, Volume 1, Issue 1, Available Online at http://criticalglobalisation.com/Issue%201/125_131_JCGS1_JONES_TYRANNYPOLICYRELEVANCE.pdf, Accessed 03-30-2011, p. 127-130]
Having conceded where Nye has a point…ten thousand Deputy Undersecretaries of State for Security Assistance, Science, and Technology.

====2NC Epistemology==== 
**Their authors are trapped within a technocratic rationality that results in worshiping weaponization – a break with the logic embodied in the affirmative’s scholarship is key.**
**Grondin, 7** [David Grondin, Lecturer in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa, 2007, “The US Religion of Technology in the Weaponization of Outer Space? A Case for Technological Atheism and Resisting Space War,” Paper Presented At The Annual Meeting Of The International Studies Association 48th Annual Convention, February 28th, Available Online via All Academic at http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/ 1/7/8/9/4/p178946_index.html, Accessed 10-26-2008, p. 12-13]
Considering outer Space, we have been able so far to prevent warfighting…the pitfalls of deterrence in building a critique of outer Space as a battlefield space.

====AT: Perm==== 
**Turn – Footnoting DA: the perm “footnotes” the criticism – it brackets off our criticism and pushes it to the margins so that business-as-usual scholarship can continue unchanged.**
**Ashley and Walker, 90** [Richard K. Ashley, Professor of Political Science at Arizona State University, and R.B.J. Walker, Professor of International Relations at the University of Victoria, 1990, “Conclusion: Reading Dissidence/ Writing the Discipline: Crisis and the Question of Sovereignty in International Studies,” International Studies Quarterly, Volume 34, Available Online via JSTOR, p. 370]

With Space weaponization as conceived by US strategic elites…possibility of a world peace, but only of a “total peace”.

====AT: Inevitable==== 
**Nothing is inevitable! Their discourse creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, flipping the case.**
**Peoples, 8** — Lecturer in International Relations in the School of Sociology, Politics and International Studies at the University of Bristol, holds a Ph.D. from the University of Wales [2008, Columba Peoples, "Assuming the Inevitable? Overcoming the Inevitability of Outer Space Weaponization and Conflict," Contemporary Security Policy, Volume 29, Number 3, December, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via IngentaConnect]
So, to what extent are we in, or approaching, a space security dilemma?...assume the ‘inevitable’ in relation to outer space weaponization and conflict.

**And we’ll win an independent DA to their framing: claims of inevitability annihilate individual agency.**
**Bleiker, 2k** — Roland Bleiker, Senior Lecturer and Coordinator of the Peace and Conflict Studies Program at the University of Queensland and former Professor at the Australian National University, the Pusan National University, and the University of Tampere, 2000 (“Introduction: Writing human agency after the death of God,” Popular Dissent, Human Agency and Global Politics, Published by Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0511034172, p. 48-49)
The very notion of prediction does, by its own logic, annihilate human agency…reshapes these entrenched perceptions and the ensuing political practices.


====AT: Positivism==== 

Discount affirmative knowledge claims – they are products of a flawed positivist epistemology
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Smith, 97</span> [Steve Smith, Professor at Aberystwyth, becoming Head of the Department of International Politics at the University of Wales BSc in Politics and International Studies in 1973, an MSc degree in International Studies in 1974 and a PhD degree in International Relations in 1978, all from the University of Southampton.

The diminishment of life's richness began with the exodus … climate-change-independent wounding of life on Earth.

And these are incommensurable—the top-down nature of the affirmative incites a zero-sum mindset in which individual action becomes swallowed up in the aff’s policy—legislating away the problem serves to temporarily prevent a problem while ignoring the root causes—means the perm fails.

In addition, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the commissioners had ample ground for skepticism AND political will to militarize space even further.”</span>16
