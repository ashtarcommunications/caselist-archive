===Rawls AC=== 
(Same FW from last Topic)
A: Health care precludes the ability to have a productive life. **__Henneberger explains Daniels__**[[file:///C:/Users/Jacob/Dropbox/Flomo%202013/Healthcare/Jacob/Rawls%20AC.docx#_ftn1|[1]]]**__:__**
Good health is fundamental in most conceptions of the good life. Health allows one to live a life that coincides with a normal human life span. However, this is not the only reason why health is important. **__Good health is__** generally **__necessary__** in order **__to__** participate in activities and **__be the subject of experiences__**. As Norman Daniels argues **__it is not the notion that good health is important for happiness__** that makes healthcare a special need **__but the importance of good health in opportunity__** 14 (Daniels, 387). A lack of health limits one’s function precluding the activities and experiences which are vital to the human experience. **__Healthcare is the best means by which to correct and prevent ill health.__** Though our treatments are not perfect in restoring health **__they are__** **__often effective in bringing back some degree of function,__** if only temporarily. Healthcare includes three categories of medical intervention: preventive, therapeutic, and palliative. None of the three is essential for all people; there are certainly individuals who never receive any sort of treatment and are of good health for the length of a normal human lifespan. Most, however, will experience all types of care to some extent. Preventive care can be as simple as education in healthful living, therapeutic care could just be setting a broken bone, and palliative care includes the administration of painkillers as basic as aspirin. Additionally, each category can be extended to include the most advanced procedures available. **__Most individuals will experience the need for a level of care__** between these two extremes dependent upon their allotment in the natural lottery. As a consequence of the social lottery, however, **__they may not be able to afford the necessary healthcare.__**

B: The veil of ignorance guarantees health care if the actor became unable to afford it. **__Henneberger 2:__**
**__Advantaged persons__** in the framework of social cooperation should **__have little difficulty securing healthcare for themselves__**. If not born into wealth they could at least parlay their talents into the funds necessary for care. **__Individuals poorly endowed in reality__**, however, **__have little hope of obtaining healthcare__**. Blinded by the 16 veil of ignorance **__those in the original position would assent to principles of justice which ensure access to healthcare in the event that they are__** in actuality **__poorly endowed.__**The difference principle provides the means to make this provision as it sets aside compensating benefits for these individuals. One could imagine this coming in the form of taxes levied against those who have used their talents to create exceptional personal wealth. Their opportunity to succeed is partially dependent upon the less well off and therefore they must offer compensation. **__Individuals in the original position would agree to a stipulation that compensating benefits are put towards healthcare__**.

C: Health care is necessary to stop unjustified inequalities. **__Coogan[[file:///C:/Users/Jacob/Dropbox/Flomo%202013/Healthcare/Jacob/Rawls%20AC.docx#_ftn2|**__[2]__**]]__** **__:__**

Rawls himself does not discuss health care and attempts at expanding his theory to include health care considerations are inadequate. However, to escape the critique raised by Sen and Nussbaum, an acceptable justification for the public provision of health care must be found within Rawls’s theory. Recall that Sen and Nussbaum point out that **__individuals vary in their ability to use means__**, or the primary goods, **__to achieve their ends__**, or conception of the good. Many of **__these variations arise from specific health needs__**. **__In order to mitigate the inequalities__** that result **__from variations in individuals’ ability to make use of their share of goods, basic health needs must be met__**. The most direct and defensible account of health care **__justice__** under the Rawlsian framework is to **__[must] include health care itself as a primary good.__** Extending the list of primary good is reasonable, because Rawls conceived of the list as flexible and in several places notes that extending them may be necessary. Health care is an appropriate addition to the list because it fits within the larger objectives of the theory and within the definition of primary goods. **__Furthermore__**, **__this approach is preferable__** to other attempts at determining a system of just health care with Rawls’s principles **__because it allows for an expanded conception of health care__**, one **__that will best ensure that the minimum standard of equality__**in health care **__is met__**.

D: Underneath the veil of ignorance we have no conception of probabilities of particular actions. **__Schroeder:__**[[file:///C:/Users/Jacob/Dropbox/Flomo%202013/Healthcare/Jacob/Rawls%20AC.docx#_ftn3|[3]]]
It turns out we can make some headway, at least. The key is to note that **__Rawls’s veil is one of ignorance, not mere risk or uncertainty__**. Recall the two distributions #1 and #2, above. In order to conclude that #1 is preferable to #2, we seem to require the assumption that the agent is equally likely to end up in group B or C, as opposed to group A. (Recall that Rawls stipulates that the parties to the original position are self-interested.) Or, rather, we need to assume that it’s not overwhelmingly likely that the agent will be in group A. If she were virtually guaranteed to be in group A, then #2 would be the smarter choice – at least she’d have $11, instead of $10. But, Rawls says (§28), **__he’s never said anything about how the positions in society are to be distributed.__** On what grounds**__[we]__** **__can[‘t]__** we **__take it for granted that we might end up in B__** or C? **__The assumption of equiprobability__**– which seems to drive Harsanyi’s argument – **__is unjustified.__** In fact, any assumption about probabilities is unjustified. **__We can’t__** even **__begin to calculate expected utility, since we can’t__** begin to **__assign probabilities to__** the **__various possible outcomes.__** If we can’t even begin to calculate expected utility, then **__the whole notion of risk aversion doesn’t get a grip__**

This justifies the difference principle, which requires that we give universal health care. **__Schroeder 2:__**[[file:///C:/Users/Jacob/Dropbox/Flomo%202013/Healthcare/Jacob/Rawls%20AC.docx#_ftn4|[4]]]
Okay, so how does this all apply to the original position? Since the veil is one of ignorance and not of risk – since agents don’t know how likely they are to end up in any given position – an uncertainty averse person won’t like the situation. She can’t, however, opt out, so how can she best minimize the uncertainty? **__The best option would be__** to insist on an **__equal distribution.__** Though she would still be uncertain as to exactly which role she’d end up in, **__she’d__** at least **__know__** exactly **__how much stuff she’d have.__** **__The uncertainty__**, in other words, **__would have no consequence.__** So, as a first step, **__we can say that the uncertainty-averse person would prefer whatever equal distribution gives the most to each person__** – that is, the maximal equal distribution. Call that distribution E. Now, compare E to some other distribution that weakly dominates it. That is, suppose E’ assigns at least as much to every role as does E, and assigns more to at least some role. As we saw earlier, it’s plausible to suppose that any rational decision procedure will prefer E’ to E. If we suppose, therefore, that the uncertainty-averse person will prefer E’ to E, we’ve basically arrived at a maximin decision procedure. An uncertainty-averse person who also prefers dominating distributions to dominated distributions will settle on the Difference Principle from the behind the veil of ignorance. Notice that **__we didn’t need to assume anything about risk aversion__**, **__and__** in particular **__we arrived at maximin without__** (implausibly) **__assuming that the parties to the original position are maximally risk-averse.__**

Thus, we would give health care to all as we would know what we would be guaranteed in someone else’s position

E:<span style="background-color: white;">The veil exists to reconcile subjective views, but regardless of the veil, individuals still want universal health care. **__CBS[[file:///C:/Users/Jacob/Dropbox/Flomo%202013/Healthcare/Jacob/Rawls%20AC.docx#_ftn5|**__[5]__**]]:__** </span>

I contend that implementing universal health care stabilizes identities.

First, universal health care stabilizes identities by generating a notion of what is correct form of the body. Illich:

Second, no other options than public.

===TFA AC=== 
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Intervention defined “Come between so as to prevent or alter a result or course of events”.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This means that counterplans don’t negate because they still alter the course of events in other nations, which is aff ground.</span>


<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Presume aff and prefer aff interps because A) the 7-4 timeskew in favor of the negative and B) the negative has the ability to adapt to the AC whereas the affirmative can never adapt the neg strat because I speak first. </span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And Aff wins on T since I’m forced to adopt some reading of the topic in the AC, and letting the neg argue that another reading might have been slightly better is infinitely possible and thus unreciprocal. </span>


<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And don’t vote me down for violating T since a) we still have time to debate after the AC and thus maintain the educational integrity of the round, b) this nullifies 6 minutes of AC speech time causing a skew.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Theory against the AC should also be treated as an RVI since a) I wouldn’t otherwise have access to offense on that level of the debate which is unreciprocal, b) adding a layer to the debate that only the neg can win exacerbates the aff’s timeskew, and c) the negative has the opportunity to adapt their arguments to meet my interpretation, so topicality should be a game-over issue either way.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">“To attempt” is an infinitive, which means that it is descriptive of the action of stopping human rights abuse, which means the resolution is evaluating if the United States taking action is justified, not if they will. This also means cps don’t negate, since the United States can still take alternative actions.</span>


<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Observation 1: Burdens</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Justified is defined as “To declare free of blame; absolve.”[[file:///C:/Users/Jacob/Dropbox/Flomo%202013/Human%20Rights/Jacob/Bomb%20AC.docx#_ftn1|[1]]]Thus, the sufficient affirmative burden is to prove that the United States cannot be attributed with moral blameworthiness for interaction. Conversely, the negative must prove that the United States is deserving of moral blameworthiness by intervening. Prefer this interpretation because:</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">1. Predictability- This reflects common usage since everyday actions like sitting down are justifiable not because there is some reason for them to be morally neutral, but since they’re not wrong. Additionally, the Free Dictionary has nearly 5 billion views, (4,820,714,177 visitors served) making most indicative of common usage. Common usage is the strongest link into predictability because we’re prepared to debate for what we are exposed to. Predictability controls the internal link into fairness because all abuses in fairness are checked back if you are prepared to engage the argumentation.</span>


<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">2. Presuming actions to be justified is the only way to have the contemplation of justification, ,making presumption a starting point for all moral discourse.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">3. Ground- Negative existentials are non-falsifiable – claiming unicorns don’t exist can’t be proven merely by my not having seen unicorns, so my burden would be unreasonable. This makes it impossible for the affirmative to win, because I would have continuously prove that there are no restrictions. This also controls the internal link into reciprocity, because any other definition would force the affirmative to attack every possible restriction, whereas the negative would only have to win one. Ground is key to fairness because both debaters deserve an equitable set of links to impacts.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">4. Philosophy Ground- Justification outside of blameworthiness and instead based upon reasons for action destroys topical philosophy debate because debaters could run ethical positions that does not relate to the agency of the United States as an agent. Instead, they could argue why reasons for action in general are bad, regardless of the actor. My interp allows for more in-depth philosophy debate, because it allows for ethical discussion that must directly correlate with the United States of an actor. Philosophy ground is key to education and fairness because it determines what matters in the round.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I contend that governments cannot have moral blameworthiness. </span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">First, governments can only justify actions to themselves as there is no international body with normative force that can coerce “morality”. Schlesinger writes:</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A nation’s law can set down relatively clear standards of right and wrong individual behavior because domestic law is the product of an imperfect but nonetheless authentic moral consensus. International life has no such broad of deep areas of moral consensus. It was once hoped that modern technology would create a common fund of moral imperatives transcending the concerns of particular nations- common concepts of interest, justice, and comity- either because the revolution in weaponry would increase mutual fear. Such expectations have been disappointed. Until nations come to adopt the same international morality, there can be no world law to regulate the behavior of states as there is law within nations to regulate the behavior of individuals. Nor can international institutions- the League of Nations or the United Nations-produce by sleight by hand a moral consensus where none exists.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Second, to question if an action taken by a government is unjustified is infinitely regressive in the political context. Hopkins[[file:///C:/Users/Jacob/Dropbox/Flomo%202013/Human%20Rights/Jacob/Bomb%20AC.docx#_ftn2|[2]]]:</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hobbes's principal claim is thatany appeal to right reason comprises a completely[an] inadequate basis for the resolution of disputes, because if disputes are about what the truth actually is, then any appeal to right reason or the truth, is essentially inconclusive and, therefore, self-defeating. Ideally,concern for the truth or right reason should be accepted as a governing principle, but this will not resolve disputes, successfully or peacefully, In those circumstances in which people adopt entrenched and irreconcilable positions, because that is precisely the route to internecine conflict and physical violence— 'the state of war, of all against all.' The truth and right reason do not bear clearly identifiable insignia, enabling them to be identified without ambiguity or uncertainty.</span>


<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Third, the only way governments can be held normatively accountable is by being able to associate their agency with the decisions that they make. This is the only way to bridge the ought-ought gap, for an agent can always question why they should act moral in the first place, and associating morality with how one conceives themselves as an agent gives motivation to be moral. However, governments cannot be held blameworthy because they can’t question their agency. Governments cannot possess intentionality a) there is no way to aggregate different collective thoughts because each thought would only matter to the individual with the thought, which means that agency cannot be aggregated b) relative political actors cause there to be different values because it is virtually impossible for all politicians to have the same value; this is empirically verified by the political gridlock and c) even if all members are in agreement, each member is not entirely self-aware of the intentions of the other members of the group as to why that political action is necessary, meaning that they can’t associate agency with the decision. Additionally, even if moral motivation could be aggregated, the only way to have moral motivations is to presume that moral action is justified, because if an actor expresses a positive moral attitude towards a goal then they definitionally values that goal and wills its completion.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Fourth, all ethical theories collapse into infinite regress, meaning individuals give weight to ethical claims. Macintyre writes:</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> “An agent can only justify a particular judgment by referring to some universal rule from which it may belogically derived, and can only justify that rule in turn by deriving it from some more general rule or principle;but on this view since every chain of reasoning must be finite, such a processof justificatory reasoning must always terminate with the assertion of some rule or principle for which no further reason can be given. Each individual implicitly or explicitly has to adopt his or her own first principles on the basis of such a choice. The utterance of any universal principle is an expression of the preferencesof for that will its principles have and itthem by adopting them.”However, that does not mean morality in and of its self cannot exist, therefore, I present the following burden analysisan individual will and can have only such authority as [one] chooses to confer upon [it]. </span>


<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Fifth, governments have no ability to test the ethical basis of their actions as they must always make decisions, meaning they cannot be held responsible. Fagin[[file:///C:/Users/Jacob/Dropbox/Flomo%202013/Human%20Rights/Jacob/Bomb%20AC.docx#_ftn3|[3]]]:</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">To a skeptic, the testability of a claim is its most important feature. Unfortunately, the testability of political hypotheses is extremely low, due to the difficulty of controlled experimentation. One wonders if the term “political science” in fact has any meaning at all. Suppose, for example, we wish to evaluate the effectiveness of income redistribution in reducing poverty. We cannot create two identical societies, giving one a placebo income tax and the other a real one, administered in double-blind fashion. The political process affects all members of a given community; there are no disinterested observers to evaluate the outcome. We must instead live with the imperfect alternative of cities, counties, states, and nations as poorly conducted experiments in social organization. Although these experiments lack controls, counterfactuals, and take long periods of time before they produce measurable results, they are the skeptic’s best source of factual information on political issues.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Sixth, holding governments morally responsible treats those who were not willing supporters of the decision as a means to an end. To hold individuals responsible for decisions is to associate blameworthiness with their moral agency. However, because governments are composed of multiple individuals with some level of disagreement on policy decisions, holding governments responsible uses individuals as a means to the end of responsibility. Additionally, any abstract morality from outside the subjective decision of the government uses individuals as a means to an end, because holding governments responsible uses them as a means to an end to achieve the end of morality. </span>
