**A hegemonic neoliberalism utilizing nation building, party politics, the military industrial complex, and a fundamental motive of profit are increasingly the drive of the US into space. This is characterized by an increasing privatization and deregulation of space interests, increasingly foreclosing indigent access.**

**The United States federal government should develop space as common**
