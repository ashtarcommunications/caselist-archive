Greenhill Round 1:

**Alva Myrdal** (Swedish sociologist and politician. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982)once said
“All mankind is now learning that these nuclear weapons can only serve to destroy, never become beneficial. “
Def.
State- A politically organized body of people usually occupying a definite territory; especially: one that is sovereign (//http://www.merriam-webster.com/netdict/state//)
Possess- own: have ownership or possession of (wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn)
Ought- implicates a moral obligation or duty (American Heritage Dictionary)
Nuclear Weapon- a weapon of mass destruction whose explosive power derives from a nuclear reaction
(wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn)

Value- International Security- Security is a fair value for the round because states, whether in conflict or not, prioritize optimal security because nations depend on it for their own protection and prosperity. Today, as never before, states link to each other through trade, travel technology, communication, and economics.
Criterion- Stabilizing Foreign Relations- foreign relations are the relationship between nations and the ways in which they are connected. Because nations are interdependent good foreign relations are important for states in order to function in our increasingly global world.
Cont. 1:

Sub A) Nuclear weapons have taken war to the edge of no return, we must go back before it’s too late.
Foucault ‘78, Chair of History of Systems of Thought at the College of France, 1978 [Michel, The History of Sexuality, Volume 1: An Introduction, p. 136-137]

Since the classical age, the West has undergone a very profound transformation of these mechanisms of power. "Deduction" has tended to be no longer the major form of power but merely one element among others, working to incite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize the forces under it: a power bent on generating forces, making them grow, and ordering them, rather than one dedicated to impeding them, making them submit, or destroying them. There has been a parallel shift in the right of death, or at least a tendency to align itself with the exigencies of a life-administering power and to define itself accordingly…The atomic situation is now at the end point of this process: the power to expose a whole population to death is the underside of the power to guarantee an individual's continued existence. The principle underlying the tactics of battle—that one has to be capable of killing in order to go on living—has become the principle that defines the strategy of states. But the existence in question is no longer the juridical existence of sovereignty; at stake is the biological existence of a population. If genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient right to kill; it is because war is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of the population.
Sub b) Nuclear weapons cause shaky alliances with distrust and intimidation
Trust, Deterrence, Realism, and Nuclear Omnicide Alexander Gralnick p.176-177 1988 International Society of Political Psychology
The concept of deterrence assumes that nuclear armament and the threat of its employment deter the other side from its use and thus ensures peace. However," deterrence" has now been extended politically a s a threat to prevent the opponent from following unwelcome policies..." This is to say that there must be trust! Instead, we think only in terms of negotiating from strength, which is contrary to everything we know about conflict resolution in every other area of life, including interpersonal conflict, and international nonmilitary diplomacy. In all areas, we accept as essential the ingredient of trust. It helps to resolve conflicts, and in any case must be present in conflicts of interest between nuclear-armed nations, since the alternative is mutual suicide. In the presence of trust conflict could lead to creative resolution, not war.

Cont.2 Nuclear Weapons are susceptible to rouge states and non-state actors
As said by the president of the United States in his state of union address in 2003:
“Today the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder. They could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies, who would use them without the least hesitation.”
The current National Security Strategy states
“Deterrence based only on the threat of retaliation is less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willingly to take risks, gambling with the lives, and the wealth of their nation.”
**//PrevPreventing Catastrophic Nuclear Terrorism//**, authored by Council Fellow for Science and Technology Charles D. Ferguson.
While the “threat of a nuclear attack by terrorists has never been greater,” the U.S. government has yet to make prevention the highest priority “The probability of nuclear attack has increased because traditional deterrence—threatening assured destruction against a valued asset such as a national territory—does not work against the terrorist groups most likely to covet nuclear weapons,” Securing and eliminating vulnerable nuclear materials and weapons offer points of greatest leverage in preventing nuclear terrorism,” “For these activities, much more national and international action is urgently needed. Preventing nuclear terrorism is also closely connected to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries,” writes Ferguson. “By reducing the number of countries with nuclear weapons or weapons-usable nuclear materials, terrorists will have fewer places to buy or steal these critical components of nuclear terrorism.” says the report.

Winston Churchill said “Be careful above all things not to let go of the atomic weapon until you are sure, and more sure, that other means of preserving the peace are in your hands.”

Security is a fair value for the round because states, whether in conflict or not, prioritize optimal security because nations depend on it for their own protection and prosperity.
Criterion: Nuclear Deterrance
Cont. 1 Nuclear Deterrence is necessary to fulfill the states obligation to protect their nation’s security
Holmes 2009, Kim R. Holmes, a former assistant secretary of state, is a vice president at the Heritage Foundation, 8/6/2009, “Defensegames and arms races,” http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/aug/06/defense-games-arms-races-not-what-you-think/
But Mr. Gates and Mr. Obama misunderstand the real-world dynamics of U.S. military superiority. America's military strength and determination to excel more often than not have discouraged aggression and - in cases like Libya - actually encouraged disarmament. Moreover, other countries don't always mirror our restraint. In fact, seeing the military gap closing can entice them to work harder to catch up, and this could happen faster than Mr. Gates imagines…
Cont. 2 Nuclear weapons limits war
The National Journal in 2001 that interviewed Paul Robinson, the author of “Nuclear Weapons Have Made the World Safer” (Ban the Bomb? Heck No, It’s Too Useful)
“Nuclear weapons have not only been vital to US national security, but also that history has turned out better for our having nuclear weapons. US nuclear weapons help maintain peace, and a lot of other nations depend on our nuclear umbrella. So, like it or not, for the foreseeable future we have no alternative but to continue to depend upon nuclear weapons and the deterrence they provide.”
