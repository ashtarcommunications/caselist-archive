===Contention One: The Slums=== 

**Capitalism is applying its stranglehold to public transportation, that worsens inequality, devalues lives and creates continuous war**
**Grengs ’04** – Associate Professor of Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Michigan ( Joe, CITY, VOL. 9, NO. 1, APRIL, “The abandoned social goals of public transit in the neoliberal city of the USA”, http://communitylearningpartnership.org/share/docs/Grengs.Abandoned_Social_Goals_of_Public_Transit.pdf//JC)//
//In an emerging world order where capitalism…those who depend most on good transit.//


//**This creates slums, filled with an urban underclass – The system uses racism and classism to fuel its failures**//
//**Wilson 10** (Carter, professor of political science at the University of Toledo, The Dominant Class and the Construction of Racial Oppression: A Neo-Marxist/Gramscian Approach to Race in the United States, Google Scholars)// 

//In the final analysis, several additional points need to be made about a neo-Marxist analysis of contemporary racial oppression and racist culture. First, the urban underclass is the product of advanced capitalism…This approach offers a deeper and richer analysis of contemporary racism.//


//**And, Capitalism builds transportation systems that promote consumerism, thus causing massive environmental catastrophe – We must advocate a mass expansion of public transit**//
//**Townsend Managing Editor 2008** (Terry, managing editor, Individual Versus Social Solutions to Global Warming)//

//We have to convince millions of people and …ecological processes, in ways that capitalism is inherently incapable of doing.//


//**These excluding and homogenizing practices prevent coalition and organization of the masses and causes extinction – We must allow the spector of Communism to reemerge**//
//**Zizek 09**//
//(Slavoj, Professor of Sociology at the Institute for Sociology, Ljubljana University, “Censorship Today: Violence, or Ecology as a New Opium for the Masses” [[http://schwarzemilch.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/censorship-today.pdf]]//HH)jc
Last but not least, new forms of apartheid, new Walls and slums… to help a new mode of existence of the hypothesis to deploy itself.



**The communism we speak of is not an ideal, but a movement that reacts to contradictions in the capitalist system – This vision of communism is thwarted by a perceived lack of revolutionary subject**
**Žižek 09** --Slavoj Žižek is a researcher at the institute for sociology at Ljubljana (New Left Review 57, May-June 2009, “How to Begin at the Beginning” http://www.newleftreview.org/II/57/slavoj-zizek-how-to-begin-from-the-beginning)JC

So where are we today, after the désastre obscur of 1989…Why insist on the communist hypothesis, against all odds?



**Transportation infrastructure is the bastion of global capitalism’s abuses – it creates zones of inclusion and exclusion – Only by accepting the mantel of the revolutionary subject and the excluded can we engage in universalized antagonism where we can recapture value to life and stave off human extinction**
**Žižek 09** --Slavoj Žižek is a researcher at the institute for sociology at Ljubljana (New Left Review 57, May-June 2009, “How to Begin at the Beginning” http://www.newleftreview.org/II/57/slavoj-zizek-how-to-begin-from-the-beginning)JC
It is not enough to remain faithful to the communist … to avoid actually becoming so is to act preventively.


**We must engage the state as planners – Using a universalized particular demand to provide transportation for urban populations acts as a counter-methodology to that of neoliberal planning**
**Grengs ’04** – Associate Professor of Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Michigan ( Joe, CITY, VOL. 9, NO. 1, APRIL, “The abandoned social goals of public transit in the neoliberal city of the USA”, http://communitylearningpartnership.org/share/docs/Grengs.Abandoned_Social_Goals_of_Public_Transit.pdf//JC)//
//Federal policy encourages local transit officials to shift… a process that has yet to tap the potential of meaningful citizen participation.//


//**The affirmative represents an ethical shift that embraces contingency in the face of certainty – This represents a dramatic shift from existing, unquestioned institutions**//
//**Žižek and Daly 2004** (Slavoj, professor of philosophy at the Institute for Sociology, Ljubljana, and Glyn, Senior Lecturer in Politics in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at University College, Northampton, Conversations with Zizek, page 18-19)//MP

For Zizek, a confrontation with the obscenities of… like Zizek's own thought, exhorts us to risk the impossible.

===Plan=== 

Thus We demand in the face of neoliberalism that:

The United States federal government will increase mass transit for urban areas.
