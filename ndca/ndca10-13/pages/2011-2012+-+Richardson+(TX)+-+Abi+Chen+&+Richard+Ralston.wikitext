This is not to argue, however, that a certain continuity does not exist in US space discourse, which has been and continues to be grounded on claims to colonization, expansionism, competition, weaponization, privatiza­tion, securitization and commercialization. One difference is, however, that, as Rees argues, the US is 'not as overwhelmingly economically superior' as it was when it launched the Marshall Plan, it cannot stabilize the world economically in the way that it might have done fifty years ago, and that</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__it is vulnerable in a way that it was not in the post-war years__**</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;"> (Rees, interviewing Tony Benn, in Reza 2003: 13). </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">It is, therefore, worth considering how, and according to what politics, US discourse has constituted and continues to constitute outer space</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">So, before I go on to examine the gendered constitution of US outer space discourse, I want first to provide some, political and historical, background to the contemporary constitution of US space policy. If the Marshall Plan her­alded 'a sort of colonial reconstruction of Europe' (Benn, in Reza 2003: 13-14), the Bush administration's 'new vision for space exploration' represents an' equally imperial design, a design predicated on ideas of imperial expansion in which the reproduction and promulgation of heterosexual gender identity(ies) are not just incidental to the success of the project, but absolutely central to it. As analysts have noted, particularly of the Kennedy and Johnson Cold War administrations, </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">US electoral politics has long embodied, 'an obsession with "toughness" and the use of a sexualised language of competition and domi­nance among men who contended for power within the American electoral system and within the foreign policy bureaucracy</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">' (Dean 2001: 3-4). A brief history of US space administration </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The contemporary US discourse of outer space </span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">that I examine in this chapter</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> is </span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">primarily </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">descendent of a heavily militarized, but highly institutionalized, discourse of post-Cold War security, military policy and alliance politics, predicated on the attainment and maintenance of military and strategic supe­riority.</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">It would be a mistake to underestimate just how much the 'Cold War' between the US and USSR (and the 'space age' that it inaugurated) dominated the writings of intellectuals and the agendas of political leaders during the 1950s and 1960s. US politics was the preserve of security, military policy and alliance politics, with issues beyond these receiving little sustained attention (Agnew and Corbridge 1995: 2).</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__The conquest of outer space achieved particular prominence as a 'space race'__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">to develop the most effective long­ range rocket-based technologies.

Garber 2003; McDougall 1985; Carter 1988). Any discussion of space 'exploration' for its own sake, as distinguishable from the development of 'rocket technology', remained, at this very early stage, muted.2 Although talk of hysteria in Washington at the launch of Sputnik may be somewhat overstated, the US certainly appeared to many something less of a world hegemon, and Eisenhower's 'paternalistically vague' (Democratic Senator Stuart Symington, quoted in Dickson 2004: 2) response to Soviet space 'dominance' was heavily criticized. Dickson characterizes the period immediately proceeding Sputnik's launch as one of 'national insecurity', 'wounded national pride', 'in-fighting', 'political grandstanding', 'clandes­tine plots' and 'ruthless media frenzy' (2004: 4). As McDougall articulates, when Sputnik 1 first circled the earth in 1957, commentators were at some­thing of a loss as to what exactly the 'space age' symbolized. With the US</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> perpetually unable to separate 'thinking about technology from teleology or eschatology'</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">(McDougall 1985: 4),</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__the space age, and the space race it inspired, became a mirror for the ways in which Americans perceived them­selves and their__**</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">, thus far unchallenged, global hegemony; less a rejection of the exact nature of the US state during the Cold War than the refraction of its political, cultural and administrative insecurities, hopes and aspirations. As McDougall argues, since 1945 the US had assumed the responsibility of 'free world' leader and maintained it on two premises: the eminent superior­ity of American liberal institutions, not only in terms of 'freedom' but in terms of material prosperity, and also the overwhelming superiority of the US in the technology of mass destruction. Sputnik, however, gave the lie to the premise that the US was 'both "better" and mightier than its chief rival' (McDougall 1985: 7). As critics increasingly condemned Eisenhower's apparently passive and unconcerned leadership for being 'old-fashioned' and 'out of touch' (McDougall 1985: 7),</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__a particular political discourse began to emerge in the US, founded on a certain type of sexual metaphor and the assertion of virile, heterosexual masculinity, led by__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Presidents John F.</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Kennedy and </span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Lyndon B.</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Johnson</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">.

Eisenhower's more careful and restrained approach was quickly replaced with Kennedy's cult of masculine prowess, a career premised, as Dean articulates, on an 'ideology of masculinity' constructed around culturally resonant images of the 'stoic warrior-intellectual' (Dean 2001: 169). The late 1950s was a period of massive US self-doubt, propelled by what Michaud refers to as 'a surge of discourses on emasculation and feminized conformity' (2005: 4). Kennedy's assertion (written in //The Nation,// before he announced he was to run for his party's nomination to presidential candidate), that the US had 'gone soft: physi­cally, mentally, spiritually soft'; that the US was 'in danger of losing our will to fight, to sacrifice, to endure' and that the 'slow corrosion of luxury is beginning to show', found great sway across America, an assertion, as Dean illustrates, of manly strength against feminized weakness, youth against age, stoic austerity against debilitating luxury (2001: 170). Kennedy's immediate focus on the 'space gap' signaled the announcement of a more militaristically virile engage­ment. Space exploration thus became a central policy tenet of the Kennedy government, with the operation to get a US astronaut on the Moon a means of reasserting US authority and avenging any doubts as to the administration's ability to perform. While the USSR operated a single military space programme, tending to classify many of the (at least earlier) processes of its devel­opment of space technology, the US elected a different approach, one that intentionally and actively separated the public and private of space colonization through the creation of so-called 'civilian' programmes (ostensibly, more open to the public) run by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), such as the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon, and the more secretive 'military' space agencies run by the Department of Defense (DoD) (operating both' classified' and 'unclassified' operations).3 Once known as US Space Command (USSPACECOM), military space operations are now labelled under the general rubric of US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). NASA, which was established in 1958, one year after the launch of Sputnik, is primarily responsible for the 'scientific' discovery and exploration of space, the development of applications for space technology (including weather and communications satellites), and the development of the space shuttle and ongoing operations to secure a permanent human presence in space on the international space station. In NASA's own words, it is focused on developing 'America's ready access to space' (NASA). US Space Command, on the other hand, was designed at its creation, in 1985, 'to help institutionalize the use of space in U.S. deterrence efforts' (United States Strategic Command). Conceived as a unified command centre of United States military operations in Space, in October 2002 the DoD merged USSPACECOM with</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__USSTRATCOM, which had been established in 1992, under President George H. Bush, according to US Strategic Command, to 'encourage stability in the post-Cold War world'__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">(ibid.). Post 9/11</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">, **__the merger //(so// the US administration claimed) was intended as a 'more integrated approach' to the defence of the US 'in response to a dramatically changing security environment generated by emerging global and transregional threats'__** (</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">ibid.).4 The contemporary politics of US space discourse US Strategic Command today controls not only space operations, but all nuclear weapon assets of the US military, 'Information Operations', 'Integrated Missile Defense', 'Global Command and Control', 'Intelligence', 'Surveillance and Reconnaissance', 'Global Strike' and 'Strategic Deterrence'. In its own words, USSTRATCOM: is a global integrator charged with the miSSlOns of full-spectrum global strike, space operations, computer network operations, Department of Defense information operations, strategic warning, integrated missile defense, global C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), combating weapons of mass destruction, and specialized expertise to the joint warfighter. (United States Strategic Command) Space's position in US politics as commercially relevant is a little hazier. As Wirbel argues,the 2001 recession effectively 'imploded' the commercial space industry with, not least</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> since 9/11, the lines between civilian and military resources becoming ever more blurred as civilian companies look to the military for dual-use functions to their products</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">(Wirbel 2002). The importance of economic, scientific and technological gain to the US should not be underestimated, but it certainly would be careless to ignore the strength of the ties that bind US discourse on outer space to military endeavour.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__There remains a close proximity, in official and unofficial US rhetoric, between the militarization of outer space and its exploitation for economic, technological and scientific profit, embedded within a wider, neo-liberal discourse concerning the assumed essentiality of the (rational) individual's need for freedom, choice and access to markets.__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Thus, while it is true that a particularly insidious neo-liberal globalization thesis (dependent on the expansion of the free market into all areas of social life) does indeed drive much of US space discourse today, as it does US politics more broadly, space is rarely conceived of primarily in commercial terms in the US. Com­munications satellites have, since the passage of the 1962 Communications Satellite Act, chiefly been a private sector activity, but, according to Smith, attempts 'to commercialize other aspects of space activities have yielded mixed success' (2003: 7). In spite of USSPACECOM's insistence that 'Space commerce is becoming increasingly important to the global economy', rela­tions between US military and private space operations are frequently tense, not least concerning the perceived 'threat' to national security created by commercial 'imagery' sales (US commercial imaging satellites compete with French, Russian, Indian and Israeli companies to 'see' an object or feature of a certain size from outer space. See Smith 2003: 7-8). An issue of particular concern, for example, involves the 'shutter control' policy inaugurated by the Clinton administration in 1994, wherein the US government may force commercial companies to discontinue obtaining or distributing imagery of certain parts of the world, causing some political groups to complain that the media and relief agencies are being deprived of essential data (Smith 2003: 8). When the US launched attacks on Afghanistan, the DoD decided to control access to imagery through the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), which bought the exclusive rights to Ikonos (a private sector satellite owned by Space Imaging) imagery of that area, preventing anyone else's use of this data without NIMA's approval. </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The current political climate in the US</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">, overseen by the Bush administra­tion, has bred a quieter but no less emphatic approach to outer space than has gone before, as predicated on the attainment of military and strategic superi­ority as US Cold War discourse at its peak, but</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> conspicuously lacking the recognition that other nations may also have rights in space</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">(not least those rights that could mean another nation rivalling the US in space capabilities.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__As__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">USSPACECOM's </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">'Vision for 2020' makes clear, the only outcome the US is willing to consider is 'full spectrum dominance</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">'</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">). With minimal fanfare, President George W. Bush authorized, on 31 August 2006, a new national space policy to supersede Clinton's previous 1996 policy. The policy is careful, at the very outset, to highlight the civil and commercial benefits of outer space exploration, with space described as 'a place that is increasingly used by a host of nations, consortia, businesses, and entrepreneurs' (US National Space Policy 2006). This said, the strategic ambitions of the Bush administration are not long withheld, with 'those who effectively utilize space' enjoying added prosperity and security' and holding 'a substantial advantage over those who do not' (ibid.). Freedom of action in space is as important to the United States as air power and sea power. In order to increase knowledge, discovery, economic prosperity, and to enhance the national security, the United States //must have// robust, effective and efficient space capabilities. (ibid.; emphasis added)</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__The 2006 Space Policy__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">provides an example of the increasingly blurred boundaries in contemporary US political culture between commercial imperatives, various narratives of scientific 'progress' and 'discovery', and the </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">unashamed imperialism of a post-9fII discourse of weaponization, territorial conquest and securitization.</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Although part of the policy remains classified, and the unclassified document does not per se call for the deployment of US weapons systems in space (the //Globe and Mai/),//</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">it explicitly does allow for any 'US defense and intelligence-related activities in pursuit of national interests', permits the US to reject 'any claims to sovereignty by any nation over Outer Space or celestial bodies</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">', and states that the US 'rejects any limitations on the fundamental right of the United States to operate in and acquire data from space' (US National Space Policy). Any arms control agreements or restrictions that may impair 'the rights of the United States to conduct research, development, testing, and operations or activities in space for US national interests' will be opposed. As far as the commercial use of space is discussed, the policy states that a commercial space sector will be encouraged only where it can be 'consistent with national security', 'promote innovation', 'strengthen US leadership' and 'protect national, homeland, and economic security'.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">While the purpose of this book is to introduce gender as a category of analysis into the discipline of international relations, the marginalization of women in the arena of foreign policy-making through the kind of gender stereotyping that I have described suggests that international politics has always been a gendered activity in the modern state system. Since foreign and military policy-making has been largely conducted by men, the discipline that analyzes these activities is bound to be primarily about men and masculinity. We seldom realize we think in these terms, however; in most fields of knowledge</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">we have become accustomed to equating what is human with what is masculine.</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Nowhere is thismore true than in international relations, a discipline that, while it has for the most part resisted the introduction of gender into its discourse, bases its assumptions and explanations almost entirely on the activities and experiences of men. Any attempt to introduce a more explicitly gendered analysis into the field must therefore begin with a discussion of masculinity. Masculinity and politics have a long and close association. Characteristics associated with "</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">manliness," such as toughness, courage, power, independence, and even physical strength, have, throughout history, been those most valued in the conduct of politics, particularly international politics</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Frequently, manliness has also been associated with violence and the use of force, a type of behavior that, when conducted in the international arena, has been valorized and applauded in the name of defending one's country. This</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">celebration of male power, particularly the glorification of the male warrior, produces more of a gender dichotomy than exists in reality</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">for, as R.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Operationalized, the evidence of patriarchy as a dysfunctional system is found in the behaviors to which it gives rise, (c), and the unmanageability, (d), which results. For example, in the United States, current estimates are that one out of every three or four women will be raped by someone she knows; globally, rape, sexual harassment, spouse-beating, and sado-masochistic pornography are examples of behaviors practiced, sanctioned, or tolerated within patriarchy. In the realm of environmentally destructive behaviors</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">, </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">strip-mining, factory farming, and pollution of the air, water, and soil are instances of behaviors maintained and sanctioned within patriarchy</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">They, too, rest on the faulty beliefs that it is okay to "rape the earth,"</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">that it is "man's God-given right" to have dominion (that is, domination) over the earth</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">that nature has only instrumental value, that environmental destruction is the acceptable price we pay for "progress."And the presumption of warism, that war is a natural, righteous, and ordinary way to impose dominion on a people or nation, goes hand in hand with patriarchy and leads to dysfunctional behaviors of nations and ultimately to international unmanageability</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Much of</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">the current" unmanageability" of contemporary life in patriarchal societies</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">, (d),</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">is</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">then viewed as</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">a consequence of a patriarchal preoccupation with activities, events, and experiences that reflect historically male-gender identified beliefs, values, attitudes, and assumptions.

In fact, it is often only through observing these dysfunctional behaviors-the symptoms of dysfunctionality that one can truly see that and how patriarchy serves to maintain and perpetuate them. When patriarchy is understood as a dysfunctional system, this "unmanageability" can be seen for what it is-as a predictable and thus logical consequence of patriarchy.'1 The theme that global environmental crises, war, and violence generally are predictable and logical consequences of sexism and patriarchal culture is pervasive in ecofeminist literature (see Russell 1989, 2). Ecofeminist Charlene Spretnak, for instance, argues that</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;"> "</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">militarism and warfare are continual features of a patriarchal society because they reflect and instill patriarchal values and fulfill needs of such a system</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Acknowledging the context of patriarchal conceptualizations that feed militarism is a first step toward reducing their impact and preserving life on Earth" (Spretnak 1989, 54). Stated in terms of the foregoing model of patriarchy as a dysfunctional social system, the claims by Spretnak and other feminists take on a clearer meaning__:__ </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Patriarchal conceptual frameworks legitimate impaired thinking (about women, national and regional conflict, the environment) which is manifested in behaviors which, if continued, will make life on earth</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">difficult, if not</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 11pt;"> impossible</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">It is a stark message, but it is plausible. Its plausibility lies in understanding the conceptual roots of various woman-nature-peace connections in regional, national, and global contexts.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">I admit it, I was skeptical when I first the buzz about the new My Little Pony show. I like a My Little Pony as much as the next fully grown woman–usually if it’s been modded to look like Star Trek’s Borg or something–but the offerings sold to young girls these days are fairly uninspiring at best, horrible at worst. It’s hard to walk through the girl’s department of a toy store without getting an eye-strain from all the pink, and even harder to imagine a spinoff shilling Hasbro’s evergreen toy series being particularly engrossing for a five year-old – let alone an adult viewer. But at the prompting of Aishwarya Subramanian, Global Comment’s resident expert on children’s literature and matters wondrous, eventually I managed to sit down to watch an episode. And what I found was a delightful, well-written, funny show with strong characters, helmed by a woman (Lauren Faust) to boot. So then I watched another episode. And then I forced my partner to watch one with me, and another, until we were finished with the first season quoting the characters (Pinkie Pie’s hissed “foreverrrr” is a particular favourite) and scanning Equestria Daily searching for fan-created works to get us through the long wait until the next season. Welcome to the herd.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__There’s a lot going on with MLP:FiM,__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">including a sizable adult male viewership (of which, more later), but </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">the most important thing</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">to me about the show</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__is__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">this:</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__it presents a world in which the normative position is female. The five main characters of the show are female,__**</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;"> as is the ruler of the show’s setting in the kingdom of Equestria, Princess Celestia. In fact,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__so many of the show’s characters are female that among the show’s fans the assumption is generally that even non-speaking characters are female–an interesting change from the default male setting that still dominates most areas of culture__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">(try mentioning your doctor and see how many times you get a “she” assumption… not many, in my experience).</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__The show offers a wide range of types of female characters–__**</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">from the conscientious scholar Twilight Sparkle, the fashion-conscious Rarity, the farmhand Applejack, the brash Rainbow Dash, the softly-spoken animal-loving Fluttershy and the hyperactive, frequently nonsensical Pinkie Pie.</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Each has her own talents, desires, and personally quirks. They’re active, not passive. Even better, many episodes demonstrate a layered, even wise, approach to character; appearances are never quite what they seem to be.</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">In “Swarm of the Century,” Pinkie Pie’s decidedly uncommon sense is dismissed by the other characters, right until she saves the day with a one-pony polka.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__And the action doesn’t centre on girl’s relation to men and boys, it primarily focuses on their friendships, their relationships with one another. Conflicts arise naturally, from misperception, selfishness, arrogance, thoughtlessness… but not by the horizontal pitting of girls against each other in__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">kyriarchical</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__narrative fighting for male approval__**. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">There’s only two minor plotlines centreing on romance – Spike the dragon’s crush on Rarity, and Rarity’s Prince Blueblood at the Grand Galloping Gala in “The Best Night Ever.” Neither is a very central storyline, and in the case of Rarity, the Prince is shown to be selfish and rude, a poor substitute for a night with her friends. There’s nothing wrong with a bit of romance in children’s stories (though I suppose it’s too much to ask a mainstream show to have canonical queer children), but there is often a disproportionate emphasis on it. In contrast,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic doesn’t just pass the Bechdel test, it shatters it__**. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">There is only one male regular character on the show, the aforementioned baby dragon Spike, and he’s relegated to a marginal sidekick kind of role. This is a clever reversal of what feminist essayist Katha Pollitt two decades ago called “the Smurfette Principle,” the way in which male characters dominate, with a lone female character rounding out the cast. Pollitt argues that: The message is clear. Boys are the norm, girls the variation; boys are central, girls peripheral; boys are individuals, girls types. Boys define the group, its story and its code of values. Girls exist only in relation to boys. Sadly, this remains as true now as it is then.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__For adults as well as children, texts in which men dominate are still largely considered “neutral,” whereas those which feature a similar female predominance are relegated to the chick-flick bin, watched only by women. The logic goes: men won’t watch shows or films about women, they can only identify with other men. Yet MLP:FiM, of all shows, puts the lie to this well-worn, if nonsensical, cultural dogma.__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">To the surprise of all concerned, MLP:FiM has managed to attract a huge adult male fanbase dubbed “bronies” </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;"> I guess I was a little behind on my Internet memes when I received an email from MomStuff listeners Regina a couple weeks ago. She wrote in to tell Caroline and me about a group of</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__“My Little Ponies Friendship Is Magic__**” </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">(“MLPFISM”)</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__fanboys collectively known as “bronies.”__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">(KnowYourMeme offers an excellent primer on how brony Internet culture started.) Considering that the “My Little Pony” franchise has been marketed to young girls since it broke out of the stables in 1982, Regina wrote that she was dubious that bronies really existed. But a visit to a bronies meet-up event proved otherwise. Regina recounted: Then I went to a brony meet up in my city after seeing it advertised on Equestria Daily, probably the biggest fan-run websites about the show. Of the attendees, 22 were male (ages 17-30) and 3 females including myself (all of us were in our early 20s**__).__**</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Having spoken to some of these male fans myself, a common theme appeared that didn’t surprise me: those who were open about their love for the show were often called gay/pansies/etc. by others.</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">As a result, some were very closeted about their fandom. For example, we went to Target, which has a lot of exclusive MLP (“My Little Pony”) merchandise. One of the male fans, excitedly purchased a pink MLP duvet for his college dorm featuring two of the unicorn characters. He said, “I know I’m going to get so much crap for this from everyone, but I want this.” In addition to extensive 4Chan posts, bronies have churned out “MLPFISM” video mash-ups, fan art and fan fiction.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Foucault (1980) envisions power as an intertwined set of shifting discursive relations among people that confine their actions and reactions in some way: “…[P]ower is essentially that which represses. Power represses nature, the instincts, a class, individuals….It has become almost automatic in the parlance of the time to define power as the organ of repression” (p. 90-91). Through discourse, hierarchies of power constantly form and reform.

Power that accumulates turns persons and institutions into monolithic, rigid entities that reify themselves to support oppression of other persons and institutions.

Foucault emphasizes that It would be a dangerous error to discount [the ‘specific’ intellectual] politically in his specific relation to a local form of power, either on the grounds that this is a specialist matter which doesn’t concern the masses (which is doubly wrong; they are already aware of it, and in any case implicated in it), or that the specific intellectual serves the interest of State or Capital (which is true, but at the same time shows the strategic position he occupies), or, again, on the grounds that he propagates a scientific ideology (which isn’t always true, and is anyway certainly a secondary matter compared with the fundamental point: the effects proper to true discourses.

First,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__the critic as an audience member locates and identifies a symbol__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">(phrase, term, object, sign) </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">that consistently appears in different narratives or narrative fragments </span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">(iterations).</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__Next, the critic uses the recurrences of the symbol to create/reveal a narrative that ostensibly dominates other narratives. Then the critic constructs one or more alternative narratives that open spaces for resistance to the dominant narrative. Finally, the critic describes the relationship between this dominant narrative and the stagnation or movement of power caused by this story__**</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">.</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;"> Through the shift in emphasis from homo narrans to homo attendens,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__audiences and rhetorical critics can critique aspects of that society and enhance it epistemologically in a self-reflexive, autonomous exercise that emphasizes their cognitive being__**. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Derrida (1982) notes: “…[T]his operation of supplementation is not exhibited as a break in presence, but rather as a reparation and a continuous, homogenous modification of presence in representation” (p. 313). </span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">When audiences and critics acknowledge that no one can escape the power structure, they can begin to use</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Foucauldian **__analysis in various ways to create a more dynamic society. They can spend fruitful time finding the actual sources of power and uncovering the relationships among the various sources of this power.__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Since no one “authoritative discourse” exists, critics must describe as many narratives as possible to enlighten other members of the society (Danaher, Schirato, & Webb, 2000, p. 77).</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__Audiences must constantly search for innovative ways to resist power.

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">And, incorporating the disparate narrative of fan culture against broader organized culture is a key narrative move against the hegemonic culture of patriarcy, Lo explains:</span>**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Lo 2001 Maps and Tracings: Fandom and Fanfiction by 2001 Malinda Lo, independent writer and researcher, focuses on fan fiction an critical cultural studies. http://malindalo.com/scully/maps.htm</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Fandom "Fandom," a very loosely bounded group of thousands of people who have diverse interests in popular culture, from comic books to pop singers, has been described as a "shadow cultural economy" with "its own systems of production and distribution...that lies outside that of the cultural industries" (Fiske 1992, 30). It is useful to conceive of fandom as a "shadow cultural economy," but it is not located "outside" of the culture industry, unless "culture industry" is defined solely in terms of corporate Hollywood. Fandom is an integral and constitutive part of the culture industry; without fans, there would be no popular culture. In addition, I do not want to imply that "fandom" is an isolated community separate from the rest of life in contemporary Western societies;</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__fandom exists within the larger society__**</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">, and there are many fans who would contest the idea that "fandom" is a "community" at all. Fandom is, however, a "shadow economy" in that</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__it produces cultural products in the liminal areas between corporate cultural production and mass consumption.__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">Deleuze and Guattari's concept of the "rhizome," which has often been used as a metaphor to describe the Internet, is a much more apt description of "fandom." Deleuze and Guattari describe the first four main principles of the rhizome as follows: 1. and 2. Connection and heterogeneity: "any point of a rhizome can be connected to anything other, and must be" (7).3. Multiplicity: "A multiplicity has neither subject nor object, only determinations, magnitudes, and dimensions that cannot increase in number without the multiplicity changing in nature" (8).4. Asignifying rupture: "A rhizome may be broken, shattered at a given spot, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new ones" (9). The popularization of the Internet as a central location for many fan cultures means that fandom--which used to exist in geographically disparate groups of fans who came together regularly for conventions--has taken on many of the characteristics of the Internet. Although many fans limit themselves to one or two fandoms (e.g., X-Philes or Trekkers), it is now quite easy to find other fandoms and engage in them via the Internet.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__A fan can easily choose to post on message boards or join mailing lists in multiple fandoms. Media fandom__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">(as opposed to sports fandom),</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__then, is a multiplicity of persons drawn together in varying configurations according to shared interests in TV, movies, comics, or novels. As the magnitudes and/or orientations of one grouping change, so does the nature of the multiplicity.__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">For example, as Buffy: The Vampire Slayer has drawn a larger fan following, several X-Files fan fiction writers have begun to shift fandoms to write in the Buffy universe. In addition,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__new writers are always emerging__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">within X-Files fandom,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__bringing with them new voices and new styles of writing. The principle of asignifying rupture as it applies to fandom is clearly discernible__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">with an example from X-Files fan fiction. The season 7 finale, "Requiem," in which Mulder was abducted by aliens, revealed that the previously-infertile Scully had mysteriously become pregnant. Thus, some fan fiction that was written pre-"Requiem" in which Scully is infertile veered into "alternate universe" (AU) with the onset of Scully's pregnancy. The canonical development of her pregnancy combined with Mulder's abduction inspired a flood of post-episode stories that dealt with these plot developments. When season 8 began, many of these stories became AU. Some authors chose to incorporate aspects of season 8 in their stories, while others who were unhappy with Scully's pregnancy chose to ignore it and write AU stories, or stories set at different points in the X-Files time line (e.g., in season 3). Fan Fiction: A Beginner's Guide</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__Fan fiction is the writing and sharing of stories written by fans featuring the characters and universe of a television show__** </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">(The X-Files), movie (Star Wars), or comic book series (The X-Men). Fan fiction writers are overwhelmingly female, middle class, and range in age from their teens well into middle age. The wide age range is likely due to the technology of the Internet, which enables diverse groups of people to interact who would not normally do so in real life.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> **__Fan fiction has been interpreted as a subversive act__**</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">--as women writing about sex while infringing on copyright law (Bacon-Smith 1992)--but women do not approach fan fiction with the goal of breaking the law; fan fiction is seductive to so many fans because it offers the freedom to manipulate favorite characters and settings, free from the restraint of publishers or the series' creators (Green et al. 1998). </span>
