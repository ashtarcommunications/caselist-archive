==Conention 1: Warming Advantage== 

1. Global warming is real and human induced – top climate scientists agree
**<span class="cite">__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Anderegg et al 10</span>__</span>** – PhD Candidate @ Stanford in Biology
William, “Expert credibility in climate change,” National Academy of Sciences, p. 12107-12109

2. Climate Change is worsening-already causes 150,000 deaths per year- 97 percent of scientists agree

He is the winner of numerous journalism awards, including the National Journalism Award for environment reporting in 2007 from the Scripps Foundation and the Outstanding Beat Reporting award from the Society of Environmental Journalists in 2008 and 2004, September 23 2012, ”WHY IT MATTERS:Global warming”, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120923/us-why-it-matters-climate-change/, D.K.)

3. Warming is real, anthropogenic, and by far the largest risk of extinction

===Impact Scenarios=== 

===Scenario 1: Beetles=== 

1. Warmer Temperatures increases bark beetles which causes further increase in temperatures
__**San Francisco Chronicle 2009**__

2. EXTINCTION
**<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">__<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Tickell 08</span>__</span>**[Oliver, “On a planet 4C hotter, all we can prepare for is extinction"]

===**Scenario 2: Oxygen Loss**===

===<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Scenario 3: Ocean Acidification</span>=== 

1. Warming leads to ocean acidification – kills marine life and ecosystems

2. Ocean acidification causes extinction- death of bottom of the food chain

==Plan== 

===Plan: The United States federal government should invest in a national CO2 sequestration pipeline infrastructure for the purposes of carbon capture and storage.=== 

==Solvency== 

1. Without the federal government the pipelines can’t get built

==<span style="font-size: 20px;">No War</span>== 

1. No war – no benefits, rising costs, democracies, common security, clear power divisions make escalation unlikely
