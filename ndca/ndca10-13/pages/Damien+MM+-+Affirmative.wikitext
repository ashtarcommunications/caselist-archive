**Contention One: Hegemony**

**Weaponization inevitable—vulnerability of assets combined with ease of access to ASAT technology**
Brown 2009 (Trevor, MSc, S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University, contributor to Air and Space Power Journal, “Soft Power and Space Weaponization” http://www.airpower.au.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj09/spr09/brown.html#brown]
Perhaps there remains a belief in the US strategic … with the requisite political skill in order to retain soft power while expanding hard power.

**Space race inevitable—even if we are dominant now, Russia, China, India and Japan all are advancing**

Although the United States …whether or not the United States moves forward in space, other countries will do so.

**The ONLY OPTION is for the US to weaponize space and now is key—only way to stop an arms race and maintain hegemony**

This is the context in which the world …weapons first—at least for the next few years—is remote.

**China is intent on taking over Earth by establishing military dominance in space- only the creation of a US Space Force can stop this by taking us beyond hegemony- American power will be invincible and eternal, guaranteeing world peace and ending terrorism- forever.**
Yoshida, B.C. Director of the Freedom Institute, Author of The Nothern Abyss, Noted Political Commentator, Columnist for the Greenwich Village Gazette, 2003 (Adam, Oct 10th, “Red China Shooting for the Moon”, Freedom Institute Magazine, http://www.adamyoshida.com/2003_10_01_archive.html )
If all goes according to plan on October … must be stopped. Everything that will follow depends upon it.

**Maintaining those assets alongside weaponry is key to overall US tech leadership—that’s independently key to heg**
Dolman and Cooper 11 (Everett, PhD and Professor of Comparative Military Studies @ US Air Force School of Advanced Air and Space Studies and Recipient of Central Intelligence’s Outstanding Intelligence Analyst Award, and Henry, Former Deputy for the Strategic and Space Systems of the DOD and Chairman of High Fronteir, a non-profit organization studying issues of missile defense and space, “Chapter 19: Increasing the Military Uses of Space,” Part of “Toward a Theory of Spacepower,” Edited by Charles Lutes and Peter Hays, National Defense University Press, http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf)
Space weapons are expensive; alternatives are …, it willlikelylose its preeminence.

**Heg is good**
Zhang and Shi 2011 (Yuhan, is a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, D.C.; Lin, independent consultant for the Eurasia Group and a consultant for the World Bank in Washington, D.C. (America’s decline: A harbinger of conflict and rivalry, http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/01/22/americas-decline-a-harbinger-of-conflict-and-rivalry/)
This does not necessarily mean … is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy.

**Even if hegemonic decline is inevitable, plan prevents transition wars**
Dolman 2006 (Everett, PhD and Professor of Comparative Military Studies @ US Air Force School of Advanced Air and Space Studies and Recipient of Central Intelligence’s Outstanding Intelligence Analyst Award, “ Toward a U.S. Grand Strategy in Space,” March 10th, Washington Roundtable on Science and Public Policy, http://www.marshall.org/article.php?id=408)
Dolman: Well, I think that some assumptions … where there is a power to create and enforce some sort of order.


**Contention Two: China**

**Weaponization and subversion of U.S. space dominance is China’s goal—uncertainty means escalation is imminent**
Cheng 7-16-2011 (Dean, Research Fellow, Asian Studies Center, “China’s Space Program: A Growing Factor in U.S. Security Planning”)
The divergence of views on how to … Toward these ends, the U.S. government should:

**None of your evidence applies—China doesn’t consider their asymmetric ASAT capabilities weapons but the threshold has already been crossed**
Houpt 8-9-2011 [Danny, Editor of Security Studies Online, article is peer-reviewed “Discerning China’s Unstated Definition of the ‘Weaponization of Space” http://securitystudiesonline.com/2011/08/09/discerning-chinas-unstated-definition-of-the-weaponization-of-space/]
The Chinese definition of the … sure to be a long and complicated coexistence in outer space.

**The risk of crisis instability and miscalculation in space is high – the PLA is likely to initiate an attack in a crisis**
MacDonald, 11 - Senior Director, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program, U.S. Institute of Peace (Bruce, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA”, 5/11, lexis)
One characteristic of too many wars … in a crisis, but the potential for space instability seems high and likely to grow.

**History proves that realists are right about the inevitability of a space race with China—both sides want the military and economic benefits**
Dolman 2010 (Everett, PhD and Professor of Comparative Military Studies @ US Air Force School of Advanced Air and Space Studies and Recipient of Central Intelligence’s Outstanding Intelligence Analyst Award, “The Case for Weapons in Space: A Geopolitical Assessment,” September, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1532576)
The coming war with China will …no-fly zone. Both sides will engage and destroy any and all satellites within range, cheaply and effectively.

**The impact is US-Sino nuclear war over Taiwan**
Lewis 2004 (Jeffrey, postdoctoral fellow in the Advanced Methods of Cooperative Security Program @ the Center for Inter- national and Security Studies at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, “What if Space Were Weaponized?” http://www.cdi.org/PDFs/scenarios.pdf]
Not surprisingly, the Pentagon is extremely worried … – that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.”29

**Any of satellites causes escalation to spiral out of control—most likely scenario for great power war**
Easton 2009 (Ian, specialist in Chinese aeronautics at the Washington-based Project 2049 Institute, “The Great Game in Space” http://project2049.net/documents/china_asat_weapons_the_great_game_in_space.pdf
Any possible U.S. military contingency … shift towards fielding ASAT weapons could have.

**China will escalate the conflict—perception of rational escalation ensures US gets drawn into a broader nuclear conflict**
Glaser 2011 (Charles, Political Science Professor @ George Washington University, March/April, “Will China’s Rise Lead to War?” Foreign Affairs, Vol. 90 Issue 2, EbscoHost)
The prospects for avoiding intense military competition …general poisoning of U.S.-Chinese relations.

**Plan: The United States Department of Defense should develop and deploy microsatellites tasked with inspection, surveillance, maintenance, protection, and propulsion capabilities to facilitate a Parasitic Attitude Control System.**


**Contention 3: Solvency**

**The best covert seizure of space would be deployment of micro-satellites in the form of a Parasitic Attitude Control System to hack and dismantle enemy capabilities without debris or negative perception**
Page 2006 (Joseph, Assistant flight commander and ICBM combat crew commander (Squadron Command Post) at the 741st Missile Squadron, 91st Space Wing, Minor AFB, North Dakota, “Stealing Zeus's Thunder” Air & Space Power Journal Summer 2006 pg. 29-31)
The idea of covertly supplanting a satellite's …enemy satellites withoutnecessarilyobliterating them

**Even if it was detected, PACS renders countermeasures or escalation pointless**
Klein 2006 [Commander John - United States Navy, Space Warfare: Strategy, Principles and Policy (Space Power and Politics) Pg. 77]
Perhaps the best defensive position is … taking advantage of the benefits coming from defensive strategy.

**And, PACS is the most effective microsat technology—cohesive with anti-ASAT capabilities and easily developed**
Page 2006 (Joseph, Assistant flight commander and ICBM combat crew commander (Squadron Command Post) at the 741st Missile Squadron, 91st Space Wing, Minor AFB, North Dakota, “Stealing Zeus's Thunder” Air & Space Power Journal Summer 2006 pg. 27-28)
If the United States were able to develop a means of …extraordinary capability in the realm of space control and space warfare.

**Microsat defense systems are the best and ONLY way to protect current satellites and stay covert until necessary**
Schendzielos 2008 (Kurt, Director, 13th Air Force Commander's Action Group at US Air Force, “Protection in Space: A Self-Defense Acquisition Priority for U.S. Satellites” http://dodreports.com/pdf/ada485553.pdf
An inherent advantage of microsats and … to be added once the satellite is orbiting.
