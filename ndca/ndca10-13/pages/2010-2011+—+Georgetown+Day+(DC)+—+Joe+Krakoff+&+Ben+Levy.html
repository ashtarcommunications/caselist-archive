<span style="color: black;">In surprisingly candid remarks Thursday, <u>Kim Jong-un, heir apparent to North Korea's highest government post, expressed doubt that he was sufficiently out of his mind to succeed his father</u>, longtime dictator Kim Jong-il.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">While <u>emphasizing that he was definitely completely insane and would likely be even less stable by the time he assumed power, the younger Kim nevertheless wondered if he could ever be enough of a lunatic</u> to replace the most unhinged leader on the planet. &quot;Obviously, I know I was handpicked because I'm super crazy,&quot; said Kim, the youngest of the 69-year-old dictator's four known children. &quot;But my father's just so great at what he does. Did you know the people of North Korea have heard his voice exactly once, for like five seconds? How nuts is that? Honestly, I look at stuff like that and I think, <u>'Wow, there's just no way I can ever top Dad.'&quot;</u> &quot;<u>We're talking about a world-class nutjob here,&quot; he added.</u> Kim told reporters that since emerging as the presumptive next-in-line to lead North Korea, <u>he had spent countless hours trying to come up with his own brand of craziness that would honor the tradition set forth by his father and grandfather</u>, Kim Il-sung, but would also set him apart. After discovering that many of his best ideas had already been taken by his father—including making citizens bow toward wall-sized portraits of himself or claiming to be a demigod whose moods directly influence the weather—Kim admitted he had grown frustrated. &quot;At this point, <u>I'm not sure what's left for me to do, really,&quot;</u> he said. &quot;I mean, according to the Ministry of Information, <u>Dad hit 11 holes-in-one the first time he ever played golf. I'm dead serious. Dad had never even picked up a golf club before, and he hit 38 under par.</u> Where am I supposed to go from there? <u>I guess I can say I ran a marathon in 20 minutes, but isn't that pretty much the same thing?&quot;</u> &quot;It is the same thing, isn't it?&quot; Kim added. &quot;Ugh.&quot; <u>Kim</u>, who in his rare public appearances wears a plain dark suit, said <u>he ultimately hoped to cultivate an eccentric,</u> yet <u>vaguely sinister look</u> as iconic as his father's pompadour, drab parka, and sunglasses, <u>perhaps something &quot;even nuttier&quot; involving canes, a large yellow raincoat, or possibly a motorized scooter.</u> Other ideas Kim has had for proving his insanity include placing anyone shorter than himself under permanent house arrest, issuing a new national currency every 90 days, normalizing relations with South Korea, and replacing all medicines with synthetic replications of his own saliva. &quot;Of course, <u>I have to be careful not to come off as too crazy, because then it would just feel forced and no one would buy it,</u>&quot; said Kim, noting that he was working on some slogans that North Korean schoolchildren would be forced to chant three times daily. &quot;Then again, maybe having it come off as forced would make me seem even crazier, because what kind of a maniac would go to such lengths to outdo his father? Right? Or is that just a cop-out?&quot; Although Kim's birthday is already recognized as a national holiday and any criticism of him is punishable by indefinite sentences in re-education camps, Kim suggested that the stress of living up to his father's insanity had been taking a toll. <u>&quot;I can't even enjoy the things I used to love, like forcing starving people to perform a five-hour dance routine in my honor, because I spend the whole time obsessing over whether I'm being wacko enough</u>,&quot; Kim admitted. &quot;That's what's so special about Dad, you know: He never worries about all that stuff, he just acts like himself. What can I say? The old man set the loony bar pretty high.&quot; <u>When asked if he planned to consult the elder Kim for advice, the future leader said that while his father would almost certainly have valuable insights, the man was far too crazy for even a lunatic like himself to speak to.</u> <u>&quot;But I've got to prove myself to him somehow,&quot; Kim said. &quot;He'll kill me if I don't.&quot;</u></span><br />

<span style="color: black;">Following the end of the Cold War in 1991, <u>some scholars in the West began to predict that Asia was “ripe for rivalry</u>.”12 <u>They based this prediction on the fol- lowing factors: wide disparities in the levels of economic and military power among nations in the region</u>; their <u>different political systems</u>, ranging from democratic to totalitarian; historical animosities; and the lack of international institutions. Many <u>scholars</u> thus <u>envisaged a return of power politics</u> after de- cades when conoict in Asia was dominated by the Cold War tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. In addition, <u>scholars envisaged a re- turn of arms racing and the possibility of major conflict</u> among Asian coun- tries, almost all of which had rapidly changing internal and external environments. More <u>specific predictions included the growing possibility of Japanese rearmament</u>;13 increased <u>Chinese adventurism</u> spurred by China’s rising power and ostensibly revisionist intentions;14 <u>conflict</u> or war <u>over</u> the status of <u>Taiwan;</u>15 terrorist <u>or</u> <u>missile attacks from</u> a rogue <u>North Korea</u> against South Korea, Japan, or even the United States;16 and arms racing or even conoict in Southeast Asia, prompted in part by unresolved territorial disputes.17 <u>More than a dozen years have passed since the end of the Cold War, yet none of these pessimistic predictions have come to pass</u><strong>.</strong> Indeed there has not been a major war in Asia since the 1978–79 Vietnam-Cambodia-China conoict; and with only a few exceptions (North Korea and Taiwan), <u>Asian countries do not fear for their survival</u>. <u>Japan</u>, though powerful, <u>has not rearmed to the extent it could</u>. <u>China seems no more revisionist or adventurous now than it was before the end of the Cold War</u>. And no Asian country appears to be balancing against China. In contrast to the period 1950–80, the past two decades have witnessed enduring regional stability and minimal conoict. Scholars should directly confront these anomalies, rather than dismissing them. Social scientists can learn as much from events that do not occur as from those that do. <u>The case of Asian security provides an opportunity to examine the usefulness of accepted international relations paradigms and to determine how the assumptions underlying these theories can become misspeciaed</u>. Some scholars have smuggled ancillary and ad hoc hypotheses about prefer- ences into realist, institutionalist, and constructivist theories to make them at various aspects of the Asian cases, including: assumptions about an irrational North Korean leadership, predictions of an expansionist and revisionist China, and depictions of Japanese foreign policy as “abnormal.”18 Social science moves forward from the clear statement of a theory, its causal logic, and its predictions. Just as important, however, is the rigorous assessment of the the- ory, especially if predictions oowing from it fail to materialize. <strong><u>Exploring why scholars have misunderstood Asia is both a fruitful and a necessary theoretical exercise.</u></strong> Two major problems exist with many of the pessimistic predictions about Asia. First, <u>when confronted with the nonbalancing of Asian states against China, the lack of Japanese rearmament, and ave decades of noninvasion by North Korea, scholars typically respond: Just wait.</u> <u>This reply</u>, however, is intellectually ambiguous. Although it would be unfair to expect instantaneous na- tional responses to changing international conditions, <u>a dozen years would seem to be long enough to detect at least some change.</u> Indeed Asian nations have historically shown an ability to respond quickly to changing circum- stances. The Meiji restoration in Japan in 1868 was a remarkable example of governmental response to European and American encroachment, and by 1874 Japan had emerged from centuries of isolation to occupy Taiwan.19 More recently, with the introduction of market reforms in late 1978, when Deng Xiaoping famously declared, “To get rich is glorious,” the Chinese have trans- formed themselves from diehard socialists to exuberant capitalists beginning less than three years after Mao’s death in 1976.20 <u>In the absence of a specific time frame, the “just wait” response is un-falsifiable</u>. Providing a causal logic that explains how and when scholars can expect changes is an important as- pect of this response, and reasonable scholars will accept that change may not be immediate but may occur over time. <u>Without such a time frame</u>, however, <u>the “just wait” response is mere rhetorical wordplay designed to avoid troubling evidence.</u></span><br />

<span style="color: black;">According to sources at the Pentagon, <u>American quagmire-building efforts continued apace in Afghanistan this week</u>, as the <u>geographically rugged, politically unstable region remained ungovernable, death tolls continued to rise, and the grim military campaign persisted as hopelessly as ever</u>. In fact, many government officials now believe that <u>the United States and its allies could be as little as six months away from their ultimate goal: the total quagmirification of Afghanistan.</u> &quot;We've spent a lot of time and money fostering the turmoil and despair necessary to make this a sustaining quagmire, and we're not going to stop now,&quot; President Barack Obama said in a national address Monday night. &quot;It won't be easy, but with enough tactical errors on the ground, shortsighted political strategies, and continued ignorance of our vast cultural differences, we could have a horrific, full-fledged quagmire by 2012.&quot; <u>Added Obama, &quot;Together, we can make Afghanistan into a nightmarish hell-scape Americans will regret for generations to come.&quot;</u> <u>The U.S. plan to build a lasting quagmire in Afghanistan calls for the loss of at least 5,000 coalition troops, nearly 1,500 of whom have already been killed, and a wasted investment of nearly $1 trillion, a quarter of which has thus far been spent.</u> With more than 80 percent of the country currently under Taliban control, Defense Secretary Robert <u>Gates argued that U.S. nation-dismantling efforts are actually proceeding ahead of schedule.</u> <u>&quot;We've made a complete mess of local institutions, and moving forward this substantial lack of infrastructure will be the cornerstone of our strategy to ensure long-term chaos in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region,</u>&quot; said Gates, gesturing to a complex, 6-foot-tall wall map of what were either newly established al-Qaeda bases in Waziristan, tribal trade routes over the Hindu Kush, or perhaps U.S. military outposts of some kind. &quot;<u>I couldn't be happier with our progress. This place is a complete clusterfuck.&quot;</u> <u>A number of Pentagon officials said they were proudly holding on to their false glimmer of hope for a victory that remains forever out of reach, and explained that waging a war that can only end in sorrow has validated all their efforts</u>. The U.S. effort in Afghanistan hasn't always looked so bleak. In 2004, when Afghanistan ratified a new constitution and directly elected a leader for the first time in its history, a number of government officials feared the quagmire would fail and perhaps even lead to relative peace and security. But American military and diplomatic initiatives to prop up the corrupt regime of Hamid Karzai paved the way for this year's utterly fraudulent presidential election, an event which gave the quagmire-building effort a much needed shot in the arm. &quot;<u>Some say the war in Afghanistan is already a quagmire, being as it's gone on for eight years and the situation on the ground continues to rapidly deteriorate,&quot;</u> said Gen. Stanley McChrystal. &quot;<u>But I know we can do better. There are still dozens of tribal allies to alienate, troop morale could sink even lower, to the point of mutiny, and by continuing to fire a bunch of missiles from unmanned predator drones we have the opportunity to scare the living shit out of every last civilian in the region.</u>&quot; Continued McChrystal, &quot;<u>If we play our cards right, the word 'Afghanistan' could soon replace the word 'Iraq' as the agreed-upon successor to the word 'Vietnam' in the American political lexicon.&quot;</u> The loose network of warlords who rule the Afghan countryside were also optimistic about quagmire-building efforts. &quot;Our nation is already impossibly fragmented, but I believe the United States has the ability to make things even worse here,&quot; said a local tribal leader, who asked to speak anonymously due to his constantly shifting alliances with the two sides. &quot;Afghanistan has a proud, ancient tradition of quagmires: Soviet Russia, the British Empire, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan. These are big shoes to fill, but if anyone can do it, these foolish Americans can.&quot; With President Karzai's government maintaining ties to known drug traffickers, and 68,000 U.S. soldiers struggling to police a harsh, challenging landscape, <u>all the conditions for a multigenerational quagmire seem to be in place.</u> For many analysts, the question now is: <u>How will Obama ensure the U.S. entanglement in the region remains permanent?</u> By deploying more troops, <u>by withdrawing them and leaving behind an unspeakable disaster, by increasing sympathy for the Taliban in nuclear-armed Pakistan? There are so many options on the table that many feel a quagmire is virtually guaranteed.</u> &quot;We have so much to thank the Americans for,&quot; said Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim, a notorious warlord who will become vice president if Karzai wins a runoff election scheduled for Nov. 7. &quot;<u>Not only have they created a lawless environment that has allowed us to capture 90 percent of the opium market, but their heroin habits have made a few of us very rich.&quot;</u> <u>&quot;I love the Americans and I hope they stay for many years,&quot;</u> he added. &quot;<u>Many, many, many, many years.&quot;</u> </span><br />

And so we fear, transforming our mass uneasiness into nationalistic and patriotic fervor, wrapping ourselves up in the flag and the Military Industrial Complex. We have fallen into the mouse trap, becoming the subservient slaves of an engine run by greed, interested not in peace but constant war, constant killing and constant sacrifice to the almighty dollar. Brainwashed to believe that War is Peace we sound the drums of war, marching our sons and daughters to a battle that cannot be won either by sword or gun. </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">We are programmed to see the world as a conflict between &quot;Us&quot; versus &quot;Them&quot;, &quot;Good&quot; versus &quot;Evil,&quot; that we must inflict death on those who are not with us and on those against us.</span></u><span style="color: black;"> The MIC prays on our human emotions and psychology, exploiting human nature and our still fragile memories of the horrors of 9/11, manipulating us to believe that what they say and do is right for us all. <u>We unite behind one common enemy</u></span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">, fearing for our lives, complacent and obedient, blindly descending like a plague of locusts onto foreign land, devastating, usurping, </span></u><u><span style="color: black;">conquering and devouring those who have been deemed enemies of the state</span></u><u><span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">, those who harbor and live among them, &quot;evil ones,&quot; &quot;evildoers&quot; and &quot;haters of </span></u><u><span style="color: black;">freedom,&quot; all for the sake of</span></u> <u><span style="color: black;">profit and pillage, ideology and empire</span></u><u><span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">.</span></u><span style="color: black;"> Power unfettered and unleashed, our freedoms die and are released <u>The so-called &quot;War on Terror&quot; is but a charade, a fear-engendering escapade, designed to last into perpetuity</u>, helping guarantee that the Military Industrial Complex will grow exponentially in power. It is a replacement for a Cold War long ago since retired and unable to deliver a massive increase in defense spending. Terrorists and the countries that harbor them have replaced the Soviet Union and Communists as enemy number one. </span><u><span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">With a war that may go on indefinitely, </span></u><u><span style="color: black;">pursuing an enemy that lives in shadows and in the haze of ambiguity, the MIC will grow ever more powerful</span></u><u><span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">, conscripting hundreds of thousands of our youth, sending them to guide, operate and unleash their products of death.</span></u><span style="color: black;"> Rumblings of bringing back the draft are growing louder, and if you think your children and grandchildren will escape it, think again. In a war without end, in battles that do not cease, the MIC will need human flesh from which to recycle those who perish and fall wounded. Empire building needs bodies and drones to go with military might, instruments of death need trigger fingers and human brains, and, with so many expendable young men and women being conditioned in this so-called &quot;war on terror,&quot; MIC will continue its reprogramming of citizen soldiers from peaceful civilians to warmongering killing machines. After all, &quot;War is Peace.&quot; Yet the Department of War, ever steadfast to use its weaponry, fails to realize that no amount of money will win this war if the root causes of terrorism are not confronted as priority number one.

<u><span style="color: black;">The militarization of knowledge is found in its pure form in the university</span></u><span style="color: black;">. <u>Militarized knowledge is a way of knowing the world and relationships between humans, characterized by an acceptance and promotion of violence and war.</u> In militarized society <u>we come to know the world and our fellow humans in terms of the hostile other</u>. <u>Other nations become enemies. Other peoples become dehumanized</u>. <u>The world becomes possess-able if we are strong enough</u>, disposable if we so choose. Militarized knowl- edge adopts a worldview of force not understanding, violence not peace. <u>Militarized society relies on knowledge to create technological solutions to our problems and con- flicts.</u> This is always <u>at the expense of</u> humanistic knowledge – the <u>ways of knowing and relating to the world which find solutions in peace and organization, not violence and quantity.</u> Because universities are at the center of knowledge creation in our society, <u>we find our institutions of higher learning imbued with violence</u>. The <u>militarization of univer- sities leads to a spiraling effect further strengthening the forces of war</u>. <u>Militarized universities produce</u>: mil- itary technologies including – <u>new weapons,</u> warfare systems, <u>ways of thought and organization distinct to the goals of coercion and force, and the per- manent technological revolution of warfare itself.</u> Universities in service of the warfare state <u>also produce the human resources demanded by the militarized society</u>. Universities churn out the politi- cians, technocrats, bureaucrats, and skilled work- ers demanded by the society which so dili- gently produces and executes the means of destruction. These graduates, having learned about the world, its society, and applied sciences through the lens of warfare go forth and <u>recreate this calamity.</u> The <u>future politicians will lead the nation into future wars, and the future engineers will construct future combat systems, while we all obey and simply &quot;do our jobs</u>.&quot; <u>The system further entrenches itself, war begets war,</u> the <u>institutions of knowledge produce destruction at the expense of creation.</u> The <u>technologies meant to banish war as unimaginabley destructive, and obsolete have only accomplished the former</u>. New tech- nologies meant to make war more humane, and conductable have only accomplished the latter.</span><br />

<span style="color: black;">Giroux suggests that <u>those working in the “hypermodern militarized knowledge factories”</u> (p. 74) <u>should ask a number of critical and “uncomfortable” questions:</u> “<u>What role do intellectuals play in the conditions that allow theory and knowledge to be appropriated</u> […in ways <u>that]</u> produce lethal weapons, <u>fuel an arms race…and corrupt ethical standards</u>…and <u>what can they do politically to prevent</u> […<u>their work] from being militarized</u>…?” And crucially, how do opposition and resistance to militarization in the academy “connect to [public intellectual] work and extend [students’ and teachers’] sense of social and political responsibility to the world outside of the academy?” <u>One vital task for intellectuals is to employ critical pedagogical practices that promote ethical citizenship, encourage a</u> willingness to take risks and responsibilities for a <u>more substantive democracy</u>, <u>and “connect knowledge and power in the interests of social responsibility and justice</u>.” (pp. 57-58) Giroux’s The University in Chains, is an intellectually rigorous and politically challenging contribution to our understanding of US culture, US politics and US education in our increasingly (and dangerously) militarized society and world, and a careful examination of the ways in which the capitalist market, the Pentagon-system, and right-wing fundamentalism corrupt and condition the academy and culture. The University in Chains is a stunning tour-de-force that meticulously examines how the multi-tiered and interpenetrating <u>military</u>, corporate, and right-wing <u>assaults on the university undermine higher education as a potentially and necessary democratic public sphere in which students</u> and teachers could, and <u>should, develop a sense of individual and social agency</u> in the context of experiencing meaningful democratic social relations <u>while identifying, critiquing, and working to overcome authoritarian forms of power and authority.</u></span><br />

<span style="color: black;">Finally, another piece of the puzzle about <u>why activists would choose to speak ironically has to do with their positioning vis-à-vis the mass media and their potential audience</u>. These <u>groups are attempting to capture attention that has not already been granted them, often the attention of both passersby and of the news media.</u> Thus, for all of the groups, <u>entertainment value is key to the success of their actions,</u> as, at the very least, it assures they will be noticed. For this reason<u>, the potential pleasure that particular stunts may afford their viewers is a key concern in their design, a pleasure often conceptualized in opposition to the potential displeasure of the straightforwardly didactic.</u> Of course, the ironic forms of play surveyed here are not, by any stretch of the imagination, the only type of activism operating today, nor are they the only type necessary to effect social change. However, they have taken on a much more significant and privileged role within activism in recent years. This shift is certainly linked to a more general upsurge of focus on culture within activist communities, meaning that it is no longer an area considered peripheral to the work of organizing, letter writing, or marching. Addressing this larger phenomenon, Stephen Duncombe explains that <u>culture, both as entertainment and information, is one of the leading sectors of the economy, so that “the idea of a performed cultural world seems second nature to us. Add into this mix the Internet, the virtual world of signs and symbols where an increasing amount of our everyday life takes place, and it’s no surprise that activism has embraced culture. Activists have become cultural guerrillas</u> <u>because this is the terrain of the battles they fight”</u> (Cultural 333). Today’s <u>activists are often savvy cultural producers as well as consumers</u>. And it is within this larger context that <u>irony has come to the fore as a type of counter-cultural dominant.</u> Drawing strategically from past performative activist groups such as The Situationists, The Yippies, and ACT UP, the contemporary groups emphasize Do-It-Yourself (DIY) activism and “viral” protest models that are creative and accessible. <u>The ironic hook can be easily picked up and replicated, used to stoke allegiances and, ideally, to shift the direction of wider public debate.</u> </span><br />

<u><span style="color: black;">Pedagogical “hinges” refer to those aspects of spaces of learning that make them pedagogically powerful.</span></u><span style="color: black;"> More specifically, <u>the “hinge” refers to some aspect of pedagogy that puts “inside and outside, self and other, personal and social into relation</u>” (Ellsworth, 2005, p. 38). Pedagogy’s <u>hinges create possibilities for</u> both inside and outside—self and <u>society—to be disrupted and refigured.</u> We believe <u>an important pedagogical moment—culture jamming’s pedagogical hinge—occurs when audience members as learners experience détournement</u> (literally, <u>a “turning around</u>”). All of the <u>peda- gogical tactics used in culture jamming attempt to lead the learner to a moment of détournement</u>, where she is no longer who she used to be, but rather is caught off guard by the possibility of becoming someone or something different. Lasn (1999) argues that <u>culture jamming helps provide a new way of looking at the world, and describes this détournement as “a perspective-jarring turnabout in your everyday life</u>” (p. xvii). <u>Through moments of détournement, culture jammers seek to move audience members away from scripted “spectacle-driven” experiences through igniting authenticity</u>. As one culture jammer writing in Adbusters stated, “<u>Is your life a project? Do you give a shit about anything? Can you still get angry? Be spontaneous?</u>” (Unattributed artist, 2003). Lasn (1999) also describes how <u>détournement can provide people with new, more authentic choices about how to live and how to be</u>: You are—<u>everyone is</u>—a creator of situations, <u>a performance artist, and the performance, of course, is your life, lived in your own way</u>. . . . Many times a day, <u>each of us comes to a little fork in the path</u>. <u>We can then do one of two things: act the way we normally, reflexively act, or do something a little risky and wild, but genuine.</u> (p. 100)</span><br />

<strong>Piradical Politics 1ac</strong><br />
<strong>We are at a crossroads in history. On one hand, we have an opportunity to fundamentally shake our understandings of politics, international relations, and our understanding of the other, those outside of Western narratives about humanity. Our occupation of the Middle East is not the first time we have come to this point; we were in the same place during Vietnam. When we left Vietnam, activists wasted the opportunity, allowing politicians to rewrite history and manipulate our understanding of Vietnam such that it was in our political interest, further consolidating Western-centric domination.</strong><br />
<strong>The same thing is happening in Iraq: we all should have known that this invasion would fail miserably, but we did it anyways.</strong><br />

The strategy the US ... course, sacrificed far more.<br />
<br />
<strong>With the collapse of the façade of the power of the West in Iraq, we have this unique opportunity again, but state forces, in and outside of debate, continue to re-appropriate the opportunity, demanding instead that it is in our military-hegemonic interest to withdraw, as an act to preserve power. If this is the understanding we have of the West’s wars, we’re doomed to repeat ourselves. If we understand that, really, we’re getting our asses kicked and no one wants us in Iraq other than our own egos, then we can actually break the stranglehold of Orientalism.</strong><br />

<strong>The mechanism of identifying certain populations as targets is part and parcel with Western scientific systems of knowledge production that both enabled every major war in the 21st century and guarantee continued violence against all other cultures by positioning these populations as others, barbarians, and ... <em>pirates</em>.</strong><br />

In the decades since 1945 ... problem of the vanishing object.”<br />
<br />
<strong>The problem is that we’ve been looking at this topic and this conflict from a reactive position. Asking “how can we get out of Iraq so as to save face for the West is synonymous?” with “how can we defend the resolution so as to get our hegemony advantages?” These epistemological constraints we’ve placed on ourselves will fail to rid us of imperialism and, more importantly, are preventing us from formulating active principles of resistance against imperialism.</strong><br />
<strong>Well, no longer – we are an active call for civil resistance, we are taking this space and smoothing it out, making it a place of freedom and a safehaven for a discussion of how to truly live. We understand this act through a metaphor of piracy – fleeing from oppressive statist forces in order to live freely, and to enjoy life. We are here to negotiate our own principles and establish our own codes in order to both engage with the topic and address the root problem with presence in Iraq and THROUGHOUT the world. We must engage AS pirates to defeat the structures generating Western narratives about the rest of the world.</strong><br />

 <strong>This debate round is practice for war-planning and the role of the ballot should be to arbitrate between methodologies for creating military doctrine. The counterplan creates a framework for changing doctrine that is responsive to changing battlefield conditions, historical experience and the development of new technological innovations. THE COUNTERPLAN IMMEDIATELY RESULTS IN THE PLAN, if the 1AC is correct that the plan is the proper response to current geopolitical conditions HOWEVER it allows for the possibility of minor modification and future rollback in response to unknown long-term developments in which the rigorous criteria of adaptive doctrinal shift are met, including empirical evidence and verification, field testing of weapons systems in simulations and training exercises and intellectual testing by academic at military service academies. Our net-benefit is dogmatism- trading one inadaptive doctrine for another means that the structural problems of mission creep, overlap and resource allocation are inevitable with the development of new technology and focus on new areas of the world making all of their scenarios inevitable. ONLY the counterplan facilitates effective force structure that allows us to learn from our mistakes which means that effective implementation is a DA to the plan and a net-benefit to the counterplan. Inflexible and untested doctrine guarantees disaster and loss of life</strong><br />

The second thing that ... uncompromising realities of battle.<br />
<br />
<strong>Our counterplan begs the question of 1AC solvency—by establishing an enduring and permanent doctrinal change in response to ephemeral circumstances the plan’s status as a good idea is highly contingent. The question of the debate is not ‘will there ever be a need for nuclear missions for X weapons system’ but rather ‘is it a good policy-making METHOD’ to formulate doctrine around the presumption that doctrine should NOT be adaptive to changing circumstances. They do not have a defense of inadaptive doctrinal changes which means they can’t win offense against the counterplan</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Doctrine is crucial to mission success-- it specifies the appropriate mechanics of addressing a problem and must be based on rigorous empirical methodologies to yield successful outcomes</strong><br />

Power sharing would be easier under a decentralized democracy... reasonable chance of balancing interests and adjudicating disputes in Afghanistan, too.<br />

<strong>Success in Afghanistan means creating a decentralized government that would be acceptable to security interests.

<strong>This is not like most kritiks and its logic does not suggest a course of action or posit some utopian future of thought. From the position of the empiricist, you should not be concerned with the future or the past as these are only historical constructions which are themselves hostages of larger ideological systems. As an empiricist, your business is the present, the flows of matter an energy, the beauty of self-organized material into cycles of creation and destruction that inspire one another. Lose yourself in these fluxes of material and let them strip away what you thought you knew about reality and about policy debate. Don’t make interpretations, predictions or good guesses as if the future can be measured or estimated—your best guess is less accurate than trying to figure out how many jelly beans fill a jar that know one has ever seen. Instead you should experiment, rigorously define your terms and their relations and let your approach be fluid.

 <strong>Throughout this debate, you should evaluate both team’s speech acts through the important lens of the axiom that POWER IS FLUID. Power is always changing, reconstituted in accordance with specific social situations and according to cultural conditions. Each time we interact, new and different power relations are reconstituted.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In this light, their 1ac is a double turn: they have proven that whiteness, like power, is fluid and always changing and reconstituting itself in new strategies to continue its supremacy. The 1ac goes on to isolate fixed and specific instances of whiteness—this practice locks us into political stasis through stable identities, which ultimately debilitate difference.</strong><br />

<br />
Even power, that favourite ... but so are the powerful.<br />
<br />
<strong>Positioning personal experience as a justification for action creates a insulation from reevaluation--“You can’t criticize how I felt!” This process prevents criticism of the status quo, which can be rendered as purely subjective—“That’s only your experience, it can’t be applied to larger structural problems of social organization.” Vote negative to affirm criticism of ANY identity categories.</strong><br />

<strong>They present difference through the lens of stable identity tropes, which are the product of majoritarian thought. Rather than fluid, they see identity as terretorialized in cultural practices and norms, dooming their project as they are subsumed within the hegemonic logic of representing the other in a dominant manner. Voting neg allows difference to speak rather than be spoken for.</strong><br />

<strong>Their presumption of whiteness as always already implicated in oppression allows the operation of power to easily side-step opposition. Once resistance has become static, the system of racial oppression can put on another mask. The reason Michael Steele uses street talk in order to make the neoliberal violence of the Republican Party agenda seem more minority-friendly, or why that Bush continually emphasized Saddam's violence against Kurdish minority groups as a justification for the invasion of Iraq is because they recognize that the 1ac’s model of racial politics is fickle and easily to manipulate.</strong><br />
<strong>Rather, resistance must remain fluid and nomadic. We are never one person but always many at once tending towards a plethora of possible futures. We are not of a tribe but rather are members of many multitudes. Not one fixed location of whiteness, but many.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>For the structures of white supremacy, racial equity is not an end in and of itself – The price extracted in exchange for the legitimacy of the plan is accepting the current terms of American nationalism which means that the official antiracism they advocate must remain blind to the linkage between race and the imperialism of American capital.</strong><br />

<strong>The ballot is also a moment of interest convergence between the Affirmative and the judge – This rhetorical alliance with alterity is a technology of political demand that repeats the strategic attitude of the system it seeks to overturn – The guilty solidarity of the 1AC masks the privilege that prevents the AFF project from directly changing the lives of the people they invoke to warrant a ballot.</strong><br />

Why are &quot;tactics&quot; useful ... in the academic sense?<br />
<br />
<strong>AND, Within the Affirmative project, the ballot functions as a politics of self-subalternization, where the judges are encouraged to found a vacuous solidarity with the Affirmative Other by valorizing the material deprivation portrayed in the 1AC – However, their rhetorical strategy amounts to nothing more than a sham renunciation authorized by the same structures of power that produce alterity in the first place, turning the case at a higher level of analysis.</strong><br />

<strong>Mbembe 2k3.</strong> Achille Mbembe social and economic researcher at the University of the Witwatersrand, 2003, Public Culture 15.1 (2003) pg. 11-40<br />
Second, the controlled inflow and ... there are mineral deposits.<br />
<br />
<strong>This biopolitical expansion is incredibly dangerous—it causes constant violence that culminates in extinction.</strong><br />
<strong>Dean 2k1.</strong> Mitchell Dean, professor of sociology at Macquarie University in Australia, 2001, “Sovereignty and Biopolitics in Nonliberal Rule,” States of Imagination edited by Thomas Hansen and Finn Stepputat, pg. 41-64<br />
There are, of course ... functioning of the modern state (232).<br />
<br />
<strong>The alternative is to reject the affirmative for their complicity with biopolitics. As a specific intellectual, you should endorse a mode of politics that functions through analysis and criticism of specific problems and reveals the flaws in our general assumptions, opening a space for change. The act of genuine and specific criticism leads to effective social transformation and rethinking solutions.</strong><br />
<strong>Owen 97</strong>. David Owen, professor of social sciences at Southampton University, 1997, “Maturity and Modernity: Nietszche, Weber, Foucault and the ambivalence of reason,” Routledge publishers, published July 22, 1997<br />
In our reflections on Foucault’s methodology ... determinations of who we are.<br />

<strong>The 1ac legitimates Japanese violence on any regional power deemed uncivilized—this is a surefire path to warfare that turns ALL of their internal links based on East Asian peace.</strong><br />
<strong>Iwami 2k8.</strong> Tadashi Iwami, Masters in Political Science at the University of Canterbury, “Discourses of Civilisation in International Politics: The Case of Japan,” pg. 96<br />
