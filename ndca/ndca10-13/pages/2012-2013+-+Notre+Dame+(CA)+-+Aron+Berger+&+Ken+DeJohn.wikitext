We won't normally post cites for __[[#|cards read]]__ after the 1ac/1nc, except in the instance of some card that like I ALWAYS read in the 2nc or whatever. Feel free to email me if you want me to post something on the wiki that was read in some other speech.
Normally I'm pretty prompt with posting stuff we recently broke (I'll put up new 1AC stuff the moment we read it) but I'm only human, and I can forget to put some all-important something up, so email me.

<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">Funds for both projects have been included in congressional bills since 2010, according to Crenshaw, totalling over %2477 million.</span>
HR 2055<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">, which passed the House 411-5, </span>includes<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> nearly %2415 million for </span>transportation infrastructure improvements at Mayport and "funding, as, necessary," for future projects such as the maintenance wharf<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> and controlled industrial facility.</span>



Basing at Mayport enables strategic dispersal of our fleet which solves the impact that a disaster at Norfolk would have on carrier readiness

===1NC- Narcissism Turn (VS Psychoanalysis Aff)===

<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;"> There are 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States today. And there are 279 Congressional votes standing between those people and the American dream. The fight for those 279 votes that 11 million people need has been long and tough, but now, more than ever, is the time for our courage and leadership. </span>__<span style="color: #000000;">In April, Arizona enshrined racial profiling into law — and awakened millions to the current civil rights crisis the immigrant community is facing in our country. Arizona changed the game and brought the urgency of our fight to a fever pitch. </span>__ __<span style="color: #000000;">Since then, at least 18 states have considered legislation similar to the Arizona law. The lack of political courage from both the White House and members of Congress to tackle immigration reform has left a vacuum that states like Arizona are rushing to fill with their own measures — and these measures mostly focus only on enforcement with no thought given to families and workers.</span>__<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;"> Immigration is no longer a policy debate; it is a political battle with clear choices: Legalization or criminalization. Justice for all or racial profiling. Family unity or family separation. </span>__<span style="color: #000000;">We, as advocates, also have a clear choice. We can negotiate with ourselves and entice our opponents to the table by proposing piecemeal options. But, an effort to push anything short of a comprehensive overhaul of our broken system would both give our opponents a reprieve from working on a bi-partisan solution to one of our nation’s most pressing problems and give our allies the choice of checking off the “immigration” box on their to-do list without having fully addressed theissue. Anything less than full legalization of the 11 million undocumented immigrants is unacceptable, and we should not demand anything less. </span>//We have a moral obligation to push for real reform that brings justice to all of our communities//<span style="color: #000000;">. We won’t allow the inaction of Congress to force us into negotiating away our power. The courage of those 11 million people is our power. If we back off from organizing the entire community, we will fail to create — much less take advantage of — the opportunities that lie ahead. </span>__<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;"> The American public has shown that they are in favor of immigration reform with a pathway to legalization. Our communities have stood up and made their voices heard. Arizona has ignited the 21st century fight for civil rights. </span>__<span style="color: #000000;">Now is the time for our lawmakers to step up and stop putting politics above what is right and just</span>__<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;">. We must continue increasing our pressure. There are no lack of options in front of the President and Congress to legalize the undocumented, keep families together and reform our immigration system in the interests of our nation. There is only a lack conviction. And it’s up to us, as immigration rights advocates, to force them to do the right thing, and bring real, comprehensive reform to all 11 million undocumented immigrants, leaving no one behind.</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 14.6667px;">These sentiments transform into a mentality of disposability without the protection of the law. Non-citizens are then mere objects, dumped into camps where violence and death are justified as commonplace.</span>
**Giroux 6**<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;">-(Henry A, “Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class, and the Biopolitics of Disposability”)</span>

<span class="underline0">In the current historical moment</span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;">, as Catherine Mills </span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">points out, "all</span>subjects are<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">at least potentially if not actually</span>abandoned by the law and exposed to violence<span class="underline0"> as a</span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> constitutive</span><span class="underline0">condition of political existence</span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;">" (2004, 47). Nicholas Mirzoeff has observed that </span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">all over the world</span>there is <span class="underline0">a </span>growing resentment of immigrants<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">and refugees,</span>matched b<span class="underline0">y the emergence of </span>detain-and-deport strategies<span class="underline0"> and</span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">coupled with </span>the rise of the camp as the key institution and social model of the new millennium<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;">. The "</span><span class="underline0">empire of </span>camps<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;">," according to Mirzoeff, has become the "exemplary institution of a system of global capitalism that supports the West in its high consumption, low-price consumer lifestyle" (2005, 145). Zygmunt Bauman calls such camps "garrisons of extraterritoriality" and argues that they </span>have become "the dumping grounds for the indisposed<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">of and as yet unrecycled </span><span class="underline0">waste of the global frontier-land"</span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;"> (2003,109).</span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">The regime of the camp has increasingly become a key index of modernity and the new world order. </span>The connections among disposability, violence, and death have become common under modernity in those countries<span class="underline0"> where the order of power has become necropolitical</span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;">. For example, Rosa Linda Fregoso analyzes feminicide as a local expression of global violence against women in the region of the U.S./Mexico border where over one thousand women have been either murdered or disappeared, constituting what amounts to a "politics of gender extermination" (2006, 109</span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">).The</span><span class="underline0">politics of disposability</span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">and necropolitics not only</span><span class="underline0"> generate widespread violence and</span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">ever expanding "garrisons of extraterritoriality" but also</span><span class="underline0">have taken on a powerful new significance as a foundation for political sovereignty.</span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;"> Biopolitical commitments to "let die" by abandoning citizens appear increasingly credible in light of the growing authoritarianism in the United States under the Bush administration (Giroux 2005).</span>


**This is a prerequisite to their ethical obligation – the immigrant’s body is the symbolic site for global social change. At best, the affirmative is a band-aid domestic solution that does not address how people should address the Other.** 
**Benhabib****12** <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">(Seyla, Eugene Meyer professor of Political Science and Philosophy at Yale University, “The Morality of Migration”, July 29, [[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/stone-immigration/#h|http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/stone-immigration/#h]][])[rkezios]</span>

<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">Migrations pit two moral and legal principles, foundational to the modern state system, against each other. On one hand, the</span><span class="Underline"> human right of individuals to move across borders whether for economic, personal or professional reasons or to seek asylum and refuge is guaranteed by Articles 13 and 14 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> On the other hand, Article 21 of the declaration recognizes a basic right to self-government, stipulating that “the will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government.” Under the current regime of states, that fundamental right includes control over borders as well as determining who is to be a citizen as distinguished from a resident or an alien. The international system straddles these dual principles but it has not been able to reconcile them. </span><span class="Underline">The irony of global developments is that </span>while state sovereignty<span class="Underline"> in economic, military, and technological domains </span>is eroded and national borders have become more porous, they are<span class="Underline"> still </span>policed to keep out aliens<span class="Underline"> and intruders. </span>//The migrant’s body has become the symbolic site upon which such contradictions are enacted.//<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> Why not advocate a “world without borders” then? From a moral point of view, n</span><span class="Underline">o child deserves to be born on one side of the border rather than another, and </span>it is deeply antithetical to our moral principles to punish individuals for what they cannot help being or doing<span class="Underline">. Punishment implies responsibility and accountability for one’s actions and choices; clearly, children who through their parents’ choices end up on one side of the border rather than another cannot be penalized for these choices. </span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">A strong advocate of the right to self-government might retort that rewarding certain children for the wrongs committed by their parents, in this case </span>illegal immigration<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">, by legalizing undocumented youths is illogical as well as immoral and that “the right thing to do” would be to deport all undocumented migrants – parents and children alike. Apart from the sheer impracticality of this solution, its advocates seem to consider undocumented “original entry” into a country as the analog of “original sin” that no amount of subsequent behavior and atonement can alter. But such punitive rigor </span><span class="Underline">unfairly </span>conflates the<span class="Underline"> messy and often </span>inadvertent reasons that <span class="Underline">l</span>ead<span class="Underline"> one </span>to become an undocumented migrant<span class="Underline"> with no criminal intent to break the law. </span>If conditions<span class="Underline"> in a person’s native country so </span>endanger<span class="Underline"> his </span>life and well-being<span class="Underline"> and he becomes willing to risk illegality in order to survive, his </span>right to survival, from a moral point of view, carries as much weight as<span class="Underline"> does </span>the<span class="Underline"> new </span>country’s claim to control borders<span class="Underline"> against migrants. Immanuel Kant, therefore, called </span>the moral claim to seek refuge<span class="Underline"> or respite in the lands of another, </span>a “universal right of hospitality,<span class="Underline">” provided that the intentions of the foreigner upon arriving on foreign lands were peaceful. </span>Such a right<span class="Underline">,</span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> he argued, </span>belonged to each human being placed on this planet<span class="Underline"> who had to share the earth with others. Even though morally the right to hospitality is an individual right, the socioeconomic and cultural causes of migrations are for the most part collective. Migrations occur because of economic, environmental, cultural and historical “push” and “pull” factors. “We are here,” say migrants, “because in effect you were there.” “We did not cross the border; the border crossed us.” </span>//We do have special obligations to our neighbors,//<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> as opposed to moral obligations to humanity at large, if, for example, our economy has devastated theirs; if our industrial output has led to environmental harm or if our drug dependency has encouraged the formation of transnational drug cartels. These claims of interdependence require a third moral principle — in addition to the right of universal hospitality and the right to self-government — to be brought into consideration: associative obligations among peoples arising through historical factors. </span>//States cannot ignore such associative obligations.//Migration policies<span class="Underline">, though they are often couched in nation-centric terms, always </span>have transnational causes and consequences<span class="Underline">. </span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">It is impossible to address Mexican migration into the United States, for example, without considering the decades-long dependency of the rich California agricultural fields upon the often undocumented and unorganized labor of Mexican workers, some of whose children have now grown up to become “Dreamers” (so named after the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act introduced to Congress in 2001). Among the three million students who graduate from United States high schools, 65,000 are undocumented. </span><span class="Underline">The United States owes these young people a special duty of hospitality, not only because we, as a society, have benefited from the circumstances under which their parents entered this country, but also because they have formed strong affiliations with this society through being our friends, students, neighbors and coworkers. In a liberal-democratic society the path to citizenship must follow along these associative ties through which an individual shows him or herself to be capable and worthy of citizenship. Migratory movements are sites of imperfect justice in that they bring into play the individual right to freedom of movement, the universal right to hospitality and the right of collectives to self-government as well as specific associative moral obligations. These rights cannot always be easily reconciled. </span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">Furthermore, international law does not as yet recognize a “human right to citizenship” for migrants, and considers this a sovereign prerogative of individual states. Nonetheless, the responsible politician is the one who acts with a lucid understanding of the necessity to balance these principles rather than giving in to a punitive rigorism that would deny, in Thomas Jefferson’s words, “the right which nature has given to all men of departing from [and I would add, from joining with] the country in which choice, not chance has placed them” (1774).</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">At times</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';"> the atmosphere of crisis and controversy has felt eerily like being transported back to Georgia in the late 1950s and </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">early 19</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">60s, when </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">at least in the white community, arguments about</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';"> desegregation </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">of the public schools </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">seemed to rage </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">hot and</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';"> loud </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">on every agitated hand. The similarities are hard to miss.</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';"> The Klan is back on board, along with newer white supremacist organizations that have found the troubled waters of immigration debate to be good fishing</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">. 26 </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Many elements echo </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">much of the talk and reproduce much of </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">the climate that prevailed in that other era of massive racial upset and adjustment: the intense feelings of entitlement that many people voice when complaining about immigrants, the firm conviction that their privileges are well-deserved, and the evident sensation of invasion, displacement, and in danger</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">There is another similarity</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;"> to that earlier time in that a substantial number of those who respond most favorably [*108] </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">to the restrictionist crusade and buy most eagerly into a nationalist or even xenophobic mind-set</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;"> seem to be working class people, in this newer context, both black and white working class people - the very ones who I believe stand to gain the most if they could find ways of making common cause with low-wage immigrants here and with workers in other countries as well. </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Native-born workers clearly are hurt by a domestic regime that tolerates the creation of a race-marked and vulnerable underclass within our home labor market.They are also hurt by a global regime that guarantees the mobility of capital while restricting the mobility of people, and pits worker against worker and community against community around the world</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Such a regime drains the institutions of electoral democracy of their capacity to set ground rules for the conduct of business and the protection of human and labor rights, yet many workers are apparently all too ready to blame "those Mexicans" in their various guises for the economic insecurity that dominates the current scene</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">. I make this statement about U.S. workers' attitudes toward immigration with some wariness in this venue. I am aware that many of us in academia and the professions make far too many stereotypical assumptions about working class people and what they think, especially when it comes to matters of race. 27 The factory workers, both black and white, with whom I traveled to Mexico have been eager to look for ways to act in solidarity with the people that we met in our travels and have often expanded my own understanding and perceptions about matters of immigration and global justice for workers. Certainly, it should not be forgotten that subtle and not-so-subtle xenophobic ideas find plenty of willing purveyors among highly educated and well-resourced pundits, not to mention among the political elite. 28 Nonetheless, many working people in the United States do participate in the anti-immigrant backlash. 29 </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Even though some labor unions have scored important successes in welcoming immigrant workers into their membership, have benefited from immigrants' energy and leadership, and</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;"> [*109] </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">have worked to advance immigrant workers' interests, 30 other unions are less convinced and significant numbers of individual union members have voiced dissatisfaction when labor leaders take stands in favor of full workplace rights for undocumented workers or a more generous immigration policy</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">. 31 </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Workers in this country are dangerously divided on questions of race, class, and nationality, and many anti-immigrant groups actively recruit workers into their organizations and campaigns</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">. I see these difficult questions of immigration policy through the lens of my past experience and accumulated conviction. As recounted above, I lived through the civil rights period and have been inspired and forever shaped by its wonders, but I also witnessed the thwarting of its promise. One important reason I believe the movement was unable to better overcome the repression and containment it eventually suffered was that so few white working class people moved into active alliance with it. To their own detriment, very few realized that solidarity with the movement's history-making effort could have led to significant advances for them and their families. Everything I learned from that saga tells me that today once more </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">the need for</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;"> cross-race - and now </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">cross-nation - solidarity among working people will be acute and pivotal</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">. In an era of globalization, </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">the obstacles to achieving such internationalist and anti-racist solidarity will be enormous</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">. At the same time</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">, however, new global dynamics expose the moral and material logic of such solidarity and suggest its potential power</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 9.33333px;">. Meanwhile, one of </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">the </span>most strategic contexts<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';"> where these questions of class solidarity and racial justice can and should be engaged in is upcoming battles over immigration policy and the </span>rights of low-wage immigrant workers<span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';"> laboring in the United States.</span>
