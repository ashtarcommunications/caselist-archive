<span style="color: #000000;">**WE KNOW THE LINK ISN'T WORKING - HERE IS FULL TEXT, AND SORRY FOR THE PROBLEM. WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER VERSION****“SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE” IS ACTUALLY REFERRING TO TRANSPORTATION – SEE ALL EXAMPLES USED**The ROI proposition of social infrastructure development is solid. The EDHEC-Risk Institute, the financial research program of the French business school EDHEC, labels social infrastructure investment an attractive proposition because it offers ‘long-term contracts with steady and predictable inflation-linked income, high operating margins and high risk-adjusted return.’ Its stable, long-term cash flow characteristics are highly desirable to investors. Yet cities aren’t investing in it, private equity firms aren’t jumping on board, sovereign wealth funds don’t make substantial commitments, and pension funds haven’t been increasing their exposure to it. Why? The problem is threefold. First, the sector is little understood. Social infrastructure investments are often misconceived as highly-risky demand-based propositions. For example, toll road investments are often perceived to be dependent on traffic volume, whereas the more common availability-based model actually starts paying the investor once the infrastructure has been delivered regardless of its utilisation. Second, there is perceived to be a high level of associated political risk. A report published by the EDHEC Business School, for example, reckons that pension funds are unwilling to invest in social infrastructure because political cycles can lead to the public sector reneging on prior commitments and re-regulating contracts. And third, the global market for social infrastructure has yet to be sufficiently established to attract significant private and institutional investment. Private investment in social infrastructure is still in its infancy – private capital was only introduced to public projects in the 1990s in the UK. The aforementioned EDHEC report estimates that the global investment pool for social infrastructure projects since then has been limited to just US$100 billion of private capital. Compare this to the US$175 billion recently committed by global development banks to public transport projects. Until these underlying issues have been resolved, the public sector’s fiscally-austere measures will result in continued underinvestment in urban social infrastructure. This is a big problem. Failure to invest in social infrastructure costs taxpayers a lot. The Economist reckons that deficiencies in roads, bridges and transport cost U.S. households nearly US$130 billion in 2010 alone. And the American Society of Civil Engineers expects that the underinvestment in infrastructure will end up costing each family in the U.S. around US$10,600 between 2010 and 2020. On the other hand, the private sector remains an unleveraged and ‘attractive source for [social infrastructure] investment, particularly when public spending cuts start to bite,’ according to Nigel Middleton, a managing director in Barclay’s infrastructure investment business unit, in an interview with Financial Times. For example, Paul Bastian, national secretary for the Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union, recently estimated that every $1 billion dollars invested in infrastructure creates and sustains 10,000 to 15,000 jobs. The Economist also notes that the involvement of the private sector in public infrastructure projects positively impacts the quality of those projects. ‘Padding, short cuts or shoddy construction are less likely to be tolerated… And city leaders might in turn overcome their aversion to the efficient pricing of public resources…’ Solution: Understanding + de-risking = market growth The future success of social infrastructure is dependent on private investment; historically an investment class that has been developed and managed by the public sector. For this to happen, three problems need to be resolved. First, the sector needs to be better understood. Second, the perceived political risk associated with social infrastructure needs to be removed. And third, the social infrastructure market needs to mature and grow. Solving the first two problems will resolve the third. The U.S. has been leading by example to resolve these problems. At the federal level, President Obama introduced the notion of creating an infrastructure bank which would amalgamate private and public finances and yield long-term returns. Similar in structure to the UK’s Green Investment Bank which was seeded with UK£3 billion, the U.S. infrastructure bank would alleviate pressure from already overstretched state and municipal governments. Obama wants to supply US$10 billion in seed capital, but the idea has not yet been accepted in Congress. This has driven Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago to create the Chicago Infrastructure Trust (CIT), an initiative which dovetails public infrastructure needs with private investment priorities on a case-by-case basis. Mayor Emanuel anticipates that US$7 billion will be needed to upgrade the city’s schools, water system, commuter rail and airport. Already, private institutions including Macquarie Group, Ullico, Citibank and JPMorgan have committed US$1.7 billion to CIT that will be invested in public infrastructure projects. Such investors are offered enticements that include tax-exempt debt and tax-exempt bonds. These kinds of initiatives are helping private investors to better understand the diversity, risks, and timelines of the infrastructure market. Other global cities also need to position social infrastructure investment as an attractive asset class to private and institutional investors. This needs to be a prioritised policy objective. The next critical step will be to reduce the perceived political risks associated with infrastructure investment. Pension funds, for example, have mentioned that social infrastructure investments are highly desirable because of their long-term buy-and-hold nature, but that a transparent and independent regulatory framework first needs to be set up. UK pension funds, for example, currently only allocate to infrastructure investments around 2% of their UK£1 trillion of assets under management – largely due to this perceived risk. Even advanced economies with historically stable governments are susceptible to variation in investor sentiment. A considerable 63% of people recently polled on WAtoday believe that political instability in Australia – typically thought of as a politically secure investment destination – is adversely affecting foreign investment in the nation’s infrastructure. By virtue of resolving these problems, the global social infrastructure market will mature. The U.S. already allocates 2% of its public money on infrastructure, Europe spends 5% on average, and China is spending 9%, according to Natwar Gandhi, CFO for the District of Columbia. The future potential for private investment in the global social infrastructure market is huge. Maturity and growth in the social infrastructure market will further stimulate investment appetite in the private sector – but this will be dependent on future market transparency and decreasing perceived political risk.</span>

**C. Voting Issue –**

**Limits** – transportation infrastructure defines this year’s new topic, departing from the phrase justifies reading any affirmative which increases any infrastructure like creating sewers

**Ground –** having to be prepared to debate any affirmative that vaguely increases infrastructure devastates negative ground, we would have to cut uniqueness for every disad

===Framework=== 
====1NC Shell==== 

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A. Interpretation – The affirmative should defend a topical plan. All advantages should be causal results of the plan.</span>**

If they aren’t tied to defending those changes it’s unlikely we will have any applicable research, which gives the aff a huge advantage. Being germane to the subject of the resolution isn’t enough since the number of relevant issues is exponentially larger than the number of defensible topical policies. Plus, the ability to unpredictably contextualize advocacies through movements, demands or language criticisms circumvents our generic ground.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">2) Hijacks Education – Predictability is the basis of negative strategy which is key to clash and depth of discussion. The impact is rigorous testing of policies which is the only way to truly understand the world.</span>**
