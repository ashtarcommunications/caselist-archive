**Observation 1: Mythology is Cool**

**Doctor Who is a uniquely educational medium through which to examine space exploration. It helps us to be philosophically engaged with our assumptions, teaches us how to deal with the Other, and mandates that we come to our own conclusions rather than blindly believe "truths."**
**Lewis 10** (Courtland, PhD candidate @ University of Tennessee, Doctor Who and Philosophy: Bigger on the Inside ; pg 376-378)

**Dr. Who allows us to blend science and mythology in order to come to a more complete understanding of our place in the universe and on Earth**<span class="st">—</span>**embracing mythology mitigtes the potential for science to lead to moral blindness and decadence.**
**Bertland 10** (Alexander, PhD Chair of Philosophy Dept. Niagara University, Doctor Who and Philosophy: Bigger on the Inside, pg 371)

**That mythology lets us access morality by expanding our moral imagination rather than just our scientific knowledge.**
**Bunce 10** (Rober, PhD: Director of Studies of Politics, Cambridge University, Doctor Who and Philosophy: Bigger on the Inside, pg 349)

**And recognizing that science and myth are inextricably bound together is the only way to recognize and stop evils like the Holocaust.**
**Helms 74** (Randall, Prof of ENglish @ ASU, Tolkien's World, pg 66)

**The way in which we view space shapes the way we utilize it.**
**Sheehan 7** - Distinguished Fellow at the Center on Law and Security (2007, Michael, pp. 5-19 “The International Politics of Space,” http://bib.tiera.ru/dvd64/Sheehan%20M.%20-%20The%20International%20Politics%20of%20Space(2007)(248).pdf, liam)

**Thus the plan:**
**The United States federal government should substantially increase its exploration of space beyond the Earth’s mesosphere using the Type 40, Mark 3 Time and Relative Dimension in Space.**

**Observation 2: Science Fiction Education**

**Science fiction is a lens to analyze politics of the present**
**Weldes 2003** – Senior Lecturer, Bristol University; PhD (Minn) (Jutta, “Popular culture, science fiction, and world politics: exploring inter textual relations” in “To seek out new worlds: science fiction and world politics” ed. Weldes, Palgrave Macmillan 2003, 10-11)

**And SF hones our decision-making skills—no other medium can improve our abilities to make predictions as well as this one can**
**Huntington 1975** – teaches English at The University of Rhode Island and for the last five years has given a course on Science Fiction. (John, “Science Fiction and the Future.” College English, Vol. 37, No. 4 (Dec., 1975), JSTOR)

**Science fiction overcomes short-term myopia and fosters involvement in predictions and scenario planning**
**Lippard 2010** - Sr. Security Product Manager for Global Crossing and a Ph.D. student in Human and Social Dimensions of Science and Technology at Arizona State University (April 29, Jim, “ Science fiction scenarios and public engagement with science ” http://lippard.blogspot.com/2010/04/science-fiction-scenarios-and-public.html)

**Science fiction can’t be separated from world politics—incorporating this perspective is the only way to make sense of traditional policy education**
**Weldes 2003** – Senior Lecturer, Bristol University; PhD (Minn) (Jutta, “Popular culture, science fiction, and world politics: exploring inter textual relations” in “To seek out new worlds: science fiction and world politics” ed. Weldes, Palgrave Macmillan 2003, 12-13)

**And increased awareness that breaks the monopoly of technological experts is critical to human survival**
**Stannard 2006** – (Matt, Department of Communication and Journalism, University of Wyoming, Spring 2006 Faculty Senate Speaker Series Speech, April 18, http://theunderview.blogspot.com/2006/04/deliberation-democracy-and-debate.html)

**Observation 3: Framework**

**Fiat is merely an act of imagination. Any act of imagination or even attempt at representation automatically includes science fiction elements—the only difference between our Aff and more traditional ones is that we acknowledge the role of fiction**
**Freedman 2000** - Associate Professor of English at Louisiana State University (Carl, “Critical Theory and Science Fiction” Wesleyan University Press, University Press of London, 20-22)

**Traditional conceptions of government fiat are also fiction, they simply present themselves as fact—fiat misrepresents the process of government decisionmaking, which means it’s neither educational nor predictable**
**Claude 1988** (Inis, Professor of Government and Foreign Affairs, University of Virginia, States and the Global System, pages 18-20)
