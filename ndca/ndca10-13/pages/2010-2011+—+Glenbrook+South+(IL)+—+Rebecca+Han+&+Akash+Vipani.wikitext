==**Afghanistan COIN 1AC**== 

**Plan: The United States federal government should reduce counterinsurgency fources under the command of General David Petraeus.**

**Advantage 1 is Hegemony**

**The war in Afghanistan will collapse American primacy - 2 internal links:**

**First - Credibility**

**Obama announced a July 2011 withdrawal date, but it is based on the conditional success of the COIN mission. This deadline isperceived as unconditional withdrawal and has created global confusion.**
**Rogin, 10**<span style="font-weight: normal;">-staff writer for Foreign Policy, Prior to that, Josh covered defense and foreign policy for Congressional Quarterly. Josh has also worked at the House International Relations Committee, and the Brookings Institution (Josh, “Petraeus: Withdrawal timeline does not mean "switching off the lights",” The Cable, 6/29,http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/06/29/petraeus_withdrawal_timeline_does_not_mean_switching_off_the_lights)</span>

"When General David Patraeus testifies...exactly what they've been doing." 

**Failure will spillover to the entirety of US foreign policy and prevent Obama from exercising leadership**
**Fernholz, 10** <span style="font-weight: normal;">– writing fellow at the American Prospect and Research Fellow at the New America Foundation (Tim, The American Prospect, “The Ultimate Test Case,” March, 2010, lexis)</span>

"Obama's final decision in December...any of his other initiatives"

**Second –overstretch**

**COIN doctrine is overstretching the US military and exhausting American leadership – withdrawing to a counterterrorism strategy is vital to preventing great power challengers**
**Kretkowski, 10** <span style="font-weight: normal;">– Frequently assists think tank in conferences and other work products that aid DoD's long-term thinking about threats that may not be addressable via weapons platforms. Spent six months in Afghanistan working with Army public affairs. (Paul, “Against COIN, for CT in Afghanistan and Elsewhere”, 1/7, Beacon (a blog), http://softpowerbeacon.blogspot.com/2010/01/against-coin-for-ct-in-afghanistan-and.html)</span>

"Over the winter break I had an epiphany about the interrelation of U.S. hard and soft power...
rogue-state nuclear development (Iran, North Korea); or complex challenges from a rising power (China, a reinvigorated Russia)."

**Afghanistan is a quagmire of attrition warfare that is destroying US morale and readiness.**
**Kuhner, 9** <span style="font-weight: normal;">- the president of the Edmund Burke Institute for American Renewal (Jeffrey, Washington Times, “Obama’s quagmire; US should look to its own interests,” 9/7, Lexis Academic)</span>

"America is losing the war in Afghanistan...drives numerous Afghans into the evil, welcoming arms of extremests."

**This will obliterate American primacy**
**Pyne, 9** -<span style="font-weight: normal;">Vice Chair of the Utah State Legislative Compensation Commission and Vice President of the Association of the United States Army's Utah chapter and a Vice President of the Salt Lake Total Force Chapter of the Military Officers Association of America (David, “Obama failing our troops in Afghanistan,” 11/7, http://westernfrontamerica.com/2009/11/07/obama-failing-troops-afghanistan/)</span>

"Since we invaded Iraq six and a half years ago and Afghanistan eight years ago, we have lost...Even Russia has done so with their invasion of US-ally Georgia this past year."

**Hegemony key to de-escalate conflict – collapse causes multiple hotspots to escalate – causes global nuclear war**
Robert **Kagan**
(Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Senior Transatlantic Fellow at the German Marshall Fund) 20**07** “End of Dreams, Return of History,” Hoover Institution, No. 144, August/September, http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/6136

"The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations...
.It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again."

**The plan solves – reducing to a counterterrorism focus creates sustainable presence, and prevents vacillations between engagement and isolationism**
**Stewart, 9**- <span style="font-weight: normal;">Ryan Family Professor of the Practice of Human Rights and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, studied at Oxford and served briefly in the British army before working in the diplomatic service in Indonesia and as British representative to Montenegro (9/16/09, Rory, “The Future of Afghanistan,”</span>
http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan)

"The best Afghan policy would be to reduce the number of foreign troops from the current level of 90,000...
In Afghanistan in the long-term, less will be more."

**The plan’s rejection of COIN creates a doctrinal shift towards selective engagement that can sustain US presence globally**
**Gventer, 9** -<span style="font-weight: normal;">Senior Defense Analyst at the RAND Corporation and a former deputy assistant secretary of defense. She served two tours in Iraq, including a year as a senior adviser to General Peter Chiarelli, the operational commander in Iraq in 2006 (Celeste, “False Promise of 'Counterinsurgency'”, 12/1, http://www.rand.org/commentary/2009/12/01/NYT.html)</span>
"An effort to conduct "counterinsurgency" in Afghanistan is not just a costly business...
selective engagement of a strong, credible U.S. military capable of applying overwhelming force."

**Advantage two is Pakistan**

**COIN failure inevitable**
**Stewart, 10** <span style="font-weight: normal;">-Professor of the Practice of Human Rights and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard, studied at Oxford and served briefly in the British army before working in the diplomatic service in Indonesia and as British representative to Montenegro (Rory, “Afghanistan: What Could Work”, New York Review of Books, 1/14,</span>
http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jan/14/afghanistan-what-could-work/?page=3)

"The counterinsurgency strategy and surge in Iraq led to a drop in violence (against predictions),
but the same will not happen in Afghanistan...because of the difficulties of the country and its political structures."

**A large military footprint combined with the perception of an illegitimate government make crushing the Taliban impossible**
**Galston 10**<span style="font-weight: normal;">- Senior Fellow of Governance Studies @ Brookings (William, Senior Fellow of Governance Studies @ Brookings, “A Question of Life and Death: U.S. Policy in Afghanistan,” Brookings, June 15th, http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2010/0615_afghanistan_galston.aspx)</span>

"Are the basic premises of our current policy in Afghanistan fatally flawed...stuck with the Taliban as a long-term military presence and political force in Afghanistan."

**A large counterinsurgency footprint drives insurgents to Pakistan, mobilizes the Pakistani Taliban and will cause Pakistan to collapse**
**Akhtar, 10**-<span style="font-weight: normal;">professor of international relations, and a senior analyst & writer. He was the dean of faculty of management, Baluchistan university, and former chairman of International Relations Department, Karachi university (1/26/10, Shameem, “Pakistan’s Instability : The US War Factor,”http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&cid=1262372328640&pagename=Zone-English-Muslim_Affairs/MAELayout#**1)**</span>

"If it is a war against extremists and militancy inside Pakistan...they may erupt at any moment, thus destabilizing the state."

**Pakistan collapse causes global nuclear conflict – draws in China, India and Russia**
**Pitt, 9-<span style="font-weight: normal;">a New York Times and internationally bestselling author of two books: "War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn't Want You to Know" and "The Greatest Sedition Is Silence." (5/8/09, William, “Unstable Pakistan Threatens the World,” http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=commentary&article=2183)</span>**

"But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car...appears to be gravely serious about addressing the situation. So should we all.

**Withdrawal of combat troops will immediately turn the population against the Taliban and shore up Afghan government legitimacy**
**Dorronsoro,9<span style="font-weight: normal;">-Visiting Scholar, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (January 2009, Gilles, “Focus and Exit: An Alternative Strategy for the Afghan War,”http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/afghan_war-strategy.pdf)</span>**

"This three-zone strategy is not, //per se,//
a gamechanger...accelerates the independence of Afghanistan’s peripheral regions."

**Indicts of the counterterrorism option underestimate the size of what the plan leaves intact – it is sufficiently resourced to provide force protection, intelligence gathering, army training and will maintain the support of the local population**
**Long, 10 <span style="font-weight: normal;">- assistant professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs (Austin, “Small is Beautiful: The Counterterrorism Option in Afghanistan,”</span>**
Orbis, Spring 2010, Science Direct)

"This insoluble problem is why the counterterrorism option is important...
it is vastly larger than any other counterterrorism deployment."

**Gradual withdrawal while maintaining a counterterrorism strategy allows more effective US leadership in the war on terror and maximizes US credibility**
**Chellany, 09**** <span style="font-weight: normal;">- professor of strategic studies at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi (9/14/09, Brahma, Japan Times, “An Advantagous U.S. Exit,”</span>

"When the administration's principle war target is not the Taliban...
Pakistani army as part of the deep-rooted military-mullah alliance."
