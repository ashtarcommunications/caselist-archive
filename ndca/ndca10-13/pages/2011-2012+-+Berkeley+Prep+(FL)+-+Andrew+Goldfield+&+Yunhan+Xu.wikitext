Has defense acquisition always been this problematic, or are we in a particularly difficult transition period? Certainly, defense acquisition has always been hard. The first ship procurements for the U.S. Navy in the 1790s experienced cost and schedule overruns, congressional lobbying, and technology overreach (Toll, 2006). But, the nation rebounded to produce resounding achievements such as the nuclear powered submarine, the intercontinental ballistic missile, and, of course, the Manhattan Project. These programs all were begun in response to significant global changes and dangerous emerging threats. Defense acquisition has shown tremendous responsiveness, when the need arises, to provide game-changing innovations that transform the trajectory of warfare. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">China has declared that its official defense budget for 2011 will rise by 12.7 percent from the previous year. Last year there was a lot of hoopla surrounding the fact that China had announced a mere 7.5 percent jump in defense budget. It was the first time since the 1980s that China's defense spending increased by a single-digit percentage. But this year we are back to the norm of double-digit increases. While China's civilian leadership has tried to downplay the latest increase, suggesting that much of the increase will go to human resources development, infrastructure and training, it is the response of the Chinese military that should be a matter of concern. Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan was unambiguous in suggesting that when it comes to military spending, there is no need for China "to care about what others may think." The international community has long demanded that China should be more transparent about the intentions behind its rapid defense spending. Now the Chinese military is making its strategic intent clear. </span>__Divisions within China about the future course of nation's foreign policy are more stark than ever__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">...</span>__foreign policy unhindered from external and internal security challenges__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question “Is Nuclear War Inevitable??” [10].4 In Section 1, Moore points out what most terrorists obviously already know about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange. As Moore points out, all that militant terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. Because of the Russian “dead hand” system, “where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,” it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the United States” [10]. Israeli leaders and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it would retaliate with the suicidal “Samson option” against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even “anti-Semitic” European cities [10]. In that case, of course, Russia would retaliate, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of nuclear warheads, many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, would rain upon most of the major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radioactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations in a nuclear winter that could last as long as a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well.

Those mattered absolutely to the people who had to sit down and try to frame the detailed guidance to exact destruction of 80 percent of the adversary’s nuclear forces. When they realized that they could not in fact assure those levels of damage if the president chose to ride out an attack, what then did they do? They built a construct that powerfully biased the president’s decision process toward launch before the arrival of the first enemy warhead.” (Jonathan Schell, The Gift of Time, Metropolitan Books, 1998, pp. 191-194).</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">China has declared that its official defense budget for 2011 will rise by 12.7 percent from the previous year. Last year there was a lot of hoopla surrounding the fact that China had announced a mere 7.5 percent jump in defense budget. It was the first time since the 1980s that China's defense spending increased by a single-digit percentage. But this year we are back to the norm of double-digit increases. While China's civilian leadership has tried to downplay the latest increase, suggesting that much of the increase will go to human resources development, infrastructure and training, it is the response of the Chinese military that should be a matter of concern. Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan was unambiguous in suggesting that when it comes to military spending, there is no need for China "to care about what others may think." The international community has long demanded that China should be more transparent about the intentions behind its rapid defense spending. Now the Chinese military is making its strategic intent clear. </span>__Divisions within China about the future course of nation's foreign policy are more stark than ever__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">...</span>__foreign policy unhindered from external and internal security challenges__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span></span>

The state must also exclusively </span>__retain the capability of intervention by use of force__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> internally as well as externally. If it permits the non-state actors to develop this capability in competition, then the state will whither away. On the contrary, the state machinery should ensure a fast-paced development in the Red Corridor even it if has to hold Maoists hostage at gunpoint. The state’s firm and just intervention will dissolve the Maoist movement. Keeping in view the imminent threat posed by China, the quickest way to swing out of pacifism to a state of assertion is by injecting military thinking in the Civil Administration to build the sinews. That will enormously increase the deliverables on ground – from Lalgarh to Tawang.</span></span>

Implementation of better business practices accounts for $2.2 billion in savings next year and $20.6 billion over the FYDP. Actions include: • A 25 percent reduction in the cost of communications infrastructure, using enterprisewide services and consolidated data centers that will save $1.3 billion over the FYDP. • Cuts to fuel and energy costs by Air Force Mobility Command through adoption of commercial best practices in flight planning and use of simulators that will require an investment of $120 million but pay back $715 million over five years. •</span> __**Adoption of a new method for acquiring satellites**__**...l**__everage existing technologies and a streamlined acquisition approach to manage costs__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span></span>

Yet, as part of its plans for missile defense, the Pentagon is calling for the development of a test bed for space-based interceptors as well as examining a number of other exotic space weapons. In an interview published in Arms Control Today, Lt. Gen. Henry Obering, director of the Missile Defense Agency, touted what he said was “a very modest and moderate test-bed approach to launch some experiments.” Obering said the Pentagon would only deploy a handful of interceptors: “We are talking about onesies, twosies in terms of experimentation.”[2] </span>


Extinction
**__Morgan ‘9__** (Dennis Ray Morgan, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, South Korea, “World on fire: two scenarios of the destruction of human civilization and possible extinction of the human race,” Futures, 41(10), December 2009, ScienceDirect)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question “Is Nuclear War Inevitable??” [10].4 In Section 1, Moore points out what most terrorists obviously already know about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange. As Moore points out, all that militant terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. Because of the Russian “dead hand” system, “where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,” it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the United States” [10]. Israeli leaders and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it would retaliate with the suicidal “Samson option” against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even “anti-Semitic” European cities [10]. In that case, of course, Russia would retaliate, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of nuclear warheads, many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, would rain upon most of the major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radioactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations in a nuclear winter that could last as long as a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well. And </span>__what many people fail to realize...____suffering in a nuclear winter__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span>

A land-based system can theoretically be deployed anywhere over about one-third of the world’s surface and, depending on how it is vectored, under some limited conditions would also be capable of boost-phase, midcourse, and terminal in­terception. Yet space-based missile defense alone is truly global in reach because of the medium in which it oper­ates, unconstrained by overflight or territorial restrictions. It also offers inherent interdiction advantages, described in greater detail below.</span>

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The failure of the FBI to prosecute the perpetrator of the anthrax letters even though the FBI is believed to know who it is has led several experts to conclude that the perpetrator is untouchable because he has knowledge damaging to the government. That knowledge is believed to be the US violation of the 1972 Convention on Biological Weapons, which states that it is illegal to "develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire" such weapons. The US is using state-of-the-art genetic splicing to make designer bioweapons. An article by Laura Rozen in Salon (2/8/02) revealed that the "Defense Intelligence Agency hired Battelle to create a genetically enhanced version of anthrax" even though no vaccine was proven to be effective beforehand. A former Clinton administration official, Elisa D. Harris, "was shocked to read in the New York Times" (9/4/01) about bioweapons research "that she herself had not known about, although she had served for eight years in the White House as the point person for weapons of mass destruction nonproliferation issues."What other secret, illegal and genetically modified bioweapons are in the works? If we are told "none," why should we believe anything they tell us? </span>**__Of all the weapons of mass destruction...__**__As bad as slavery is, extinction is worse__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

Empires may come and go, but who are the honored custodians of life on earth? Temporal politicians? Corporate competitors? Strategic brinksmen? Military gamers? Inflated egos dripping with testosterone? How can any sane person believe that national sovereignty is more important than survival of the species? Now that extinction is possible, our slogan should be "Where there is life, there is hope." No government, no economic system, no national pride, no religion, no political system can be placed above human survival. The egos of leaders must not blind us. </span>

===Arctic - Methane Hydrate Exploration & Production Scenario=== 

Second scenario is __Arctic E&P__:

Lack of satellite bandwidth is constraining arctic gas exploration and production
**__NSR ‘11__** (Northern Sky Research, Industry Briefing, “The Digital Oilfield: Rising Bandwidth Demand, Consolidation and the HTS Puzzle,” 5-24-2011, [[http://www.nsr.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=444&catid=102&Itemid=175]])
**__Recent discoveries in remote areas__** <span style="font-size: 10.66px;"> … push further into the frontiers of connectivity.</span>


New satellite communications capability is key
**__Jarrold ‘8__** (Martin Jarrold, Chief of International Program Development, Global VSAT Forum, “Dynamics in the “Oil & Gas Patch”,” Sat Magazine, March 2008, http://www.satmagazine.com/cgi-bin/display_article.cgi?number=724995289)

Arctic exploration and production is key to prevent methane release – multiple internal links:

First, __natural outgassing__ – the ocean is already too warm to sustain frozen methane hydrates – wide-scale melting is inevitable and underway
**__Nissen ‘11__** (John Nissen, Chairman, Arctic Methane Emergency Working Group, geoengineering expert; other contributors & members: Peter Wadhams, Professor of ocean physics at Cambridge University, Stephen Salter, Emeritus Professor of Engineering Design at Edinburgh University, Dr. Brian Orr, former Principal Scientific Officer, Department of the Environment, Peter Carter, Sam Carana, Anthony Cook, Gary Houser, Jon Hughes, and Graham Ennis; “Arctic Methane Alert,” December 2011, http://www.vmine.net/scienceinparliament/specials/12.pdf)
__Until now, governments have been told__ <span style="font-size: 10.66px;"> … summer temperature to positive (above freezing).”</span>


And, only extraction solves
**__Cohen ‘10__** (Dave Cohen, Association for the Study of Peak Oil & Gas – USA (ASPO-USA), M.A. Theoretical Linguistics, “Methane Hydrates,” Energy Bulletin, 2-11-2010, http://www.energybulletin.net/node/51517)
<span style="font-size: 10.66px;">Well, of course, this makes sense … </span>__like natural gas—**to cause natural degassing**__<span style="font-size: 10.66px;">. </span>


Second, __drilling accidents__ – exploration avoids them
**__Adam ‘5__** (Dave Adam, science correspondent, The Guardian (UK), “US in race to unlock new energy source,” 4-3-2005, http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2005/apr/04/usnews.science)
<span style="font-size: 10.66px;">Its new project will see the drilling vessel … our future national energy security."</span>


And, new extraction technology is safe – beginning production as soon as possible is the only way to avoid massive methane release
**__Rennie ‘11__** (John Rennie, “Energy from Methane Hydrates: Better to Burn Out than Fade Away,” The Gleaming Retort, 6-1-2011, http://blogs.plos.org/retort/2011/06/01/energy-from-methane-hydrates-better-to-burn-out-than-fade-away/)

Methane release causes extinction – outweighs nuclear war
**__Ryskin ‘3__** (Gregory Ryskin, Department of Chemical Engineering, Northwestern University, “Methane-driven oceanic eruptions and mass extinctions,” Geology, 31(9), September 2003, http://pangea.stanford.edu/research/Oceans/GES205/methaneGeology.pdf)

Any risk of methane release controls your impact calculus – it’s the most probable and only empirical extinction event, and accesses an invisible threshold
**__Dorritie ‘7__** (Dan Dorritie, paleontologist, studies mass extinction events, M.A. Geology, University of California—Davis, “Preface,” //Killer in our Midst//, 2007, http://www.killerinourmidst.com/)

===Contention 2: Hosted Payloads=== 
The NSP signaled benign intent in space development, but political controversy and residual global uncertainty over its implementation continue to deny effective multilateral cooperation on space security

The energy of an object moving at 13 km/s (a typical impact velocity in LEO) is roughly equivalent to the energy released by the explosion of 40 times its mass of TNT. For example, a 1-cm-diameter aluminum sphere (which has a mass of about 1.4 grams) moving at 13 km/s has a kinetic energy equivalent to the energy released by the explosion of 56 grams of TNT (about 0.24 MJ); for a 10-cm aluminum sphere, the equivalent is 56 kg of TNT (about 236 MJ). </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">It is envisaged that the Bengaluru is most suitable location for installing the ground station for the SSPS. The utilization factor of rectenna for LEO system is poorer as compared to Molniya system and GEO system for the same received power and energy.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">The argument for military necessity states that the military advantages of space weapons to the United States and potential adversaries will soon be so great that it is in the national security interest to pursue them.39 Space weapons will “defend friendly satellites… attack enemy space weapons and other satellites that perform important military functions, shoot down long-range ballistic missiles, and conduct attacks against enemy air and surface forces.”40 The basis of this argument is that regardless of what the United States chooses to do, other nations will certainly develop space weapons over time. </span>__The U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>__relies heavily on the force enhancement__ ... <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Any weapon is only as good as the targeting intelligence and our record in that area is somewhat suspect.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Even considering these weaknesses, near-space assets can form an additional layer of persistence between satellites and air-breathers, complementing both and making the combination of systems more survivable and redundant by their presence.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">The discussions so far describe some of the persistence problems with C3ISR. This section will more fully define near-space along with its advantages and disadvantages. General John Jumper, the USAF Chief of Staff; Peter Teets, the DOD space czar; and General Lance Lord, head of Air Force Space Command, recently defined near space as the altitudes between 20 and 300 km.16 The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale defines the air and space boundary at 100 km.17 The region of near-space starts where controlled airspace ends. Over the U.S., the Federal Aviation Administration controls the airspace up to and including 60,000 feet mean sea level (Class A airspace). To provide a buffer with any near space vehicles (NSV), this paper considers the start of near-space as 65,000 ft or about 20 km. Near-space extends up to the lowest altitude that a vehicle can maintain low earth orbit, defined as 490,000 ft or about 150 km. However, near-space operations have disadvantages. </span>**__Near-space is not space...__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">For the military to exploit near-space, it must be with the understanding it has overflight rights of a country or is in a position of air dominance.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">The success of nuclear deterrence may turn out to be its own undoing. Nuclear weapons helped keep the peace in Europe throughout the Cold War, preventing the bitter dispute from engulfing the continent in another catastrophic conflict. But after nearly 65 years without a major war or a nuclear attack, many prominent statesmen, scholars, and analysts have begun to take deterrence for granted. They are now calling for a major drawdown of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and a new commitment to pursue a world without these weapons.</span> Unfortunately, **__deterrence in the twenty-first century__ ...** __**sites related to its nuclear program**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Ideally, a U.S. counterforce strike would completely destroy the enemy’s nuclear forces. But if an adversary had already launched a nuclear attack against the United States or its allies, a response that greatly reduced the adversary’s nuclear force could save countless lives, and it could open the door to decisive military actions (such as conquest and regime change) to punish the enemy’s leadership for using nuclear weapons.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">The context in which the US defense establishment thinks about long-range bombers has changed dramatically since the end of the Cold War.
