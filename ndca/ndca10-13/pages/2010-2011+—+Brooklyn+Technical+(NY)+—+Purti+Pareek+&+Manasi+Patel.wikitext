<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__NARRATIVE__ </span>**</span>

In ancient India, Women and men were viewed. They had access to the same privileges in society. It was until western imperialism when things started to change. Women were seen as a means to an end and patriarchal oppression became justifiable. What are we? Two Indian women living in the US because it offers more opportunities and freedom. However, after being exposed to the real world in the US, we realized that this is all a facade. No matter where we live, we will always be looked by men as some creature, not a human, not a woman. Our bodies are perceived as a an commodity, to be ravaged and exploited in order to preserve an order that looks to us as property. Definitely not equality. Being a woman just gives the man the right to look at me like that. When a man has sex every night with different women he is called a Pimp, applauded. But now if a woman does the same she is called the worst names possible, and degraded to the lowest level of the social ladder. 

The status quo prefers that we are to be complacent to the wrongs that are done around us. I can walk down the street it will be perfectly fine to see a man call a woman a bitch or a whore for no reason at all. Whether you’re African American Asian pacific islander Hispanic or Hindustani, if you’re a woman, you’re always inferior. I see the looks I get and how my partner and I are talked about by certain people just because we are two brown girls raging against the machine. And then we walk into a debate round and there’s some people trying to shut our voices?! WRONG.

Culturally, war is understood as a creation and creator of the culture in which it thrives. War’s violence is not understood as separate and apart from other social practices. There is a continuum of violence running from bedroom, to boardroom, factory, stadium, classroom and battlefield, “traversing our bodies and our sense of self</span></span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">.”...</span>__</span>**</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">.
