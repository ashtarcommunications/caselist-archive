**Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its defensive counterspace capabilities beyond the Earth’s mesosphere, including on-orbit satellite redundancy, micro-satellite deployment, space situational awareness, and satellite hardening and mobility.**

**Contention 1 is Hegemony**

**Current policies leave US space assets extremely vulnerable, inviting attack**
**Rendleman ‘10** - Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science)

The 11 January 2007 test of a Chinese ground-based, direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) kinetic-kill interceptor against one of their own defunct weather satellites generated considerable angst across the United States space community. The 2007 test demonstrated that the importance of space capabilities is also their Achilles heel, that is, their deadly weakness in spite of overall strength; it is far too easy to neutralize space systems and their power. In the broad strategic context, space capabilities have their own set of unique, inherent vulnerabilities, which are largely the result of orbital mechanics. This invites destruction, damage, and even just mischief delivered by even the least significant adversary. However, other nations may seek to deny U.S. advantages in space through a variety of negation and prevention actions. Negation Threats Satellite systems consist not only of spacecraft, each with their own payload and bus, but also a supporting infrastructure—ground control stations, tracking and control links, commonly referred to as the tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&C) links, data links, launch facilities, and an industrial base. Each of these components is at risk to threats of physical and cyber attack, and sabotage, and can be negated, simultaneously or each in detail. The satellite payload, bus, links, and infrastructure can be negated by using a variety of permanent or reversible means to achieve one of the five possible effects, known as the ‘‘five Ds’’—deception, disruption, denial, degradation, and destruction.5 Space-based threats proliferate as a result of the ever-growing global availability of technology and access to the space domain. There are huge incentives for states to invest in and use space, and the spread of space technologies has occurred. States with sufficient resources can now reach out to space and ‘‘touch’’ satellites through a variety of means, and achieve one and even more of the five Ds. Spacecraft are vulnerable to direct ascent weapons as demonstrated by the Chinese ASAT test, and to a variety of other groundbased, airborne, and space-based ASAT technologies. Direct-ascent launched, or orbit-based nuclear devices, can be detonated, generating radiation and other lethal effects to destroy unshielded electronics over a wide lethal range. Co-orbital ASATs could be employed, comparable to the old Soviet system that was tested extensively in the 1970s and early 80s. In a less likely scenario, space-borne mines can also be deployed in close proximity to spacecraft, or exploded to generate debris clouds that destructively engage whole classes of satellites in the same orbital plane or in crossing orbits. Ground, space-based, or airborne lasers could be used by adversaries to wreak havoc. Blinding operations could be executed and inflict effects ranging from temporary ‘‘dazzling’’ to permanent burnout of optical or other sensors with intense energy bursts. Ground systems, supporting communications, and their nodes, are vulnerable to diverse land, sea, or air kinetic attacks, including sabotage. Unprotected systems are also susceptible to electronic attack through jamming and electromagnetic deception techniques. Jammers emit signals that mask or prevent reception of desired signals; these methods can disrupt uplinks, downlinks, and even cross-links. By disabling the means of command and control, and data communications, jammers render satellites inoperable or unavailable. Electromagnetic deception techniques can be employed to confuse systems; this could include sending false, but deceptively plausible, commands that cause spacecraft to perform damaging or wasteful maneuvers, modify databases or execute configuration changes, or otherwise destroy it. Similarly, supporting terrestrial ground stations, computer networks, and links are vulnerable to information operation and cyber attacks. These attacks could involve directing global denial of service tasks, injecting fake commands, malicious software and viruses into the space system, performing unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of sensitive information (data interception), and causing unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of network information, services, and databases. In sum, there is a wide span of kinetic and other types of attacks an adversary could consider and employ. There is potential that even non-state actors can access some of these technologies and space systems, and achieve several of the five Ds; however, it is unlikely they can obtain and then employ a full-spectrum of these means and achieve all of these effects. Conducting an attack within the space domain involves a rather substantial investment to develop, acquire, operate, and sustain needed shooter, sensor, and command and control systems. Given the scope and commitment needed to affect such a move, an on-orbit attack would probably be made only in the context of a larger strategic struggle, perhaps as a prelude to or part of early combat operations. On the other hand, inexpensive jamming technology is available to even the poorest potential adversaries. As such, jamming poses the most used and growing threat to space systems. Some argue that jamming also carries with it implicit political and legal sanctions since no major space power has moved to ban or make even temporary and reversible jamming illegal. This may change now that a number of nations have banned together to object to recent Iranian satellite jamming.6 Cyber adversaries and criminals are also beginning to hone their craft. They present an evolving threat to space systems; and like jamming, cyber threats can be developed and deployed for only modest investments. Prevention Threats Prevention actions generally involve economic, political, informational, and diplomatic instruments of national power. For example, an extremely large creditor nation could employ its considerable economic clout and leverage in an attempt to compel or blackmail the United States to not license or permit imaging of its territory, preventing its use, and reducing its exposure to such observation. The creditor nation could seek to accomplish its objective by destabilizing the world market place. It could refuse to purchase treasury offerings that underpin the burgeoning U.S. fiscal and trade deficits, perhaps arguing that remote sensing, especially commercial remote sensing, of its territory infringes on its territorial and sovereign rights, or that it constitutes ‘‘unlawful’’ industrial espionage, and is thus, an unfair trade practice.7 Commercial remote sensing systems are nowan important resource for the United States Government and its national security needs. U.S. Government orders help sustain and stabilize the remote sensing industry,8 and any limitations on activities, whether for U.S. Government customers or commercial ones, imposed in response to external economic threats could evolve to cause problems. In an alternative scenario, a state, acting through political allies and proxies, could exert considerable influence and dominance to affect a change in U.S. law. This change could restrict licensing of commercial remote sensing imagery, restricting the market place and impacting business models for producers.9 As a diplomatic prevention example, adversaries could attempt to use international forums and treaties to deny frequency rights needed by U.S. military or intelligence satellites by making spurious ‘‘paper satellite’’ filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). ‘‘Paper satellites’’ involve ITU applications for satellite orbital slots, many for ‘‘speculative’’ systems that will never leave Earth. These filings can block access to scarce spectrum and orbital resources.10 The ability to place communications and other satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) positions could be held at risk. Some characterize some of these types of actions as a form of ‘‘lawfare.’’ ‘‘The term lawfare describes the growing use of international law claims, usually factually or legally meritless, as a tool of war. The goal is to gain a moral advantage over your enemy in the court of world opinion, and potentially a legal advantage in national and international tribunals.’’11 Prevention actions taken to hobble U.S. space systems are not armed attacks. As is discussed later, the use of force is only authorized under the United Nations (UN) Charter in response to an armed attack, or upon authorization of the UN Security Council. As such, using armed force to deter and defeat prevention actions involving political or diplomatic subterfuge or intrigue may be unlawful under international law. Creative alternative solutions must therefore be found to assure access to space when facing these types of threats. Implications for U.S. Space Strategy The wide span of threats poses profound implications for U.S. space strategy and its execution. First, unlike the Cold War era, the United States now confronts a wide array of global actors, all operating with different motivations and incentives, some of which could become potential adversaries who can attack or threaten space capabilities. These state and non-state adversaries exhibit a wide array of political, economic, technical, and social differences. Having many potential adversaries makes each of them harder to understand. This complicates efforts to understand motivations and to influence perceptions for deterrence purposes. These differences, in turn, increase the likelihood of misperception, undercutting strategies to protect access to space capabilities. When one’s attention is divided, deterrent measures that are appropriate for one target may not be useful, or even counterproductive, for another. This requires tailored intelligence efforts, information operations, and transparency efforts in order to avoid or minimize disputes and prevent problems. Second, the broad array of adversaries exhibit widely varying risk-taking behaviors. Risk-taking behavior can strongly influence an adversary’s perception of a situation. Understanding this phenomenon can lead to better ways of influencing those perceptions. Unfortunately, potential adversaries may not care that space systems offer tremendous value and capabilities to all nations, or care whether conflict in space could create space debris that could cost all nations access to the domain. A strategy to assure continuing access to space assets must therefore be sufficiently flexible to address both risk-averse and risk-taking adversaries. Indeed, potential adversaries may shift from risk-taking to risk-adverse over a relatively short period of time. China may fit in this category. Within a decade or two, it will have its own extensive space-based communications, navigation, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellite constellations, all of which will be integrated into its military operations. No doubt, China will embrace that evolution and become very reliant on space capabilities; this will shift it from an asymmetric competitor to one similar to the United States or Russia. Third, with the demise of the Soviet Union, some political commentators and critics described the United States as a ‘‘hyperpower’’ not just a ‘‘superpower.’’ 12 Though buffeted by recent events involving Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and the 2008 global financial meltdown, U.S. military supremacy continues. But, that supremacy does not make or guarantee a successful space strategy. Adversaries may believe they have a higher stake than the United States in the outcome of a particular crisis or conflict. Alternatively, the United States stake in the crisis may not be commensurate with the possible cost of involvement by the United States military and the rest of its national security apparatus. The first alternative may encourage mischief by adversaries; the second discourages U.S. action. As a result, adversaries may find threats of U.S. action in response to hostile acts affecting U.S. access to space systems to be non-credible. Fourth, while the United States has produced superlative space capabilities, it has not produced enough systems ready to survive the new kinetic, exotic, jamming, and cyber threat environment. The vulnerability exists because the spacecraft developed and deployed today are in many ways the same as those originally fielded during the Cold War. During that epic struggle, there was a tacit and then explicit understanding that each superpower would not attack and overwhelm the other’s space systems, except in the direst of circumstances, perhaps during the throes of a nuclear conflagration. Indeed, a number of agreements between the superpowers adopted the understanding and ruled out interference with national technical means, including space assets. This belief in the superiority of space systems and power blinds the United States to the inherent strategic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in these systems. This, predictably, can now be exploited by potential adversaries, such as China, who, with their recent ASAT test, appear more willing to fully explore the technologies needed to expand the limits of conventional war to include the space domain. Consequently, by historically and diplomatically reducing the threat, engineering of some satellite threat detection, attack avoidance, and other defense subsystems have not matured enough so that they are sophisticated, nimble, and robust enough to counter new 21st Century adversary attack capabilities.

**Offensive deterrence fails – a new system of defensive deterrence is necessary – it dissuades attacks, solves problems of asymmetrical capabilities, and ensures that even if we were attacked we’d be protected**
**Butterworth ‘8** (President of Aries Analytics, served on staff of President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and at the DoD, Washington Roundtable on Science & Public Policy, “Deterrence in Space”, Nov. 13, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.marshall.org/pdf/materials/622.pdf]]</span>)

So I want to insist on this distinction between deterrence and defense. It has been very useful for a very long time and I would hate to see it be occluded just because we are now talking about space rather than nuclear weapons. The distinction is one between punishment and denial, between prevention and retaliation, a question of the capability, and a question of the capability to attain an objective versus the cost/benefits of doing so. For example, I might decide that someone in the audience is interested in pushing me off the podium (which could well happen soon, but maybe not quite yet). If I had a defense policy, I would simply arm myself and say, “You can’t do it. Give it a try, but it won’t work.” If I had a deterrence policy, on the other hand, I might well recognize that you are younger and more vigorous and there are more of you and that you could certainly push me off. But if I had my hands on your little baby daughter and a vat of lye here, I could certainly tell you that if you push me off, I will dump her in the lye. And if you believe that, you might not push me off. The difference between a threat of punishment or a threat of retaliation and a capability to protect an objective – that is what I am trying to insist on. The chief problems that we have found with trying to pursue a deterrence policy with nuclear weapons during the Cold War are as follows: first of all, if your deterrence policy fails for any reason at all, accident or whatever, you lose. All you can do at that point is to exercise your punishment threat, if you want to. And revenge might in fact be sweet, but it’s not the first order of business. Under a deterrence policy, you have made little or no provision for what you would want to do if deterrence fails. What you haven’t done, then, is to pursue what Frederick Iklé recommended, which is to think through how a war would end and what kind of capabilities you would want if your deterrence failed. Closely related to that is the fact that you don’t know how to make a deterrence policy work, because it’s in the eye of the other side and how the other side views things in general, not just in peace time but in a crisis time, a time when everything looks bleak, or maybe in a time when the drums of war have been pounding and the times are driving everyone toward a crisis, as in the summer of 1914 perhaps. Then there is the problem of what the other side is. It is hard enough to figure out what our side is. We have a congeries of actors, of bureaucrats, of organizations, of views and perceptions. Do we really understand the other side so well as to make the threat that we use precisely meaningful to them in a way that they believe it and that they will, in fact, be deterred? To the extent that we do understand the views of the other side, we essentially become prisoner of their strategic outlooks, and that can lead to a bit of a Catch-22. For example, when Secretary Weinberger changed our nuclear strategy, he did so in response to what we had found out about how the Soviets viewed the prospects of nuclear war. They tended to value the capability for a long, protracted war much more than we ever did. As a result, Secretary Weinberger made that a part of our declaratory strategy, that we would have the capability to persist under nuclear conditions, the idea being that that would speak more loudly to the Soviets in terms of their calculations and assessments as to how the war would actually go. But of course as he did that, our own side started complaining, “Wait a minute, we are thinking about making nuclear war more winnable, and if you make it more winnable or if you act as if it could be winnable, isn’t that going to undercut deterrence because it will make the other side worry that you might actually launch one?” There is no way out of these “Alice in Wonderland” semantic traps once you step out to try to pursue this policy of deterrence. The question is one of communication and shared understanding, not your real intention, but what the other side believes it to be. How can you be credible about that threat of revenge when that is the last option for a rational response? It is very difficult. It leads to lots of questions about nibbling at the edges, of escalation dominance, ties to allies, and all that stuff that we had to deal with during the period of the Cold War. But also, of course, as we saw, it requires serious amounts of money to put it together. And as I mentioned before, it wasn’t in fact our nuclear strategy, or if it was, it was so only for about two minutes when McNamara first talked about mutually assured destruction. But after that, we had something that was militarily much more sensible. Those are key problems with the deterrence strategy that we saw in the nuclear era. How does it apply to space systems? Well, it is actually even trickier, I think. John’s paper elaborates on these sins in some better detail as well. Let me just summarize a few. One, we can’t do a tit-for-tat kind of strategy: if they hit our satellites, we’ll hit theirs. There is absolutely nobody in the world that depends on space to the degree that we do, that has so fully integrated space systems into theater and global military power. That is one of our great strengths and an asymmetrical advantage that the United States has. So if we take away the Chinese satellites or take away the Russian satellites, it has nowhere near the same effect and presumably won’t be as deterring as their efforts to target ours. If we fail to protect our satellites, that will have direct battlefield consequences, because those satellites are not just space support, they are an integral part of how we do business in the military today. It can be very difficult to identify who is attacking you, so if you have trouble with one of your satellite support systems, it could be quite tricky to decide whether it was Venezuela or Indonesia or China or whoever. It wasn’t that hard to decide who was launching ICBMs against us; that part was certainly easier during the Cold War. What is important, I think, is that the inseparability of our space capabilities from our total national security relationship, whether it is theater power or global capabilities, means that we are going to have a different view of what is meaningful in terms of threats and capabilities than anyone else. We have to make sure that if we are going to pursue deterrence, that we have punishment that links up to whatever it is that we are trying to dissuade people from attacking, and that can be enormously difficult for us, because to be effective our deterrence strategies must take into account our overall context. But we don’t have to worry about those, in fact, and this is my final point, because we really don’t need them for our space systems. We have defense programs that are available. We have technology that doesn’t require miracles to be implemented. We can do a lot of strategic things to protect them and it is not going to cost us as much as the National Reconnaissance Program, for example, by a long shot. For example, we could try rapid augmentation and reconstitution of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites. That would in itself the benefits of initial attack. We could have a quick-planned launch for our LEO birds and have silent spares, for example, for ones in higher orbits. That is an option. We could have tighter coordination with our allied and commercial systems and create a virtual armada that could preclude a sudden and debilitating strike against our systems and would also complicate the targeting of someone who was trying to take after us in space. Those are near-term things that we could do actually starting this year. A little further away, we can improve our space situational awareness, which is going to take a while, and improve our command and control for active measures, such as orbit adjustments or perhaps intercepting things that are on their way up to get us in higher orbits. We might also move toward a distributed architecture for our military support systems. What is interesting about this as well is not only that these things that are real defenses and don’t depend on the deterrent threat of punishment, but that they have also don’t put weapons in space nor do they invite warfare in space. We need space in order for warfare here on the ground, but we don’t particularly need warfare in space. So in sum, I am urging you to consider only the capability to deny someone the military incentive to strike our space assets. That is the defense option, a response to more of the risks that might initiate attacks and that provides more options for limiting the consequences if those attacks should happen. The defense of our military assets in space is possible without requiring miracles of technology. They are sustainable and effective, no matter what other governments or their constituent elements believe. The defenses provide options that we want if the attacks do come anyway. And if an attack is then seen as too difficult to blind or deafen us, then presumably opponents will seek options other than attacks on our satellites. Now if you want to say then that they are deterred, fine. They might be inhibited, dissuaded, discouraged, diverted – I don’t care. But if they get it wrong and they do try to attack us, we have something that we can do about it and we can survive. So our mantra in responding to those would threaten our space assets, I think, should be, in keeping with the latest campaign, “No, you can’t.” If you seek defense, I think deterrence will look after itself.

**Hardening and redundancy is key to protect our assets – diplomacy fails against rogue actors**
**Haddick ‘11** Robert, Managing Editor of Small Wars Journal, “Lost In Space” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/02/11/this_week_at_war_lost_in_space?page=0,1]]</span>

The U.S. Department of Defense released its first-ever <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2011/0111_nsss/docs/NationalSecuritySpaceStrategyUnclassifiedSummary_Jan2011.pdf|National Security Space Strategy]]</span> (NSSS), on Feb. 4. The document "seeks to maintain and enhance the national security benefits" the United States derives from its activities and capabilities in space. This week, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=255|Gregory Schulte]]</span>, deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy, explained the new policy in <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/02/09/the_final_frontier|an essay]]</span> for Foreign Policy. Schulte described the benefits the United States receives from a wide variety of surveillance, communications, and navigation satellites. He also noted the increasing competition among a growing number of players who are seeking their own advantageous positions in orbit. Schulte explained some clever diplomatic and soft-power strategies that U.S. officials hope will protect the country's space interests, along with some hedges in case the soft-power strategies fail. However, growing those hedges could get very expensive for the Pentagon. Of greatest worry to the Pentagon is the vulnerability of its satellites to attack. In 2007, China shot down one of its old weather satellites with a direct-ascent missile, demonstrating its ability to threaten the space systems on which U.S. military forces depend. In addition to missile attack, many commercial and Defense Department satellites are also vulnerable to directed energy (laser) attack and to electronic jamming. U.S. adversaries may view attacks on U.S. satellites as a high-payoff/low-risk strategy. By attacking U.S. satellites, an adversary could hobble U.S. military forces without the usual indications of warfare, at least in the public's perception. For example, without any images of explosions, burning buildings, or wounded civilians, U.S. policymakers might find it difficult to generate political and diplomatic support for a military response. As Schulte explained, U.S. officials hope to use diplomacy and soft-power tools to deter attacks on satellite networks. The first such hoped-for line of deterrence is to establish a code of conduct and international norms against attacks on space infrastructure. A second strategy is for the United States to share some its defense-related space platforms with other countries. In this case, an adversary with designs on U.S. space assets would be forced to attack a shared platform, and thus attack an alliance of countries and not just the United States. U.S. officials hope that such a complication would deter such an attack in the first place. Such soft-power methods might not be effective against determined adversaries who may already be isolated from the international system and thus have little more to lose from violating international norms or alliances. The NSSS hedges against the failure of the soft-power approaches. Proposed hedges include hardening satellites against kinetic and electronic attack and keeping redundant satellites standing by in launch position to rapidly replace those destroyed. Another hedge is to vastly increase the number of reconnaissance aircraft and terrestrial communication platforms as substitutes for space-based systems. Finally, the Air Force -- operator of the global positioning navigation satellite system and thus the service most familiar with that system's vulnerabilities -- is seeking in its <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101130-062.pdf|technology roadmap]]</span> to devise a new system of precise navigation that won't rely on satellites. Hedging against the vulnerability of space-based systems will not be cheap. And if soft-power strategies and redundant hedges fail, the Pentagon reserves the right, as Schulte <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4765|explained]]</span> at a Pentagon briefing "to respond in self-defense to attacks on space. And the response may not be in space either." With much more to lose in space than any other adversary, an escalating war in space is the last thing the Pentagon would like to see. Thus the threat to shift the mode of retaliation to terrain an adversary may value most. Although the U.S. government's diplomatic and soft-power tactics to defend its interests in space are clever, they may not be enough against rogue state or non-state actors with few of their own assets at risk. In this case, the Pentagon will need to harden and diversify its space assets or develop terrestrial work-arounds that avoid its vulnerabilities in space. Those costly solutions could not come at a worse time for the Pentagon's budget masters.

**The plan is key to deterrence by denial – it destroys the incentive for conflict**
**Sheldon ‘8** (John Sheldon - was program director for Space Security at the Centre for Defence and International Security Studies, Fellow at the Marshall Institute, Washington Roundtable on Science & Public Policy, “Deterrence in Space”, Nov. 13, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.marshall.org/pdf/materials/622.pdf]]</span>)

There are more concrete measures for deterring attacks on U.S. satellite systems. I have five possible measures that we could perhaps use or at least put in place that might help support a deterrence strategy to deter attacks on U.S. satellite systems. These are not exhaustive; they are just suggestions as a springboard for further discussion. Try and pursue a strategy of deterrence by denial. Deny the adversary the benefits of attacking your satellite systems by installing, whenever possible, passive defenses on satellites, such as hardening against electromagnetic pulse attacks, measures to make jamming more difficult, and ablative shielding to help satellites both withstand actual physical attacks and survive space debris impacts. Eventually, as individual threats become more defined, active defenses should also be seriously considered, although this will be much further in the future. In tandem with passive defenses, develop and accelerate programs for rapid launch of satellites to reconstitute lost systems and to bolster constellations in times of crisis. Also needed are spare satellites in storage here on earth that can be launched at short notice. While the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) program is seeking to address these issues with the use of small satellites, efforts should also be made to speed up the time it takes to place larger satellites and more traditional systems that are being used in orbit.

**China is developing offensive capabilities in preparation for a coming attack on our space assets – high-ranking PLA and CCP officials agree – cites multiple insider studies**
**Houpt 10/31** – M.A. in Security Studies from Georgetown (Danny, “A new policy typology to better understand the goals of China’s space program,” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/1]]</span>, dml)

Little is known about the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) actual capability to wage war in space. What has been demonstrated, however, including the 2007 ASAT test and reports of China blinding US intelligence satellites, has caused much consternation across the world. One aspect of Chinese military aspirations in space that has been studied is the internal publications of the PLA and its stated views on space doctrine. Increasingly, these writings have accepted the inevitability of the weaponization of space and called for appropriate preparations to be made to successfully wage war in space. Given the dual-use nature of most space technology, it is no surprise that China’s military uses of space are advancing commensurately with its civilian and commercial programs. First of all, China is widely known to have an array of intelligence satellites for space reconnaissance and surveillance. The Ziyuan Earth observation satellite is known to be one of these, but China has also fielded the Fanhui Shi Weixing, or Retrievable Satellite, which drops canisters of film from space.15 China’s ongoing microsatellite program has sparked some of the most concern abroad. Aside from intelligence satellites, microsatellites have many potential offensive uses such as maneuvering in range of an adversary’s satellite and either latching on—a “parasitic microsat”—to disrupt proper functions, or merely exploding within range of a target satellite to destroy it. Furthermore, the ability to deploy a constellation of microsatellites on short notice, a capability China may already possess with its Kaituozhe launch vehicle, denies the deterrence factor that could otherwise prevent offensive attacks on an adversary’s space assets for fear of retaliation. China’s rocket technology also has proven offensive military use in space: the ability to shoot down enemy assets in space through direct ascent attacks. China demonstrated such ability in 2007, which has been the impetus for much of the recent speculation about China’s military space aspirations. Despite political blowback from this test (it resulted in a 20 percent increase in the total amount of trackable space debris in low Earth orbit), China may still be pursuing ASAT technologies.16 In January 2010 China conducted a successful test of its ground-based midcourse missile interception technology. This test used technology similar to its 2007 ASAT test and, as exemplified by the US Navy-led Operation Burnt Frost that intercepted the satellite USA 193, missile defense technology can serve ASAT ends. In addition to these hard-kill capabilities, China has the capability to use soft-kill measures to neutralize adversary’s space assets. China is known to have the means to jam satellite communication and GPS receivers and is developing directed energy ASATs, including high-powered microwave and particle beam weapons.17 The US Department of Defense (DoD), in their annual report to Congress on China’s military modernization, also notes that China is developing ground-based laser ASATs, the beginnings of which may have already been demonstrated. In 2006 the director of the National Reconnaissance Office, Donald Kerr, substantiated reports that China used a ground-based laser to dazzle a US spy satellite over its territory. Although this laser could not do any long-term damage, similar techniques and capabilities used to track and dazzle this satellite could be coupled with more powerful ground-based lasers to destroy space assets. Some reports actually indicate China has already tested and deployed a ground-based ASAT laser that can target assets in LEO.18 Despite the array of activity the PLA conducts in and through space, they seem to lack a specific doctrine for the employment of their space capabilities and have not made public any substantial plans for military uses of space. In lieu of a formal declaration on space, there is a growing literature from within the PLA ranks that may be forming the basis for what later becomes stated—or unstated—PLA space doctrine. These authors generally hold the same assumptions about space, including the inevitability that space will be a domain of war in the future.19 Many also acknowledge that establishing space dominance will be crucial to fully exploiting wartime necessities such as control of airspace and secure command and control.20 Three internal Chinese sources are largely cited as being the defining PLA space doctrine writings: Space War by Colonel Li Daguang; On Space Operations by Colonel Jia Junming; and Joint Space War Campaigns by Colonel Yuan Zelu.21 Colonel Li highlights many specific recommendations to develop the PLA’s space fighting capabilities, including fielding offensive capabilities capable of “destroying or temporarily incapacitating all enemy space vehicles that fly in space above our sovereign territory.” Other recommendations include focusing development on land-based anti-satellite weapons and anti-satellite satellites as well as “assassin’s mace” space weapons that could deal a crippling blow to an enemy. Particularly important to foreign perceptions of China, these writings also call for China to combine military and civilian technology and integrate peacetime and wartime facilities. Other authors on the subject promote such actions as: fielding sea-launched anti-satellite weapons, attacking GPS with high energy laser weapons, fielding stealthy space satellites and weapons, and seeking the ability to attack terrestrial targets from space. Kevin Pollpeter, summing up the view of most Chinese authors writing on the subject, writes, “The development of space technology will inevitably lead to the militarization of space and space militarization will lead to confrontation in space. As the struggle over air and space control is becoming the new focal point of war, space will become the main battlefield of future wars.”22 Pollpeter also notes that throughout his extensive review of Chinese space writings, there were no rebuttals to the view that China will inevitability develop and use counterspace weapons. These views also seem to be held by some in the upper echelons of the PLA. In November 2009, PLA Air Force (PLAAF) commander Xu Qiliang stated in an interview with the PLA Daily newspaper, an official government publication, that the militarization of space is a “historical inevitability” and called on the PLAAF to develop offensive and defensive capabilities in space.23 Xu is not only the head of the PLAAF, but as of 2007 was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (CCCP) and a member of the Central Military Commission (CMC)—two primary policy decision making bodies in China. The Foreign Ministry tried to backtrack on Xu’s comments days later by reiterating that China has “all along upheld the peaceful use of outer space,” and would not be part of a space arms race.24 However, Xu did not personally retract his statements and, given his elite government position, this interview could actually be exemplary of how some of China’s top official’s views space. Indeed, there is some indication the CCCP acknowledges the need to prepare for the weaponization of space. In December 2010, the official publication of the CCCP, the Qiushi Journal, on its website released an article that spoke to China’s perspectives on space war:

Currently, the configuration of global space technologies and assets is highly desirable from a US perspective.67 The US has begun to rely heavily on space assets for a myriad of capabilities in recent years. Some have voiced worries that the United States will lose its lead as the global innovator in technology or that an enemy could make technological leaps that would give it significant advantages.68 That is possible, but by no means a foregone conclusion.69 However one thing is clear, “technology will proliferate.”70 Space technology has become increasingly available to any country or multinational corporation with the ability to fund the research or acquire the technology and place it in orbit.71 The increasing proliferation of launch and satellite capabilities, as well as the development of anti-satellite capabilities has begun to level the playing field.72 Adversary technological advances in kinetic-energy weapons causing structural damage by impacting the target with one or more high-speed masses, directed-energy weapons that are either ground- or air-based systems never getting close to their target, and nuclear weapons that detonate at an empty point in space could put our space assets at risk in the near future.73 Kinetic-energy weapons such as China‘s 11 January 2007 successful test of a direct-ascent, kinetic-kill anti-satellite (ASAT) vehicle destroying an inactive Chinese weather satellite generating thousands of pieces of space debris that threatened many operational spacecraft is of growing concern.74 Another kinetic energy weapon that is of concern is microsatellites (microsats). Currently, at least 40 countries have demonstrated some ability to design, build, launch, and operate microsats.75 Microsats can maneuver in such a way to observe and disrupt operations of orbiting assets. These microsats may soon be capable of harassing or destroying larger satellites at virtually any altitude.76 Because these satellites are so small, they may not be easily detectable as part of a payload or when maneuvering in space. Directed-energy weapons are laser, radio frequency, and particle beam weapons. Lasers operate by delivering energy onto the surface of the target and gradual or rapid absorption of this energy leads to several forms of thermal damage.77 Radio frequency (RF) weapons such as the high-power microwave (HPM) have either ground-and space-based RF emitters that fire an intense burst of radio energy at a satellite, disabling electronic components.78 Nuclear weapons are perhaps the technology of most concern to US space assets. Some argue though that adversaries would desist from using nuclear weapons in space out of fear of retaliation.79 While others say “what better way to use nuclear weapons than to destroy a key military capability of an enemy country without killing any of its population.”80 Regardless of the arguments, one thing is clear; a nuclear detonation would have three huge environmental effects in space: electromagnetic pulse (EMP), transient nuclear radiation, and thermal radiation.81 EMP from a nuclear detonation will induce potentially damaging voltages and currents in unprotected electronic circuits and components virtually rendering space assets inoperative.82 Increased radiation from such a detonation would also have profound effects on the space environment. This would severely damage nearby orbiting satellites reducing the lifetime of satellites in LEO from years to months or less and make satellite operations futile for many months.83 The risk of this potential threat is significant. To execute this mission, all that is needed is a rocket and a simple nuclear device.84 Countries such as Iran, North Korea, Iraq, and Pakistan possess such missiles that could carry warheads to the necessary altitudes to perform such missions.85 Technological advances in adversary weaponry are certainly hard to predict even in the near term. However, if this weaponry matures enough and is successfully used it will create additional space debris from the orbiting satellites being rendered inoperative (space junk) and becoming potential hazards to other satellites.

**Absent reinforcement of deterrent capabilities space conflicts erupt – this destroys our assets**

He served in the Pentagon’s National Security Space Office as the Chief of the Future Concepts shop (M.V., Toward a Theory of Space Power: Selected Essays, February, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf]]</span>)

Spacefaring prowess is a common attribute of the dominant powers in the world today. Special attention must be paid to so-called rogue states that have access to space-related technology and may even be spacefaring but do not have the conventional forces to achieve their policy aims. Those aims tend to be very intense, and these players may seek space weapons as an asymmetric hedge against spacefaring adversaries who may try to coerce them.
The dominant military powers in the world, some of whom are potential adversaries, also tend to be the dominant spacefaring states. Because of the economic benefits and exponential enhancements that spacepower delivers to terrestrial warfighting, those states are under increasing pressure to defend their space systems and to counter those of their potential adversaries. This may lead to a space weapons race and an immediate escalation of hostilities to "wipe the skies" of enemy satellites should war break out between two or more dominant military space powers.29
When assessing the interplay between the spectrum of conflict and the spectrum of belligerents, it may be the case that war between two weak actors will not likely extend into space. However, if the power is perceived to be disparate, a weak actor is far more likely to use space weapons against a powerful state as an asymmetric defensive move.30 A powerful state may counter the space systems in use by a weaker adversary, but it is likely to do so by placing diplomatic pressure on commercial vendors, or executing attacks on their ground stations, or launching highly selective covert attacks on the satellites they use by employing temporary and reversible means.
Should two dominant spacefaring powers go directly to war with each other with intense motives, both will find it critical to preserve their space systems and will consider it a dangerous liability to allow their enemy to exploit theirs. Given the ability of spacepower to cut the fog and friction of war while connecting military forces at the tactical, operational, and strategic level, it is likely that space systems will be primary targets that will be negated in the opening moves of war. The fight for space is likely to be intense and brief. Temporary means of negation will likely switch to permanent methods of destruction to remove doubt in the minds of commanders.

**Our assets are key to hegemony – they’re critical to the credibility and effectiveness of forward-deployed troops**
**Marshall ‘8** - NASA Ames Research Center (Will, Astropolitics, 6:154–199, “REDUCING THE VULNERABILITY OF SPACE ASSETS: A MULTITIERED MICROSATELLITE CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE,” Ebsco Political Science)

Space assets are one of the most critical ‘‘Achilles’ heels’’ of the current military capability of the United States (U.S.). This is for two reasons: (1) the U.S. military space systems—in particular reconnaissance, navigation, signals intelligence, early warning, and communications systems—are critical to modern military warfare and intelligence; and (2) space systems are inherently vulnerable to attack. This combination is understood at the highest levels and was espoused in the ‘‘Rumsfeld Space Commission’’ with talk of a ‘‘Space Pearl Harbor.’’1 Whether one agrees with the tone, this is a genuine security problem for the U.S. in need of a near-term solution. While there have been numerous papers, and much media and academic attention, in the space security discussion focused on promoting or criticizing space-based weapons,2 there have been far fewer papers and studies offering constructive ways forward that deal with these genuine security concerns in a broader sense.3 The central motivation for this paper is to put forward one key element—the satellite architecture—in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. space assets. It is hoped that this idea, together with others like it, should stimulate and contribute to a debate on more constructive ways forward for how to achieve space security in the post-Cold war world. Importance of Space Assets For better or worse, it is clear that the U.S. military is to some significant extent dependent on its key satellites, which number about 86–105 operational satellites at present. These satellites constitute a significant part of the eyes, ears, and central nervous system of the modern military.4 A practical example that helps to illustrate this is the case of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. First, the decision to go was based in part on satellite imagery and signals intelligence from satellites; whether or not it was interpreted or used correctly is a separate issue. Second, the planning and operation were facilitated by satellite imagery. Third, many planes, ships, tanks, and units’ positions were known through Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and even most munitions were guided by GPS. Fourth, the operation was commanded from the U.S. in large part through the use of communications satellites. Perhaps more importantly than any of the functions in the Iraq example, early warning (EW) satellites are the U.S.’s and Russia’s first warning of nuclear missile attack. As Gray classified, space assets have moved from being ‘‘useful and important’’ to an ‘‘indispensable adjunct’’ in the military over the last decade.5 Space assets are definitely used a great deal by the U.S. military, but that does not mean necessarily as strong a dependence as Gray implies. The loss of U.S. space assets could range in its effect anywhere from a loss to the U.S. military in practical operations, to being catastrophic to U.S. security. The former would entail a reduction in operational effectiveness or speed, but fundamentally supposes that back-up systems and/or redundancy allow a near continuation of military capability. The latter scenario would entail an effective disablement of the U.S. military capability from normal operations. In reality, the significance lies between these boundaries, but this is a topic that could benefit from further research.

**Hegemony based on forward-deployed presence de-escalates conflicts because of promotion of democracy, free trade, bandwagoning, prevention of proliferation and terrorism, and has empirically led to a comparatively better world. The alternative is great-power conflict and leads to extinction.**
**Thayer ‘6** Associate Professor in the Department of Defense and Strategic Studies at Missouri State University [Bradley, In Defense of Primacy, The National Interest, December (lexis)]

A grand strategy based on American primacy means ensuring the United States stays the world's number one power--the diplomatic, economic and military leader. Those arguing against primacy claim that the United States should retrench, either because the United States lacks the power to maintain its primacy and should withdraw from its global commitments, or because the maintenance of primacy will lead the United States into the trap of "imperial overstretch." In the previous issue of The National Interest, Christopher Layne warned of these dangers of primacy and called for retrenchment.1 Those arguing for a grand strategy of retrenchment are a diverse lot. They include isolationists, who want no foreign military commitments; selective engagers, who want U.S. military commitments to centers of economic might; and offshore balancers, who want a modified form of selective engagement that would have the United States abandon its landpower presence abroad in favor of relying on airpower and seapower to defend its interests. But retrenchment, in any of its guises, must be avoided. If the United States adopted such a strategy, it would be a profound strategic mistake that would lead to far greater instability and war in the world, imperil American security and deny the United States and its allies the benefits of primacy. There are two critical issues in any discussion of America's grand strategy: Can America remain the dominant state? Should it strive to do this? America can remain dominant due to its prodigious military, economic and soft power capabilities. The totality of that equation of power answers the first issue. The United States has overwhelming military capabilities and wealth in comparison to other states or likely potential alliances. Barring some disaster or tremendous folly, that will remain the case for the foreseeable future. With few exceptions, even those who advocate retrenchment acknowledge this. So the debate revolves around the desirability of maintaining American primacy. Proponents of retrenchment focus a great deal on the costs of U.S. action--but they fail to realize what is good about American primacy. The price and risks of primacy are reported in newspapers every day; the benefits that stem from it are not. A GRAND strategy of ensuring American primacy takes as its starting point the protection of the U.S. homeland and American global interests. These interests include ensuring that critical resources like oil flow around the world, that the global trade and monetary regimes flourish and that Washington's worldwide network of allies is reassured and protected. Allies are a great asset to the United States, in part because they shoulder some of its burdens. Thus, it is no surprise to see NATO in Afghanistan or the Australians in East Timor. In contrast, a strategy based on retrenchment will not be able to achieve these fundamental objectives of the United States. Indeed, retrenchment will make the United States less secure than the present grand strategy of primacy. This is because threats will exist no matter what role America chooses to play in international politics. Washington cannot call a "time out", and it cannot hide from threats. Whether they are terrorists, rogue states or rising powers, history shows that threats must be confronted. Simply by declaring that the United States is "going home", thus abandoning its commitments or making unconvincing half-pledges to defend its interests and allies, does not mean that others will respect American wishes to retreat. To make such a declaration implies weakness and emboldens aggression. In the anarchic world of the animal kingdom, predators prefer to eat the weak rather than confront the strong. The same is true of the anarchic world of international politics. If there is no diplomatic solution to the threats that confront the United States, then the conventional and strategic military power of the United States is what protects the country from such threats. And when enemies must be confronted, a strategy based on primacy focuses on engaging enemies overseas, away from American soil. Indeed, a key tenet of the Bush Doctrine is to attack terrorists far from America's shores and not to wait while they use bases in other countries to plan and train for attacks against the United States itself. This requires a physical, on-the-ground presence that cannot be achieved by offshore balancing. Indeed, as Barry Posen has noted, U.S. primacy is secured because America, at present, commands the "global commons"--the oceans, the world's airspace and outer space--allowing the United States to project its power far from its borders, while denying those common avenues to its enemies. As a consequence, the costs of power projection for the United States and its allies are reduced, and the robustness of the United States' conventional and strategic deterrent capabilities is increased.2 This is not an advantage that should be relinquished lightly. A remarkable fact about international politics today--in a world where American primacy is clearly and unambiguously on display--is that countries want to align themselves with the United States. Of course, this is not out of any sense of altruism, in most cases, but because doing so allows them to use the power of the United States for their own purposes--their own protection, or to gain greater influence. Of 192 countries, 84 are allied with America--their security is tied to the United States through treaties and other informal arrangements--and they include almost all of the major economic and military powers. That is a ratio of almost 17 to one (85 to five), and a big change from the Cold War when the ratio was about 1.8 to one of states aligned with the United States versus the Soviet Union. Never before in its history has this country, or any country, had so many allies. U.S. primacy--and the bandwagoning effect--has also given us extensive influence in international politics, allowing the United States to shape the behavior of states and international institutions. Such influence comes in many forms, one of which is America's ability to create coalitions of like-minded states to free Kosovo, stabilize Afghanistan, invade Iraq or to stop proliferation through the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI ). Doing so allows the United States to operate with allies outside of the UN, where it can be stymied by opponents. American-led wars in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq stand in contrast to the UN's inability to save the people of Darfur or even to conduct any military campaign to realize the goals of its charter. The quiet effectiveness of the PSI in dismantling Libya's WMD programs and unraveling the A. Q. Khan proliferation network are in sharp relief to the typically toothless attempts by the UN to halt proliferation. You can count with one hand countries opposed to the United States. They are the "Gang of Five": China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Venezuela. Of course, countries like India, for example, do not agree with all policy choices made by the United States, such as toward Iran, but New Delhi is friendly to Washington. Only the "Gang of Five" may be expected to consistently resist the agenda and actions of the United States. China is clearly the most important of these states because it is a rising great power. But even Beijing is intimidated by the United States and refrains from openly challenging U.S. power. China proclaims that it will, if necessary, resort to other mechanisms of challenging the United States, including asymmetric strategies such as targeting communication and intelligence satellites upon which the United States depends. But China may not be confident those strategies would work, and so it is likely to refrain from testing the United States directly for the foreseeable future because China's power benefits, as we shall see, from the international order U.S. primacy creates. The other states are far weaker than China. For three of the "Gang of Five" cases--Venezuela, Iran, Cuba--it is an anti-U.S. regime that is the source of the problem; the country itself is not intrinsically anti-American. Indeed, a change of regime in Caracas, Tehran or Havana could very well reorient relations. THROUGHOUT HISTORY, peace and stability have been great benefits of an era where there was a dominant power--Rome, Britain or the United States today. Scholars and statesmen have long recognized the irenic effect of power on the anarchic world of international politics. Everything we think of when we consider the current international order--free trade, a robust monetary regime, increasing respect for human rights, growing democratization--is directly linked to U.S. power. Retrenchment proponents seem to think that the current system can be maintained without the current amount of U.S. power behind it. In that they are dead wrong and need to be reminded of one of history's most significant lessons: Appalling things happen when international orders collapse. The Dark Ages followed Rome's collapse. Hitler succeeded the order established at Versailles. Without U.S. power, the liberal order created by the United States will end just as assuredly. As country and western great Ral Donner sang: "You don't know what you've got (until you lose it)." Consequently, it is important to note what those good things are. In addition to ensuring the security of the United States and its allies, American primacy within the international system causes many positive outcomes for Washington and the world. The first has been a more peaceful world. During the Cold War, U.S. leadership reduced friction among many states that were historical antagonists, most notably France and West Germany. Today, American primacy helps keep a number of complicated relationships aligned--between Greece and Turkey, Israel and Egypt, South Korea and Japan, India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia. This is not to say it fulfills Woodrow Wilson's vision of ending all war. Wars still occur where Washington's interests are not seriously threatened, such as in Darfur, but a Pax Americana does reduce war's likelihood, particularly war's worst form: great power wars. Second, American power gives the United States the ability to spread democracy and other elements of its ideology of liberalism. Doing so is a source of much good for the countries concerned as well as the United States because, as John Owen noted on these pages in the Spring 2006 issue, liberal democracies are more likely to align with the United States and be sympathetic to the American worldview.3 So, spreading democracy helps maintain U.S. primacy. In addition, once states are governed democratically, the likelihood of any type of conflict is significantly reduced. This is not because democracies do not have clashing interests. Indeed they do. Rather, it is because they are more open, more transparent and more likely to want to resolve things amicably in concurrence with U.S. leadership. And so, in general, democratic states are good for their citizens as well as for advancing the interests of the United States. Critics have faulted the Bush Administration for attempting to spread democracy in the Middle East, labeling such an effort a modern form of tilting at windmills. It is the obligation of Bush's critics to explain why democracy is good enough for Western states but not for the rest, and, one gathers from the argument, should not even be attempted. Of course, whether democracy in the Middle East will have a peaceful or stabilizing influence on America's interests in the short run is open to question. Perhaps democratic Arab states would be more opposed to Israel, but nonetheless, their people would be better off. The United States has brought democracy to Afghanistan, where 8.5 million Afghans, 40 percent of them women, voted in a critical October 2004 election, even though remnant Taliban forces threatened them. The first free elections were held in Iraq in January 2005. It was the military power of the United States that put Iraq on the path to democracy. Washington fostered democratic governments in Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Caucasus. Now even the Middle East is increasingly democratic. They may not yet look like Western-style democracies, but democratic progress has been made in Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Iraq, Kuwait, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt. By all accounts, the march of democracy has been impressive. Third, along with the growth in the number of democratic states around the world has been the growth of the global economy. With its allies, the United States has labored to create an economically liberal worldwide network characterized by free trade and commerce, respect for international property rights, and mobility of capital and labor markets. The economic stability and prosperity that stems from this economic order is a global public good from which all states benefit, particularly the poorest states in the Third World. The United States created this network not out of altruism but for the benefit and the economic well-being of America. This economic order forces American industries to be competitive, maximizes efficiencies and growth, and benefits defense as well because the size of the economy makes the defense burden manageable. Economic spin-offs foster the development of military technology, helping to ensure military prowess. Perhaps the greatest testament to the benefits of the economic network comes from Deepak Lal, a former Indian foreign service diplomat and researcher at the World Bank, who started his career confident in the socialist ideology of post-independence India. Abandoning the positions of his youth, Lal now recognizes that the only way to bring relief to desperately poor countries of the Third World is through the adoption of free market economic policies and globalization, which are facilitated through American primacy.4 As a witness to the failed alternative economic systems, Lal is one of the strongest academic proponents of American primacy due to the economic prosperity it provides.

**Hegemony is better than any alternative – even if there are some disadvantages to maintaining it we can’t risk the costs of allowing for a rapid decline**
**Goure ’11** (Daniel, Vice President with the Lexington Institute, “Unsettled World Won’t Let US Reduce Its Military,” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.defpro.com/news/details/20969/?SID=3f7de7dc9a8343394bd7e1cfb97fd429]]</span>, dml, We don’t endorse the gendered language)

The conventional wisdom in the national security community is that the United States must and will reduce its expenditure on defense and hence the size and capability of its military forces. Defense analysts are trying to put a good face on this situation in speaking of frugal superpowers and leaner and meaner defense establishments. A few have argued that the United States must alter its foreign and defense policies so that there will be fewer, less stressing missions for a reduced military to perform. The last time the U.S. military contracted and the defense budget shrank was at the end of the Cold War. Over the next five or six years, the U.S. military shrank by almost half, from eighteen Army divisions to ten, almost 600 ships to around 300, and from 28 fighter wings to 20. That legendary stalwart of a strong defense Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense in the First Bush Administration, was responsible for canceling more than 100 weapons programs. The defense decline of the early 1990s was based on two premises. The first was the need for a peace dividend in the wake of the recession of the late 1980s. The second was that with the fall of the Soviet Union there was less of a need for a large and capable U.S. military. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell, opined that the United States was running out of enemies. Many expected that the world after the end of the East-West ideological conflict was going to be less conflict ridden. Remember such phrases as “new world order” or the “end of history?” The reality was quite different from the optimistic vision. The decade of the 1990s was bookmarked by the first Gulf War and September 11. In between, the U.S. military, freed from the responsibility to man the ramparts against the Soviet threat, found itself undertaking a wide variety of other missions from humanitarian relief and nation building in Somalia to maintaining no fly zones over Iraq and supporting the expansion of NATO. Measured in terms of the number of unit deployments that took place, the U.S. military experienced a four-fold increase in its utilization rate even as it shrank by almost half in terms of deployable forces. The result of the two trends mentioned above was a hollowing out of the military. In order to support force deployments, the procurement and military construction accounts were particularly hard hit. One former Army Chief of Staff estimated that his service had deferred some $56 billion in expenditures on maintenance, procurement and construction in the 1990s. Hundreds of billions of dollars of the rising defense budget post-2001 was spent to make up for inadequate investments of the preceding decade. Even with the increases in defense spending under Presidents Bush and Obama the age of the force overall has increased due to insufficient procurement for such weapons systems as tankers, strategic bombers, fighters, armored fighting vehicles and Navy surface combatants. Even in the relatively quiescent 1990s, the U.S. military found itself extremely active. If anything, the new decade will be even less quiet and stable. One only has to point to the rise of China, belligerent regional powers such as North Korea, Iran, Venezuela and Russia, failing states like Pakistan, Sudan and Ivory Coast and rising non-state actors. At the same time, the U.S. is becoming more engaged in the world economically. The belief that the United States can withdraw even part way from the world, engage in so-called offshore balancing or selective engagement flies in the face of the recent historical evidence, ongoing national interests and the structure of the extant international order. In fact, the role of the U.S. military in protecting U.S. national interests is likely to increase as erstwhile allies such as Britain, France and Germany spend less on defense. We may be well advised to engage less in certain missions such as nation building. But this only means the U.S. military will spend more time on others such as counter-terrorism. Nor can the U.S. military avoid the twin challenges of nuclear attack and large-scale conventional conflict so long as potential adversaries are acquiring both kinds of forces. The United States will have to go through the obligatory period of trying to decrease its spending in defense and its international military presence. We will also see a short-term decline in defense stocks. But smart investors – and smart strategists – would be wise to bet on U.S. defense for the long run. The world has no one else to whom it can turn.

**Decline in power causes re-intervention – conflict would happen**
**Snyder and Shapiro ‘7** (Jack Snyder, Columbia university, AND Robert Shapiro, Columbia university, and Yaeli Bloch-Elkon, Bar Ilan University, “FREE HAND ABROAD, DIVIDE AND RULE AT HOME: THE DOMESTIC POLITICS OF UNIPOLARITY”, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.henryfarrell.net/unipolarity.pdf]]</span>)

Plausible as these arguments may be, the opposite case may be equally plausible. States that are under intense international pressure may be especially vulnerable to mythridden foreign policies. Hostile encirclements heighten the enemy images, bunker mentalities, and double standards in perception that are common in competitive relationships of all kinds, especially in international relations. 9 Nationalist and garrison state ideologies are reinforced. Likewise, Charles Kupchan argues that declining empires typically adopt strategic ideologies of aggressive forward defense out of fear that their opponents will discover the truth about their growing weakness. 10 In contrast, diplomatic historians commonly applaud the pragmatism of powerful “off-shore balancers,” whose privileged position grants them the freedom to be selective and fact-driven, waiting upon developments before committing troops. Whether powerful, unconstrained states are more ideological than weaker or highly constrained states depends greatly on their domestic politics, not simply their position in the international system. 11

**The best data goes our way – our status as hegemon has led to a major decrease in the number and magnitude of war**
**Russett et al ‘6** (Bruce, (Dean Acheson Prof. IR @ Yale U., Editor of Journal of Conflict Resolution and Past President of the International Studies Association), Bethany Lacina, (PhD Student in Political Institutions and Comparative Politics @ Stanford U.), and Nils Petter Gleditsch, (Adjunct Prof. Pol. Sci. @ Norweigan U. Science and Technology Center for Study of Civil War and International Peace Research Institute), International Studies Quarterly, “The Declining Risk of Death in Battle”, 50:3, Wiley Interscience)

The Correlates of War (COW) data set tracking the incidence and characteristics of interstate, intrastate (civil), and extrastate (often called colonial or imperial) wars is one of the most widely cited sources of conflict data in international relations scholarship. Sarkees, Wayman, and Singer (2003) recently introduced readers of ISQ to an update of this data set through 1997. According to them, the data "reflect a disquieting constancy in warfare" (2003:49) with relatively little change over the past 150 years in the rate at which human lives are being lost to battle. This pessimism is surprising given that the new COW data, in accord with similar conflict monitoring projects (Esty et al. 1998; Gleditsch et al. 2002; Harbom, Högbladh, and Wallensteen 2006; Marshall and Gurr 2006), find a decrease in the number of armed conflicts in recent years (Sarkees, Wayman, and Singer 2003:Figure 4).1 There has been no direct conventional war between major powers since 1954, and the incidence of interstate war has declined over the past half century. Of course, the number of ongoing armed conflicts is not necessarily proportional to their total cost. It is here the authors make their case, arguing that "with the risk of death in battle trending neither up nor down since the date of Napoleon's exile," (Sarkees, Wayman, and Singer 2003:65) warfare is actually shifting between types—from imperial wars in the late nineteenth century, to interstate wars in the early 1900s, to civil wars in the post-World War II era—while the global level of battle violence remains relatively constant (Sarkees, Wayman, and Singer 2003:64). Their argument concurs with literature arguing that contemporary civil wars are fundamentally "new," in that they are driven by primordial ethnic hatreds and are especially vicious compared with conventional wars and ideological internal conflicts (Snow 1996; Duffield 1998; Kaldor 1999; Henderson 2002). We challenge that conclusion by questioning the authors' interpretation of their own data and by pointing to several irregularities in the COW data. In the first section, we reinterpret the data presented by Sarkees et al., pointing out that their "flat-line" finding is driven primarily by the massive spikes in the middle of their timeline representing the two World Wars. These wars were several orders of magnitude more deadly than any conflicts before or since, and their presence in the regression line obscures other trends. We then discuss problems of consistency in the COW deaths data, leading to a reanalysis of the data on deaths in COW wars. We find that the annual incidence of battle deaths declined in the decades after World War II, and again after the end of the Cold War.2
