=This will be the 1NC, If we can get through it= 

4 OFF! 
===ASPEC!!!!!=== 
Violation- you dont 
Thats a voting issue-
OSPEC independent voter- IF THEY READ A WE MEET THEY OVER SPECIFY!!! HAHA DOUBLE BIND

===Fiat is Extra-T=== 
**Our interpretation is that affirmative action should be limited to the mandates of the resolution; fiat is not part of that, making it extra topical.**

**Voting issue**
**Predictability- resolution is all that the negative has to research, allowing the affirmative to go outside the bounds of the resolution destroys negative ground.**
**Ground- we are prepared to debate the consequences of the aff advocating the resolution, we have reasons why advocating that the USFG should do something is bad**




==Intrinsincness== 
**The 1AC is not intrinsinc to the affirmative, because other people could propose the same Plan and say it. They solve, not a reason to vote aff-vote neg on presumption**

==Paperless Theory== 

**The affirmative failed to present me with paper copies of their evidence to make sure it’s real. Reject them- no way to know if there’s any proof for their aff.**

**Voting issue for ethics- lieing destroys debate**

**At worst reject their evidence and vote neg on presumption**
