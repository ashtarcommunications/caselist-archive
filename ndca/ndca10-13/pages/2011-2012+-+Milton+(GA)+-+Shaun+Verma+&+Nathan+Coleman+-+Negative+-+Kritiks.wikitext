====2NC AT: Racism is the RC of Slavery==== 





1) Class, NOT RACE, is the root cause of slavery - several reasons:

a) Russia proves

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Fields, 90 - professor at Columbia University who specializes in southern history and 19th-century social history (Barbara Jeanne, Slavery, //Race and Ideology in the United States of America//, NLR, I/181, May-June, p. 107, CT)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In explaining why slaveholders in … what needs to be explained. </span>



b) Economic independence motivates racist ideology - not reverse causal

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Fields, 90 - professor at Columbia University who specializes in southern history and 19th-century social history (Barbara Jeanne, Slavery, //Race and Ideology in the United States of America//, NLR, I/181, May-June, p. 108, CT)</span>

<span class="Underline">During the</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> heyday of </span><span class="Underline">the … </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">characteristic form of </span>racial ideology<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>



c) Racial historical analysis created only to explain loss of liberty motivated by profit in a republic

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Fields, 90 - professor at Columbia University who specializes in southern history and 19th-century social history (Barbara Jeanne, Slavery, //Race and Ideology in the United States of America//, NLR, I/181, May-June, p. 114 CT)</span>

Racial ideology supplied the means … <span style="font-size: 8pt;">as theirs by natural right.</span>



AND, turn - identifying race as a historical cause naturalizes racial inferiority

a) Identifying race as sole cause of slavery reifies tautological reasoning, causing historical misinformation

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Fields, 90 - professor at Columbia University who specializes in southern history and 19th-century social history (Barbara Jeanne, Slavery, //Race and Ideology in the United States of America//, NLR, I/181, May-June, p.98-100, CT)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Probably</span><span class="Underline"> a majority of American </span>historians … <span style="font-size: 8pt;">.’ The quoted sentences appear on p. 353.</span>


Only way to break from tautology is to naturalize race, the exact tool used by biological determinists to justify genocides and racist social policies

Fields, 90 - <span style="font-size: 8pt;">professor at Columbia University who specializes in southern history and 19th-century social history (Barbara Jeanne, Slavery, //Race and Ideology in the United States of America//, NLR, I/181, May-June, P. 101 CT)</span>

Only if race is defined … <span style="font-size: 8pt;">a latter-day version of </span>Lamarckism<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>


NEXT, their methodology highlighting racism as the root cause of slavery only furthers commodification and reification of human relations. The World Conference against Racism proves identifying class as the fundamental structure is a pre-requisite to solve racism and racist social policies.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">From racism to class struggle … </span>requisite precondition for ending racism<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>


LASTLY, Err with class as root cause, NOT racism - it is critical to prevent further atrocities of military and police presence that threatens humanity and the environment

==Burroughs K== 

===1NC Score=== 

Nathan and I basically just read different parts of the 1ac in together for like 2-3 minutes



===2NC Overview=== 

**Our methodology is a necessary challenge to the spider-webs of re-capture by systems of capital, language and subjectivity which will inevitably re-integrate the affirmative’s approach into a new war machine of technical debate conformity. The cut-up approach, taken by William S. Burroughs in his novels which dissect the very loss of valuation that late capitalism collapses into, the machine that meaninglessly consumes and produces, and is finally interrupted by the author himself. Burroughs dis-aggregates the narrative form through cutting up, we are a dis-aggregation of the technical machine of debate, which takes in spoken words, evidence, training, money, laptops and produces ballots filled out with wins and losses and subjects ready for obedience. Cutting up is our intervention into the 1AC -- to literalize the calls for pluralism and difference not in the structure but in the presentation of the 1AC by reformulating juxtapositions and creating an escape route for life that opens up space for social change**

__Murphy 97__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Timothy S., U of CA, “Wising Up The Marks: The Amodern William Burroughs” p. 4-7) </span>

__Burroughs's literary career is defined … Deleuze in his philosophy spire.__



**The 1AC is reactively nihilistic in its critique of debate. Rather than treating the language of the 1AC as meaningful, we expose its arbitrariness through cutting it up which creates an alternative form of organization that cannot be simply captured within the matrix of another conventional narrative ‘attack on policy debate’**

__Sanchez ‘6__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Kevin, Hard Knocks, cross-x.com post “linkages between burroughs and d&g: positivity, rhizomatics, BwO, and anti-fascism... September 26 </span>



<span style="font-size: 8pt;">from //Retaking the Universe//, an essay entitled…BwO, and anti-fascism... September 26 </span>



**Cutting up the 1AC creates an explosion of the formulation of politics that defies linear narratives, presenting the affirmative’s political act in an impossibly unpredictable formulation that resists capture and re-crystallized within the boundaries of thought itself, as the affirmative simply becomes re-domesticated within the confines of deliberative or Socratic discourse, simply another seminar in the school building, our cut-up provokes questioning of the abstract machines that have colonized their debate thinking caps with their side-ways roots and built their rhizomatic meanings out of cogency and deliberation. The 1AC builds a prison out of coherence and ties themselves to the ballot to drown in the solipsism of enjoying the sound of their own voices. Thus, the cut-up destabilizes the fundamental relationship between the meaning that __presents at the beginning of the round to the question of the ballot__**

__**The affirmative’s focus on dialogue is simply an attempt to replicate the liberalist deliberative debate that characterizes an ideal discursive face which has already been written as white, affluent and male by socializations of privilege. In attempting to “be real” they ignorantly situate us in a reality of the debate space which is always mediated by technique and expectation of form – a space which is always already colonized by simulacra. While the affirmative team attempts to break with the structure altogether, they reveal this strategy in a sort of performativity which is still qritiq for its own sake, debate for the sake of debate. Only the elocution of the 1AC which, through juxtaposing already-heard concepts forces the question of new meaning from old material allows us to use the standard format of debate effectively against itself**__
