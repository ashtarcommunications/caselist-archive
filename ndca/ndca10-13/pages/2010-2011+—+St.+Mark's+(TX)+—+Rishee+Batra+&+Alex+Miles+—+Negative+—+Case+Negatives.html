Chiarelli 10—General Chiarelli, Vice Chief of Staff for the U.S. Army, former Senior Military Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, B.S. in Political Science from Seattle University, Master of Public Administration from University of Washington, Master of Arts in National Security Strategy from Salve Regina University, graduate of the U.S. Naval Command &amp; Staff College, &amp; a graduate of the Naational War college, 3-16-10 (Peter, “Military Services’ Operation &amp; Maintenance,” testimony before the House Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Readiness, CQ Congressional Testimony)<br />
<br />
As all of you know, it has been a busy time for our Nation's military. We have been at war for the past eight-plus years. With the support of Congress, the forces deployed are the very best manned, equipped, trained and led in the 234-year history of the United States Army. That said, the prolonged demand and high operational tempo over the course of this two-front war have undeniably put a strain on our people and equipment. Our shared goal must continue to be to restore balance and sustain the high quality of our All-Volunteer Force for the duration of the current fight as well as for future operations. The United States Army's FY11 Budget Request seeks to achieve the Army's four imperatives: our ability to sustain the Army's Soldiers, Families, and Civilians; prepare forces for success in the current conflict; reset returning units to rebuild the readiness consumed in operations and to prepare for future deployments and contingencies; and transform to meet the demands of the 21st century. The intent of this statement is to provide justification for the Army's request for O&amp;M funding (base and OCO) in each of these areas. 2 The FY11budget (base and OCO) requests $107.3 billion in O&amp;M funding - a $7 billion increase from [fiscal year 2010] FY10. O&amp;M is the largest portion of the total budget, at 43.7 percent, and will be used for Soldier and unit training; ground and air vehicle operating costs; depot maintenance; base operations, sustainment, restoration, and modernization; and a 1.4 percent civilian pay raise. The Army's O&amp;M base account grew by approximately $3,729M in FY11. $1,104M of this growth reflects increases in pricing and inflation. The remaining $2,625M provides funds to restore balance and supports a phased expeditionary cycle for units at various Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) readiness levels. The FY11 budget request also migrates $1B in funding for enduring missions from OCO into the base. This move is largely due to increased home station training resulting from the Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) drawdown. Specifically, the request supports readiness through increases in OPTEMPO, Depot Maintenance, Soldier well-being programs, facilities and infrastructure sustainment, training, systems and accountability improvements, and cyber and network security operations. Sustain our All-Volunteer Force Sustaining our All-Volunteer Force is our first imperative. The Soldier, as Secretary Gates has said, is our greatest strategic asset. Unfortunately, after eight-plus years of war, we continue to see the high OPTEMPO and prolonged stress and strain on our Force manifested in the increased demand for behavioral health counseling and drug and alcohol counseling; increased divorce rates; and increased numbers of Soldiers temporarily non- deployable from nagging injuries from previous deployments. 3 The FY11 O&amp;M budget request includes $1.7 billion to standardize and fund vital Family programs and services to include welfare and recreation; youth services and child care; Survivor Outreach Services; and expanded counseling and rehabilitative opportunities for Soldiers and Family Members. In particular, the budget request supports the Army's commitment to Soldiers and their Families through initiatives such as the Army Campaign Plan for Health Promotion, Risk Reduction, and Suicide Prevention (ACPHP) and the Global Assessment Tool (GAT) that provides individual feedback on five fitness dimensions. The request also provides increased funding for barracks modernization, and ensures facility Sustainment is funded at 90 percent of the Facility Sustainment Model. Additionally, in collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health, the Army began a 5-year, $50 million seminal study into suicide prevention (funded through RDT&amp;E) that will help inform the ACPHP. The Army also began instituting our Comprehensive Soldier Fitness (CSF) program, an all-inclusive approach that puts mental health on par with physical fitness. By promoting resiliency and life-coping skills, we hope to help our Soldiers, Civilians, and Family Members to better deal with stress and other challenges. By enhancing the quality of life across our Army community, we believe we will see improvement in many other areas of concern, including suicides. The Army has also initiated a comprehensive sexual assault prevention campaign, the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response Program (SHARP), focused on leaders maintaining a positive command climate, which encourages peer-to-peer intervention in an environment where Soldiers do not tolerate the types of behavior that, left unchecked, could lead to sexual assault. 4 To ensure Reserve Component Soldiers and their Families receive the same level of support and assistance, the United States Army Reserve established Army Strong Community Centers to support geographically-dispersed Soldiers and Families. Together with Army National Guard Family Assistance Centers and Soldier and Family Assistance Centers on active duty installations, these centers provide help to Soldiers' Families near their homes. Prepare our Force The FY11 O&amp;M budget request funds manning, equipping, and training goals for the current operational environments. Today, we are continuing to transform the Army to a rotational model - the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN). This model represents the core process for generating trained, ready, and cohesive units on a sustained and rotational basis - to meet current and future strategic demands. The ARFORGEN process includes three force pools Reset, Train- Ready, and Available. Each of the three force pools contains a versatile force package, available at varying time intervals based on its readiness level. The ARFORGEN process increases predictability for Soldiers, Families, employers, and communities, and enables our RC to remain an integral element of the operational force while providing the Nation with the strategic depth (i.e., those non-deployed units which are two to three years from commitment) and operational flexibility to meet unexpected contingencies. Manning The Army is currently implementing the Active Army temporary end- strength increase of up to 22,000 Soldiers approved by the Secretary of Defense in July 2009. 5 Eight-plus years of sustained combat operations have increased non-deployable rates in our units. These increasing non-deployable rates (from 11 percent in 2007 to 13 percent in 2009) require us to continue to overfill our deploying units. The Soldiers needed to overfill those deploying units come largely from resetting units, thus reducing individuals' dwell time and the strength of these and other affected units across the Army. The temporary end-strength increase is substantially augmenting the enlisted fill of our Reset forces enabling more effective ARFORGEN-based manning, equipping and training processes required to get future deployers ready, thereby improving the overall readiness of our Army. The decision was made to temporarily increase the Army end-strength by 15,000 Soldiers by the end of fiscal year 2010. This was to assist in improving fill of deploying units while mitigating the elimination of Stop Loss. We added 5,000 Soldiers in fiscal year 2009, and will add an additional 10,000 individuals in fiscal year 2010. The resulting Army end-strength will be 562,400 Soldiers. The Army is assessing the need for an additional 7,000 Soldier growth for fiscal year 2011. This would bring us to the total 22,000 increase. The decision on whether or not to add the additional 7,000 growth is pending confirmation of our immediate demand, the pace of the drawdown from Iraq, and the requirement for forces in Afghanistan. If the decision is made to add the additional 7,000 Soldiers, growth could be complete by end of 2nd quarter, FY2011. We would hold at that end-strength for the requisite 12 months before beginning the 18-month drawdown. Regardless of the decision on the 7,000 Soldier growth we 6 plan to return to the pre-increase end-strength level of 547,400 by the end of FY 2013. Equipping The Army greatly appreciates the tremendous support Congress has provided for our equipping needs, which has allowed deployed Soldiers and Army units to have the equipment needed to accomplish their missions. Because of your interest and support, today the American Soldier is the best equipped combatant in the world. Whatever the mission, from disaster relief in Haiti, to counter insurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, Army Soldiers and units have the latest and most capable military equipment in the world. Training Training is a critical part of Army readiness, and the FY11 budget request reflects our focus to improve home station training, maintain capabilities at the Combat Training Centers (CTC), and continue building the Modular Army in order to set the conditions to achieve balance as future unit dwell times increase. Fiscal year 2011 base OPTEMPO funding supports increased ground miles and increased flying hours. For the Active component, it funds ground OPTEMPO from 545 miles in FY10 to 583 miles in FY11. It funds Air OPTEMPO from 12.0 hours per crew month in FY10 to 12.3 hours in FY11. The FY11 budget also increases available training range days from 184 funded in the FY 10 budget to 216 of 242 required training days and provides additional operations capability for the Training Support Centers that maintain and manage the Training Aids, Devices, Simulations and Simulators (TADSS). 7 The FY 2011 O&amp;M base budget request funds a total of 24 rotations through the Army's Combined Arms Training Centers (CTCs) and two Exportable Training Capability (ETC) events. The CTCs are in the initial phase to transition to Full Spectrum Operations (FSO); we plan to conduct a pilot FSO rotation in FY11. Funding for Army Military and Civilian Leader Development programs remains constant in FY11. The Army sustains support for all the Army Leader Development Strategy initiatives. The Army projects increased enrollment in Professional Military Education programs as dwell time increases in FY12. We will increase resources to reduce the backlog created by years of insufficient dwell time. The Army continues to increase investment in Language Qualification Training and Cultural Awareness Training. Additional funding includes increased Mobile Language Training Teams to support the Language Proficiency Enhancement Program in support of ARFORGEN, and funding for Language Training Detachments and for the Afghanistan/ Pakistan Hands Program. The FY11 budget request funds increases in officer training and accessions. The commissioning mission increases from 5,100 in FY10 to 5,350 in FY11. The request also funds an 11.3 percent increase in enlisted and officer specialized skills training. Reset Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Reset funding has sustained the Army and maintained our operational readiness for the past 8 years. The FY11 O&amp;M OCO budget request includes $7.8 billion to Reset Army equipment. 8 Reset is an essential element of readiness and restoring balance to the Army for known requirements. It is part of the cost of war, and it prepares our Soldiers and their equipment for an unpredictable future and evolving threats. Reset is a necessary process that must continue not only as long as we have forces deployed, but an additional two to three years after major deployments end to ensure future equipment readiness. Reset is especially challenging given the extraordinary wear on vehicles, aircraft, and equipment in the harsh environments our forces operate in today. Coarse sand, fine dust, extreme temperatures, and high OPTEMPO erode sophisticated mechanical and electronic systems at altitudes and loads which near the edge of the aircraft design capabilities. Our rotary wing fleet, for example, operates up to six times non-combat usage levels. Over the past year, our depot-level Maintenance Reset workload exceeded ~100,000 items of equipment; and, we expect to sustain this pace for as long as we have substantial forces deployed. Reset timelines are directly related to the pace of the Iraq drawdown, operational decisions such as the OEF plus-up, available capacity within our industrial base (labor and physical plant capacities and long lead-time parts) and the availability and timing of funding. Given current projections, we would expect our requirements to decrease in the outyears as we complete the retrograde and Reset of equipment from Iraq. Army Prepositioned Stocks Army Prepositioned Stocks (APS) have repeatedly most recently in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) fulfilled their primary purpose of enhancing the Army's strategic agility. In order to restore balance to the Army's strategic readiness posture, it is necessary to --Reset?? these war reserve stocks. The FY 11 budget request funds APS at $400.7M, an increase of $120.9M. This funding will make available three Large Medium Speed Roll-on/Roll-off (LMSR) ships associated with APS Afloat that are currently in reduced operating status. These ships will carry one Sustainment Brigade with a Combat Support Hospital and an Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Additionally, the O&amp;M funding requested in FY11 will partially reconstitute Prepositioned Stocks in Southwest Asia (APS-5); fund reconstitution and Care of Supplies In Storage (COSIS) for an Infantry Battalion with a motorized augmentation set in Afghanistan; and, fund COSIS for existing afloat APS stocks. Transforming our Force The Army is continuously evolving our capabilities to meet current and future strategic demands. We recognize that we must ensure our Nation has the capability and range of military options to meet the evolving challenges we face in the 21st century. As Army Chief of Staff, General George W. Casey, Jr. has stated, &quot;We need an Army that is a versatile mix of tailorable and networked organizations, operating on a rotational cycle, to provide a sustained flow of trained and ready forces for full spectrum operations and to hedge against unexpected contingencies - at a tempo that is predictable and sustainable for our all- volunteer force.&quot; The centerpiece of our efforts is the shift to a modular construct focused at the brigade level, thus creating a more deployable, adaptable, and versatile force. This ongoing transformation has greatly enhanced the Army's ability to respond to any situation, quickly and effectively. However, the degree of impact continues to vary, for example, between Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), --enablers,?? the Reserve components, and individual Soldiers. The FY11 budget request supports increases to integrated management systems for Army Business Operations, enhancing communications systems, personnel systems, and financial readiness. It also funds increases in cyber and network security to enhance computer network defense and protect our information systems from unauthorized access and use. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) request O&amp;M also represents the largest portion of the OCO request, $63.4 billion or 62 percent, and will fund the day-to-day costs of the war, training to prepare units for deployment, force protection, in-theater maintenance and repair, drawdown of equipment from Iraq, and the Reset of Army Prepositioned Stocks and equipment returning from deployment. The OCO portion of the request also includes $628M for the training and sustainment of the temporary wartime increase in personnel - an increase of $242M from FY10. The FY11 OCO request for O&amp;M appropriations is $3.2 billion higher than the FY10 request ($63.4B versus $60.2B). Although the overall deployed force structure will be lower in FY11, the request reflects a full year of OEF operations at the increased force structure level and with significantly higher costs for transportation, in-theater maintenance, and support of new and expanded base camps in Afghanistan. FY 2011 Budget Risks Budget risk Army-wide is projected to be minimal if the $245.6 billion [Budget Request] is appropriated as requested. The Army continues to identify, manage and mitigate risks resulting from changes in assumptions 11 underlying the FY11 budget build, past budget builds, or any unforeseen events. Risk has been identified in the following areas: Sustained Demand Since September 11, 2001, all deploying Army units are trained, led, and equipped to the highest levels prior to deployment. However, due to sustained demand, Army units are achieving this deployment readiness closer and closer to their arrival dates in theater. OCO Funding The Army continues to rely on OCO funding to meet the full scope of training and sustainment of our forces. Personnel Mobilization Assumptions include: no significant new missions; Iraq draw down will proceed on time, and end year at less than 50K end-strength; Afghanistan surge will proceed on time and not increase beyond the planned level; and, Active Duty Operational Support (ADOS) requirement for the Reserve Component will continue to decrease parallel to Iraq draw down. Training The Army continues to accept moderate risk in the base funding of unit training for all components; training at the CTCs due to the execution of Mission Readiness Exercises for deploying units; and funding of the Training Support Systems operations while units remain deployed. Primary risks are in the acceleration of the drawdown in forces ahead of planned timeline; and the availability of OCO to support pre-deployment training for all components and readiness certification and validation during pre- and post-mobilization for the Reserve Components. 12 Base Operations Support Base Operations Support (BOS) resources the Army's installation services worldwide, ensuring an environment in which Soldiers and Families can thrive, and provides a structure that supports a campaign quality, expeditionary Army. The FY11 budget request funds BOS programs at $9.1billion across all components, an increase from FY2010 of $241M. The budget request funds new Army Senior Leadership Initiatives (SLI) to support Soldier/Family well-being at garrison/installation level, to include ACPHP, SHARP; and Contract Security Guards in Europe previously funded with OCO now funded in base. Although the Army has taken risk in BOS, the Army's Installation Management Command (IMCOM) continues to work closely with each installation to ensure its essential BOS needs are met. Earlier this month, the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff, Army, announced the Army's plan to increase BOS funding by $500M in FY10. Additionally, the Army will conduct a comprehensive mid-year review of all BOS accounts to ensure adequate funding is maintained to meet the Army's priorities through the remainder of the fiscal year. The Army's senior leaders anticipate working closely with Congress to make the necessary modifications to the Army's FY11 request as they relate to BOS needs across our installations. In the meantime, we are continuing to look for efficiencies and best practices in the use of BOS funds. You can be assured we will not shortchange Soldiers and their Families in the process. Unknown Risk We recognize that much of the risk we assume depends on minimal projected reductions in demand and corresponding savings; and the absence of unplanned events or a resurgence of tensions in ?hot spots' 13 around the world. If such unforeseen events occur, we will have to make the necessary adjustments, to include reallocation of resources. However, based on the current situation and known risks, we are confident the FY11 O&amp;M budget request, if appropriated in full, would improve the overall readiness of our Force by ensuring the Army is able to properly care for, train, equip and support our Soldiers, Civilians, and Family Members around the world.<br />

<br />
As all of you know, it has been a busy time for our Nation's military. We have been at war for the past eight-plus years. With the support of Congress, our forces deployed are the very best manned, equipped, trained and led in the 234-year history of the United States Army. That said, this success has come at the expense of our non-deployed and Generating Forces. The consequence is increased strategic risk to the Nation. The prolonged demand and high operational tempo of this two-front war have undeniably put a strain on the readiness of our Force. Our current readiness is a reflection of the total number of available Soldiers, as well as materiel resources - coupled with time to train. This sum measure of readiness is further impacted by the overall global demand for Army forces. So long as demand exceeds supply, the availability and deployability of Soldiers, units and equipment will be challenged, as will the Army's ability to build trained and ready forces. In particular, heightened, prolonged demand results in periods of degraded readiness for non-deployed forces in order to shift Soldiers and equipment to units preparing to deploy. The Army currently has limited capacity to respond to unforeseen contingencies. However, if demand for Army forces comes down as forecasted and budgetary expectations remain consistent, then we should be able to restore our full operational depth by [fiscal year 2012] FY12.Recognizing this process will be dependent upon a number of factors to include the projected drawdown of forces in Iraq; the continued implementation of the rotational Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) model; and, the continued transition of our Reserve Component(RC) force from a strategic reserve to an operational force, thus allowing the Army recurrent, assured, predictable access to the RC to meet operational requirements IAW ARFORGEN. By FY13, these actions, in part, and the resulting increase in operational depth should enable our Army to mitigate current strategic risk and reliably respond to the full range of potential, unforeseen contingencies. In the meantime, I assure the members of this subcommittee, the Army is doing everything within its control to improve our readiness and restore balance to the Force. Congress remains a vital partner in this shared endeavor.<br />

<strong>Plan is political suicide for Obama—causes massive Republican backlash</strong> <br />
<strong>Joyner 1/12—</strong>Managing Editor of the Atlantic Council. PhD in pol sci, U Alabama (James, Afghanistan: Sparking a New Debate on an Old War, 12 Jan. 2011, <span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4744:http://acus.org/new_atlanticist/afghanistan-sparking-new-debate-old-war --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://acus.org/new_atlanticist/afghanistan-sparking-new-debate-old-war" rel="nofollow">http://acus.org/new_atlanticist/afghanistan-sparking-new-debate-old-war</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4744 --></span>, AMiles)  <br />
<br />
The center-left New America Foundation has enlisted an unlikely ally, conservative tax foe Grover Norquist, to help build a coalition against the war in Afghanistan. At first blush, this would seem unnecessary. A CNN poll released January 3 found a whopping 66 percent of Americans opposed the war, with only 35 percent supporting it. And opposition is even stronger within President Obama's base, with 80 percent of self-described Liberals and 74 percent of Democrats opposing. But Democratic strategists fear, not without reason, that it would be <strong>political suicide</strong> for the president to call for a quick end to the war, as Republican critics would hammer him as weak -- and worse. And, the same CNN poll shows, slim majorities of both Republicans and self-identified supporters of the Tea Party (52 percent each) supported the war. Self-identified Conservatives are on the fence, with 49 percent favoring and 49 percent opposing the war. Norquist, who talked to a group of us at a dinner hosted by NAF's Steve Clemons, believes fiscal conservatives, desperate to slash the massive budget deficit, yearn to join together with the center-left and end the war. His ammunition: A new poll commissioned by the Clemons' Afghanistan Study Group showing that, when informed that the war in Afghanistan was costing American taxpayers $117 billion a year, 71 percent of conservatives and 67 percent of Tea Partiers said they were &quot;very worried&quot; or &quot;somewhat worried&quot; about the financial burden of the war. In that context, 57 percent of conservatives and 55 percent of Tea Party supporters agreed, &quot;The United States can dramatically lower the number of troops and money spent in Afghanistan without putting America at risk.&quot; Now, as I told Clemons and Norquist during the Q&amp;A session, I think the poll is a publicity stunt of dubious probative value. (I may have used more colorful language.) The truth of the matter is that most Americans have only the vaguest notions of how much our government spends and therefore have no context whatsoever against which to judge numbers. &quot;$119 billion&quot; is a scary number to bandy about but it's a tiny fraction of a $3.69 trillion budget. One could imagine that, if people were told that the Department of Labor spends $117.5 billion a year, they'd wonder whether we couldn't get by without that, too. Much less $915.5 billion for Health and Human Services. I'm guessing NAF won't be polling on that, though. Whether we're getting good value for our investment in Afghanistan isn't a matter of uninformed reaction to big numbers but rather an assessment of costs and benefits. Indeed, Norquist readily acknowledges this, saying we need to have &quot;a conversation&quot; &quot;about the vast expenditures of cash, the vast expenditures of other people lives, and the opportunity cost.&quot; He insists that, while everyone, himself included, agreed that we needed to go to war to &quot;hit back at those who hit us on 9/11,&quot; we've not really had an honest dialog about the years-long rebuilding effort that followed toppling the Taliban. While we've certainly talked about it -- rather a lot in fact -- over the years, it's mostly been at the level of platitude. We've got to &quot;finish the job&quot; and &quot;achieve victory,&quot; however that's defined. And, Norquist's least favorite, &quot;we have to support the troops.&quot; The heated political environment, in which openly talking about ending the mission short of achieving our lofty goals would bring catcalls of &quot;surrender&quot; and &quot;appeasement&quot; and &quot;betrayal,&quot; makes an adult conversation difficult. So, Norquist is trying to use the cost issue as a means of getting around this dilemma. But, while fiscal issues are his bread and butter, it's not what's driving his opposition to the war. Rather, he argues, &quot;Being tied up there does not advance American power.&quot; He explained, &quot;If you've got a fist in the tar baby Iraq and you've got a fist in the tar baby Afghanistan, then who's afraid of you?&quot; While HuffPo's Dan Froomkin cringes at the loaded metaphor, it's Norquist's belief that our long adventures in the region weaken our leverage against the likes of Iran and North Korea. Further, he argues that Republican icon Ronald Reagan would never have gotten us into this position. He reminded the audience that Reagan's reaction to the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon, which killed 241 Americans, &quot;was not to stay, it was to leave. Ronald Reagan didn't decide to fix Lebanon. I think that's helpful in getting the conversation going on the right.&quot; Norquist is confident that the result of that conversation will go his way. I'm not so sure. First, <strong>the politics mitigate against it</strong>. We're gearing up for a presidential election in which the Republican candidates will vie amongst themselves to demonstrate that they're the &quot;toughest,&quot; with no serious contender likely to come out against the war. It's hard to imagine President Obama switching course in that environment. Second, whatever private misgivings he might have about the war, <strong>this president has committed himself</strong>. The decision, taken after months of painful deliberation, to double down on the effort with the Afghan Surge truly made this &quot;Obama's War.&quot; And firing two commanders and then putting the most charismatic and famous general in a couple generations in charge reinforced that.  <br />

<strong>Republican support outweighs any link turn</strong> <br />

<br />
Last week anti-tax leader Grover Norquist pleaded with conservatives to have, at least, a conversation about Afghanistan and the goals and costs of the 10-year war. (One estimate puts the price tag at $120 billion per year.) But it appears the Republican Party is simply not there with Norquist. The latest evidence comes as four freshman Republican senators, including among the most &quot;fiscally conservative&quot; members of the Senate, have concluded a trip to the region. They are now promptly calling for the expensive war to be extended indefinitely. This is despite the fact that the Obama Administration's oft-repeated target dates for beginning of withdrawal (July 2011) and full transition to Afghan control (2014) are not hard deadlines at all. John McCormack at the Weekly Standard has been gathering reaction from the senators, Marco Rubio of Florida, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Ron Jonson of Wisconsin, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. All four came back with basically the same message: progress is being made in the war and there should not be even a timeline for withdrawal. Here's Rubio: Based on everything we've see here, we are making significant progress. ... Everywhere we went here--and I mean everywhere--from the markets that we walked on the streets to the Afghan authorities, all the way up to the president, even in Pakistan, what we heard repeatedly was: It is important--it is important--that it is clearly understood that the U.S. is committed to seeing this through. And here's Johnson: We’ve sacrificed so many lives and so many dollars in this effort and it’s such an important effort in terms of our national security, we have to see this thing through. Politically this means that -- even if serious Democratic opposition to Obama on the war arises in Congress -- the Republican Party will be standing with the president, if not pushing an even greater escalation of the war. War critic and Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell told me last year that Afghanistan cannot become a serious political liability for Obama as long as he has full Republican support on the war. So far, he appears to be right.  <br />
<br />
<strong>Speeding up withdrawal will cause the GOP to hammer Obama – possibility of bipartisan cooperation now</strong> <br />
<strong>Polman, 1/2</strong> (Dick, Inquirer National Political Columnist, 1/2/11, “The American Debate: With 2012 already in view, expect D.C. gridlock,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4746:http://www.philly.com/inquirer/currents/20110102_The_American_Debate --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/currents/20110102_The_American_Debate" rel="nofollow">http://www.philly.com/inquirer/currents/20110102_The_American_Debate</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4746 --><u>With_2012_already_in_view</u>expect_D_C__gridlock.html, JMP) <br />
<br />
But some Senate Republicans might be amenable to bipartisan overtures. In addition to the usual centrists, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, some of the new blue-state Republican senators, notably those from Illinois and New Hampshire, might at times find it necessary to vote in accordance with the prevailing sentiment back home. Scott Brown, the erstwhile tea party darling from Massachusetts, has already done so - to the point where tea partyers are threatening to run a primary candidate against him in 2012. And another Senate wild card is Lisa Murkowski, the Alaskan who is poised to be more independent this year, having won reelection via the write-in route after being abandoned by the Republican establishment. <br />
So perhaps total gridlock can be avoided. The problem is, we don't know the variables. We don't know whether the economy will rebound, or at what pace. If the jobless rate inches steadily downward, Obama will inch up in the polls, and (some) Republicans will be more amenable to doing deals with him. If the rate stays flat, Republicans will be more inclined to let him twist in the wind. <br />
War is another variable. If Obama starts to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan at a pace that Republicans deem too speedy (withdrawals are scheduled to begin in July, by the way), they may view that as extra incentive to make his life miserable. <br />
I'm just hoping that a sufficient number of political players this year, on both sides, will recognize, on at least a few key occasions, the mutual advantages of compromise. Obama said it best, shortly before Christmas, when he sent a message to the Republicans: &quot;With greater power comes greater responsibility&quot; - and accountability, too. Screaming from the sidelines is easy; governing is hard. <br />
And why govern when you can always campaign? That's way more fun. By the time the leaves on our trees are in full bloom, some of the Republican presidential hopefuls will have already declared their intentions. The first debate is scheduled for May. I kid you not. The creaking sound you just heard is the window for compromise already beginning to close. <br />

<span style="color: black;">However, reversing policy and disengaging would be no easier for Obama. It would be the wrong course on the merits. Politically, it would commit the Administration to a policy now supported by only 17 percent of the electorate. It would play into the traditional Republican narrative of Democratic weakness on defense, facilitate widespread if ill-founded Republican accusations of the Administration’s leftist radicalism, and risk alienating moderate Democrats in battleground districts whose support the President will need on other issues. However bad the news may look if the United States fights on, withdrawal would probably mean a Karzai collapse and a Taliban victory, an outcome that would flood American TV screens with nightmarish imagery. </span><br />

Despite all the questions surrounding the war in Afghanistan, congressional <strong>Democrats have not challenged the administration's policies</strong> since President Obama announced a surge of troops in 2009. <br />
The release of classified documents about the war by the website WikiLeaks seemed to have no impact on Capitol Hill. The same week that the documents were released, the House approved legislation with almost no debate that will provide tens of billions of dollars for the war effort. Even though the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is chaired by John Kerry, who entered the national spotlight in the 1970s with his riveting testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the problems with the war in Vietnam, the panel has been relatively quiescent. <strong>Democrats don't want Afghanistan to become a political problem for Obama</strong>. Their party is having enough trouble as a result of the recession and the deficit that they don't want to give their opponents one more issue to run on. Democrats, who have suffered for decades when being attacked as &quot;weak on defense,&quot; also fear that any questions about the war will open them up to those attacks again.  <br />

The president has to play the role of the commander in chief of a military expedition that is accomplishing something. Americans expect that from their presidents in time of war. We know that Mr. Obama has serious reservations about the size and duration of the commitment that the United States has undertaken in Afghanistan, but he must put up a brave and confident face because of that public expectation and for other reasons. One of those reasons is his own political baggage, which includes his admirable opposition from the beginning to the ill-advised war in Iraq, leaving the war in Afghanistan as the contrasting “good” war through which he is expected to demonstrate his fortitude on matters of national security. His current political status does not lead him to diverge from these expectations. Democrats can cause him some grief over the issue, but <strong>Republicans could cause him even more if he were to change course</strong>. Besides, where else would Democrats go in 2012? The U.S. military is playing its professional and constitutional role of performing the mission assigned to it, which it currently understands to be the stabilization of Afghanistan, or as much of Afghanistan as possible. The military does not evaluate whether the mission is worth the costs sustained in pursuing it; such evaluation is not part of its role. The field commander, General David Petraeus, and those advising him are expert enough in counterinsurgency to realize that the facts and the numbers in Afghanistan simply do not add up to an ability to stabilize Afghanistan. But the general, like the president, must play the role of the confident commander in whom the American people can also be confident. This role is all the greater for Petraeus because of the popular image of him as a miracle worker who turned things around in Iraq, even though politically things never really did turn around in Iraq and the reduction in violence there was also due to other factors besides the surge and the commander's ingenuity. So Petraeus and his command emphasize in Afghanistan concentrated operations in selected parts of the country that can show some success, and emphasize in Washington the positive side of the results of those operations. Analysts elsewhere in the government and especially in the intelligence community have the professional role of calling things as they see them in Afghanistan while scrupulously avoiding anything that would constitute criticism of current policy. The job of the analysts is not just, as some journalists have suggested, to warn of potential bad news. Indeed, their job is more comfortable when they can talk about good news. Apparent differences in their outlook from those of the military also are not due, as some in the military have suggested, to intelligence assessments being the work of desk-bound analysts who lack a sense of what is going on in the ground in Afghanistan. To the contrary, their assessments reflect the thinking of multiple agencies and the totality of the evidence, including not least the reporting of the military itself. The assessments reflect a broader and more complete perspective than the outlook of military leaders who are properly focused on working hard to accomplish a specific mission. The differences in assessments reflect that difference in breadth and the absence from the analysts' role of any need to put on a brave face for public consumption. More specifically in the current instance, the difference is between the military's emphasizing of what has been accomplished where military efforts have been concentrated in Helmand and Kandahar provinces, and the intelligence community's broader awareness of negative trends in other parts of the Afghanistan. It also reflects the military's natural tendency to de-emphasize the negative side of what is occurring even in Helmand and Kandahar, such as an increase in favorable popular sentiment toward the Taliban. Independent analysts and specialists outside government have the same role of calling things as they see them, but with none of the government analysts' restrictions about openly criticizing current policy. The most recent significant statement of outside analysts is an open letter signed by some fifty specialists who have studied Afghanistan. The letter describes how trends in Afghanistan are unfavorable, a military solution there is not feasible, and negotiations with the Taliban are necessary. The statement amplifies earlier outside assessments such as the one released by the Afghanistan Study Group three months ago. So far these assessments have not diverted the policy, partly because many other members of the political class, especially in Congress, are playing the role of supporting anything undertaken in the name of protecting Americans from terrorism. The intervention in Afghanistan began that way and still bears a counterterrorist label. But the strong inclination to play this particular role has obscured the significant change in the nature and objective of the military expedition during the nine years of the war. The politicians also have in mind the role they will play in the event of a future major terrorist attack with any connection to Afghanistan: that of hurling recriminations at anyone vulnerable to the charge of having been soft on threats that might come from Afghanistan.  <br />

<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">GOP gains will force Obama to remain in Afghanistan – the plan will spark a huge backlash that stops Obama’s agenda </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Gearan, 11/5</span></strong> (Anne, 11/5/10, States News Service, “GOP Gains Set Stage for National Security Battle,” Factiva, JMP) <br />
<br />
The big Republican gains in Congress could make it harder for President Barack Obama to keep his pledge to start bringing U.S. troops home from Afghanistan by next summer and dim prospects for several of his administration's centerpiece military and diplomatic initiatives. <br />
The GOP's victories seem likely to derail congressional efforts to repeal the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; ban on gays serving openly in the military, thwart efforts to curb the growth of Pentagon spending and frustrate hopes for quick ratification of a nuclear arms control agreement with Russia. <br />
More Republicans in Washington may also mean trouble for Obama's efforts to improve U.S. relations with Iran and Cuba and restart disarmament talks with North Korea. <br />
But the wild card in the looming conflict between the White House and Capitol Hill, especially the new Republican-controlled House, could be tea party candidates elected Tuesday. <br />
More than 30 tea party candidates won election to Congress, according to an analysis by The Associated Press, enough to affect some policy decisions. Some haven't staked out clear national security priorities, while others are libertarians or isolationists who could split the GOP with debates over the U.S. commitment to shaping events abroad. <br />
Tea party hero Rand Paul, now a senator-elect from Kentucky, has said the greatest threat to U.S. national security is a lack of border control. On his website, Paul also says that &quot;when we must fight, we declare war as the Constitution mandates and we fight to win.&quot; Congress has not formally declared war since World War II. <br />
If the Republicans can avoid internal divisions, they will be able to slow some Obama programs or policies and kill others. <br />
On Afghanistan, some Republicans say they will increase pressure on Obama to stick with a war plan they generally support, using the bully pulpit of congressional hearings this spring. <br />
They will argue that Obama's plan to begin withdrawing forces in July 2011 is arbitrary and that war commanders should not be asked to yank forces prematurely. <br />
&quot;If we see the White House beginning to discuss withdrawing, and the conditions aren't right on the ground, you're going to see us talk about the importance of keeping focused,&quot; said Adam Kinzinger, a Republican and former Air Force pilot who won a House seat in Illinois with tea party support. <br />
The arms control treaty called New START is one of Obama's top foreign policy achievements, but Republicans have held it up in the Senate and Obama is now trying to speed its passage before the new, more Republican, Senate arrives. <br />
On Thursday, Obama used remarks during a Cabinet meeting to urge the Senate to ratify the treaty in the lame-duck session that starts Nov. 15. <br />
&quot;I am hopeful that we can get that done before we leave and send a strong signal to Russia that we are serious about reducing nuclear arsenals, but also send a signal to the world that we're serious about nonproliferation,&quot; Obama said. <br />
Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell responded that he didn't think there will be enough time. <br />
Even with majorities in both houses of Congress, Democrats did not give the White House what it sought - repeal of the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; ban on gays serving openly in the military. Republicans have even less inclination to end the ban now. <br />
Obama said Wednesday that he considers the ban unjust and said there is still time to repeal it before the new Congress arrives. <br />
&quot;This should not be a partisan issue,&quot; he said. &quot;You've got a sizable portion of the American people squarely behind the notion that folks who are willing to serve on our behalf should be treated fairly and equally.&quot; <br />
But some powerful Republicans oppose repeal, and given the election results, the effort is probably dead for the near future. <br />
&quot;I don't think it's going to go anywhere&quot; in that session, said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who sits on the House Armed Services Committee. He noted that there was opposition among both Republican and Democratic colleagues. <br />
The new Republican-controlled House will also put existing White House defense and foreign policies under a microscope. <br />
Rep. Howard &quot;Buck&quot; McKeon, R-Calif., in line to become chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, promised new oversight and investigation of Obama's Afghanistan strategy, among other things. <br />
&quot;We're not going to be looking for gotcha things,&quot; McKeon told The Associated Press. &quot;We're just going to look at things we should be doing and are they doing it.&quot; <br />
Like a number of other Republican lawmakers, McKeon strongly supported Obama's decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan this year, but he has also called Obama a &quot;reluctant wartime president&quot; for linking the troop increase with a date for the start of withdrawal. <br />
McKeon said his panel wants to hear directly from the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David Petraeus, this spring. Petraeus has not testified to Congress since taking the job last summer, in part because Democrats were not eager to draw attention to an unpopular war. <br />
A CNN/Opinion Research poll last month found 58 percent of Americans oppose the war, which is now in its 10th year and has cost more 1,200 American lives and $300 billion. <br />
Democrats are already looking toward the presidential election in 2012, and there is strong support among activists for Obama to begin the pullout on schedule. <br />
Many Republicans argue that the exit plan has only raised doubts among U.S. allies while encouraging the Taliban to fight harder, in anticipation of a pullout. <br />
Obama says his date for starting withdrawal is a reminder to everyone that the war cannot run indefinitely, and that he will take security conditions into account in deciding whether to bring any forces home. <br />
&quot;This date has proven problematic from the get-go, and it's going to prove even more problematic&quot; with Republicans controlling the House, said Juan C. Zarate, a deputy national security adviser under President George W. Bush. <br />
&quot;Republicans are going to want to hold the president's feet to the fire and show we are not cutting and running,&quot; said Zarate, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. <br />
Troop increases and withdrawals are almost entirely the prerogative of the commander in chief, like nearly every other major decision about the management of the war. What Congress can do is make things easier or much harder for the president and hold out the threat of funding cuts for decisions it does not like. <br />
&quot;I still think he is in the driver's seat because I don't believe he was ever going to make actual decisions on troop drawdown plans based primarily on domestic politics,&quot; said Michael O'Hanlon, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institution. <br />
<br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Even if they win a turn – the plan causes huge short-term backlash first </span></strong><br />

<br />
Political capital from Afghanistan <br />
In contrast, the president is not dependent on the agreement of Congress when it comes to Afghanistan policy. If he decides, as planned, to bring the troops home from the summer of 2011, then he is within his rights to do so as commander-in-chief of the army. This could possibly earn him points with the public, said Stephen F. Szabo, who is director of the Transatlantic Academy of the German Marshall Fund in Washington. <br />
&quot;The Republicans are against an early withdrawal from Afghanistan,&quot; Szabo said. &quot;They would fight against it and would have the military on their side.&quot; <br />
Obama might then garner support, according to Szabo - the American public being war-weary after years of troop deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan. <br />
For other economic blocs, such as the European Union, the strengthening of the Republicans could have a positive effect, claimed Szabo; at least where free trade is concerned. <br />
&quot;It means there will be less pressure to adopt protectionist measures in the next two years,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">And, if the GOP changes their opinion on the war it won’t be until next year if there is no improvement – plan ensures a short term backlash </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Washington Post, 11/4</span></strong> (Mary Beth Sheridan and Greg Jaffe, 11/4/10, “The degree of difficulty rises for Obama agenda,” Factiva, JMP) <br />
<br />
The biggest losers in the midterm elections were moderate Democrats who were the staunchest backers of the adminstration's Afghanistan policy. Their defeat will yield a Democratic caucus that is significantly more antiwar. The Obama administration will, in turn, probably be forced to depend more heavily on Republicans, who have generally backed the overall strategy in Afghanistan. <br />
&quot;The level of inconvenience may go up for the Obama administration, but I don't think it will be likely to force a policy change,&quot; said Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. <br />
If the Afghan war is still widely viewed as going poorly next year, though, it is possible that some conservative Republicans could break with their party. <br />
&quot;There is a libertarian streak that is starting to emerge in the Republican party . . . that has called for significant reductions in defense spending,&quot; said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a defense think tank. <br />

WASHINGTON: Republican lawmakers who now control the US House of Representatives said on Thursday that they would try to prevent President Barack Obama from withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan as he planned. <br />
Congressman Buck McKeon, who will now take over the House Armed Services Committee from the Democrats, has also announced his party’s plan for Afghanistan and Iraq. He said that under the Republicans the committee’s top priority would be to continue the US military presence in Afghanistan. Mr McKeon pledged to work directly with Gen David Petraeus, the US commander in Afghanistan, to commit more equipment and resources to the war effort. <br />
“America remains a nation at war,” Mr McKeon said in a statement. “More than 150,000 of our sons and daughters are deployed around the globe in the fight against Al Qaeda and its terrorist allies. The top priority of the Armed Services Committee will be to provide those brave fighters the resources and support they need to succeed in their missions and return home safely.” <br />

<br />
In sharp contrast to 2006 and 2008, when weariness over the Iraq war boosted the fortunes of Democrats, national security issues played virtually no role in the 2010 U.S. midterm elections. This year, with economic and financial problems paramount, the long war in Afghanistan received nary a mention during the campaign. Adding to the silence over the war is the perception that there exist few substantial differences on Afghan policy; Republican leaders generally endorse President Barack Obama's &quot;surge&quot; strategy and will watch from the sidelines as Obama ponders his withdrawal options next year. <br />
The conventional wisdom is that even if a more left-wing Democratic caucus on Capitol Hill grumbles at Obama's Afghan policy, Republicans will provide the administration with the support it needs. This view also holds that the Pentagon will largely get what it wants. Although some new libertarian-leaning Republicans might be mild Pentagon skeptics, the arrival of the new, mostly pro-defense Republican delegation in Washington, combined with the generally bipartisan workings of the House and Senate Armed Services committees, should mean that the Pentagon's programs and Obama's strategy for Afghanistan are safe. <br />
Are there any reasons to question this conventional wisdom? Might defense spending come under the knife in spite of the Republican wave? And might Obama be left alone to deal with Afghanistan, without political cover on either flank? <br />

<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">No support for the plan </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Engelhardt 10</span></strong> [Tom, co-founder of the American Empire Project, runs the Nation Institute's TomDispatch.com , “Yes, We Could…. Get Out! – Why we won’t leave Afghanistan or Iraq” Atlantic Free Press -- lexis] <br />
<br />
Yes, We Could... Get Out! Why We Won't Leave Afghanistan or Iraq Yes, we could. No kidding. We really could withdraw our massive armies, now close to 200,000 troops combined, from Afghanistan and Iraq (and that’s not even counting our similarly large stealth army of private contractors, which helps keep the true size of our double occupations in the shadows). We could undoubtedly withdraw them all reasonably quickly and reasonably painlessly. Not that you would know it from listening to the debates in Washington or catching the mainstream news. There, withdrawal, when discussed at all, seems like an undertaking beyond the waking imagination. In Iraq alone, all those bases to dismantle and millions of pieces of equipment to send home in a draw-down operation worthy of years of intensive effort, the sort of thing that makes the desperate British evacuation from Dunkirk in World War II look like a Sunday stroll in the park. And that’s only the technical side of the matter. Then there’s the conviction that anything but a withdrawal that would make molasses in January look like the hare of Aesopian fable -- at least two years in Iraq, five to ten in Afghanistan -- would endanger the planet itself, or at least its most important country: us. Without our eternally steadying hand, the Iraqis and Afghans, it’s taken for granted, would be lost. Without the help of U.S. forces, for example, would the Maliki government ever have been able to announce the death of the head of al-Qaeda in Iraq? Not likely, whereas the U.S. has knocked off its leadership twice, first in 2006, and again, evidently, last week. Of course, before our troops entered Baghdad in 2003 and the American occupation of that country began, there was no al-Qaeda in Iraq. But that’s a distant past not worth bringing up. And forget as well the fact that our invasions and wars have proven thunderously destructive, bringing chaos, misery, and death in their wake, and turning, for instance, the health care system of Iraq, once considered an advanced country in the Arab world, into a disaster zone(that -- it goes without saying -- only we Americans are now equipped to properly fix). Similarly, while regularly knocking off Afghan civilians at checkpoints on their roads and in their homes, at their celebrations and at work, we ignore the fact that our invasion and occupation opened the way for the transformation of Afghanistan into the first all-drug-crop agricultural nation and so the planet's premier narco-nation. It’s not just that the country now has an almost total monopoly on growing opium poppies (hence heroin), but according to the latest U.N. report, it’s now cornering the hashish market as well. That’s diversification for you. It’s a record to stand on and, evidently, to stay on, even to expand on. We’re like the famed guest who came to dinner, broke a leg, wouldn’t leave, and promptly took over the lives of the entire household. Only in our case, we arrived, broke someone else’s leg, and then insisted we had to stay and break many more legs, lest the world become a far more terrible place. It’s known and accepted in Washington that, if we were to leave Afghanistan precipitously, the Taliban would take over, al-Qaeda would be back big time in no time, and then more of our giant buildings would obviously bite the dust. And yet, the longer we’ve stayed and the more we’ve surged, the more resurgent the Taliban has become, the more territory this minority insurgency has spread into. If we stay long enough, we may, in fact, create the majority insurgency we claim to fear. It’s common wisdom in the U.S. that, before we pull our military out, Afghanistan, like Iraq, must be secured as a stable enough ally, as well as at least a fragile junior democracy, which consigns real departure to some distant horizon. And that sense of time may help explain the desire of U.S. officials to hinder Afghan President Hamid Karzai’s attempts to negotiate with the Taliban and other rebel factions now. Washington, it seems, favors a “reconciliation process” that will last years and only begin after the U.S. military seizes the high ground on the battlefield. The reality that dare not speak its name in Washington is this: no matter what might happen in an Afghanistan that lacked us -- whether (as in the 1990s) the various factions there leaped for each other’s throats, or the Taliban established significant control, though (as in the 1990s) not over the whole country -- the stakes for Americans would be minor in nature. Not that anyone of significance here would say such a thing. Tell me, what kind of a stake could Americans really have in one of the most impoverished lands on the planet, about as distant from us as could be imagined, geographically, culturally, and religiously? Yet, as if to defy commonsense, we’ve been fighting there -- by proxy and directly -- on and off for 30 years now with no end in sight. Most Americans evidently remain convinced that “safe haven” there was the key to al-Qaeda’s success, and that Afghanistan was the only place in which that organization could conceivably have planned 9/11, even though perfectly real planning also took place in Hamburg, Germany, which we neither bombed nor invaded. <br />

<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">He can’t spin this one – plan destroys capital </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">CDH 10</span></strong> [“Obama walks fine line on Afghanistan” June 29 -- lexis] <br />
<br />
When I say these departures show us what is really important in the judgments about Obama that will be forthcoming — first in the midterm elections in November and then in 2012 — this is what I mean: As forecast by his campaign, Obama has staked almost everything in his reputation as commander in chief on the conduct of the war in Afghanistan. He staged a long and heavily publicized review of the war strategy, concluded it by adding 30,000 more U.S. troops to the struggle, set a mid-2011 deadline for beginning a withdrawal, and picked McChrystal as the commander to carry out the task. That choice — recommended by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who fired McChrystal’s predecessor — has now backfired, but the president insists the change of command does not signal a change of strategy. Instead, he has turned back to Gen. David Petraeus, the hero of President George W. Bush’s Iraq surge — which was opposed by Obama. At some point in the future, a nuclear Iran may pose an even greater challenge for Obama. But for now he will be rated on national security by what happens in Afghanistan. Why is Orszag’s departure equally significant? Because he has been at the intersection of three domestic concerns: health care, the budget and the economy. The OMB director provided much of the intellectual firepower behind Obama’s approach to health care legislation. He shaped the budgets that have become increasingly the center of debate between Democrats and Republicans. And he has been a central voice on overall economic policy. Those topics loom large on the agenda for the next two elections. On all of them, Obama is walking a fine line. He has tried to finesse some of the issues in health care by phasing in his proposals and by avoiding the direct approach of a &quot;public option&quot; or expanded Medicare. Similarly, on the budget and economy, he has called for stimulus measures but also promised spending restraint and ultimate fiscal discipline. In Afghanistan, too, he is trying to have it both ways, sending in more troops but still standing by his vow to begin a withdrawal. All of these measures — and the men behind them — are controversial. And over all of them looms the issue of Obama’s leadership. As the latest Pew Research Center poll confirms, none of the president’s actions so far at home or abroad have damaged his overall approval numbers — which remain just below 50 percent. <br />

2010 is the key year for Russia to expand its sphere of influence and consolidate power over the region – pulling out allows the US to contain Russian expansion<br />

<br />
<strong>Well <span class="Underline">2010 will be a period of consolidation for Russia. It now has a sphere of influence that stretches into the Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan. </span>Putin once said that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical disaster in 20th century history. He also said he had no intention of rebuilding that political union. The former statement was true; but we are seeing signs that the latter was just rhetoric. <span class="Underline">Putin does have political designs over the states of the f</span>ormer<span class="Underline"> S</span>oviet <span class="Underline">U</span>nion – the Customs Union that has just entered into force between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan is the clearest example of this. <span class="Underline">His intention will be to </span>eventually <span class="Underline">integrate them into a new Russian political union</span> for it is the next logical step in Russia’s resurgence. <span class="Underline">A customs union is designed to reintegrate the industrial and strategic economic sectors of the old Soviet grid. Mutual economic benefits will flow from this and former Soviet states</span>outside it <span class="Underline">will find it incredibly appealing</span> to join (or Russia will make them ‘an offer they cannot refuse’). Once integration is done the weaker states of the customs union have two options - resist political integration while maintaining economic connections (a delicate balancing act), or politically integrate. What is interesting here are the analogies we can take from the EU experience. The EU economic project is intended by French and German elites to eventually create a European superpower. But to do so requires the smaller states to become subservient to the national interests of the larger members (and these interests often diverge). Absent a serious external threat it becomes very hard for the smaller states to convince their populations they should become a tool in a larger, potentially global, geopolitical game the French and German want to gain entry into. This becomes even more difficult when the smaller states are democratic - as we've seen with the referendums in Ireland and eventual acceptance of the watered down 'Lisbon Treaty' instead of the 'Constitutional Treaty'. The states Russia wants to pull back into a political union are not stable and established democracies. Therefore the elites of these states do not need to submit themselves to the will of their population. Furthermore, if joining Russia in a new political union guarantees their monopoly of power (since the Kremlin gains an interest in bolstering these elites) they will be far more willing to go along with it. In a way, former Soviet states will sue for what they can; but take what they must. The reality is that most of them are already economically dependent upon Russia anyway. Furthermore Russia’s great power relative to them means they cannot realistically resist Russian expansion anyway because, as Ukraine, Belarus and Georgia all found out, if you disagree with the political designs of the Kremlin Putin can simply shut off the gas, close down a border, deny them primary goods, or, should need be, smash them with its far superior military power (as Georgia found out). It is the will to use power that makes others fearful and compels them to accommodate one’s interests; not the existence of power itself. Putin has shown time and time again the will to use Russia’s power against its neighbours. <span class="Underline">For the elites in states adjacent to Russia (and their populations) the message is clear: align with Moscow or face the consequences</span>. As a consequence the next state to fall back into Moscow’s camp will be Ukraine after its upcoming elections. Obama and the Afghan Surge <span class="Underline">American military power is going to be absolutely bogged down</span> in the Middle East<span class="Underline">throughout 2010. Obama seems to be escalating the conflict</span> for political and diplomatic reasons: US presidents cannot just declare failure and retreat – it’s not in the DNA of the American political system. They have 'to show' that they will fight 'the bad guys' as hard as they can before they can make the rational decision to remove American military power. But <span class="Underline">Obama</span>has <span class="Underline">announced </span>that <span class="Underline">the surge </span>in Afghan <span class="Underline">is temporary</span>. <span class="Underline">The 'pull-out' begins in 2011</span>.

But the Russians know <strong>this and</strong> it gives them one year <strong>- 2010 - to completely lock down their influence and eject any remnants of American or European influence. Whether they entirely succeed or not is beside the point; <span class="Underline">by the end of 2010 any move to remove them from their position will have to be momentous</span> and overt. <span class="Underline">At the same time whatever Obama's plans may be they are not really his to make, for there are simply too many players now involved in the Middle Eastern cesspool of crises. The most important in the coming year will be the one centred upon Iran. An Escalating Crisis 2009 saw an escalation in the Iranian-American standoff over its nuclear program. Firstly, Obama and co. released proof of a covert Iranian nuclear plant followed by a series of highly significant leaks that seemed to show the Iranians were driving towards nuclear weapons. But this crisis also became consumed by the Russo-American standoff as Russian support for Iran became overt as it seeks to use Iran as a bargaining chip. But the outcome of the crisis is also dependent upon the calculations of Israel. If they actually believe that a nuclear Iran is an 'existential threat' they will have to act against is before it attains nuclear weapons, or at least show America they will act unless it gets tough on Iran. However, for America 'to act' short of war it needs Russian help to impose sanctions. Thus far Russia has given vague signals that </span></strong>it will help if the price is right<strong>.</strong> The price being American acquiescence to a new Russian political sphere of influence <strong>around it’s near abroad (which it already has). Obama and Biden have declared that they will not do this owing to Russia's declining long term geopolitical position (although its power is growing in the short term). Biden, on a trip to Eastern Europe last year, even went so far to announce the Obama's administrations intentions to support efforts by US-friendly governments in the region to counter Russia's push. That means end-game for any Russo-American alignment on Iranian sanctions. At the same time Obama is escalating a war in Afghanistan and needs all the help from regional powers to 'win' this thing - even Iran. If America can accept the inevitability of a nuclear Iran and even the eventual hegemonic domination by Iran over parts of the Middle East and Gulf region then America can do a 'deal' with it whereby it would gain Iranian help to suppress the multiple crises in the Middle East. This would allow the US to drawdown military forces and reorient them back to the greater geopolitical enemy - Russia. Therefore Russia has an interest in keeping Iran close and ensuring that a rapprochement between Iran and the US remains impossible.</strong><br />

US/Russian relations are at a turning point – US encroachment on Russia’s sphere of influence kills cooperation<br />
<br />
Eyal 10 <strong>(Jonathan, U.S., Russia truly committed to improving their relations, 26 June 2010,<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/special-to-the-china-post/2010/06/26/262241/US-Russia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/special-to-the-china-post/2010/06/26/262241/US-Russia.htm</a></span>, AMiles)</strong><br />

<strong>Yet the meeting between the Russian and American leaders also cements a blossoming new partnership between their countries, after decades of frosty relations. This is one foreign policy achievement for which U.S. President Obama can justifiably feel proud. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, all U.S. presidents have tried to forge better relations with Moscow, but usually with little success. The old Cold War confrontation was quickly replaced by a feeling of mutual resentment. The Russians objected to what they saw as</strong> America's encroachment into their old sphere of influence, <strong>as Nato kept expanding into Eastern Europe. And the U.S., in turn, fretted about the alleged absence of democratic reforms in Moscow. Relations sunk to their lowest ebb when Russian troops invaded Georgia in August 2008, a conflict exacerbated by miscalculations in both Moscow and Washington. But by the time Obama came to power, many of these disputes were already over. Nato's expansion into the former Soviet republics reached its natural conclusion, while in Russia, Medvedev, a politician who believes in diplomacy, took over from Vladimir Putin, now Prime Minister, who instinctively opted for confrontation. Obama identified a “reset” in U.S.-Russian relations as one of his chief foreign policy objectives. He cancelled plans to build U.S. missile defense installations in Europe, to Moscow's great delight. And he swiftly re-launched nuclear disarmament talks. There were hiccups on the way. Obama's sudden tilt towards Russia alarmed some European countries, who feared that their security interests would be sacrificed. A nuclear disarmament deal proved difficult to negotiate, and still has to be ratified by the U.S. Congress. And Obama himself committed a gaffe when, during his first official visit to Moscow early last year, he made disparaging remarks about Putin, who continues to exercise considerable influence. But ultimately,</strong> Obama's strategy has worked because<strong>, as Sergey Rogov, who heads Russia's Institute for the U.S. and Canadian Studies, points out,</strong> Russian officials were persuaded that Washington had truly abandoned its “paternalistic tone towards Moscow.” <strong>As a result, Russia swung behind the U.S. in adopting sanctions against Iran, and this ensured that China also accepted the need for sanctions. However, the U.S.-Russian</strong> rapprochement has only begun<strong>. Although bilateral trade has doubled during the past year, it still stands at a puny US$24 billion, less than America's trade with Taiwan, and a mere fraction of the total value of America's trade with China, a figure which is 15 times larger.</strong><br />

<strong><span class="Underline">As long as catastrophic possibilities exist in that nation, so do the unprecedented threats to US and international security. Experts differ as to which danger is the gravest--proliferation of Russia's enormous stockpile of nuclear, chemical and biological materials; ill-maintained nuclear reactors on land and on decommissioned submarines; an impaired early-warning system controlling missiles on hair-trigger alert; or the first-ever civil war in a shattered superpower, the terror-ridden Chechen conflict. But no one should doubt that together they constitute a much greater constant threat than any the United States faced during the Soviet era. Nor is a catastrophe involving weapons of mass destruction the only danger in what remains the world's largest territorial country. Nearly a quarter of the planet's people live on Russia's borders, among them conflicting ethnic and religious groups. Any instability in Russia could easily spread to a crucial and exceedingly volatile part of the world. There is another, perhaps more likely, possibility. Petrodollars may bring Russia long-term stability, but on the basis of growing authoritarianism and xenophobic nationalism. Those ominous factors derive primarily not from Russia's lost superpower status (or Putin's KGB background), as the US press regularly misinforms readers, but from so many lost and damaged lives at home since 1991. Often called the &quot;Weimar scenario,&quot; this outcome probably would not be truly fascist, but it would be a Russia possessing weapons of mass destruction and large proportions of the world's oil and natural gas, even more hostile to the West than was its Soviet predecessor. How has the US government responded to these unprecedented perils? It doesn't require a degree in international relations or media punditry to understand that the first principle of policy toward post-Communist Russia must follow the Hippocratic injunction: Do no harm! Do nothing to undermine its fragile stability, nothing to dissuade the Kremlin from giving first priority to repairing the nation's crumbling infrastructures, nothing to cause it to rely more heavily on its stockpiles of superpower weapons instead of reducing them, nothing to make Moscow uncooperative with the West in those joint pursuits. Everything else in that savaged country is of far less consequence. Since the early 1990s Washington has simultaneously conducted, under Democrats and Republicans, two fundamentally different policies toward post-Soviet Russia--one decorative and outwardly reassuring, the other real and exceedingly reckless. The decorative policy, which has been taken at face value in the United States, at least until recently, professes to have replaced America's previous cold war intentions with a generous relationship of &quot;strategic partnership and friendship.&quot; The public image of this approach has featured happy-talk meetings between American and Russian presidents, first &quot;Bill and Boris&quot; (Clinton and Yeltsin), then &quot;George and Vladimir.&quot; The real US policy has been very different--a relentless, winner-take-all exploitation of Russia's post-1991 weakness. Accompanied by broken American promises, condescending lectures and demands for unilateral concessions, it has been even more aggressive and uncompromising than was Washington's approach to Soviet Communist Russia. Consider its defining elements as they have unfolded--with fulsome support in both American political parties, influential newspapers and policy think tanks--since the early 1990s: §_A growing military encirclement of Russia, on and near its borders, by US and NATO bases, which are already ensconced or being planned in at least half the fourteen other former Soviet republics, from the Baltics and Ukraine to Georgia, Azerbaijan and the new states of Central Asia. The result is a US-built reverse iron curtain and the remilitarization of American-Russian relations. §_A tacit (and closely related) US denial that Russia has any legitimate national interests outside its own territory, even in ethnically akin or contiguous former republics such as Ukraine, Belarus and Georgia. How else to explain, to take a bellwether example, the thinking of Richard Holbrooke, Democratic would-be Secretary of State? While roundly condemning the Kremlin for promoting a pro-Moscow government in neighboring Ukraine, where Russia has centuries of shared linguistic, marital, religious, economic and security ties, Holbrooke declares that far-away Slav nation part of &quot;our core zone of security.&quot; §_Even more, a presumption that Russia does not have full sovereignty within its own borders, as expressed by constant US interventions in Moscow's internal affairs since 1992. They have included an on-site crusade by swarms of American &quot;advisers,&quot; particularly during the 1990s, to direct Russia's &quot;transition&quot; from Communism; endless missionary sermons from afar, often couched in threats, on how that nation should and should not organize its political and economic systems; and active support for Russian anti-Kremlin groups, some associated with hated Yeltsin-era oligarchs. That interventionary impulse has now grown even into suggestions that Putin be overthrown by the kind of US-backed &quot;color revolutions&quot; carried out since 2003 in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, and attempted this year in Belarus. Thus, while mainstream editorial pages increasingly call the Russian president &quot;thug,&quot; &quot;fascist&quot; and &quot;Saddam Hussein,&quot; one of the Carnegie Endowment's several Washington crusaders assures us of &quot;Putin's weakness&quot; and vulnerability to &quot;regime change.&quot; (Do proponents of &quot;democratic regime change&quot; in Russia care that it might mean destabilizing a nuclear state?) §_Underpinning these components of the real US policy are familiar cold war double standards condemning Moscow for doing what Washington does--such as seeking allies and military bases in former Soviet republics, using its assets (oil and gas in Russia's case) as aid to friendly governments and regulating foreign money in its political life. More broadly, when NATO expands to Russia's front and back doorsteps, gobbling up former Soviet-bloc members and republics, it is &quot;fighting terrorism&quot; and &quot;protecting new states&quot;; when Moscow protests, it is engaging in &quot;cold war thinking.&quot; When Washington meddles in the politics of Georgia and Ukraine, it is &quot;promoting democracy&quot;; when the Kremlin does so, it is &quot;neoimperialism.&quot; And not to forget the historical background: When in the 1990s the US-supported Yeltsin overthrew Russia's elected Parliament and Constitutional Court by force, gave its national wealth and television networks to Kremlin insiders, imposed a constitution without real constraints on executive power and rigged elections, it was &quot;democratic reform&quot;; when Putin continues that process, it is &quot;authoritarianism.&quot; §_Finally, the United States is attempting, by exploiting Russia's weakness, to acquire the nuclear superiority it could not achieve during the Soviet era. That is the essential meaning of two major steps taken by the Bush Administration in 2002, both against Moscow's strong wishes. One was the Administration's unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, freeing it to try to create a system capable of destroying incoming missiles and thereby the capacity to launch a nuclear first strike without fear of retaliation. The other was pressuring the Kremlin to sign an ultimately empty nuclear weapons reduction agreement requiring no actual destruction of weapons and indeed allowing development of new ones; providing for no verification; and permitting unilateral withdrawal before the specified reductions are required. The extraordinarily anti-Russian nature of these policies casts serious doubt on two American official and media axioms: that the recent &quot;chill&quot; in US-Russian relations has been caused by Putin's behavior at home and abroad, and that the cold war ended fifteen years ago. The first axiom is false, the second only half true: The cold war ended in Moscow, but not in Washington, as is clear from a brief look back. The last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power in 1985 with heretical &quot;New Thinking&quot; that proposed not merely to ease but to actually abolish the decades-long cold war. His proposals triggered a fateful struggle in Washington (and Moscow) between policy-makers who wanted to seize the historic opportunity and those who did not. President Ronald Reagan decided to meet Gorbachev at least part of the way, as did his successor, the first President George Bush. As a result, in December 1989, at a historic summit meeting at Malta, Gorbachev and Bush declared the cold war over. (That extraordinary agreement evidently has been forgotten; thus we have the New York Times recently asserting that the US-Russian relationship today &quot;is far better than it was 15 years ago.&quot;) Declarations alone, however, could not terminate decades of warfare attitudes. Even when Bush was agreeing to end the cold war in 1989-91, many of his top advisers, like many members of the US political elite and media, strongly resisted. (I witnessed that rift on the eve of Malta, when I was asked to debate the issue in front of Bush and his divided foreign policy team.) Proof came with the Soviet breakup in December 1991: US officials and the media immediately presented the purported &quot;end of the cold war&quot; not as a mutual Soviet-American decision, which it certainly was, but as a great American victory and Russian defeat. That (now standard) triumphalist narrative is the primary reason the cold war was quickly revived--not in Moscow a decade later by Putin but in Washington in the early 1990s, when the Clinton Administration made two epically unwise decisions. One was to treat post-Communist Russia as a defeated nation that was expected to replicate America's domestic practices and bow to its foreign policies. It required, behind the facade of the Clinton-Yeltsin &quot;partnership and friendship&quot; (as Clinton's top &quot;Russia hand,&quot; Strobe Talbott, later confirmed), telling Yeltsin &quot;here's some more shit for your face&quot; and Moscow's &quot;submissiveness.&quot; From that triumphalism grew the still-ongoing interventions in Moscow's internal affairs and the abiding notion that Russia has no autonomous rights at home or abroad. Clinton's other unwise decision was to break the Bush Administration's promise to Soviet Russia in 1990-91 not to expand NATO &quot;one inch to the east&quot; and instead begin its expansion to Russia's borders. From that profound act of bad faith, followed by others, came the dangerously provocative military encirclement of Russia and growing Russian suspicions of US intentions. Thus, while American journalists and even scholars insist that &quot;the cold war has indeed vanished&quot; and that concerns about a new one are &quot;silly,&quot; Russians across the political spectrum now believe that in Washington &quot;the cold war did not end&quot; and, still more, that &quot;the US is imposing a new cold war on Russia.&quot; That ominous view is being greatly exacerbated by Washington's ever-growing &quot;anti-Russian fatwa,&quot; as a former Reagan appointee terms it. This year it includes a torrent of official and media statements denouncing Russia's domestic and foreign policies, vowing to bring more of its neighbors into NATO and urging Bush to boycott the G-8 summit to be chaired by Putin in St. Petersburg in July; a call by would-be Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain for &quot;very harsh&quot; measures against Moscow; Congress's pointed refusal to repeal a Soviet-era restriction on trade with Russia; the Pentagon's revival of old rumors that Russian intelligence gave Saddam Hussein information endangering US troops; and comments by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, echoing the regime-changers, urging Russians, &quot;if necessary, to change their government.&quot; For its part, the White House deleted from its 2006 National Security Strategy the long-professed US-Russian partnership, backtracked on agreements to help Moscow join the World Trade Organization and adopted sanctions against Belarus, the Slav former republic most culturally akin to Russia and with whom the Kremlin is negotiating a new union state. Most significant, in May it dispatched Vice President Cheney to an anti-Russian conference in former Soviet Lithuania, now a NATO member, to denounce the Kremlin and make clear it is not &quot;a strategic partner and a trusted friend,&quot; thereby ending fifteen years of official pretense. More astonishing is a Council on Foreign Relations &quot;task force report&quot; on Russia, co-chaired by Democratic presidential aspirant John Edwards, issued in March. The &quot;nonpartisan&quot; council's reputed moderation and balance are nowhere in evidence. An unrelenting exercise in double standards, the report blames all the &quot;disappointments&quot; in US-Russian relations solely on &quot;Russia's wrong direction&quot; under Putin--from meddling in the former Soviet republics and backing Iran to conflicts over NATO, energy politics and the &quot;rollback of Russian democracy.&quot; Strongly implying that Bush has been too soft on Putin, the council report flatly rejects partnership with Moscow as &quot;not a realistic prospect.&quot; It calls instead for &quot;selective cooperation&quot; and &quot;selective opposition,&quot; depending on which suits US interests, and, in effect, Soviet-era containment. Urging more Western intervention in Moscow's political affairs, the report even reserves for Washington the right to reject Russia's future elections and leaders as &quot;illegitimate.&quot; An article in the council's influential journal Foreign Affairs menacingly adds that the United States is quickly &quot;attaining nuclear primacy&quot; and the ability &quot;to destroy the long-range nuclear arsenals of Russia or China with a first strike.&quot; Every consequence of this bipartisan American cold war against post-Communist Russia has exacerbated the dangers inherent in the Soviet breakup mentioned above. The crusade to transform Russia during the 1990s, with its disastrous &quot;shock therapy&quot; economic measures and resulting antidemocratic acts, further destabilized the country, fostering an oligarchical system that plundered the state's wealth, deprived essential infrastructures of investment, impoverished the people and nurtured dangerous corruption. In the process, it discredited Western-style reform, generated mass anti-Americanism where there had been almost none--only 5 percent of Russians surveyed in May thought the United States was a &quot;friend&quot;--and eviscerated the once-influential pro-American faction in Kremlin and electoral politics. Military encirclement, the Bush Administration's striving for nuclear supremacy and today's renewed US intrusions into Russian politics are having even worse consequences. They have provoked the Kremlin into undertaking its own conventional and nuclear buildup, relying more rather than less on compromised mechanisms of control and maintenance, while continuing to invest miserly sums in the country's decaying economic base and human resources. The same American policies have also caused Moscow to cooperate less rather than more in existing US-funded programs to reduce the multiple risks represented by Russia's materials of mass destruction and to prevent </span></strong>accidental nuclear war<strong>. More generally, they have inspired a new Kremlin ideology of &quot;emphasizing our sovereignty&quot; that is increasingly nationalistic, intolerant of foreign-funded NGOs as &quot;fifth columns&quot; and reliant on anti-Western views of the &quot;patriotic&quot; Russian intelligentsia and the Orthodox Church. Moscow's responses abroad have also been the opposite of what Washington policy-makers should want. Interpreting US-backed &quot;color revolutions&quot; as a quest for military outposts on Russia's borders, the Kremlin now opposes pro-democracy movements in former Soviet republics more than ever, while supporting the most authoritarian regimes in the region, from Belarus to Uzbekistan. Meanwhile, Moscow is forming a political, economic and military &quot;strategic partnership&quot; with China, lending support to Iran and other anti-American governments in the Middle East and already putting surface-to-air missiles back in Belarus, in effect Russia's western border with NATO. If American policy and Russia's predictable countermeasures continue to develop into a full-scale cold war, several new factors could make it even more dangerous than was its predecessor. Above all, the growing presence of Western bases and US-backed governments in the former Soviet republics has moved the &quot;front lines&quot; of the conflict, in the alarmed words of a Moscow newspaper, from Germany to Russia's &quot;near abroad.&quot; As a &quot;hostile ring tightens around the Motherland,&quot; in the view of former Prime Minister Evgeny Primakov, many different Russians see a mortal threat. Putin's chief political deputy, Vladislav Surkov, for example, sees the &quot;enemy...at the gates,&quot; and the novelist and Soviet-era dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn sees the &quot;complete encirclement of Russia and then the loss of its sovereignty.&quot; The risks of direct military conflict could therefore be greater than ever. Protesting overflights by NATO aircraft, a Russian general has already warned, &quot;If they violate our borders, they should be shot down.&quot; Worsening the geopolitical factor are radically different American and Russian self-perceptions. By the mid-1960s the US-Soviet cold war relationship had acquired a significant degree of stability because the two superpowers, perceiving a stalemate, began to settle for political and military &quot;parity.&quot; Today, however, the United States, the self-proclaimed &quot;only superpower,&quot; has a far more expansive view of its international entitlements and possibilities. Moscow, on the other hand, feels weaker and more vulnerable than it did before 1991. And in that asymmetry lies the potential for a less predictable cold war relationship between the two still fully armed nuclear states. There is also a new psychological factor. Because the unfolding cold war is undeclared, it is already laden with feelings of betrayal and mistrust on both sides. Having welcomed Putin as Yeltsin's chosen successor and offered him its conception of &quot;partnership and friendship,&quot; Washington now feels deceived by Putin's policies. According to two characteristic commentaries in the Washington Post, Bush had a &quot;well-intentioned Russian policy,&quot; but &quot;a Russian autocrat...betrayed the American's faith.&quot; Putin's Kremlin, however, has been reacting largely to a decade of broken US promises and Yeltsin's boozy compliance. Thus Putin's declaration four years ago, paraphrased on Russian radio: &quot;The era of Russian geopolitical concessions [is] coming to an end.&quot; (Looking back, he remarked bitterly that Russia has been &quot;constantly deceived.&quot;) Still worse, the emerging cold war lacks the substantive negotiations and cooperation, known as détente, that constrained the previous one. Behind the lingering facade, a well-informed Russian tells us, &quot;dialogue is almost nonexistent.&quot; It is especially true in regard to nuclear weapons. The Bush Administration's abandonment of the ABM treaty and real reductions, its decision to build an antimissile shield, and talk of pre-emptive war and nuclear strikes have all but abolished long-established US-Soviet agreements that have kept the nuclear peace for nearly fifty years. Indeed, according to a report, Bush's National Security Council is contemptuous of arms control as &quot;baggage from the cold war.&quot; In short, as dangers posed by nuclear weapons have grown and a new arms race unfolds, efforts to curtail or even discuss them have ended. Finally, anti-cold war forces that once played an important role in the United States no longer exist. Cold war lobbies, old and new ones, therefore operate virtually unopposed, some of them funded by anti-Kremlin Russian oligarchs in exile. At high political levels, the new American cold war has been, and remains, fully bipartisan, from Clinton to Bush, Madeleine Albright to Rice, Edwards to McCain. At lower levels, once robust pro-détente public groups, particularly anti-arms-race movements, have been largely demobilized by official, media and academic myths that &quot;the cold war is over&quot; and we have been &quot;liberated&quot; from nuclear and other dangers in Russia. Also absent (or silent) are the kinds of American scholars who protested cold war excesses in the past. Meanwhile, a legion of new intellectual cold warriors has emerged, particularly in Washington, media favorites whose crusading anti-Putin zeal goes largely unchallenged. (Typically, one inveterate missionary constantly charges Moscow with &quot;not delivering&quot; on US interests, while another now calls for a surreal crusade, &quot;backed by international donors,&quot; to correct young Russians' thinking about Stalin.) There are a few notable exceptions--also bipartisan, from former Reaganites to Nation contributors--but &quot;anathematizing Russia,&quot; as Gorbachev recently put it, is so consensual that even an outspoken critic of US policy inexplicably ends an article, &quot;Of course, Russia has been largely to blame.&quot; Making these political factors worse has been the &quot;pluralist&quot; US mainstream media. In the past, opinion page editors and television producers regularly solicited voices to challenge cold war zealots, but today such dissenters, and thus the vigorous public debate of the past, are almost entirely missing. Instead, influential editorial pages are dominated by resurgent cold war orthodoxies, led by the Post, whose incessant demonization of Putin's &quot;autocracy&quot; and &quot;crude neoimperialism&quot; reads like a bygone Pravda on the Potomac. On the conservative New York Sun's front page, US-Russian relations today are presented as &quot;a duel to the death--perhaps literally.&quot; The Kremlin's strong preference &quot;not to return to the cold war era,&quot; as Putin stated May 13 in response to Cheney's inflammatory charges, has been mainly responsible for preventing such fantasies from becoming reality. &quot;Someone is still fighting the cold war,&quot; a British academic recently wrote, &quot;but it isn't Russia.&quot; A fateful struggle over this issue, however, is now under way in Moscow, with the &quot;pro-Western&quot; Putin resisting demands for a &quot;more hard line&quot; course and, closely related, favoring larger FDR-style investments in the people (and the country's stability). Unless US policy, which is abetting the hard-liners in that struggle, changes fundamentally, the symbiotic axis between American and Russian cold warriors that drove the last conflict will re-emerge. If so, the Kremlin, whether under Putin or a successor, will fight the new one--with all the</strong>unprecedented dangers <strong>that would entail. Given different principles and determined leadership, it is still not too late for a new US policy toward post-Soviet Russia. Its components would include full cooperation in securing Moscow's materials of mass destruction; radically reducing nuclear weapons on both sides while banning the development of new ones and taking all warheads off hair-trigger alert; dissuading other states from acquiring those weapons; countering terrorist activities and drug-trafficking near Russia; and augmenting energy supplies to the West. None of those programs are possible without abandoning the warped priorities and fallacies that have shaped US policy since 1991. National security requires identifying and pursuing essential priorities, but US policy-makers have done neither consistently. The only truly vital American interest in Russia today is preventing its stockpiles of mass destruction from endangering the world, whether through Russia's destabilization or hostility to the West. All of the dangerous fallacies underlying US policy are expressions of unbridled triumphalism. The decision to treat post-Soviet Russia as a vanquished nation, analogous to postwar Germany and Japan (but without the funding), squandered a historic opportunity for a real partnership and established the bipartisan premise that Moscow's &quot;direction&quot; at home and abroad should be determined by the United States. Applied to a country with Russia's size and long history as a world power, and that had not been militarily defeated, the premise was inherently self-defeating and certain to provoke a resentful backlash. That folly produced two others. One was the assumption that the United States had the right, wisdom and power to remake post-Communist Russia into a political and economic replica of America. A conceit as vast as its ignorance of Russia's historical traditions and contemporary realities, it led to the counterproductive crusade of the 1990s, which continues in various ways today. The other was the presumption that Russia should be America's junior partner in foreign policy with no interests except those of the United States. By disregarding Russia's history, different geopolitical realities and vital interests, this presumption has also been senseless. As a Eurasian state with 20-25 million Muslim citizens of its own and with Iran one of its few neighbors not being recruited by NATO, for example, Russia can ill afford to be drawn into Washington's expanding conflict with the Islamic world, whether in Iran or Iraq. Similarly, by demanding that Moscow vacate its traditional political and military positions in former Soviet republics so the United States and NATO can occupy them--and even subsidize Ukraine's defection with cheap gas--Washington is saying that Russia not only has no Monroe Doctrine-like rights in its own neighborhood but no legitimate security rights at all. Not surprisingly, such flagrant double standards have convinced the Kremlin that Washington has become more belligerent since Yeltsin's departure simply &quot;because Russian policy has become more pro-Russian.&quot; Nor was American triumphalism a fleeting reaction to 1991. A decade later, the tragedy of September 11 gave Washington a second chance for a real partnership with Russia. At a meeting on June 16, 2001, President Bush sensed in Putin's &quot;soul&quot; a partner for America. And so it seemed after September 11, when Putin's Kremlin did more than any NATO government to assist the US war effort in Afghanistan, giving it valuable intelligence, a Moscow-trained Afghan combat force and easy access to crucial air bases in former Soviet Central Asia. The Kremlin understandably believed that in return Washington would give it an equitable relationship. Instead, it got US withdrawal from the ABM treaty, Washington's claim to permanent bases in Central Asia (as well as Georgia) and independent access to Caspian oil and gas, a second round of NATO expansion taking in several former Soviet republics and bloc members, and a still-growing indictment of its domestic and foreign conduct. Astonishingly, not even September 11 was enough to end Washington's winner-take-all principles. Why have Democratic and Republican administrations believed they could act in such relentlessly anti-Russian ways without endangering US national security? The answer is another fallacy--the belief that Russia, diminished and weakened by its loss of the Soviet Union, had no choice but to bend to America's will. Even apart from the continued presence of Soviet-era weapons in Russia, it was a grave misconception. Because of its extraordinary material and human attributes, Russia, as its intellectuals say, has always been &quot;destined to be a great power.&quot; This was still true after 1991. Even before world energy prices refilled its coffers, the Kremlin had ready alternatives to the humiliating role scripted by Washington. Above all, Russia could forge strategic alliances with eager anti-US and non-NATO governments in the East and elsewhere, becoming an arsenal of conventional weapons and nuclear knowledge for states from China and India to Iran and Venezuela. Moscow has already begun that turning away from the West, and it could move much further in that direction. Still more, even today's diminished Russia can fight, perhaps win, a cold war on its new front lines across the vast former Soviet territories. It has the advantages of geographic proximity, essential markets, energy pipelines and corporate ownership, along with kinship and language and common experiences. They give Moscow an array of soft and hard power to use, if it chooses, against neighboring governments considering a new patron in faraway Washington. Economically, the Kremlin could cripple nearly destitute Georgia and Moldova by banning their products and otherwise unemployed migrant workers from Russia and by charging Georgia and Ukraine full &quot;free-market&quot; prices for essential energy. Politically, Moscow could truncate tiny Georgia and Moldova, and big Ukraine, by welcoming their large, pro-Russian territories into the Russian Federation or supporting their demands for independent statehood (as the West has been doing for Kosovo and Montenegro in Serbia). Militarily, Moscow could take further steps toward turning the Shanghai Cooperation Organization--now composed of Russia, China and four Central Asian states, with Iran and India possible members--into an anti-NATO defensive alliance, an &quot;OPEC with nuclear weapons,&quot; a Western analyst warned. That is not all. In the US-Russian struggle in Central Asia over Caspian oil and gas, Washington, as even the triumphalist Thomas Friedman admits, &quot;is at a severe disadvantage.&quot; The United States has already lost its military base in Uzbekistan and may soon lose the only remaining one in the region, in Kyrgyzstan; the new pipeline it backed to bypass Russia runs through Georgia, whose stability depends considerably on Moscow; Washington's new friend in oil-rich Azerbaijan is an anachronistic dynastic ruler; and Kazakhstan, whose enormous energy reserves make it a particular US target, has its own large Russian population and is moving back toward Moscow. Nor is the Kremlin powerless in direct dealings with the West. It can mount more than enough warheads to defeat any missile shield and illusion of &quot;nuclear primacy.&quot; It can shut US businesses out of multibillion-dollar deals in Russia and, as it recently reminded the European Union, which gets 25 percent of its gas from Russia, &quot;redirect supplies&quot; to hungry markets in the East. And Moscow could deploy its resources, connections and UN Security Council veto against US interests involving, for instance, nuclear proliferation, Iran, Afghanistan and possibly even Iraq. Contrary to exaggerated US accusations, the Kremlin has not yet resorted to such retaliatory measures in any significant way. But unless Washington</strong> stops abasing and encroaching on Russia<strong>, there is no &quot;sovereign&quot; reason why it should not do so. Certainly, nothing Moscow has gotten from Washington since 1992, a Western security specialist emphasizes, &quot;compensates for the geopolitical harm the United States is doing to Russia.&quot; American crusaders insist it is worth the risk in order to democratize Russia and other former Soviet republics. In reality, their campaigns since 1992 have only discredited that cause in Russia. Praising the despised Yeltsin and endorsing other unpopular figures as Russia's &quot;democrats,&quot; while denouncing the popular Putin, has associated democracy with the social pain, chaos and humiliation of the 1990s. Ostracizing Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko while embracing tyrants in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan has related it to the thirst for oil. Linking &quot;democratic revolutions&quot; in Ukraine and Georgia to NATO membership has equated them with US expansionism. Focusing on the victimization of billionaire Mikhail Khodorkhovsky and not on Russian poverty or ongoing mass protests against social injustices has suggested democracy is only for oligarchs. And by insisting on their indispensable role, US crusaders have all but said (wrongly) that Russians are incapable of democracy or resisting abuses of power on their own. The result is dark Russian suspicions of American intentions ignored by US policy-makers and media alike. They include the belief that Washington's real purpose is to take control of the country's energy resources and nuclear weapons and use encircling NATO satellite states to &quot;de-sovereignize&quot; Russia, turning it into a &quot;vassal of the West.&quot; More generally, US policy has fostered the belief that the American cold war was never really aimed at Soviet Communism but always at Russia, a suspicion given credence by Post and Times columnists who characterize Russia even after Communism as an inherently &quot;autocratic state&quot; with &quot;brutish instincts.&quot; To overcome those towering obstacles to a new relationship, Washington has to abandon the triumphalist conceits primarily responsible for the revived cold war and its growing dangers. It means respecting Russia's sovereign right to determine its course at home (including disposal of its energy resources). As the record plainly shows, interfering in Moscow's internal affairs, whether on-site or from afar, only harms the chances for political liberties and economic prosperity that still exist in that tormented nation. It also means acknowledging Russia's legitimate security interests, especially in its own &quot;near abroad.&quot; In particular, the planned third expansion of NATO, intended to include Ukraine, must not take place. Extending NATO to Russia's doorsteps has already brought relations near the breaking point (without actually benefiting any nation's security); absorbing Ukraine, which Moscow regards as essential to its Slavic identity and its military defense, may be the point of no return, as even pro-US Russians anxiously warn. Nor would it be democratic, since nearly two-thirds of Ukrainians are opposed. The explosive possibilities were adumbrated in late May and early June when local citizens in ethnic Russian Crimea blockaded a port and roads where a US naval ship and contingent of Marines suddenly appeared, provoking resolutions declaring the region &quot;anti-NATO territory&quot; and threats of &quot;a new Vietnam.&quot;</strong><br />

Collins &amp; Rojansky, 8/18 <strong>– * U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation from 1997 to 2001, AND deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment (8/18/10, James F. Collins, Matthew Rojansky, Foreign Policy, “Why Russia Matters,” <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=41409" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=41409</a></span>, JMP)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A year and a half after Barack Obama hit the &quot;reset&quot; button with Russia, the reconciliation is still fragile, incomplete, and politically divisive. Sure, Russia is no easy ally for the United States. Authoritarian yet insecure, economically mighty yet technologically backward, the country has proven a challenge for U.S. presidents since the end of the Cold War. Recent news hasn't helped: The arrest in July of a former deputy prime minister and leader of the Solidarity opposition movement, Boris Nemtsov, provoked some of the harshest criticism of Russia yet from the Obama administration. Then last Wednesday, Russia announced that it had moved anti-aircraft missiles into Abkhazia, the region that broke off from Georgia during the August 2008 war. The announcement was hardly welcome news for the United States, which has tried to defuse tensions there for the last 24 months. Yet however challenging this partnership may be, Washington can't afford not to work with Moscow. Ronald Reagan popularized the phrase, &quot;Trust, but verify&quot; -- a good guiding principle for Cold War arms negotiators, and still apt for today. Engagement is the only way forward. Here are 10 reasons why: 1. Russia's nukes are still an existential threat. Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Russia has thousands of nuclear weapons in stockpile and hundreds still on hair-trigger alert aimed at U.S. cities. This threat will not go away on its own; cutting down the arsenal will require direct, bilateral arms control talks between Russia and the United States. New START, the strategic nuclear weapons treaty now up for debate in the Senate, is the latest in a long line of bilateral arms control agreements between the countries dating back to the height of the Cold War. To this day, it remains the only mechanism granting U.S. inspectors access to secret Russian nuclear sites. The original START agreement was essential for reining in the runaway Cold War nuclear buildup, and New START promises to cut deployed strategic arsenals by a further 30 percent from a current limit of 2,200 to 1,550 on each side. Even more, President Obama and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, have agreed to a long-term goal of eliminating nuclear weapons entirely. But they can only do that by working together. 2. Russia is a swing vote on the international stage. As one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Moscow holds veto power over any resolution that the body might seek to pass -- including recent efforts to levy tougher sanctions on Iran or, in 2009, against North Korea following that country's second nuclear test. Russian support for such resolutions can also help persuade China and others not to block them. The post-reset relationship between Moscow and Washington works like a force multiplier for U.S. diplomacy. Russia plays an equally crucial role in the G-8 and G-20 economic groups, helping to formulate a coordinated approach in response to economic threats. In 2008, for example, Russia supported a G-20 resolution promising to refrain from protectionism and avoid new barriers to investment or trade. 3. Russia is big. The country's borders span across Europe, Central and East Asia, and the Arctic -- all regions where the United States has important interests and where it cannot afford destructive competition. With an ongoing counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan, the United States has a strong interest in Central Asian stability and relies on Russia not only for direct assistance with logistics and information sharing, but to help manage threats like the recent political upheaval and sectarian violence in Kyrgyzstan. In the former Soviet space, Moscow's historical ties to newly independent states are still fresh and powerful. Moscow is the linchpin to resolving &quot;frozen conflicts&quot; that prevent countries like Moldova, Georgia, and Azerbaijan from prospering economically and moving toward European Union membership. Recently, for example, Moscow signaled renewed interest in resolving frozen conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria. And despite recent troop movements into Abkhazia, a negotiated settlement is still very possible, one that returns some territory to Georgia but preserves its autonomous status, along with that of its fellow breakaway republic, South Ossetia. 4. Russia's environment matters. As the catastrophic fires across Western Russia have dramatically illustrated, Russia is both a victim of global climate change and a steward of natural resources -- including many of the forests now badly burned -- needed to reverse the global warming trend. With more than one-tenth of the world's total landmass, vast freshwater and ocean resources, plus deposits of nearly every element on the periodic table, Russia is an <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">indispensable partner</span> in the responsible stewardship of the global environment. On climate change, there is work to be done, but progress is evident. Russia today is the world's fourth-largest carbon emitter, but as a signatory to the Copenhagen Accord, it has pledged to reduce emissions to 20 to 25 percent below 1990 levels. Another black spot is Russia's use of &quot;flaring&quot; -- a technique that burns natural gas into the open atmosphere during oil extraction, but Medvedev agreed to capture 95 percent of the gas currently released through flaring. Last year he also signed Russia's first law on energy efficiency, which takes such steps as requiring goods to be marked according to their energy efficiency and banning incandescent light bulbs after 2014. True, most of Russia's other commitments are short on deadlines and concrete deliverables. But like China's cleanup for the Beijing Olympics, Moscow could transform resolve into reality with surprising speed, given the right amount of international engagement. And in the meantime, Russia's natural climate-cleaning properties are vast; the Siberian provinces alone contain more clean oxygen-producing forests and reserves of freshwater than continental Europe. 5. Russia is rich. As the &quot;R&quot; in the famous BRIC grouping of emerging economies, Russia is the 12th-largest market in world, with the third-largest foreign currency reserves. And the country's role in world markets is only growing. Russia is a big player in commodity trading, the country boasts a volatile but increasingly attractive stock exchange, and it is open to foreign investment -- even in state-owned industries. Russian businesses are increasingly looking abroad to form strategic partnerships, acquire assets, and sell their products. And as a country that felt the global financial crisis viscerally -- economic growth fell by almost 8 percent in 2009 -- Russia has a strong interest in making sure there is no repeat. Despite occasional retrenchments, such as the ban on grain exports after the summer fires, Russia is committed to becoming a free-trading World Trade Organization member, and wants more access to U.S. and European technology and management know-how to drive its modernization. Excessive bureaucracy and widespread corruption are the biggest challenges to Russia's further economic growth, but these are already top talking points in Medvedev's modernization drive, and engagement with more transparent Western countries such as the United States can only help. 6. One word: energy. The American way of life depends on stable and predictable commodity prices -- gasoline, natural gas, and coal in particular -- and Russia plays a large role in the global production and pricing of these fossil fuels. Russia alone possesses roughly one-quarter of the world's known gas reserves, and it is currently responsible for over a fifth of global exports. It is the second largest oil-producing state after Saudi Arabia and has the second-largest coal reserves after the United States. The even better news for Washington is that Russia is not a member of OPEC, the cartel of oil-producing countries. This gives the country far more freedom to focus on increasing exports rather than reducing them to keep prices down. When it comes to bringing supply to market, many will no doubt remember the so-called gas wars between Russia and Ukraine and Russia and Belarus that left Eastern Europe in the cold several times in recent years. Much of the trouble is attributable to the legacy of Soviet energy infrastructure in Russia's western neighbors, which put a choke-hold on Russia's gas pipelines. Moscow is currently working with the United States, China, and Western Europe to find a way around this problem, which will entail building new pipelines through the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Siberia. 7. Russia is a staunch ally in the war on terror (and other scourges). Even during the dark days after the 2008 Russia-Georgia war, Moscow and Washington cooperated effectively on counterterrorism, counternarcotics, infectious disease prevention and response, and other shared security priorities. Recently, the two have worked together under the auspices of the Bilateral Presidential Commission to coordinate relief strategies for catastrophes such as the Haiti earthquake and the violence in Kyrgyzstan. Both Washington and Moscow recognize that swift, well-organized responses to such crises are key to preventing weaknesses from being exploited -- for example by extremist groups who are happy to fill the vacuum of government authority. Russia is also a critical partner in U.S. law enforcement efforts to defeat organized crime and terrorism financing. The two countries are currently working to map smuggling routes in Central Asia. And Russia has shared information with the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates on the informal financial networks used to fund Taliban and Afghan warlords. 8. The roads to Tehran and Pyongyang go through Moscow. Russia maintains unique relationships with Iran and North Korea -- both top concerns on Washington's nuclear nonproliferation radar. In the past, the Kremlin has used its leverage to keep the path open for negotiations, sending senior diplomats to Tehran and offering carrots such as civilian nuclear assistance and weapons sales (though it has deferred the sale of advanced S-300 ground-to-air missiles that could be used to blunt a U.S. or Israeli air strike). Now more than ever, Washington needs allies with that kind of leverage to help punish violators and discourage cascading nuclear proliferation worldwide. Leading by example on nonproliferation is also a must; as the world's biggest nuclear powers, the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates and Russia are looked to as the standard-setters. If they fail to ratify their latest modest step forward on bilateral nuclear arms control, it will be difficult to push other countries to take similar counter-proliferation measures. 9. Russia can be a peacemaker. Moscow has the potential to play a role in the settlement of key regional conflicts -- or if it chooses, to obstruct progress. Russia is a member of the Middle East &quot;Quartet,&quot; the six-party talks dealing with North Korean denuclearization, and each of the working groups addressing conflicts in the post-Soviet space, such as the OSCE Minsk group on Nagorno-Karabakh, and the 5+2 group on Transnistria. In such post-Soviet regions in particular, Russia has a unique capacity to contribute to peaceful resolution of territorial disputes by facilitating trade and economic engagement with and between former adversaries, and acting as a peacekeeper once a final settlement is reached. In the Middle East, Russia still controls a network of commercial and intelligence assets and has substantial influence with the Syrians, who should be pushed to play a more productive role in the Arab-Israeli peace process. 10. Russians buy U.S. goods. As the U.S. economy stops and starts its way out of recession, most everyone agrees that boosting exports is a key component in the recovery. And Russia is a big market. U.S. companies such as Boeing, International Paper, and John Deere have invested billions in Russian subsidiaries and joint ventures. In all, there are more than 1,000 U.S. companies doing business there today. They are in Russia not only to take advantage of the country's vast natural resources and highly skilled workers but also to meet the demand for American-branded goods. The Russian middle class wants consumer goods and the country's firms increasingly seek advanced U.S. equipment and machinery. Between 2004 and 2008, before the financial crisis hit, U.S.-Russia trade grew by more than 100 percent to over $36 billion annually, and although that figure dropped by a third in 2009, there is potential for an even better, more balanced trade relationship in the coming decade. In short, Russia is indispensible. As long as the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates participates in the global economy and has interests beyond its own borders, it will have no choice but to maintain relations with Russia. And good relations would be even better.</strong><br />

<strong>The hour is late. Leading climate scientists such as James Hansen are literally shouting at the top of their lungs that the world needs to reduce emissions by 20-40% as soon as possible, and 80-90% by the year 2050, if we are to avoid climate chaos, crop failures, endless wars, melting of the polar icecaps, and a disastrous rise in ocean levels. Either we radically reduce CO2 and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e, which includes all GHGs, not just CO2) pollutants (currently at 390 parts per million and rising 2 ppm per year) to 350 ppm, including agriculture-derived methane and nitrous oxide pollution, or else survival for the present and future generations is in jeopardy. As scientists warned at Copenhagen, business as usual and a corresponding 7-8.6 degree Fahrenheit rise in global temperatures means that the carrying capacity of the Earth in 2100 will be reduced to one billion people. Under this hellish scenario, billions will die of thirst, cold, heat, disease, war, and starvation.</strong><br />

<strong>STRATFOR often discusses how Russia is on a bit of a roll. The U.S. distraction in the Middle East has offered Russia a golden opportunity to re-establish its spheres of influence in the region, steadily expanding the Russian zone of control into a shape that is eerily reminiscent of the old Soviet Union. Since 2005, when this process began, Russia has clearly reasserted itself as the dominant power in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Ukraine, and has intimidated places like Georgia and Turkmenistan into a sort of silent acquiescence</strong><br />

<strong>A Closing Window Russia has had some success in meeting its goals while the United States has been preoccupied, but it also knows Washington is attempting to wrap up its affairs in Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan and have a freer hand in other areas. For Russia,</strong> the clock is ticking. <strong>Russia does have the advantage, in that it is easier for the United States to prevent the emergence of a regional hegemon than to control one that has already emerged. The United States’ focus will return to Eurasia after Russia has already made significant progress on its to-do list. But this is not to say that Russia is the definite winner. Russia’s geopolitical imperatives remain: The country must expand, hold together and defend the empire, even though expansion can create difficulties in the Russian core. This is already a difficult task; it will be made even harder when the United States is free to counter Russia.</strong><br />

<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">This posting is a follow-up to one recently done on the subject of Russia cutting off US landing rights at an airbase in Kyrgyzstan. That action cuts off a “secure” aerial supply line to US troops in Afghanistan even as the overland supply line through Pakistan is growing steadily-more unreliable and dangerous. Russia is manipulating the USA in the “Great Game” in Central Asian politics as easily as a chess grand-master toys with a novice in the game of chess. More information on Russia’s agenda is now clear (but US decision-makers cannot or will not see it). The first link below reports that just after taking action to shut down the US aerial supply route to Afghanistan via Kyrgyzstan, Russia offered the US a ground transportation route to Afghanistan through Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (all ex-Soviet regions). It is obvious to everyone (except highly-compensated US decision-makers) that Russia is “herding” US troops and war materials into a direction desired by Moscow. Let’s examine the ramifications of this move. Surely, Russia will continue to stir up anti-American fervor in West Pakistan to make the ground supply route through Pakistan ever-more dangerous for convoys with US supplies. This will make the USA ever-more dependent on the ground supply routes through ex-Soviet territory. As the USA becomes more dependent on Russia’s “good will” to supply American forces in Afghanistan, President Obama will be required to submit to Russian desires and demands in order to keep that supply route to Afghanistan open. Also, Russia will be able to close off that supply route whenever it desires to do so in the future for its maximum advantage. The second link below cites US Admiral Fallon’s realistic assessment that Russia’s “…principal motivation is to reassert Russian influence and get visible US presence out of former Soviet Republics.” At least one high military official sees dangers for the US in Russia’s “offer,” but if the Russian desire is to get US presence out of Central Asia, why is it offering the USA a supply line via Russia and its ex-Soviet vassal states? There are at least two reasons. The first reason is that it is powerfully in Russia’s interest to continue “bleeding the US white ” both financially and militarily. By allowing the USA a supply line to Afghanistan via a route totally controlled by Russian forces, Russia enables the US to continue its self-destructive war in Afghanistan. The costs of this war (which President Obama wants to rapidly escalate) will hasten the financial collapse of an already-overburdened US Government. It also permits the USA to continue to weaken its army and military. The small US army is worn out from two Asian wars, as many media articles have documented. It needs rest, but President Obama now intends to further wear it out in Afghanistan. It is a telling sign of how exhausted the US military has become that a recent media article noted that the US army is now losing more soldiers to suicide than to enemy actions. The second reason is that Russia can compel the Obama administration to allow oil and energy prices to go back up to where energy-rich Russia wants them to go. If Obama does not cooperate in this effort, Russia “cuts the cord” and the US forces will have to find their own way out of a hostile Asia. Either the US forces would have to fight their way via western Pakistan to the sea so they could be evacuated “Dunkirk”-style or they would have to be evacuated by the US Air Force in a way which would force the US to leave much of its heavy equipment behind for its enemies to use. There is no good reason for the US to pursue any longer a war in Afghanistan. It makes no sense to waste mega-billions and many lives to pursue a war which cannot accomplish any useful US strategic objective. </span></span></strong><br />

<strong>To do this, the United States sought to expand its influence in the countries surrounding Russia, in a process that would ultimately see Russian influence limited by its borders. US efforts began with the expansion of Nato into the Baltic States in 2004, putting the West on Russia's doorstep. In the second phase of this grand plan, Washington encouraged pro-western political movements in the former Soviet republics. These were the so-called ‘colour revolutions', which began in Georgia in 2003 and moved on to Ukraine in 2004 and Kyrgyzstan in 2005. The Orange Revolution in Ukraine marked a turning point in US-Russian relations, however. At that point, Moscow recognized that the United States was seeking to cripple Russia permanently. After Ukraine turned orange, Russia began to organise a response. Taking advantage of US troubles in Afghanistan and Iraq and the crisis with Iran, Russia began a process of rolling back Washington's influence in the former Soviet republics.</strong> Its focus on the Islamic world has left Washington with a limited ability <strong>to undermine Moscow, or to counter any Russian response to growing western influence. Knowing that Washington won't remain fixated on the Islamic world for much longer, Russia has accelerated its efforts to reverse western influence in the former Soviet Union, country by country. This year, Moscow has scored a number of major successes. In January, it signed a customs union agreement to economically reintegrate Russia with Kazakhstan and Belarus. Also in January, a pro-Russian government was elected in Ukraine. And now, a pro-Russian government has taken power in Kyrgyzstan. As it seeks to roll back western influence, Russia has tried various approaches in each of the former Soviet republics. These have included political pressure, social instability, economic influence, energy cuts and direct military intervention. Thus far, energy cuts — as applied in Ukraine and Lithuania — have proved most successful. The use of direct military intervention — as seen in Georgia — has also proved successful, with Russia now occupying a third of that country's land. Political pressure in Belarus and Kazakhstan has pushed the two countries into signing the aforementioned customs union. And now with Kyrgyzstan, Russia has proved willing to take a page from the US playbook and spark a revolution along the lines of the pro-western colour revolutions. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Russian strategy has been tailor-made for each country, taking into account their differences in an effort to dominate them — or at least make them adopt a more pragmatic approach</span></span>.

Russia’s window of opportunity to expand its sphere of influence depends on US Preoccupation in Eurasia<br />

<strong><span class="Underline">The Window of Opportunity While Russia reconsolidated, the United States became preoccupied with the Islamic world. As the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have developed, they have absorbed Washington’s focus, presenting Russia with an opportunity to push back against the West’s increased influence in Eurasia. It remains unclear whether Russia would have been able to counter the Western infiltration of the former Soviet states if the United States had not been looking elsewhere. But Russia has taken advantage of Washington’s preoccupation to attempt to re-establish its sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union. The U.S. absorption on Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan has not occurred without Russian involvement. Russia has used its connections in the Middle East and Afghanistan as leverage in its negotiations with the United States for years, demanding that Washington outright abandon moves to solidify Western influence in the former Soviet states. Furthermore, Moscow’s plan to expand its influence into the former Soviet sphere depends on Washington’s preoccupation. Thus, Russia has openly supported Iran with political, nuclear and military deals, and has made negotiations for military supply routes into Afghanistan more difficult for the United States and NATO. The geopolitical tug-of-war between Washington and Moscow has not been easy. But while Washington has been preoccupied with its wars, Russia has been able to reconsolidate its influence in countries that never strayed far from Moscow’s hand, such as Belarus and Kazakhstan. Russia proved that the West could not stop it from militarily rolling back into its former territory during the 2008 Russo-Georgian war. Russia’s most crucial victory to date has been in Ukraine, where the top four candidates in the country’s January presidential election were all pro-Russian, thus ensuring the end of the pro-Western Orange movement. The question now is: What does Russia feel it must accomplish before the United States is freed up from its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or its standoff with Iran? </span></strong><br />

<strong>The assumption that underlies all these ideas is that the strategy currently being implemented has already failed. But is that really the case? Having spent the first half of July in Afghanistan along with other scholars at Petraeus's invitation, I am struck by how premature such judgments are—and how reminiscent of attempts to write off the surge in Iraq as a failure when it had barely begun. What I found is a strategy that is only beginning to be implemented, and one that has a good chance of working--provided more attention is paid to ameliorating Afghanistan's crippling governance woes. That will not be easy to do, but it offers a greater likelihood of an acceptable outcome than any realistic alternative. Although U.S. and allied forces have been in Afghanistan for nine years as part of NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), it is only in the past year that they have begun to wage war in earnest. As recently as 2008, there were only 30,000 American troops in the country. By the end of August, there will be close to 100,000—a much greater increase in percentage terms than during the Iraq surge, when U.S. troop levels went from 130,000 to 160,000. General Stanley McChrystal spent much of his year in charge (June 2009-June 2010) simply building up the infrastructure to command and support these forces—a formidable undertaking that involved everything from expanding bases and runways to creating an operational headquarters to manage the war on a daily basis. New command structures were needed to manage detentions and the training and equipping of Afghan security forces, as well as the buildup of top-tier Special Operations Forces such as the SEALs and Delta Force. By the time he was fired in June, McChrystal had just begun to use this nascent infrastructure to carry out a concerted counterinsurgency campaign in key districts around the country. It is still too soon to draw any conclusions about these efforts, which will undergo inevitable adjustment and fine-tuning by Petraeus, because the full complement of surge forces is only now arriving. But</strong> early indications are <strong>relatively</strong> promising<strong>. Certainly, the initial operations are not the failure they have often been made out to be. McChrystal's first major focus was in Marjah, a district in central Helmand Province that I visited in early July. Prior to the Marine-led assault that began in February, Marjah had been completely outside the control of the Afghan government and the international military force. The Taliban had been in charge, and they had used it as a staging ground for attacks elsewhere in southern Afghanistan. Marjah was also a center of the global opium trade, which helps fund the insurgency. Coalition aircraft had even been told not to fly over it because it was too dangerous. Today, six months into Operation Moshtarak, the Marines and their Afghan partners are solidly established in the heart of Marjah and are gradually expanding their control outward. Marines continue to be attacked, but they have already managed to deny the Taliban the use of Marjah as a base. Attacks in neighboring districts, as a result, are down sharply. The operation appears to be a bust only because of the exaggerated expectations of immediate success raised by commanders early on. McChrystal touted what he called “government-in-a box,” which was supposed to come in and instantly displace the Taliban, who had long dominated the area. The box, alas, proved mainly empty. Kabul failed to send enough ministry representatives; the district governor's job went to an illiterate official who had a criminal record in Germany and scant managerial experience; and the Afghan National Civil Order Police, brought in to provide law and order, fell short in discipline, armaments, and training. These highly publicized setbacks created a lasting impression of failure that ignores the strides made since February—including the recent replacement of the first district governor, Haji Zahir, with a candidate who appears, at least on paper, to be better qualified. The Marines with whom I spoke believe that Marjah is on a positive trajectory but that it will require 18 months to become truly stable. That is hardly out of the norm for counterinsurgency operations, which always take time. To see where Marjah may be heading, one needs to look at other districts in central Helmand that the Marines had entered earlier. I visited one such area, Nawa. It had been a virtual ghost town before the Marines arrived last summer. Now the district center is bustling and secure enough that it's possible to walk around without body armor. Other towns in central Helmand such as Garmsir and the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, are also fairly peaceful. That's quite an achievement in a province that has long been the country's most dangerous. Progress has been made possible not only by American and Afghan troops, who are able to beat the Taliban in any firefight, but also by Afghan officials, who, with considerable coalition help, have proved they can exceed the low expectations of the population. Nawa's district governor, Haji Abdul Manaf, gets high marks for being hard-working and responsive to the needs of the people. Helmand as a whole is governed by Gulab Mangal, who is rated by international officials as one of the most effective and honest provincial governors in the country. In 2008 he replaced a governor whose basement had been found to contain nine tons of opium and heroin. The British, who at the time provided the only substantial foreign military presence in Helmand, threatened to withdraw from Afghanistan unless that governor, Sher Mohammad Akhundzada, was fired by President Hamid Karzai. He was, and this has made progress possible in Helmand: halting and slow progress, admittedly, but progress nonetheless. Much has been written about Afghanistan's governance problems. Its government is said to be weak, ineffective, corrupt, predatory, and resistant to all attempts at improvement. The Washington Post has reported that the attorney general, Mohammed Ishaq Aloko, has impeded attempts to prosecute politically connected malefactors. That is true, but Helmand's recent history shows that reform is possible even without legal action provided that the coalition applies sufficient political will and military muscle. Kandahar Province, next door to Helmand, is the logical next focus of such action. Its capital, Kandahar, is not only one of Afghanistan's largest cities but also the traditional heart of the Taliban movement. I drove through Kandahar in an armored car and found it to be fairly peaceful; there are not many terrorist attacks within city limits. But the outward normality hides the widespread intimidation of the population—not only by the Taliban but also by the government. Kandahar is dominated by Ahmed Wali Karzai, President Hamid Karzai's half brother. Like a big-city political boss of old, Ahmed Wali Karzai sits atop a powerful network of patronage posts and private companies linked to the state. He is generally believed to be complicit in the opium trade, land grabs, extortion, and other rackets. One of the major sources of his power is his relationship with the United States, Canada, and other Western countries. American and Canadian troops have already been deployed to take control of Kandahar's outskirts away from the Taliban. McChrystal's plan within the city itself had been to avoid an all-out assault such as the one in Marjah. Instead he planned to increase the number of American military police, who are partnered with local police, from one company to five companies—a large jump in percentage terms but still fewer than 1,000 soldiers in a city of more than 500,000 people. This probably will not be sufficient to reduce Ahmed Wali's all-pervasive power, considering that the local police are widely believed to be in his pocket. More troops may have to be dispatched—and thanks to the surge, more troops should be available. Coalition forces must try to reduce Ahmed Wali's power and funding and, if possible, to remove him from office altogether as a way to build confidence among the people in their government. He may look unassailable today, but so did Sher Mohammad Akhundzada before his ouster. If they are to succeed in stabilizing Afghanistan, international forces will have to do more than simply spread out across the countryside. They will also have to be more careful about how they employ their resources to prevent their own largess from inadvertently fueling the insurgency. As General Petraeus said in his recently released Counterinsurgency Guidance: “Money is ammunition; don't put it in the wrong hands.” Foreign aid is Afghanistan's chief source of revenue, amounting to an estimated $14 billion a year (out of a total GDP of $23 billion). But so much is currently being stolen and misspent that according to the Washington Post, more than $1 billion a year in cash is leaving Afghanistan via flights to Dubai. It may be impossible to stop the graft altogether, but it can certainly be reduced to less catastrophic proportions through simple steps such as building more accountability into Western contracts for logistics, construction, and other tasks. These lucrative jobs are handed out to prime contractors who are able to navigate a Byzantine legal process and then hire shady subcontractor firms that give kickbacks to Afghan power brokers. This process has led to the proliferation of private security firms, which deploy veritable armies of gunmen to safeguard trucks carrying Western supplies. As noted in a June report from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, “A typical convoy of 300 supply trucks going from Kabul to Kandahar, for example, will travel with 400 to 500 guards in dozens of trucks armed with heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs).” Often the contractors will attack people traveling on the highways or living around them to ensure safe passage of their goods. When the contractors can't fight their way through, they simply pay off the Taliban en route. The U.S. is happy not to deploy scarce soldiers for such assignments, but the cost is steep. This process, the House report noted, “fuels warlordism, extortion, and corruption, and it may be a significant source of funding for insurgents ... undercut[ting] efforts to establish popular confidence in a credible and sustainable Afghan government.” As things stand, contractors provide precious little information about where their money goes. Before his dismissal, McChrystal set out to change this unacceptable situation by establishing two task forces to monitor coalition contracts and the local trucking firms that supply them. Petraeus is putting even more emphasis on this area by appointing Brigadier General H.R. McMaster—a brilliant and forceful officer who is famous for writing a popular book about Vietnam and for his success in pacifying Tal Afar, Iraq in 2005-2006—to take charge of anti-corruption efforts. He has only recently arrived but if given time and resources—and cooperation from civilian agencies—he should be able to reduce the funds flowing to malign power brokers and to the Taliban, who have a symbiotic relationship with them. It may also be necessary to redirect some American and Afghan troops to increase security on major roads so as to decrease reliance on private security contractors—something President Karzai has said he would support. Nobody should be under any illusions that such efforts will transform Afghanistan into Switzerland. But that isn't the goal. Afghans, like residents of Illinois and New Jersey, will tolerate a certain degree of corruption. What they won't accept is the brazen, unconstrained thievery practiced by all too many government officials today, who demand a bribe to perform the simplest service, whether allowing a motorist to pass a checkpoint or a farmer to file a legal grievance against an interloper who has stolen his land. Bribes are also necessary to secure many government jobs—which in turn necessitates that officials collect more bribes to pay for the cost of office. A recent survey of 6,500 Afghans by the international group Integrity Watch Afghanistan found that 70 percent perceive corruption as a problem and that 50 percent “consider that corruption fosters the expansion of the Taliban.” The figures are even higher in Kandahar and other areas where, no coincidence, the Taliban have displayed the most strength. If coalition forces, working with honest Afghans (yes, they do exist), can reduce the overall level of corruption, they can do much to reduce the insurgency's appeal. As things stand, the Taliban posture, rather hypocritically, as the incorruptible guardians of Islamic virtue fighting against the crooks who dominate the current government and against the foreign soldiers who are seen as their enablers. Reduce the level of corruption and popular anger will be directed where it belongs—against the Taliban, with their unpopular, antediluvian ideology and history of brutal, horrifying violence. That is a difficult task, but it is no longer as unthinkable as it was when NATO had only 50,000 troops in the country. With 140,000 foreign troops—and 130,000 soldiers in the Afghan National Army, which is widely viewed as relatively clean—ISAF has newfound leverage to take on not only the Taliban but also the abusive practices that enhance their appeal. And in David Petraeus, ISAF has a commander uniquely skilled in the delicate art of fighting alongside a local government while working to reform it.</strong><br />

<strong>A good way to understand what is going right in Afghanistan, rather than fixate on the Karzai government’s limitations, is to spend a few days in the field watching the Afghan army in its recruiting, training and operational planning. I had this opportunity last week. New recruits begin service under the auspices of the NATO Training Mission for Afghanistan, or NTM-A). This is run by Gen. Bill Caldwell, an U.S. Army three-star officer. He and his team have revamped the effort since arriving in late fall. And by all accounts, the U.S. Defense Department is bending over backward to help. NATO is still short on trainers, but that is largely because the Afghan army is growing fast and the previously poor ratios of trainers to soldiers are being corrected. Literacy training is provided to the new Afghan soldiers, for only 11 percent are estimated to be literate. Pay has roughly doubled this year, which helps with retention as well as recruiting. There are still equipment shortages for the Afghan security forces, but that is partly due to the inevitable slowness of the U.S. contracting system. These shortfalls are now being rapidly reduced. New courses have been created for Afghan noncommissioned officers, the leaders crucial to any good military’s performance in the field. Graduates of Afghanistan’s military officer academy, who would have previously been steered to safe jobs by political allies, are now deployed where they are most needed -- in the field. As a result, the Afghan army is now on track to reach its interim goal of 134,000 troops by this fall, and an ultimate size of roughly 171,000 by next year. The pursuit of quantity is not slowing efforts to improve the force’s quality. One indicator of the latter is the number of Afghan soldiers with basic marksmanship proficiency -- previously 35 percent, now 65 percent. But best is how these forces are doing in the field. Formed into units and deployed, they are teamed with NATO units—an Afghan brigade of some 3,000 soldiers might be paired with a U.S. battalion of, say, 1,000, for example, though ratios can vary. And in some places, NATO continues to outnumber the Afghan security forces, at least for now. Those sister units then exercise, patrol and fight together, providing on-the-job training to complement the schoolroom and basic field instruction. With the typical Afghan unit, this process continues for many months -- if not a year or two. In some places, in fact, the development has been so rapid that Afghan Army units are planning and conducting operations on their own—even declining to ask for help in some of them. There is a long way to go, and the police lag the army badly among other problems, with drug abuse and corruption still big challenges. But progress is already palpable. The Afghan Army is the best place I found to look for good news to balance the all too common bad news in Afghanistan. A strong Afghan security force is probably the linchpin of our exit strategy, so this good news should not be underrated.</strong><br />

The squo solves legitimacy and corruption<br />

Kagan 9 <strong>[Frederick, In Afghanistan, Real leverage Starts with More Troops, Washington Post, American Institute for Public Policy Research, November 27th, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/article/101363" rel="nofollow">http://www.aei.org/article/101363</a></span></strong><br />

<strong>The president will soon announce the deployment of additional U.S. forces to Afghanistan, in a speech likely to emphasize the importance of political progress there. Legitimacy is the most important outcome of a counterinsurgency strategy, not, as some have suggested, an input. It is unfortunate that much of the debate has ignored the role that additional military forces can play in building legitimacy and effective government in a counterinsurgency. Adding forces gives us leverage; military forces are vital to the success of any political strategy because they contribute directly to improving governance as well as to improving security. The recent American experience in Iraq illustrates how U.S. forces and diplomacy helped correct the behaviors of a sometimes malign government in ways that helped neutralize insurgent groups. In early 2007, many Iraqi leaders were using instruments of state to support sectarian death squads. The dysfunctional government could not secure the population, pass laws or provide services to its people. The implementation of a fully resourced counterinsurgency strategy--enabled by the deployment of nearly six additional U.S. combat brigades--transformed Iraq's government within 18 months. Opponents of the surge argued that Iraqis would &quot;step up&quot; politically and militarily only if they knew that U.S. forces would leave. Instead, before committing to the fight, political leaders and populations throughout Iraq assessed whether U.S. forces would stay long enough to secure them. Iraqis stepped up precisely because of the absence of conditionality and time limits on U.S. force levels. If the Afghan government were fully legitimate, there would be no insurgency. U.S. and international actions must aim to improve the Afghan government's ability to provide basic services such as security and dispute resolution nationwide, building the legitimacy of the government in Kabul sufficiently to dampen a large-scale insurgency. They must persuade and even compel Afghan leaders to stop activities that alienate the people and create fertile ground for insurgents. Afghan forces can learn by listening to the exhortations of mentors and by seeing the world's best military perform those tasks. Adding American forces in large numbers would help. It is critical that the Afghan people be provided security. Continuous violence, insurgent intimidation and propaganda campaigns create a pervasive sense of insecurity that undermines the government. As we have seen in Iraq and some parts of Afghanistan, a reduction in violence can slow or stop the erosion of the government's legitimacy. It can also create space in which to resolve underlying tensions that had fueled the violence, through negotiation or the construction of more effective governmental structures, neither of which can occur without security. But American military forces also contribute directly to efforts to improve Afghan institutions. In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, international troops will partner with army and police units. Afghan forces can learn by listening to the exhortations of mentors and by seeing the world's best military perform those tasks. Partnered American units also hinder illegal activities, such as extortion, that Afghan units might otherwise undertake. American military forces can also help restrain politicians' abuses of power. U.S. forces can develop a picture of local power structures, including those through which Afghan officials abuse their power and exacerbate the insurgency. American commanders can collect evidence on individual offenders that a reformed Afghan judicial system would one day be able to use. In the short term, such evidence can be published, embarrassing the official and others involved. Since much of the corruption involves narcotics, the United States and its partners can use international legal mechanisms to pursue Afghan officials in more reliable court systems. We can also threaten to add the worst offenders to our target lists when abuse of power directly supports the enemy. Used systematically, as happened in Iraq, this leverage can dramatically alter the behavior of networks of people misusing their power.</strong><br />

The US will win - multiple reasons<br />

<br />
<strong>We face huge challenges in Afghanistan, to be sure. No one watching the news, or hearing President Barack Obama’s sober tone on Dec. 1 at West Point, or listening to testimony from Gen. Stanley McChrystal and Ambassador Karl Eikenberry last week, could doubt that basic reality. But in these serious, difficult times, it is worth remembering all the things that actually are working in our favor in Afghanistan now. First, Afghans want a better future for themselves. This is true for Afghans in their own country, as well as for the Diaspora of Afghans around the world — many of whom have moved back home to help build a new country, others of whom stand ready to invest, trade and assist in other ways. Most Afghans reject war. They also reject the Taliban, by 90 percent or more in most polls. Among the majority of the Afghan people who are not Pashtun, in fact, support for the Taliban is virtually zero. Even among the Durrani, one of the two main Pashtun tribal groupings, support for the Taliban has been limited (the Taliban’s main support has come from the Pashtun Ghilzai tribes). The Taliban is not a popular insurgency. It is in equal parts a narco-terrorist organization willing to use drug smuggling to finance its operations, an extremist Islamist movement with an intolerant view of nonbelievers and a backward view of the role of women, and a ruthless organization willing to use brutal violence against innocent, law-abiding citizens to impose its version of Islam. Yes, it has achieved impressive discipline in its ranks in some ways, and battlefield momentum as well, but it has no positive vision for the country — and Afghans know it. There are also many good and committed “average citizens” in the country today. In Kandahar City citizens are telling authorities about the locations of up to 80 percent of all improvised explosive devices before they go off, allowing security forces to defuse them. This high percentage, higher than ever witnessed in Iraq, further suggests that our efforts to quell the Taliban may have found unexpected support from the general population in one of the Taliban strongholds, support that a counterinsurgency can build upon. Progress is apparent in other places too. In the town of Nawa in Helmand Province, for example, an infusion of U.S. forces in 2009 has turned a previously lawless area held by the Taliban into a relatively secure area where ordinary people can begin to get back to their daily lives. Second, elements of the Afghan security forces are improving fast. This is most true for the army. With NATO’s International Security Assistance Force focused intently now on proper training and mentoring, the building of Afghan security forces that can protect their own people should accelerate. Third, life in Afghanistan has actually improved somewhat compared with the recent past. Yes, the progress is uneven, and the poor remain very badly off. But overall the economy, education, healthcare and similar indicators are moving more in the right direction than the wrong one. Material progress has contributed to a reservoir of goodwill among the Afghan people toward those in authority. President Karzai, the United States, and NATO all still enjoyed at least 60 percent support from the population as of summer 2009 — far better than the United States has enjoyed in Iraq. This popularity number is fragile, and uneven among different groups, but we do have some advantages in how the Afghan public views the situation nonetheless. Fourth, NATO in general and the United States in particular know how to carry out counterinsurgency missions better than ever before. Troops are experienced in the art of counterinsurgency and knowledgeable about Afghanistan. We also have excellent commanders, starting with Central Command Combatant Cmdr. Gen. David Petraeus and Gen. McChrystal, who directs both the NATO forces and the separate, U.S.-led counterterrorism force carrying out Operation Enduring Freedom there. Commanders at much lower levels of authority, the ones who execute the strategy day in and day out, are also seasoned and quite smart in the ways of this type of warfare. The importance of good leadership in counterinsurgency is very significant, and our strengths in this area are a major asset. Fifth, enough troops are now on the way. Until now, on the ground, troop shortages prevented combined Afghan and NATO forces from securing many districts, towns and villages. Worse, it left troops stalemated in dangerous situations over extended periods of time because they did not have the capacity to seize land and sustain control. It left NATO forces relying too heavily on air strikes with all their potential to cause accidental deaths of innocents (a policy that McChrystal has changed; air strikes are generally allowed now only if NATO troops are in direct peril). And it left Afghan citizens who cooperate with NATO and their government vulnerable to reprisal. Only in 2009 did these realities finally begin to change; only in 2010 will we achieve reasonable overall force rations. To predict success outright would be to go too far. But I honestly believe that, setting our sights at a reasonable level, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the odds are with us</span></span> in this important mission.</strong><br />

<strong>We waited until 2009 to give the Afghan conflict the resources that success will require. While we focused on Iraq, the Taliban regained strength and reinstituted its previous reign of terror in much of southern and eastern Afghanistan. But with the war in Iraq winding down and a determined international focus on Afghanistan and Pakistan, it is possible over the next five years to build an Afghan government that can outperform the Taliban and an Afghan army that can outfight it, especially with the support of a Pakistani government that continues its own efforts on its side of the Durand Line. During his visit to Washington, President Karzai discussed with President Barack Obama how the political and military efforts are faring and what endstate America will be willing to accept from Taliban negotiators, who are beginning to seek reconciliation with the Afghan government. The fact that elements of the Taliban are contemplating reconciliation is the single best piece of evidence that a successful outcome is possible in an Afghanistan that will require long-term security assistance from the West, but that with that assistance can achieve a reasonable degree of stability.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Though the new strategy is still at an early phase, making a firm assessment impossible at this stage, there are nonetheless signs that it is already starting to bear fruit. In Sangin, a region of Helmand province that has hitherto proved extremely difficult to pacify, the number of violent incidents dropped by 80 per cent in the month July-August.41 This has been credited on all sides - by the military, by British officials, and by local Afghans – as the consequence of the newly reinforced counterinsurgency approach. The reinforcement of the British commando battalion stationed there with a battalion of US marines has put sufficient forces on the ground to protect the population centres and block insurgent infiltration routes into the area. This has been combined with an extensive commitment to working more closely with the local population in order to persuade them to restrain tribal elements aligned with the Taliban and to expel insurgents operating amongst them. The efficacy of these efforts has been further enhanced by the existence of another vital component of good counterinsurgency: a commitment to good governance, provided in the form of the widely respected and notably uncorrupt new district governor, Mohammad Sharif.42 Combined with a growing sense of revulsion at the brutality of the insurgentsi, who now account for more than three quarters of civilian deaths, the population-centric counterinsurgency approach being undertaken in Sangin appears to have convinced a critical mass of the population there to withdraw their support for the insurgents and to start lending it to the counterinsurgents.43 “Before, tribes gave space to the Taliban, gave food, support in the night. Now they are not letting them into the irrigated areas [around Sangin]”, one tribal elder told The Times newspaper recently. “Security is better” added another, with a third observing that “people believe now that the Government will support us. If there is peace, they will start reconstruction”.44 The evidence coming out of Sangin at present correlates with the assertion of this report that a properly resourced, population-centric counterinsurgency strategy can work in Afghanistan, and is starting to do so. Though the resources required for this approach are greater in the short-term than the more limited resources hitherto being afforded to the conflict, in the long-term the counterinsurgency approach is undoubtedly more resource efficient since it offers the possibility of lasting - as opposed to merely temporary - progress.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Friday he saw and heard evidence that the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy is taking hold in critical Kandahar province. Gates toured U.S. bases and met with troops in the thick of the fighting in Kandahar city and the Taliban haven of Zhari district, west of the city. The birthplace of the Taliban, Kandahar is Afghanistan's second-largest city and a linchpin of the retailored battle plan President Barack Obama announced last year. Even as the U.S. nears the full complement of the troop surge ordered last year by Obama, the region remains a battleground, still far from under full control of the U.S.-backed central government in Kabul. Military commanders know the nearly nine-year war cannot be won without a turnaround in Kandahar, yet goals and plans for the fight there have been vague. The Taliban are fighting back, waging a fear and intimidation campaign to keep local Afghans from siding with international forces and the Afghan government. Gates wanted a firsthand look at operations in the dangerous south where Afghan and international troops are ramping up security. The Obama administration plans a top-to-bottom assessment of the war in December. The review will question whether Obama's strategy is working. &quot;I come away from my visits down here today encouraged,&quot; Gates told reporters traveling with him. He said that signs of progress were incremental but growing. Still, he added, &quot;Everybody knows this is far from a done deal.&quot; The bulked-up force here is aimed at blunting Taliban momentum on their home ground and setting the stage for a gradual U.S. exit from the war beginning next summer. Gates spoke with a couple dozen U.S. service members in a courtyard ringed with heavily armored all-terrain vehicles designed to help them survive the homemade bombs that are the biggest death threat to coalition troops. &quot;You guys are in the forward foxhole and what makes a difference in the whole campaign is your success here in Kandahar city,&quot; Gates told U.S. troops at Camp Nathan Smith, headquarters for U.S. operations in the largest city in southern Afghanistan. The troops were part of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, which arrived Aug. 18, and has already lost eight soldiers _ seven last Monday alone. &quot;Unfortunately, there are going to be more tough days ahead,&quot; Gates said. &quot;You know that better than anybody.&quot; One soldier asked Gates why the U.S. doesn't go after insurgents hiding in neighboring Pakistan. The United States is pressing Islamabad to expand its pursuit of insurgents farther into North Waziristan, a border area next to Afghanistan often described as lawless. &quot;I think the likelihood of direct U.S. military engagement in Pakistan is very low,&quot; Gates said. For the past 18 months, Pakistan has realized the importance of fighting insurgents on its soil and has effectively squeezed militant groups _ in some cases, concentrating them in North Waziristan. U.S. officials are looking for assurances that Pakistan will not end its efforts there because of the demands created by this year's historic floods. &quot;Everyone understands that the sanctuaries on the other side of the border are a big problem&quot; and the joint U.S.-Pakistan objective is to expunge those hideouts, Gates said. But he noted that recent flooding in Pakistan would delay the government's strike at militants there. From Camp Nathan Smith, Gates traveled west of Kandahar to violent Zhari district, which Lt. Gen. David Rodriguez calls &quot;one of the critical districts&quot; outside the city. Speaking to reporters, Rodriguez predicted that U.S. and Afghan forces will be able to show some progress in Kandahar province before the end of the year and in time for an important end-of-year evaluation of the war by the Obama administration. Rodriguez said the progress would be piecemeal and gradual, predicting Afghans would feel less intimidation from insurgents and local governing councils would be less dominated by local powerbrokers.</strong><br />

<strong>The final component without which good intelligence-gathering will be much more difficult is an efficient, honest, and properly resourced police force. The failure of the Afghan government and its international partners to properly develop the Afghan National Police (ANP) has been seriously to the detriment of operations in Afghanistan. Not only has training been almost non-existent in many cases, but poor security checks have made the ANP a favourite target for infiltration by insurgents, and low to no pay has led to rampant corruption. Not only has this decimated the ANP’s ability to conduct its day to day policing duties, it has also made it ineffectual as an intelligence gathering organisation. Ordinarily, the police should be one of the primary gatherers of intelligence in an area; a good understanding of the local community and the development of relationships with the people is part of a police force’s raison d’ être. In the case of the ANP, this interaction frequently takes place only to extort money.59 If the people despise the police and cannot even trust that they might not be talking to an insurgent, they will certainly not come to them with intelligence. Fortunately, the current surge of men and resources into Afghanistan has also been accompanied by a renewed emphasis on properly training and equipping the ANP, and improving the Afghan security services generally, and already, vast improvements have been made.60 As late as autumn of last year it was being reported that some areas had just one trainer for every 466 recruits, meaning that in reality, many were not receiving any training whatsoever. The extra resources and focus on developing the Afghan security services has seen that figure fall dramatically to one trainer for every 29 recruits.61 This development of Afghanistan’s indigenous security services is obviously a pre-requisite for success. Western forces will not be in Afghanistan forever, and it is therefore vitally important that this commitment to enhancing domestic capacity continues.</strong><br />

<strong>NATO has reached its goal of expanding the size of Afghanistan's army and police to 240,000 three months ahead of schedule, achieving a key measurement that will be used to gauge progress in the war. The size and quality of Afghan security forces will be a central part of a review that the White House will be conducting in December to measure the effectiveness of its strategy of emphasizing protecting civilians in Afghanistan. The improved recruitment and retention follow a pay raise and improvements in a payroll system. NATO has also increased the number of trainers dedicated to working with Afghan soldiers. &quot;Before we were training them very quickly and throwing them into the fight,&quot; said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the Armed Services Committee. &quot;It didn't work too well.&quot; MORE: Afghanistan war toll hits high mark DATABASE: American casualties in Iraq, Afghanistan, and beyond The quality of the recruits is also improving, according to statistics. A year ago, only about 25% of the soldiers graduating from basic training passed a weapon-qualification test. Today, between 90% and 95% pass the test, said Jack Kem, deputy director of the NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan. The size of the Afghan army has increased to 134,000 soldiers, up from about 97,000 in November, according to NATO. The police are at 109,000 now, up from about 95,000 in November. The plan is to increase the size of the forces further in the coming year. The quality and number of troops are only one goal that will be used to assess the White House's Afghanistan strategy, but the goal is considered a critical one. &quot;Perhaps the most important point is the development in Afghanistan of the national security forces,&quot; said Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., a member of the Armed Services Committee. The December assessment will measure a broad range of issues, including the viability of markets and level of government corruption, according to the White House. It will cover strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The review will use a set of congressionally mandated targets that are already being reported to Congress, but will also include other information. Commanders in Afghanistan are already routinely collecting data detailing everyday life for Afghan civilians. &quot;I'm trying to measure things like what the prices might be in the bazaar,&quot; British Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, commander of allied forces in southern Afghanistan, said Tuesday. &quot;I'm trying to measure the extent to which life is returning to normality.&quot; The level of violence will also be included in the review, but it is at best an ambiguous measure and can be misleading. In Iraq, violence initially went up as U.S. forces challenged the dominance of insurgents in their strongholds under a strategy called &quot;the surge.&quot;</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Corruption has constituted a viable threat in Afghanistan for some time, but measures are being taken there to help keep Afghan officials honest. Increased training, as well as salary and compensation reforms for Afghan police and soldiers are among the tools being employed to reduce corruption, Army Col. Thomas J. Umberg, chief of anti-corruption activities for NATO Training Mission Afghanistan, said in a “DoD Live” bloggers roundtable yesterday. When officials don’t need to take bribes or behave unethically to pay the bills and feed their families, Umberg explained, corruption will decrease across the board. “If you don't have systems in place that limit opportunities for corruption, you're going to have it,” Umberg said. “And then, if you don't pay adequate salaries, then you also create an environment for corruption.” Umberg explained that Afghan soldiers and police historically were underpaid, due in part to their pay system. Rather than being paid in regular installments by the government, soldiers received pay from their leadership, who received a budget for salaries. “The … commander would receive the pay for all his soldiers or patrolmen,” the colonel explained, “and then [would] pay the soldiers and patrolmen as he thought appropriate. As you can imagine, that provided opportunity for all sorts of different methods of payment.” Now, Umberg said, about 95 percent of Afghan soldiers receive electronic direct deposits for their paychecks, and police are receiving a living wage. Police have been problematic, he added, because they’ve resorted in some cases to “shaking down” people on the street for their pocket money. Starting patrolmen make $165 monthly, though if they work in a more hostile area, such as southern Afghanistan, they can make as much as $240 a month. “And in the past, when the patrolmen were grossly underpaid, there were challenges just sort of surviving,” Umberg said. “And today, on $165 or $240, you can live in Afghanistan. Now, you can't live all that well, but you certainly can live. So that's one way to meet the challenge.” Training also has helped to reduce corruption. Previously, local stations were given the responsibility of training new recruits on corruption. That has proven to be ineffective for a number of reasons, Umberg said. Now, anti-corruption training is centralized and given before a patrolman reports for duty. “Part of the training consists of training with respect to ethics and corruption, and the Islamic and Quranic underpinnings with respect to, in essence, stealing from the community,” Umberg said. “Because that's what you're doing when you shake down folks or engage in that kind of graft: you're stealing from the community.” The training is very careful to focus on underlying beliefs that prohibit corruption and other dishonest behavior, the colonel said. Because the Quran and Islamic teachings deter dishonesty, there isn’t a feeling of imposing ideas on Afghan trainees, said he added. “We define corruption as where you put your personal interests above that of your job or your mission,” he said. “So for example, if you are hiring someone based on criteria other than who would do the best in that job, that's corruption. Obviously, to take a bribe, that's corruption -- you take a bribe to do something that is a detriment to the mission.” Corruption, ethics and issues of honesty are fairly universal ideals, so it’s not really necessary to tailor the training to any sort of “cultural norm,” the colonel said. “I don't think we need to impose Western values,” he said. “The Islamic and Quranic underpinnings -- as you know, virtually everyone here is Muslim -- they're pretty strong and profound with respect to corruption. So we don't need to impose our values upon them.” Umberg said he sees hope in young Afghans who don’t see modernization as a bad thing. They have strong faith, family values and national pride, he said, and those things make them want to make a better Afghanistan. “I was on an investigation several months ago, and a young, 24-year-old sergeant was reporting corruption on behalf of a senior officer -- at some risk to himself,” Umberg said. “I asked him how he had the courage to come forward, and he said, ‘I do this for my faith, my family and my country. I'm staying here.’”</strong><br />

<strong>In the past month, the Afghan government has made significant progress in addressing the issue of corruption. The Afghan National Police have taken a number of steps to restore confidence in the police with the Afghan people. The recently released Afghan National Police Strategy (ANPS) states that the national interests of Afghanistan and the threats to them entail the need to “eliminate corruption all over the country.” The strategy further identifies corruption as one of the primary problems within the Afghan National Police: Corruption in the police force directly affects our poor people and never goes unheeded by the public. This unfortunate phenomenon erodes the trust and confidence of our people which the police must earn in order to be a valued institution. Also, corruption in the police force is a betrayal to the cause for which so many of our brave brothers and sisters in police uniform have made the ultimate sacrifice. The police, together with our judicial system, are responsible for the enforcement of the law and must set an example by eradicating all forms of corruption within the MoI. The Afghan National Army has additionally made significant efforts in the past month towards addressing the issue of corruption. Two new documents providing strategic direction for the Afghan National Army were recently published which addressed corruption; the National Military Strategy (NMS) specifically identified national interests that included “implementation of a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy.” The Guidance for Operational Planning (GOP) directly addressed corruption as a major threat to the security of Afghanistan: The effective establishment of the rule of law depends on the ability to detect, prosecute, and punish corruption. The existence of corruption in government organizations (bribery, patronage, misuse of power, selfish motives, etc.), diminishes popular support from the counterinsurgency effort. Funding and resources, which should go to the communities in greatest need, instead flow into the coffers of the greedy.</strong><br />

<strong>One of us (Sherjan) helped start girls education programs in Afghanistan even before the 2001 war, when the Taliban largely banned them. Even then, Afghans were yearning to move forward into the 21st century. Today, with the support of allied forces, they have a chance. She knows that much of the world sees the Afghan people as backward and wanting to reject those beyond its borders. Her experience, however, shows that this isn't the case. For the other (O'Hanlon), observing Afghans voting last August was inspirational. True, the threat of violence kept turnout quite low, but those who did vote were proud to do so. The defiant election workers and even the oft-criticized Afghan police showed the world that the government can function competently despite decades of civil war and weak state rule before 2001. Yet it is not simply our personal opinions or experiences that give us hope. Two new and encouraging polls that have received little attention to date in the U.S. back us up. They are important to bear in mind — not least for the U.S. Congress, which will soon be called upon to consider additional funding for Afghanistan. While polling is always inexact and potentially misleading, these surveys were done by professional organizations that in fact had found less positive trends before in earlier polls — bolstering their credibility now. Something about Afghanistan is again showing promise. Promising polls Start with the resilience and hopefulness of the people. A major poll conducted late last year by the BBC, ABC and German TV company ARD showed that 71% of Afghans believe life will get better. Similarly, a poll in November by the International Republican Institute, which promotes political party building and democracy abroad, shows that 56% of Afghans believe the country is headed in the right direction; only 27% believe it is headed downward. By contrast, just 30% were optimistic last spring. These numbers have significance beyond reflecting a temporary improvement in the Afghan mood. They suggest a renewed sense that the Taliban — which remains extremely unpopular, with favorability ratings of less than 10% — will be defeated. The Afghan people are not ambiguous on this score, reflecting a feeling that the current Afghan government and the international community can prevail in this epic battle. Belief in the government is important because Afghans like to go with a winner, or front-runner. Such support can snowball as people begin to gain confidence that the Taliban is not, in fact, coming back. Reversing this psychological trend is critical.</strong><br />

<strong>Second, the mineral deposits: The Defense Department’s office for economic investment activities in war zones, headed by the formidable Paul Brinkley, has concluded that Afghanistan may, in fact, be rich. Not just in its poppies, or its ability to attract foreign aid, but in actual resource wealth buried in the ground. Its iron, copper, lithium and other deposits may be worth more than $1 trillion. If they can generate even $10 billion a year for the Afghan state, that would nearly double the nation’s gross national product. This could also provide a long-term funding source for Afghan security forces and other major national needs. Critics and skeptics point out that resource wealth is often corrupting, especially in developing countries. Some of the world’s biggest producers of key minerals, gems and oil, for example, are among the world’s most kleptocratic economies. For such income streams often benefit only a narrow stratum of society rather than the population as a whole. They can also skew exchange rates, in what is known as “Dutch disease” — making it harder for farmers and small businessmen to sell goods abroad. Such concerns are real, and Afghans have to be attentive to this risk as they design contracts for the mining work. But mineral wealth will hardly introduce corruption, which is already well established in the country. Indeed, mineral wealth could provide the Afghan government and international community with opportunities to tackle some key economic problems that have long plagued the country. With the right strategy, it could even help reduce corruption. First, it could provide a long-term funding source that could gradually replace foreign aid. It could pay for Afghanistan’s army and police force, schools, health clinics and infrastructure, like the irrigation systems and roads needed by farmers. Lack of such prospective funding is partly why Afghanistan’s government has not been able to build adequate security forces or infrastructure. Second, with the money from natural wealth, Kabul could increase salaries of key ministers and other government employees. This would, in turn, deprive these officials of the excuse to take bribes to compensate for unacceptably low paychecks. Combined with improved means of ferreting out corrupt officials — which has already led to arrest or indictment of as many as 20 officials this year — the new funding source could help address corruption over the long term. Claiming a big turnaround from this recent news would go too far. The Taliban and Haqqani network still need to be weakened on the battlefield, and Afghan governance needs to improve quite a bit. But there is indeed reason for hope in Afghanistan.</strong><br />

Kagan, 9 <strong>-- former prof of military history @ West Point (Fredrick W., “A Stable Pakistan Needs a Stable Afghanistan”, 9/5/2009, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/article/100986" rel="nofollow">http://www.aei.org/article/100986</a></span>)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Winning the war in Afghanistan--creating a stable and legitimate Afghan state that can control its territory--will be difficult. The insurgency has grown in the past few years while the government's legitimacy has declined. It remains unclear how the recent presidential elections will affect this situation.</strong><br />
<strong>Trying to win in Afghanistan is not a fool's errand, however. Where coalition forces have conducted properly resourced counterinsurgency operations in areas such as Khowst, Wardak, Lowgar, Konar and Nangarhar Provinces in the eastern part of the country, they have succeeded despite the legendary xenophobia of the Pashtuns.</strong><br />
<strong>Poorly designed operations in Helmand Province have not led to success. Badly under-resourced efforts in other southern and western provinces, most notably Kandahar, have also failed. Can well-designed and properly-resourced operations succeed? There are no guarantees in war, but there is good reason to think they can. Given the importance of this theater to the stability of a critical and restive region, that is reason enough to try.</strong><br />
<strong>Pakistan's stability cannot be secured solely within its borders any more than can Afghanistan's.</strong><br />
<strong>Critics of the war have suggested we should draw down our troops and force Pakistan to play a larger role in eliminating radical extremists. American concerns about al Qaeda and Taliban operating from Pakistani bases have led to the conventional wisdom that Pakistan matters to the U.S. because of what it could do to help--or hurt--in Afghanistan. The conventional wisdom is wrong as usual.</strong><br />
<strong>Pakistan is important because it is a country of 180 million Muslims with nuclear weapons and multiple terrorist groups engaged in a mini-arms race and periodic military encounters with India--the world's most populous state and one of America's most important economic and strategic partners. Pakistan has made remarkable progress over the last year in its efforts against Islamist insurgent groups that threatened to destroy it. But the fight against those groups takes place on both sides of the border. The debate over whether to commit the resources necessary to succeed in Afghanistan must recognize the extreme danger that a withdrawal or failure in Afghanistan would pose to the stability of Pakistan.</strong><br />
<strong>Pakistan's ambivalence toward militant Islamist groups goes back decades. The growth of radical Islamism in Pakistan dates to the 1970s and '80s when the government encouraged radicalism both for domestic political reasons and to combat Soviet encroachment. The Pakistani government, with U.S. support, established bases in its territory for Afghan mujahedeen (religious warriors) fighting the Red Army.</strong><br />
<strong>When Afghanistan descended into chaos in the '90s following the Soviet withdrawal, Pakistan intervened by building the Taliban into an organization strong enough to establish its writ at least throughout the Pashtun lands. Links forged in the anti-Soviet war between Pashtun mujahedeen and Arabs from the Persian Gulf remained strong enough to bring Osama bin Laden to the territory controlled by mujahedeen hero and Taliban leader Jalalluddin Haqqani. The 9/11 attacks were planned and organized from those bases.</strong><br />
<strong>The 9/11 attacks caught Pakistan by surprise and forced a radical, incoherent and unanticipated change in Pakistan's policies. Under intense pressure by the U.S., including an ultimatum from Secretary of State Colin Powell, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf chose to ally with America against Pakistan's erstwhile Afghan and Arab partners. Mr. Musharraf long tried to channel his own and U.S operations narrowly against al Qaeda while diverting them from the remnants of the Taliban (whom elements of the Pakistani intelligence services continued to support).</strong><br />
<strong>But U.S. pressure to act in Pakistan's tribal areas and the inexorable logic of the conflict led Pakistan to take actions that brought it into open conflict with some insurgent groups. Those groups in turn came to see Pakistan itself as their main enemy. By 2004, Pakistan faced a serious and growing insurgency in its tribal areas. By 2008 that insurgency had spread beyond the tribal areas into more settled areas such as the Swat River Valley. By 2009 it had metastasized to the point where Punjabis and not just Pashtuns were fighting the Pakistani government.</strong><br />
<strong>Pakistan turned an important--and little noticed--corner in its fight against its own Islamist insurgents this summer. The Pakistani military drove the Pakistani Taliban out of Swat and the surrounding areas, including much of the northern part of the tribal areas. Most recently, Pakistani military operations (with covert American support) decapitated the most dangerous Pakistani Taliban group based in Waziristan by killing its leader, Beitullah Mehsud. He was thought to be responsible for the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.</strong><br />
<strong>In contrast with previous such efforts, the current Pakistani government has retained significant military force in all of these areas and so far appears to be continuing the fight even after these successes. Remarkably, the combat divisions now holding Swat and other areas in the northwest of Pakistan are among those most critical to Pakistan's strategy to defend against the always-feared Indian attack.</strong><br />
<strong>But as American and NATO forces in Afghanistan discovered, the fight against the Taliban must be pursued on both sides of the border. Pakistan's successes have been assisted by the deployment of American conventional forces along the Afghanistan border opposite the areas in which Pakistani forces were operating, particularly in Konar and Khowst Provinces.</strong><br />
<strong>Those forces have not so much interdicted the border crossings (almost impossible in such terrain) as they have created conditions unfavorable to the free movement of insurgents. They have conducted effective counterinsurgency operations in areas that might otherwise provide sanctuary to insurgents fleeing Pakistani operations (Nangarhar and Paktia provinces especially, in addition to Konar and Khowst). Without those operations, Pakistan's insurgents would likely have found new safe havens in those provinces, rendering the painful progress made by Pakistan's military irrelevant.</strong><br />
<br />
They won’t be able to resurge<br />

<strong>It is the need to keep the population angry and disenchanted with the government and its allies that explains why insurgents actively target humanitarian aid workers and reconstruction teams. Although these workers may claim to be neutral actors seeking only to serve the population, what they are in fact doing is improving conditions on the ground under the auspices of the Afghan government, and threatening the insurgency’s entire narrative in the process. Those critics of the conflict who argue that the Clear, Hold, Build strategy is futile because it will merely compel the insurgents to lie low until such time as Western forces withdraw misunderstand the nature of this conflict. The insurgents cannot afford to allow the domestic security and economic infrastructure to develop unmolested to such a level that not only will insurgents find it extremely difficult to launch attacks and to threaten the population, but that the population decides to switch its allegiance to the government altogether.</strong><br />

<strong>Though the separation of the population from the insurgency is vital in order to succeed in Afghanistan, this is of course easier said than done. This is especially so in a country such as Afghanistan, where insurgents are often physically indistinguishable from the population, and indeed, often are the population. No operation of this nature can succeed, therefore, without good intelligence. It makes it almost impossible to distinguish the insurgent from the civilian before he opens fire, in turn making it exceedingly difficult to engage militarily on anything but the insurgent’s terms. Moreover, in addition to reducing the likelihood of successful contacts with insurgency, lack of intelligence also increases the likelihood of generating civilian casualties, which is absolutely the last thing that needs to happen if the support of the people is to be won. This is why it is so important that the intelligence-gathering effort is taken seriously and is properly resourced at every level. Poor intelligence about the insurgency was another failure that marred ISAF operations when they commenced in the south in 2006. Newly-arrived NATO officers described the intelligence available to them at the time as “appalling”, and were shocked to discover that between 2002-2005, the US had not actually monitored Taliban activity in four provinces in the south, nor in the Taliban leadership’s base in Quetta in Pakistan, at all. Ironically enough, the reason for this was because the Americans did not believe any al-Qaeda leaders were operating there, and it was the elimination of al-Qaeda, not nation-building, that dictated the course of US operations between 2001-5.55 Good intelligence on insurgents will tend to come from four main sources. First, advanced monitoring technology such as satellites, radio-intercepts and similar electronic intelligence; second, the operations of professional agents on the ground; third, from captured or surrendered insurgents, and fourth from the local population amongst whom the insurgents operate. It is beyond the remit of this report to go into specific intelligence-gathering techniques on the technological or professional level, except to say that such activity needs to be properly resourced, as it was not in Afghanistan in the early part of the conflict, and it needs to be as well integrated as possible. It is not sufficient for one intelligence branch to gather information in an area without ensuring that this information is then shared with others who may be in need of it. The Afghan Mission Network (AMN), a project aimed at improving intelligence-sharing among forces in Afghanistan, is a good example of the commitment to integrating intelligence efforts that is so important in a conflict such as this.56 Moreover, it is also important that collaboration takes place with other intelligence agencies. This is especially relevant in Afghanistan, where cross-border insurgent activity, particularly into Pakistan, is pervasive. The main argument that needs to be put forward here, however, is that much of the most vital intelligence on insurgent activity will come from daytoday interaction between the counterinsurgents and ordinary members of the population. This makes the case once again for the counterinsurgency approach, where the emphasis is very much on extensive interaction with the people. This is extremely important, because as well as getting a better sense of the dynamics and potential grievances at play in an area that is the natural corollary of such interaction, the people are also more likely to be forthcoming with intelligence if they come to know and trust those to whom they are imparting that information.</strong><br />

<strong>5. Counter-terrorism is working. The escalation from a more limited and focused counter-terrorism strategy to a larger combined counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency strategy (in a country devoid of the al-Qaeda presence!) is predicated on the assumption that the terrorist threat is either stable or increasing – meaning that counter-terrorism has failed. The timeline graphs clearly show that the threat is fading, from its high water mark of 2004. There has been no global neo-jihadi terrorist casualty in the United States in the past eight years and none in the West in general in the past four years. Of course, al-Qaeda is not dead as long as its top leadership is still alive. This cannot be attributed to a loss of intent from al-Qaeda and its militant rivals. From all indications, including recent debriefs of terrorist wannabes captured in Pakistan and the West, the respective leaders of global neo-jihadi terrorism are still enthusiastically plotting to hit the West and do not hesitate to proclaim their desire on the Internet. Nor is this due to the counter-insurgency in Afghanistan because al-Qaeda and its allies all have their training facilities in Pakistan. It is due to effective counter-terrorism strategy, which is on the brink of completely eliminating al-Qaeda. A dead organization will not be able to return to Afghanistan. 6. The reasons for the effectiveness of the counter-terrorism strategy so far are multiple. First and foremost is al-Qaeda’s inability to grow. Unlike the pre-9/11/01 period, al-Qaeda leaders have generally not incorporated new recruits among its ranks. The leadership of al-Qaeda still harks back to the fight against the Soviets in the 1980s. Because he has been hiding full time, Osama bin Laden has not been able to appoint and train a new group of top leaders and there is no evidence that he trusts anyone whom he has not known from the anti-Soviet jihad. In the 1990s, al-Qaeda incorporated the brightest and most dedicated novices who came to train in its network of camps in Afghanistan. They became its cadres and trainers. In the past five years, al-Qaeda has not been able for the most part to incorporate new recruits among its ranks. Western novices traveling to Pakistan in the hope of making contact with al-Qaeda have been turned around and sent back to the West to carry out terrorist operations. Meanwhile, the success of the Predator drone strike campaign on the Pakistani border has dramatically thinned the ranks of both al-Qaeda leaders and cadres. Now it appears that these strikes are also targeting al-Qaeda allies with a transnational agenda.</strong><br />
<br />
Al Qaeda isn’t key to terrorism<br />

<br />
<strong>The above statistics are crystal clear: 78% of all global neo-jihadi terrorist plots in the West in the past five years came from autonomous homegrown groups without any connection, direction or control from al-Qaeda Core or its allies. The ‘resurgent al-Qaeda’ in the West argument has no empirical foundation. The paucity of actual al-Qaeda and other transnational terrorist organization plots compared to the number of autonomous plots refutes the claims by some heads of the Intelligence Community [4] that all Islamist plots in the West can be traced back to the Afghan Pakistani border. Far from being the “epicenter of terrorism,” this Pakistani region is more like the finishing school of global neo-jihadi terrorism, where a few amateur wannabes are transformed into dangerous terrorists.</strong><br />

No internal link—Al Qaeda doesn’t need a sanctuary to launch from<br />

<br />
<strong>Both the Bush and Obama strategies assume that al-Qaeda needs state support or sanctuary. That, after all, is the fundamental rationale for continued American involve-ment in Afghanistan. But throughout the “war on terror,” no one has made a persuasive case that the September 11, 2001, attacks would not have happened had al-Qaeda not had bases in Afghanistan. While it may take meetings and phone calls to plot terrorism, these can be done from nearly anywhere. Al-Qaeda's Afghanistan sanctuary was a con-venience, not a necessity. Destroying the sanctuary has not stopped bin Laden and his henchmen from plotting new attacks. Why, then, should the United States devote billions of dollars fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan if doing so has little effect on al-Qaeda's ability to launch terrorism? The answer says more about the way Americans think than it does about how terrorists operate. The United States has expended great effort to eradicate al-Qaeda's bases and training camps less because they were important than because we are effective at it. There is an old saying that, “when all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.” America has an amazing hammer—its military—which is very good at seizing and controlling territory. So, we reasoned, eradicating bases and training camps will cripple al-Qaeda. Yet there is no evidence to validate this idea.</strong><br />
<br />
No impact to al-Qaeda sanctuary in Afghanistan<br />

<br />
<strong>Finally, the Obama strategy assumes that if the Taliban regained control of some or all of Afghanistan and did, for some reason, provide support and sanctuary to al-Qaeda, this would increase the threat to the United States and the other NATO count-ries. Again, this overlooks history. Al-Qaeda was able to plot terrorism from Afghanis-tan because the United States was unaware of the impending danger. Had America known what was coming, it certainly would have rendered al-Qaeda's Afghanistan bases useless even without a full scale invasion. There is no reason to believe that if al-Qaeda somehow recreated its pre-September 11 Afghanistan sanctuary that the United States would not quickly destroy it.</strong><br />
<br />
Afghanistan not key—Yemen is more important<br />
<br />
Freeman 10—<strong>foreign correspondent (Colin, 1 9, The Irish Times, “Divisions Create Breeding Ground for Terrorism,” Lexis Nexis)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Experts say al-Qaeda is set to exploit divisision between the North and south of Yemen to attract recruits, writes SUDARSAN RAGHAVANin Aden, Yemen A HATRED of the government in southern Yemen is complicating US-backed efforts to stem al-Qaeda s ambitions across the region, according to western and Yemeni officials, analysts and human rights activists. The concerns highlight the extent to which the United States, as it deepens its military engagement here, is teaming up with a government facing internal divisions that in some ways are more complex than those in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In a speech on Thursday, US president Barack Obama said his country has worked closely with its partners, including Yemen, to inflict major blows against al-Qaeda. But experts familiar with the group here say it is poised to exploit the country s divisions to attract recruits and more sympathy from the south s powerful tribes. Al-Qaeda dreams of secession, said Najib Ghallab, a political science professor at Sanaa University. It wants to turn the south into the perfect breeding ground for global terrorism. Once two countries, Yemen was unified in 1990. But a brief civil war broke out in 1994. From the north, President Ali Abdullah Saleh dispatched thousands of Yemeni mujahideen who had fought in Afghanistan as well as Salafists, who follow a strict interpretation of Islam, to fight the southerners. Ever since, tension has gripped the region. The government s resources are stretched thin, as it also grapples with a Shia rebellion in the north. Southerners contend that the government has denied them their share of oil revenue, and has dismissed many southerners from military and government jobs. A wave of protests has roiled the south, prompting a government crackdown. Many members of the Southern Movement, a loosely knit coalition, now demand secession. We no longer want our rights from the government. We want a separate north and south, said Ahmed Kassim, a secessionist leader who spoke in a hushed tone inside a car on a recent day in the southern port city of Aden. In May, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the affiliate alleged to have masterminded the attempted bombing of an American jet on Christmas Day, declared its support for the southerners demands for a separate state. The group s leader, Nasser al-Wahayshi, promised to avenge the oppression faced by southerners. Southern Yemen, nestled at the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, edges the strategic Bab el-Mandab strait, one of the world s oil shipping choke points. It is also a gateway to Somalia, where the Islamist militant movement al-Shabab, which has ties to al-Qaeda, is fighting the US-backed Somali transitional government. Al-Qaeda militants have thrived in Yemen s southern and southeastern provinces. They are shielded by tribal alliances and codes in religiously conservative communities that do not tolerate outside interference, even from the government. A shared dislike of central authority and US policies in the Middle East has strengthened al-Qaeda s bonds with southern tribesmen. The resentment persists in Aden, where al-Qaeda militants bombed the USS Colein 2000, killing 17 American sailors. Inside the dented white car, Kassim sat with another secessionist leader Nasser Atawil. Now and then, they looked nervously out the window, concerned that Yemeni intelligence agents might overhear their conversation with a journalist. They complained that the names of streets had been changed to northern ones. They said northerners had taken buildings, farms and land from southerners. Northerners, they contended, gain entry into better universities and have better careers. Atawil, a retired army general, said his pension was half what his northern counterparts receive. What the government is doing will make al-Qaeda stronger here, he said. In another corner of Aden, the managing editor of Al Ayyam, the largest and most influential daily in the south, said the government has banned his paper for sympathising with the Southern Movement s cause. We are virtually under house arrest, Hani Bashraheel said. On Monday, journalists staged a sit-in to protest at the shutdown. But clashes erupted between police and the paper s armed guards; a policeman and a guard were killed. On Wednesday, police arrested Hani and his father, Hisham Bashraheel, the paper s editor. According to Human Rights Watch, Yemeni forces opened fire on unarmed protesters six times in 2008 and 2009, killing at least 11 and wounding dozens. On Thursday, a senior Yemeni official denied the government was using excessive force and instead said some secessionists had targeted government forces. They claim they are a movement, but they are outlaws, said Rashad al-Alimi, deputy prime minister for security and defence. With continuing government repression, concern is growing that violence could increase especially as the US-backed war on al-Qaeda unfolds in the south. Since July, there have been more reports of protesters bringing weapons to rallies, according to Human Rights Watch. In November, al-Qaeda militants killed three senior security officials and four escorts in the southern province of Hadhramaut. The recent alliance between a powerful tribal leader and former jihadist, Tariq al-Fadhli, and the Southern Movement also has escalated tensions. Fadhli, who is from the south, fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Then Saleh sent him to fight against the former Marxist forces in the south during the civil war. But in April, Fadhli broke ties with Saleh, injecting new momentum into the Southern Movement. Since then, protests against the government have intensified. The government has accused Fadhli and the Southern Movement of colluding with al-Qaeda. They have denied this and accuse Saleh of using the spectre of al-Qaeda to elicit support from the US and its Middle East allies. Still, some rights activists say an alliance is forming between some secessionists, Fadhli and al-Qaeda. Christoph Wilcke, a Human Rights Watch researcher for Yemen, said at least one al-Qaeda leader had joined Fadhli and the Southern Movement. He was killed in a US-backed Yemeni airstrike last month, Wilcke said. Any melding of the Southern Movement and al-Qaeda is far from established, he said. But that could change if the US-backed war deepens without Washington pressuring Saleh to stop repression in the south. Angry southerners, meanwhile, have accused the government and the US of killing a few dozen civilians in an airstrike last month. Yemeni officials say they killed militants and their relatives. It will change the sympathies if they have a common enemy in the United States, Wilcke said. Al-Qaeda will become more of an ally. This is exactly what we don t want to get into.</strong><br />

Military pressure is wrecking terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan<br />
Finel and Difo, 10 - <strong>Director of Research and Senior Fellow at the American Security Project AND policy analyst for counterterrorism at ASP (Bernard and Germain, “Are We Winning?

<br />
<strong>The last six month have seen a continued uptick in military pressure on Islamist groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan.4 Though the long-term consequences remain unclear, in the short-run, military pressure seems to be having a significant disruptive effect on terrorist groups based in both countries. This finding is demonstrated both by direct evidence of successful attacks on “jihadist” leaders and by indirect evidence such as reports that al Qaeda members are fleeing South Asia for safer areas.5 Al Qaeda’s diminished media presence and decreased capacity for initiating and executing significant terrorist attacks also illustrate its institutional weakness and eroded operational capability. Afghanistan has not been home to a significant, globally-oriented extremist movement since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001 and the flight of remaining al Qaeda elements in 2002.6 As a result, it is unlikely that the American military escalation in that country announced by President Barack Obama in December 2009 will have a significant impact on the overall threat from Islamist groups in the near-term. Nevertheless, the increase in American forces and the U.S. military’s demonstrated capacity to “clear” insurgent areas quickly and at relatively low cost may have some secondary effects in turning the momentum. This escalation has certainly made it more difficult for radicals to claim they are moving toward an inevitable victory. While invalidating that claim might not be worth the costs associated with tripling America’s commitment to that country, the value of undermining extremist propaganda cannot be dismissed as wholly irrelevant either. We eagerly await data on the first quarter of 2010 with which to assess whether the American buildup is having a positive effect in terms of reducing terrorist violence in Afghanistan.</strong><br />

Financial crackdown solves<br />

Bruno 10 <strong>(Greg, 2/1/10, “ Al-Qaeda's Financial Pressures,”<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/21347/alqaedas_financial_pressures.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/21347/alqaedas_financial_pressures.html</a></span>.)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In addition to the ongoing military campaign against al-Qaeda, financial regulators are beefing up efforts to cut the terror group's lines of funding. These efforts are showing signs of progress. In Europe, al-Qaeda recruits complain of being forced to pay for their own training and supplies; affiliate cells are recording video and audio messages to solicit cash from supporters; and senior al-Qaeda leaders are calling on donors to ramp up illicit contributions. In mid-2009, al-Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, complained of a shortage of food, weapons, and supplies (Reuters) brought about by a dearth of cash. Analysts are split on whether global financial woes or a weakened brand are responsible for al-Qaeda's declining reserves. And some analysts downplay the importance of any financial weakening of al-Qaeda. For one, terrorism is cheap: The London transit bombings on July 7, 2005, only cost about $15,000. As al-Qaeda increasingly connects to affiliates in Somalia, Yemen, and elsewhere, the wealth of al-Qaeda central may also be of less consequence. An increase in criminal activities like smuggling and drugs could easily turn around the group's fortunes, analysts say. Still, David S. Cohen, assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the U.S. Treasury Department, insists that targeted efforts to dampen al-Qaeda's finances are working. &quot;We assess that al-Qaeda is in its weakest financial condition in several years,&quot; Cohen said in October 2009. &quot;As a result, its influence is waning.&quot;</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>President Barack Obama insists that the U.S. mission in Afghanistan is about &quot;making sure that al Qaeda cannot attack the U.S. homeland and U.S. interests and our allies&quot; or &quot;project violence against&quot; American citizens. The reasoning is that if the Taliban win in Afghanistan, al Qaeda will once again be able to set up shop there to carry out its dirty work. As the president puts it, Afghanistan would &quot;again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can.&quot; This argument is constantly repeated but rarely examined; given the costs and risks associated with the Obama administration’s plans for the region, it is time such statements be given the scrutiny they deserve. Multiple sources, including Lawrence Wright's book The Looming Tower, make clear that the Taliban was a reluctant host to al Qaeda in the 1990s and felt betrayed when the terrorist group repeatedly violated agreements to refrain from issuing inflammatory statements and fomenting violence abroad. Then the al Qaeda-sponsored 9/11 attacks -- which the Taliban had nothing to do with -- led to the toppling of the Taliban’s regime. Given the Taliban’s limited interest in issues outside the &quot;AfPak&quot; region, if they came to power again now, they would be highly unlikely to host provocative terrorist groups whose actions could lead to another outside intervention. And even if al Qaeda were able to relocate to Afghanistan after a Taliban victory there, it would still have to operate under the same siege situation it presently enjoys in what Obama calls its &quot;safe haven&quot; in Pakistan. The very notion that al Qaeda needs a secure geographic base to carry out its terrorist operations, moreover, is questionable. After all, the operational base for 9/11 was in Hamburg, Germany. Conspiracies involving small numbers of people require communication, money, and planning -- but not a major protected base camp. At present, al Qaeda consists of a few hundred people running around in Pakistan, seeking to avoid detection and helping the Taliban when possible. It also has a disjointed network of fellow travelers around the globe who communicate over the Internet. Over the last decade, the group has almost completely discredited itself in the Muslim world due to the fallout from the 9/11 attacks and subsequent counterproductive terrorism, much of it directed against Muslims. No convincing evidence has been offered publicly to show that al Qaeda Central has put together a single full operation anywhere in the world since 9/11. And, outside of war zones, the violence perpetrated by al Qaeda affiliates, wannabes, and lookalikes combined has resulted in the deaths of some 200 to 300 people per year, and may be declining. That is 200 to 300 too many, of course, but it scarcely suggests that &quot;the safety of people around the world is at stake,&quot; as Obama dramatically puts it. In addition, al Qaeda has yet to establish a significant presence in the United States. In 2002, U.S. intelligence reports asserted that the number of trained al Qaeda operatives in the United States was between 2,000 and 5,000, and FBI Director Robert Mueller assured a Senate committee that al Qaeda had &quot;developed a support infrastructure&quot; in the country and achieved both &quot;the ability and the intent to inflict significant casualties in the U.S. with little warning.&quot; However, after years of well funded sleuthing, the FBI and other investigative agencies have been unable to uncover a single true al Qaeda sleeper cell or operative within the country. Mueller's rallying cry has now been reduced to a comparatively bland formulation: &quot;We believe al Qaeda is still seeking to infiltrate operatives into the U.S. from overseas.&quot; Even that may not be true. Since 9/11, some two million foreigners have been admitted to the United States legally and many others, of course, have entered illegally. Even if border security has been so effective that 90 percent of al Qaeda’s operatives have been turned away or deterred from entering the United States, some should have made it in -- and some of those, it seems reasonable to suggest, would have been picked up by law enforcement by now. The lack of attacks inside the United States combined with the inability of the FBI to find any potential attackers suggests that the terrorists are either not trying very hard or are far less clever and capable than usually depicted. Policymakers and the public at large should keep in mind the words of Glenn Carle, a 23 year veteran of the CIA who served as deputy national intelligence officer for transnational threats: &quot;We must see jihadists for the small, lethal, disjointed and miserable opponents that they are.&quot; Al Qaeda &quot;has only a handful of individuals capable of planning, organizing and leading a terrorist operation,&quot; Carle notes, and &quot;its capabilities are far inferior to its desires.&quot;</strong><br />

Pakistani instability not caused by US presence<br />
Zaidi, 10- <strong>Lecturer, Policing and Criminal Investigation, University of Central Lancashire (2010, Syed, “Negotiations and the anti-Taliban Insurgency in Pakistan” Asian Politics &amp; Policy, v.2, n.2)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The Taliban in Pakistan are not just a reaction to American or Pakistani policies; this view will be empirical and simplistic, leading to all the wrong conclusions. They are political Islamists, with a definite ideological agenda that is furthered by intolerant orthodoxy and violence. As with political Islam, the notion of primacy of power is a central theme in their philosophy; this is in direct opposition to the concept of primacy of state power, and this violence will continue to be used in opposition to the Pakistani state until one opponent overwhelms the other. This makes the Taliban in Pakistan a more serious threat than any ethnic or separatist challenge Pakistan has faced, since this movement is ideological rather than ethno-nationalist, which tends to subside with healing touches of socioeconomic improvement and antidiscrimination frameworks. In a way, the Taliban are anarchist in their disposition, since they are going all out to destroy an established state infrastructure without presenting a viable alternative. This makes COIN all the more urgent because such guerilla movements benefit most from time lags and accommodative deals, which enable them to entrench their footholds among swathes of civilian territory.</strong><br />

No Pakistani collapse<br />

<br />
<strong>Not for the first time, Pakistan appears to be teetering on the edge with a government unable to cope. Floods are ravaging a country at war with al-Qaida and the Taliban. Riots, slayings and arson are gripping the largest city. Suggestions are flying that the intelligence agency is aiding Afghan insurgents. The crises raise questions about a nation crucial to U.S. hopes of success in Afghanistan and to the global campaign against Islamist militancy. Despite the recent headlines, few here see Pakistan in danger of collapse or being overrun by militants — a fear that had been expressed before the army fought back against insurgents advancing from their base in the Swat Valley early last year. From its birth in 1947, Pakistan has been dogged by military coups, corrupt and inefficient leaders, natural disasters, assassinations and civil unrest. Through it all, Pakistan has not prospered — but it survives. “There is plenty to be worried about, but also indications that when push comes to shove the state is able to respond,&quot; said Mosharraf Zaidi, an analyst and writer who has advised foreign governments on aid missions to Pakistan. &quot;The military has many weaknesses, but it has done a reasonable job in relief efforts. There have been gaps in the response. But this is a developing a country, right?&quot; The recent flooding came at a sensitive time for Pakistan, with Western doubts over its loyalty heightened by the leaking of U.S. military documents that strengthened suspicions the security establishment was supporting Afghan insurgents while receiving billions in Western aid. With few easy choices, the United States has made it clear it intends to stick with Pakistan. Indeed, it has used the floods to demonstrate its commitment to the country, rushing emergency assistance and dispatching helicopters to ferry the goods. The Pakistani government's response to the floods has been sharply criticized at home, especially since President Asif Ali Zardari departed for a European tour. With so many Pakistanis suffering, the trip has left the already weak and unpopular leader even more vulnerable politically. The flooding was triggered by what meteorologists said were &quot;once-in-a-century&quot; rains. The worst affected area is the northwest, a stronghold for Islamist militants. Parts of the northwest have seen army offensives over the last two years. Unless the people are helped quickly and the region is rebuilt, anger at the government could translate into support for the militants. At least one charity with suspected links to a militant outfit has established relief camps there. The extremism threat was highlighted by a suicide bombing in the main northwestern town of Peshawar on Wednesday. The bomber killed the head of the Frontier Constabulary, a paramilitary force in the northwest at the forefront of the terror fight. With authorities concentrating on flood relief, some officials have expressed concern that militants could regroup. The city of Karachi has seen militant violence and is rumored to be a hiding place for top Taliban and al-Qaida fighters. It has also been plagued by regular bouts of political and ethnic bloodletting since the 1980s, though it has been calmer in recent years. The latest violence erupted after the assassination of a leading member of the city's ruling party. More than 70 people have been killed in revenge attacks since then, paralyzing parts of the city of 16 million people. While serious, the unrest does not yet pose an immediate threat to the stability of the country. Although the U.S. is unpopular, there is little public support for the hardline Islamist rule espoused by the Taliban and their allies. Their small movement has been unable to control any Pakistani territory beyond the northwest, home to only about 20 million of the country's 175 million people.</strong><br />

As for Pakistan, it has taken numerous precautions to ensure that its own weapons are insulated from the country’s chaos, installing complicated firing mechanisms to prevent a launch by lone radicals, for example, and instituting special training and screening for its nuclear personnel to ensure they’re not infiltrated by extremists. Even if the Pakistani state did collapse entirely—the nightmare scenario— the chance of a Taliban bomb would still be remote. Desch argues that the idea that terrorists “could use these weapons radically underestimates the difficulty of actually operating a modern nuclear arsenal. These things need constant maintenance and they’re very easy to disable. So the idea that these things could be stuffed into a gunnysack and smuggled across the Rio Grande is preposterous.”<br />

<strong>The problem is that the united radical Islamists are expanding the combat zone inside Pakistan, threatening the state itself. But our drone attacks on the united Taliban (and al-Qaida) are driving the radicals deeper into Pakistan, including its major cities. Also, the attacks inevitably also kill Pakistani women and children (or are claimed by the radicals to have done so), which serves as a recruiting tool for new jihadists. Thus, this is what Kilcullen was quoted as saying by Der Spiegel: &quot;I am against the drone attacks. Even if we could kill half of the al-Qaida leaders, what does it help us if we cause an uprising by the population of Pakistan?&quot;</strong><br />

Pakistan, Russia, Iran, and even China are willing to move in at Karzai's invitation and fill any vacuum the U.S. leaves behind. I'm not as sanguine as Schlesinger that any of Afghanistan's neighbors would ever involve themselves positively from a standpoint of U.S. national interests.<br />

<strong>From Pakistan's perspective, limiting the war on almost any terms would be better than prosecuting it for years, even to &quot;victory,&quot; whatever that would mean. In fact, the least likely outcome is a takeover by widely unpopular Pakistani militants. The Pakistan military is the nation's strongest institution; while the army might not be able to rule alone, it can prevent any other force from ruling. Indeed, Bennett Ramberg made the important point: &quot;Pakistan, Iran and the former Soviet republics to the north have demonstrated a brutal capacity to suppress political violence to ensure survival. This suggests that even were Afghanistan to become a terrorist haven, the neighborhood can adapt and resist.&quot; The results might not be pretty, but the region would not descend into chaos. In contrast, warned Bacevich: &quot;To risk the stability of that nuclear-armed state in the vain hope of salvaging Afghanistan would be a terrible mistake.&quot;</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>In preparing for the 2010 QDR, DOD identified three instructive trends in this evolution of force planning. The first is the need to balance current operational readiness with the requirement to develop forces for future contingencies. In the 1997 QDR, this concept was demonstrated in the tension between our readiness to &quot;respond&quot; and our imperative to &quot;prepare now.&quot; More recently, the concept of balance was introduced by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in the 2008 National Defense Strategy. The second is an increasing recognition that future operations are less predictable than we would like. Planning against a specific threat in a specific place would leave the United States vulnerable to the wide range of operations that history has proven we unexpectedly find ourselves involved in. There was false comfort in believing that to prevail in the future we could simply look to past successes. The third trend, tied in many ways to the second, is the increasing difficulty of neatly or reliably categorizing potential contingency types (for example, as conventional or irregular warfare). The hybrid approaches to warfare that adversaries are likely to employ demand that U.S. forces prepare for a much broader challenge set and be ready to move quickly from one &quot;type&quot; of warfare to another, often converging in time and place. We have been routinely surprised by our inability to predict the course or costs of the employment of our military. Even after the tide of conflict is turned and the United States and its allies and partners prevail in combat, there is often a decades-long requirement for security force assistance or follow-on activities in the theater to maintain deterrence or military balance. Likewise, so-called small-scale conflicts, such as counterinsurgency and stability operations, can pose significant demands on the force and call for capabilities that may be quite different from those employed in combat. These lessons substantially informed the 2010 QDR defense strategy and its associated near-term and mid- to long-term force planning and sizing approach. Taking past experience into account, and casting our vision forward 20 years, the defense strategy focuses on fulfilling four key defense objectives: We must be able to prevail in today's conflicts. We must look for ways to prevent and deter further conflict. We must prepare to defeat adversaries and succeed in a wide range of future challenges. We must preserve and enhance our force, including making necessary improvements in our defense institutions to ensure we honor the commitment and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform. This strategic priority includes caring for our wounded warriors, supporting families, recruiting and retaining personnel (including development of present and future military leaders), and seeking ways to rebalance reliance on the Reserve Component as the operational environment allows. As in 2006, DOD undertook the 2010 QDR in a time of war. Unlike its predecessors, however, the most recent QDR explicitly addresses the sizing construct to be used in the near term (5 to 7 years) while describing how that construct shifts over the mid to long term (7 to 20 years). Near-term Force Sizing (5 to 7 Years). This year's review leaves no doubt that as long as substantial numbers of U.S. forces are operating in Afghanistan and we are conducting a responsible drawdown of forces in Iraq, U.S. force sizing and shaping will be driven by the need to ensure success for the men and women serving in both theaters. Success in these operations significantly enhances our long-term security outlook. At the same time, the QDR requires U.S. forces to be capable of executing other elements of the defense strategy today. This includes limited prevent and deter missions focused on ensuring a defense in depth of the United States, preventing the emergence or reemergence of transnational terrorist threats. It also includes being prepared to defend the United States and to support civil authorities in the case of an emergency and defeating threats to U.S. allies and interests that might arise, such as on the Korean Peninsula. Finally, the QDR requires the force to begin transitioning to sustainable personnel rotation rates that encourage the vitality and long-term health of America's All-Volunteer Force. Long-term Force Sizing (7 to 20 Years). Looking out along the long-term security horizon, we see an even more complex environment with a greater opportunity and need to address our prevention, preparation, and preservation (prevent, prepare, preserve) defense objectives. Some of the particularly stressing operational challenges we face include: lower barriers to entry for dangerous actors attempting to acquire an increasingly lethal array of technologies, including WMD—more actors are more dangerous and can directly threaten America's interests and its ability to operate incentives for nonstate and state adversaries to challenge us asymmetrically—this would likely occur at the low and high ends of potential lethality and/or technology, and we should expect future conflicts to combine these approaches potential for state collapse or chronically fragile states to pose a range of complex challenges. Given the broad spectrum of potential future conflicts, Secretary Gates has directed force planners to develop &quot;an American military that must have the maximum possible flexibility to deal with the widest possible range of scenarios and conflicts.&quot;13 Although the U.S. Armed Forces must in aggregate be flexible, not all portions of the force must do everything equally well. Operations will affect each part of the joint force differently, including variations in the intensity and duration of use for land, maritime, air, space, and cyberspace forces. Nor should we overspend by inflating threats. Indeed, as the QDR states, &quot;Not all challenges pose the same degree of threat to national interests, rely on U.S. military capabilities equally, or have the same chance of occurrence.&quot;14 Ensuring our ability to meet defense objectives over the long term required us to move beyond a single, small set of scenarios against which to assess our future forces. For this reason, the QDR used multiple Integrated Security Constructs—scenario combinations designed to test the force's capacity to manage plausible but highly stressing combinations of overlapping missions. For example, QDR analyses tested the capacity of U.S. forces to meet the following challenges in overlapping timeframes: conduct a large-scale stability operation, such as Operation Iraqi Freedom defeat a highly capable state adversary in a distant theater extend support to civil authorities in response to a catastrophic event in the United States continue to execute a global campaign against al Qaeda and its allies. We also tested the QDR force against several other plausible combinations of challenges, each designed to stress the force differently in terms of its speed, strength, versatility, and durability. To analyze scenarios, we planned a contingency operation, determining the required force size and structure, then tested these forces using modeling and simulation where possible, and military judgment in other cases. We complemented these efforts with lessons learned from past and current operations and numerous classified wargames—many set in the distant future. Using this planning process, the 2010 QDR went far beyond the scope and time horizon of earlier reviews. By broadening scenario sets and testing multiple variations, we captured long-term challenges such as advanced cyber, nuclear, and antispace situations set decades in the future. We also explored the implications of increased demands for day-to-day global presence and partner capacity missions over a period of years. These missions—domestic support to civil authorities, security force assistance, and deterring nuclear-armed aggressors— have been only marginally assessed in prior analyses. Although we must be realistic about our ability to predict all of the factors that affect U.S. and foreign military planning— trends that include global economics, energy, demographics, technology, geopolitics, and domestic pressures on adversaries, allies, and friends—we are confident that the analysis undertaken in the 2010 QDR and the review's resulting strategic and programmatic decisions set DOD on the right course to guide the force's needed evolution over the next 20 years. The 2010 QDR concretely identifies the size and composition of U.S. force structure appropriate for executing the defense strategy. It then goes beyond prior reviews to establish clear measures for further force evolution, ensuring that our force of the future includes: ground forces capable of full-spectrum operations naval forces capable of robust power projection and effective partnering survivable fifth-generation fighter aircraft with increased range, flexibility, and multimission versatility agile special operations forces with organic enablers and support from general purpose forces more and better enabling systems, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as electronic attack communications networks, more resilient base infrastructure, enhanced cyber defenses and missile defenses the right combination of joint persistent surveillance, electronic warfare, and precision-attack capabilities, including both penetrating platforms and standoff weapons, to support U.S. power projection operations.</strong><br />

Afghanistan won’t collapse hegemony<br />
Lawrence 9—assistant editor, the national interest (Edward, America in Decline? Think Again, 28 October 2009,<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2009/10/28/america_in_decline" rel="nofollow">http://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2009/10/28/america_in_decline</a></span>think_again_97299.html, AMiles)<br />
<br />
The chorus of declinists has returned. Imperial overstretch in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are told, has imposed impossible burdens upon our military, while over-consumption and a mountain of debt has ravaged our economy. Meanwhile, a specter lurks in the East, as China's GDP grows ever larger, and its army and navy grow ever stronger. Beijing's star rises as Washington's falls. The unipolar moment is over, and Americans must learn to live within their means and adapt to a new international pecking order where theirs is one voice among many, instead of the loudest and most important. Or so say a bevy of our most learned academics and political leaders-including President Barack Obama, who boldly declared to the United Nations in September that &quot;no one nation . . . can dominate another.&quot; America, it seems, has had its fatted calf and found it lacking. If all this seems vaguely familiar, that's because it is. In the 1970s, the United States was supposed to be finished as a superpower. Our disastrous anti-Communist adventure in Vietnam had broken our armed forces, and stagflation seemed to have sapped our economic might. The Soviet Union, our great rival in geopolitics, was on a roll, supporting Communist insurgencies and uprisings in Africa, and invading Afghanistan in 1979. In that same year, Iran erupted in flames as the friendly government of the shah was deposed, and Islamist fanatics held hundreds of American citizens in captivity. The prestige of the United States had never sunk so low. Washington seemed powerless to stop these indignities, and looked to be a wounded dinosaur flailing about in a new environment it could not fathom. Our economic well being was in danger too. Japan, another rising power in the East, was purchasing great quantities of American debt and had purportedly found an economic model that was more efficient and productive than our own. Given these sobering realities, President Jimmy Carter asked Americans to recognize that our day in the sun had ended, and that it was time to adapt to a new world where the power and influence of the United States was dramatically reduced. Fortunately, the American people didn't acquiesce to his demands. In 1980, they elected Ronald Reagan, who refused to believe that America's day was over, and encouraged its citizens to share in his optimism. Over the course of the next decade, many of the nightmare scenarios of the gloomy declinists proved to be completely wrong. Instead of inaugurating a new era of Communist hegemony, the 1970s proved to be the apotheosis of the Soviet Empire, which imploded in domestic and economic turmoil only a decade later-leaving the United States unchallenged as the world's superpower. On the financial front, Reagan's pro-growth policies and Paul Volcker's work at the Federal Reserve tamed stagflation, making America fiscally healthy once again. And although Japan enjoyed a booming economy throughout the 1980s, it hardly eclipsed the United States as the world's premier economic power. The next decade would prove to be a &quot;lost&quot; one for Japan, while America embarked on one of the largest economic booms in history. In 1999, the United States stood astride the world as a noble colossus-and it hardly seemed possible that just twenty years before some had predicted its impending doom. So perhaps, in our moment of alleged decline, we find ourselves in a time similar to 1979 - for although history never repeats itself exactly, it does occasionally sound a few familiar notes. The challenges America faces - Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and the economy, to name a few - are daunting. It would be incredibly foolish to assume that just because the country has endured rough patches in the past that it can do the same again. But the knowledge that we have been in a similar position should provide some comfort. In the early 1980s, our elected leaders weren't afraid to try out unorthodox strategies to solve the nation's problems: tax cuts, deregulation, increased military spending, and a harder stance toward the Soviet Union. New ideas- some untested - proved to work, and our country emerged stronger for it. We need the same sort of policy innovation from our leaders today.<br />

<u>No overstretch—recruiting at all time high</u><br />
<u>Peter 9 <strong>(Thomas A. Peter is a staff writer for the Christian Science Monitor. “High unemployment means high military recruitment.” November 12, 2009. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2009/1112/p17s01-usmi.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2009/1112/p17s01-usmi.html</a></span> DA August 9, 2010 SM.)</strong></u><br />
<br />
<u><strong>As a construction worker in southern California, says Blaise Counter, life was pretty sweet. Working on what he describes as &quot;corporate millionaire homes,&quot; his $1,300-a- week paycheck allowed him his own luxury – a modest shared apartment in upscale Laguna Beach, where he could surf every day. And there was enough left over to support his 5-year-old daughter by a former girlfriend. But when the &quot;corporate millionaires&quot; hit the skids in the recession, so, too, did legions of workers – like Mr. Counter – who served them. And that's how – less than a year after losing his job and his apartment amid the palms – he finds himself today living in a steel shipping container on the front lines of the war in Afghanistan at a tiny outpost along the border with Pakistan. He signed up for the only steady work he could find – the US Army. Now a private first class, the avid surfer is hundreds of miles from the nearest beach, pulling latrine duty once a week in between dangerous foot patrols and manning mortars. But he's making about $1,900 a month, tax-free, plus room and board and medical care. In the mellow singsong of the California surfer patois that adds an oddly cheerful flavor to his momentous decision, he explains: &quot;I have a little girl, so I had to think about her and the possibility of never coming back to her. At the same time you've got to pay your bills and you've got to keep living.&quot; Counter is among thousands of Americans hit hard by the financial crisis who are finding financial refuge in the military, where in spite of the stark prospect of going to war, the work is steady and the pay and benefits are decent. Economic hard times are a driving force in what the Department of Defense is calling the best recruitment year since 1973. &quot;We're pleased to report that for the first time since the advent of the all-volunteer force, all of the military components, active and reserve, met their number as well as their quality goals.… [T]hat's the first time that's been achieved for every component since the start of the all-volunteer force in 1973,&quot; said Bill Carr, head of personnel for the Department of Defense. In his October report on 2009 recruitment, he attributed part of the success to high unemployment rates in the US, in addition to increased spending on recruits and better military salaries. ACROSS THE SERVICES, THE MILITARY MET all its goals and, after years of lowering standards during the peak of fighting in Iraq, this past year attracted one of the most educated groups to the military in nearly a decade. All the services modestly exceeded their recruiting goals, with the Army having the most success, making 108 percent of its target. In sum, the US Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force brought in nearly 169,000 new recruits, while the National Guard and Reserve forces brought in about 138,000. There is some question as to the significance of the military's record-level recruiting year. Some have pointed out that the services exceeded their goals only after lowering them, so in actuality fewer people joined the military this year than last. However, the military has also managed to attract an undeniably more qualified core of recruits. The number of Army recruits with a high school degree was up 11 percentage points from last year. Across the services, 96 percent of recruits had a high school diploma, the strongest percentage since 1996. Additionally, the services saw the best showing on their math and verbal aptitude test since 2004 with 73 percent of recruits scoring above average.</strong></u><br />

<u>Latent power solves overstretch</u><br />

<br />
<u><strong>Analysts who argue that the United States now suffers, or soon will suffer, from imperial overstretch invariably fail to distinguish between latent power (the level of resources that could be mobilized from society) and actual power (the level of resources a government actually chooses to mobilize).&quot; In his original formulation of imperial overstretch, Kennedy had in mind a situation in which a state's actual and latent capabilities cannot cope with its existing foreign policy commitments. To date, there is virtually no research on whether the United States faces this prospect. Part of the problem is that because the Bush administration made no attempt to ask the public for greater sacrifice, there is no observable evidence of whether it would be possible to extract more resources for advancing Ll.S. foreign policy interests. The Cold War experience indicates that the U.S. public is capable of supporting, over long periods, significantly higher spending on foreign policy than current levels. Yet this does not necessarily mean that the U.S. public would be willing to support a dramatic increase in foreign policy spending now if policymakers called for it. The larger issue is that though IR scholars use the term, they have not theorized or researched imperial overstretch as a constraint independent of counterbalancing. In the historical cases highlighted by Kennedy and others, leading states suffered from imperial overstretch in significant part because they faced counterbalancing that demanded more resources than they were able to extract domestically. As chapters 2 and 3 showed, the United States does not face a counterbalancing constraint. This raises a key question of whether there are limits to the U'S. polity's capacity to generate power in the absence of the threat posed by a geopolitical peer rival. Lacking a focused research effort, scholars can now only answer with speculation.</strong></u><br />

<u><strong>The long list of U.S. problems in Afghanistan and Iraq should not be misinterpreted. It would be a mistake to conclude that: (1) the United States should cease to act hegemonically; (2) U.S. values (i.e., culture) are flawed, for Americans and some others; (3) the U.S. armed forces have been demonstrably incompetent. A more sensible interpretation of events would be the following: (1) the United States is the only candidate for contemporary hegemon, and world order needs a hegemon willing and able to serve as world policeman, even one that makes some policy errors9; (2) in major respects U.S. culture is highly attractive, which is fortunate since it is not easily alterable, but it does need to be advertised and applied with care and restraint abroad; (3) Americans have become very competent at warfighting, but that prowess has not extended across the whole of the conflict spectrum. In common with all great powers in the past, the United States has to learn to cope with occasional policy failure. Failure through human error or sheer incompetence, friction, and bad luck should not be mistaken for precipitate decline. Too many commentators today are proclaiming the end of American hegemony. It is true that there are visible trends hostile to U.S. hegemony, the well-announced “rise of “ China and India, and one day, just possibly, the EU/Europe, and even a long-delayed Japan and Brazil. But for the time being and for many years to come, the United States will be the hegemon. This is to say that it will be the global leader, certainly the most important player, in any matter of grave significance for international security. This will be what one might call a default reality. It is, and will be, a consequence of conscious American choice and effort. Also, U.S. leadership, notwithstanding the exception of its behavior towards Iraq, will rest upon a base provided by broad global consent, albeit not always of an enthusiastic kind.</strong></u><br />

<u><strong>He or she who sits in Delhi with his back to Muslim Central Asia must still worry about unrest up on the plateaus to the northwest. The United States will draw down its troops one day in Afghanistan, but India will still have to live with the results, and therefore remain intimately engaged. The quickest way to undermine U.S.-India relations is for the United States to withdraw precipitously from Afghanistan. In the process of leaving behind an anarchic and radicalized society, which in and of itself is contrary to India’s interests, such a withdrawal would signal to Indian policy elites that the United States is surely a declining power</strong> on which they cannot depend<strong>. Detente with China might then seem to be in India’s interest. After all, China wants a stable Afghanistan for trade routes; India, for security. Because of India’s</strong> history and geography<strong>, an American failure in Afghanistan bodes ill for our bilateral relationship with New Delhi. Put simply, if the United States deserts Afghanistan, it deserts India.</strong></u><br />
<u><strong>Indeed, India is</strong> quietly <strong>testing the United States in Afghanistan perhaps to the same intense degree as Israel is very publicly testing the United States in regards to a nuclear Iran. I do not suggest that we should commit so much money and national treasure to Afghanistan merely for the sake of impressing India. But I am suggesting that the deleterious effect on U.S.-India bilateral relations of giving up on Afghanistan should be part of our national debate on the war effort there, for at the moment it is not. The fact is that our ability to influence China will depend greatly on our ability to work with India, and that, in turn, will depend greatly on how we perform in Afghanistan.</strong></u><br />

<u>Causes global nuclear war</u><br />
<u>Cimbala, 10 <strong>- Prof. of Political Science @ Penn State, (Stephen, Nuclear Weapons and Cooperative Security in the 21st Century, p. 117-8)</strong></u><br />
<u><strong>Failure to contain proliferation in Pyongyang could spread nuclear fever throughout Asia. Japan and South Korea might seek nuclear weapons and missile defenses. A pentagonal configuration of nuclear powers in the Pacific basis (Russia, China, Japan, and the two Koreas – not including the United States, with its own Pacific interests) could put deterrence at risk and create</strong> enormous temptation toward nuclear preemption<strong>. Apart from actual use or threat of use, North Korea could exploit the mere existence of an assumed nuclear capability in order to support its coercive diplomacy. As George H. Quester has noted: If the Pyongyang regime plays its cards sensibly and well, therefore, the world will not see its nuclear weapons being used against Japan or South Korea or anyone else, but will rather see this new nuclear arsenal held in reserve (just as the putative Israeli nuclear arsenal has been held in reserve), as a deterrent against the outside world’s applying maximal pressure on Pyongyang and as a bargaining chip to extract the economic and political concessions that the DPRK needs if it wishes to avoid giving up its peculiar approach to social engineering. A five-sided nuclear competition in the Pacific would be linked, in geopolitical deterrence and proliferation space, to the existing nuclear deterrents in India and Pakistan, and to the emerging nuclear weapons status of Iran. An arc of nuclear instability from Tehran to Tokyo could place U.S. proliferation strategies into the ash heap of history and call for more drastic military options, not excluding preemptive war, defenses, and counter-deterrent special operations. In addition, an eight-sided nuclear arms race in Asia would increase the likelihood of accidental or inadvertent nuclear war. It would do so because: (1) some of these states already have histories of protracted conflict; (2) states may have politically unreliable or immature command and control systems, especially during a crisis involving a decision for nuclear first strike or retaliation; unreliable or immature systems might permit a technical malfunction that caused an unintended launch, or a deliberate but unauthorized launch by rogue commanders; (3) faulty intelligence and warning systems might cause one side to misinterpret the other’s defensive moves to forestall attack as offensive preparations for attack, thus triggering a mistaken preemption.</strong></u><br />

<br />
<u><strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The blocks would fall quickest and hardest in Asia, where proliferation pressures are already building more quickly than anywhere else in the world. If a nuclear breakout takes place in Asia, then the international arms control agreements that have been painstakingly negotiated over the past 40 years will crumble. Moreover, the United States could find itself embroiled in its fourth war on the Asian continent in six decades--a costly rebuke to those who seek the safety of Fortress America by hiding behind national missile defenses. Consider what is already happening: North Korea continues to play guessing games with its nuclear and missile programs; South Korea wants its own missiles to match Pyongyang's; India and Pakistan shoot across borders while running a slow-motion nuclear arms race; China modernizes its nuclear arsenal amid tensions with Taiwan and the United States; Japan's vice defense minister is forced to resign after extolling the benefits of nuclear weapons; and Russia-whose Far East nuclear deployments alone make it the largest Asian nuclear power-struggles to maintain territorial coherence. Five of these states have nuclear weapons; the others are capable of constructing them. Like neutrons firing from a split atom, one nation's actions can trigger reactions throughout the region, which in turn, stimulate additional actions. These nations form an interlocking Asian nuclear reaction chain that vibrates dangerously with each new development. If the frequency and intensity of this reaction cycle increase, critical decisions taken by any one of these governments could cascade into the second great wave of nuclear-weapon proliferation, bringing regional and global economic and political instability and, perhaps, the first combat use of a nuclear weapon since 1945.</span></span></strong></u><br />

<u><strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The West has vital interests in the energy resources and strategic stability in Central Asia . Simply put, Europe’s ability to rely on “the Persian Gulf of the 21st Century” — Central Asia — for its long-term secure energy supplies depends on containing the PRC’s strategic ascent and quest for the same energy resources and the southwards transportation routes (there is a limit to the quantities of hydrocarbons which can be piped westwards through Russia). These interests can be secured through the Russian political-security hegemony in Central Asia , which, in turn, is facilitating the Western economic outreach. The European Union-Russian Federation (EU-RF) “Eurasian Home” grand strategy codifies such cooperation. The PRC’s containment can also be achieved in part by ensuring a strategic balance between India and the PRC, a policy supported by Russia . As well, Western interests would be furthered by the stifling of the continued spread of jihadism, a key objective of Russia as well. Moscow is most apprehensive about the jihadist attrition of socio-political stability in Central and South Asia and the ensuing spread into Russia ’s sizeable Muslim population.</span></span></strong></u><br />
<u><strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Ultimately, however, there is no substitute for the West’s long-term direct presence and military involvement at the Heart of Asia. A US withdrawal would abandon the Heart of Asia to a Russian-Chinese condominium with the EU — being dependent on the region’s energy resources — playing a pliant supportive rôle. Apprehensive as it is of China ’s strategic ascent, Russia does not have the means to singlehandedly block the PRC. To remain in Central Asia, Russia will have to compromise with China against its own better judgment. Russia would rather have the West in the area to jointly contain China .</span></span></strong></u><br />
<u><strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">It is therefore crucial for Russia and the West to demonstrate US-led Western commitment through long-term military presence and continued fighting against the primary foes. Afghanistan and Pakistan are the crux of such presence for they are outside Russia ’s strategic domain in Central Asia, and they constitute both the vital corridor for independent Western access to Central Asia and the primary route of pipelines transporting the region’s hydrocarbons to the West (or China ). Moreover, Western military presence in Afghanistan and Pakistan would </span></span></strong>calm down India ’s warranted anxieties <strong>of strategic encirclement and the imperative of an audacious breakout, thus</strong> significantly reducing the threat of Indo-Pakistani crisis and war.</u><br />
<u><strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Obama White House, however, is going to undermine these vital interests of the entire West and abandon everything.</span></span></strong></u><br />

<u><strong>Small footprint causes Taliban takeover, nuclear terrorism, and Indo-Pak war</strong></u> <br />
<u><strong>Kagan and Kagan, 9</strong> - * former prof of military history @ West Point AND <strong>military historian (Fredrick W., Kimberly, “Don't Go Wobbly on Afghanistan”, 10/12/2009, <span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/article/101110" rel="nofollow">http://www.aei.org/article/101110</a></span>)</strong></u> <br />
<br />
<u><strong>It is very likely that the insurgency will grow in size and strength in 2010 faster than Afghan security forces can be developed without the addition of significant numbers of American combat troops. If the United States should adopt a small-footprint counterterrorism strategy, Afghanistan would descend again into civil war. The Taliban group headed by Mullah Omar and operating in southern Afghanistan (including especially Helmand, Kandahar, and Oruzgan Provinces) is well positioned to take control of that area upon the withdrawal of American and allied combat forces. The remaining Afghan security forces would be unable to resist a Taliban offensive. They would be defeated and would disintegrate. The fear of renewed Taliban assaults would mobilize the Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras in northern and central Afghanistan. The Taliban itself would certainly drive on Herat and Kabul, leading to war with northern militias. This conflict would collapse the Afghan state, mobilize the Afghan population, and cause many Afghans to flee into Pakistan and Iran. Within Pakistan, the U.S. reversion to a counterterrorism strategy (from the counterinsurgency strategy for which Obama reaffirmed his support as recently as August) would disrupt the delicate balance that has made possible recent Pakistani progress against internal foes and al Qaeda. Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari, army chief of staff General Ashfaq Kayani, and others who have supported Pakistani operations against the Taliban are facing an entrenched resistance within the military and among retired officers. This resistance stems from the decades-long relationships nurtured between the Taliban and Pakistan, which started during the war to expel the Soviet Army. Advocates within Pakistan of continuing to support the Taliban argue that the United States will abandon Afghanistan as it did in 1989, creating chaos that only the Taliban will be able to fill in a manner that suits Pakistan. Zardari and Kayani have been able to overcome this internal resistance sufficiently to mount major operations against Pakistani Taliban groups, in part because the rhetoric and actions of the Obama administration to date have seemed to prove the Taliban advocates wrong.</strong> The announcement of the withdrawal <strong>of U.S. combat forces</strong> would prove them right<strong>. Pakistani operations against their own insurgents--as well as against al Qaeda, which lives among those insurgents--would probably grind to a halt as Pakistan worked to reposition itself in support of a revived Taliban government in Afghanistan. And a renewed stream of Afghan refugees would likely overwhelm the Pakistani government and military, rendering coherent operations against insurgents and terrorists difficult or impossible. The collapse of Pakistan, or even the revival of an aggressive and successful Islamist movement there, would be a calamity for the region and for the United States. It would significantly increase the risk that al Qaeda might obtain nuclear weapons from Pakistan's stockpile, as well as the risk that an Indo-Pakistani war might break out involving the use of nuclear weapons.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>The surreal belief in some quarters that abandoning Afghanistan -- described as a &quot;graveyard of empires&quot; with its complicated tribes, forbidding terrain, and peripheral strategic importance -- would not have direct and bloody consequences for the United States, never mind the Afghan people, can be answered with three numbers: 9-11. It is troubling that our political and foreign policy elites even need to engage this debate (including its more sophisticated but equally illusory variants like moving to an &quot;over-the-horizon&quot; strike-and-retreat strategy). At the same time, the experts (correctly) advocating a counterinsurgency strategy make the same mistake of framing their arguments purely with reference to Afghanistan's internal dynamics. As important as they are, they constitute only part of a wider strategic landscape that would be upended by a U.S. decision to reduce its political and military commitment to Afghanistan. A recent trip to Islamabad and Lahore revealed to me that most Pakistani elites -- including the small minority that could credibly be described as sympathetic to Western goals in Afghanistan -- already believe that the game is up: the will of the transatlantic allies is broken, Obama doesn't have the courage or vision to see America's mission in Afghanistan through to victory, and the U.S. is well along the road to walking away from Afghanistan as it did after 1989. This widespread Pakistani belief has encouraged behavior deeply inimical to Washington's regional aims, with the effect that the American debate over whether Afghanistan is worth it is inspiring Pakistani actions that will make success all the harder to achieve. After all, why shouldn't the Pakistani security services continue to invest in their friendly relations with the Taliban if Mullah Omar and company soon will take power in Afghanistan's Pashtun heartland? Why should the Pakistani military take on the militant groups that regularly launch cross-border attacks into Afghanistan when the NATO targets of those attacks will soon slink away in defeat? Why should the Pakistani government get serious about wrapping up the Quetta Shura when the Afghan Taliban appears to be ascendant in the face of Western weakness? Why should Pakistan's intelligence service break its ties to Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of the world's most potent terrorist groups, when it forms such a useful instrument with which to bleed U.S. ally India? And why should Pakistani civilian and military leaders overtly cooperate with the United States when it appears such a weak and unreliable ally of the Afghan people -- incapable, despite its singular wealth and resources, of defeating a 25,000-man insurgency in one of the poorest countries on Earth? As Chris Brose and I recently argued, it is vital for the West to prevail in Afghanistan because of its effect in shaping Pakistan's strategic future. Proponents of drawing down in Afghanistan on the grounds that Pakistan is the more important strategic prize have it only half right: if Pakistan is the strategic prize, it should be unthinkable not to press for victory in Afghanistan given the spillover effects of a Western defeat there. All of Pakistan's pathologies -- from terrorist sanctuary in ungoverned spaces, to radicalized public opinion that creates an enabling environment for violent extremism, to lack of economic opportunity that incentivizes militancy, to the (in)security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, to the military's oversized role in political life in ways that stunt the development of civilian institutions -- all of this will intensify should Afghanistan succumb to the Taliban as the West withdraws. These dynamics, in turn, will destabilize India in ways that could torpedo the country's rise to world power -- and the strategic dividends America would reap from India's success. New Delhi is now a truer proponent of Washington's original objectives in Afghanistan -- the Taliban's decisive defeat by military force rather than reconciliation and the construction of a capable Afghan democracy -- than some American leaders are now. Afghanistan is in India's backyard -- they shared a border until 1947 -- and the collapse of its government would destabilize Pakistan in ways that would quickly cost Indian dearly. Indian strategists fear that the spillover from a Taliban victory in Afghanistan would induce Pakistan's &quot;Lebanonization,&quot; with the Pakistani Taliban becoming a kind of South Asian Hezbollah that would launch waves of crippling attacks against India. India cannot rise to be an Asian balancer, global security provider, and engine of the world economy if it is mired in interminable proxy conflict with terrorists emanating from a weak or collapsing state armed with nuclear weapons on its border. The strategic implications of a Western defeat in Afghanistan for American relations with other major powers are similarly troubling. The biggest game-changer in the nuclear standoff with Iran is not new sanctions or military action but a popular uprising by the Iranian people that changes the character of the radical regime in Tehran -- a prospect one would expect to be meaningfully diminished by the usurpation through violence of the Afghan government, against the will of a majority of Afghans, by the religious extremists of the Taliban. And despite welcome new unity in the West on a tougher approach to Iran's development of nuclear weapons following revelations of a new nuclear complex in Qum, how can Washington, London, Paris, and Berlin stare down the leaders of Iran -- a potentially hegemonic Middle Eastern state with an advanced conventional and near-nuclear arsenal and a vast national resource base -- if they can't even hold their own against the cave-dwelling, Kalashnikov-wielding despots of the Taliban? Russia appears to be quietly reveling in the prospect that NATO, which appeared so threatening to Russian eyes during its multiple rounds of enlargement during the 1990s, could be defeated in its first real out-of-area operation. A NATO</strong> defeat in Afghanistan would call into question the future of the alliance and the credibility of American leadership <strong>with it, possibly creating a new and lasting transatlantic breach and intensifying concerns about the alliance's ability to protect weak European states against a resurgent Russia. China has no interest in Afghanistan's collapse into a sanctuary for Islamist extremists, including Uighers who militate against China's rule in Xinjiang. But a Western defeat in Afghanistan, which if historical precedent holds would be followed by a bout of U.S. isolationism, would only create more space for China to pursue its (for now) peaceful rise. And that is the point: the debate over whether to prevail in Afghanistan is about so much more. An American recommitment to a sustained counterinsurgency strategy that turned around the conflict would demonstrate that the United States and its democratic allies remain the principal providers of public goods -- in this case, the security and stability of a strategically vital region that threatens the global export of violent extremism -- in the international system. A new and sustained victory strategy for Afghanistan would show that Washington is singularly positioned to convene effective coalitions and deliver solutions to intractable international problems in ways that shore up the stability of an international economic and political order that has provided greater degrees of human freedom and prosperity than any other. By contrast, a U.S. decision to wash its hands of Afghanistan would send a different message to friends and competitors alike. It would hasten the emergence of a different kind of international order, one in which history no longer appeared to be on the side of the United States and its friends. Islamic extremism, rather than continuing to lose ground to the universal promise of democratic modernity, would gain new legs -- after all, Afghan Islamists would have defeated their second superpower in a generation. Rival states that contest Western leadership of the international order and reject the principles of open society would increase their influence at America's expense. Just as most Afghans are not prepared to live under a new Taliban regime, so most Americans are surely not prepared to live in a world in which the United States voluntarily cedes its influence, power, and moral example to others who share neither our interests nor our values.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>If decision makers interpreted interests along material lines, then analysts of foreign policy would need to look no further in order to explain state behavior. However, time and again nations take on tasks that appear to be counter to what a rational evaluation of interests would recommend – to borrow Barbara Tuchman’s memorable phrase, they engage in a “march of folly.”6 How could U.S. policymakers fail to disengage from Vietnam, for instance, when it was clear that the costs in blood and treasure were not proportional to any potential benefits that could conceivably be gained from an anti-communist South Vietnam? To prominent realists such as Hans Morgenthau and Kenneth Waltz, intervention in isolated, resource-poor Vietnam was irrational, “moralistic” and mistaken. Only “if developments in Vietnam might indeed tilt the world’s balance in America’s disfavor,” argued Waltz, would the war be worthwhile.7 They did not, of course – from a material perspective, Vietnam was next to irrelevant to U.S. national security. Clearly some other compelling forces had to be at work.</strong> State behavior cannot be explained absent an understanding of <strong>the forces at work within</strong> the human mind<strong>. Intangible interests, ones whose roots are psychological and inherently unmeasurable, often drive decisions in directions inexplicable to the empirical analyst. The war in Vietnam was fought more to send messages to adversaries, allies and neutrals than in pursuit of any material benefits that victory would bring. Diplomatic historian Robert McMahon spoke for the vast majority of observers when he argued that Vietnam’s importance did not derive from tangible interests, but “primarily from the meanings that others would ascribe to American actions there.”8 The reputation and credibility of the United States was at stake, or so decision-makers thought, and those were assets well worth a fight. One cannot understand the major U.S. foreign policy actions – from Korea to Iraq – without understanding the messages that policymakers hoped to send through their actions. The conventional wisdom holds that a healthy reputation of the United States is absolutely vital for not only its national security, but for the very maintenance of world order and peace. It is this belief, which McMahon has called the “credibility imperative,” that has driven action in consistent and observable ways since the end of World War II.9</strong></u><br />

<u><strong>Not much chance Obama will go that route. If the violence skyrockets next year and it looks as though the president’s ambitious objectives can’t be met, Afghanistan could look a lot more like Vietnam in 1973. U.S. forces withdrew. Our abandoned ally was soon overrun. South Vietnam became a gulag; Cambodia sprouted the killing fields; life in Laos was just plain lousy. By 1979, the Sino-Vietnamese war erupted. We can expect similar results if Obama’s Afghan strategy fails and he opts to cut and run. Most forget that throwing South Vietnam to the wolves made the world a far more dangerous place. The Soviets saw it as an unmistakable sign that America was in decline. They abetted military incursions in Africa, the Middle East, southern Asia and Latin America. They went on a conventional- and nuclear-arms spending spree. They stockpiled enough smallpox and anthrax to kill the world several times over. State-sponsorship of terrorism came into fashion. Osama bin Laden called America a “paper tiger.” If we live down to that moniker in Afghanistan, odds are the world will get a lot less safe. Al-Qaida would be back in the game. Regional terrorists would go after both Pakistan and India—potentially triggering a nuclear war between the two countries. Sensing a Washington in retreat, Iran and North Korea could shift their nuclear programs into overdrive, hoping to save their failing economies by selling their nuclear weapons and technologies to all comers. Their nervous neighbors would want nuclear arms of their own. The resulting nuclear arms race could be far more dangerous than the Cold War’s two-bloc standoff. With multiple, independent, nuclear powers cautiously eyeing one another, the world would look a lot more like Europe in 1914, when precarious shifting alliances snowballed into a very big, tragic war.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>However, there is some space between U.S. and Russian interests if it comes to a NATO defeat and withdrawal from Afghanistan. In lieu of a complete U.S. victory over the Taliban and other jihadists in Afghanistan as well as the cap­ture of al Qaeda’s leadership, most important Osama bin Laden, Russia’s inter­ests would be served more by the West’s long-term engagement of jihadists in Afghanistan and Pakistan than by defeat and withdrawal, thus containing the threat to South Asia and bog down the United States, NATO, al Qaeda, and jihadists in the region, diverting their attention and resources from deployment elsewhere. If there were a NATO withdrawal, Russia and/or others might be tempted to enhance the already growing military component of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO; members include Russia, China, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; observer-members are Pakistan, India, Iran, and Mongolia) and employ it to defeat or contain jihadism in Central Asia.<span style="color: black;">5 </span>Such actions would be more costly for Moscow, and many Russians would blame the regional crisis on American hubris or even conspiracies,</strong> further damaging U.S.-Russian relations<strong>. A SCO role would involve China even more deeply in the region, something that is probably neither in Russia’s nor America’s interests. In this event, Moscow likely would promote a more virulently anti-Western, especially anti-American, and perhaps “Eurasianist” line, proposing an alliance of non-Western civilizations to counter American hegemony. In the long-term, this could compensate Russia’s Muslims for Moscow’s war against foreign Muslims and rally some Islamic states toward SCO, further threaten­ing American interests. At present, Moscow supports U.S. efforts in Afghanistan, where the West is doing heavy lifting for the Kremlin. It is imperative that Moscow’s support continues and grows, even if NATO draws back from ground operations to covert and air operations. It is in the American and Russian interest to maxi­mize reconstruction, intelligence, security, and, perhaps in the future, limited military forms of cooperation in Afghanistan. Otherwise, as Barnett Rubin and Ahmed Rashid have warned, Afghanistan and Central Asia could be trans­formed into yet another region where Russian-American differences lead to competition or conflict (such as the recent five-day war in Georgia), which can only benefit the region’s jihadists.<span style="color: black;">6 </span></strong></u><br />

<u><strong>What trends? Simply put, the world has entered a period of great flux and upheaval of uncertain duration. We are witnessing an historic shift in global dynamism from Europe to the Asia-Pacific region, initially in the economic realm, but one that will eventually reorder the geopolitical realm. The middle east – or more broadly the Muslim world – is engaged in an epic battle between tradition and modernization that jeapoardizes global energy sucirty. Although the nation-state, the fundamental unit of the international system since the westphalian peace of 1648, is thrivi ng in East Asia and the United states , it is under mounting strain as Europe seeks to create a supranational structure and artifical states in the Middle East begin to break down along sectarian and ethnic lines. Globalization has fueled an unprecedented period of economic growth around the world while unleashing the forces of disorder – terrorism, transnational crime – and rasing challenges beyond the capacity of individual states or current international organizations to manage – global warming, pandemic diseases, proliferation of the materials and know how to build weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). With the economic growth has can a historic transfer of wealth from the West to energy exporters, such as russia, and rising manufacturing powers, such as China. In this uncertain world, the US and russia are not strategic rivals, and neither poses a strategic threat to the other ( despite some overwrought Russian rhetoric to the contrary) , in contrast to the situation during the cold war. Rather, they share a set of common strategic challenges. Russia, by virtue of ite geographic location, and the US, by virtue of its global role, must build new relationships with a Europe that is expanding and deepening; they both must find a way to cope with the growing instability in the middle east, the challenge to energy security that implies, and, at least for Russia, the threat that that instability will infect Russia’s southern reaches ; and they both must manage relations with a rising china. In addition, both countries must deal with the dark side of globalization, and both have a keen interest in the role and effectiveness of the instituions of global governance, such as the UN and G8 the world bank and the IMF. Given their standing as the world’s two leading nuclear powers, the United States and Russia are each Indispensable to dealing with the problems of proliferation of WMDs, nuclear terrorism and strategic stability. The US, as the world’s largest consumer of energy, and Russia, as the largest producer of hydrocarbons, are essential to any discussion of energy security and energy’s future. Global economic dynamics and transfers of wealth will require bringing Russia, along with china, india, and others, into a more central role in managing the global economy, a service long performed by Europe and the United States. In east asia, to create a favorable new equilibirum, Russia has an interest in a strong power – that is, the US – acting as a moderating influence on China, and the US has no interest in a weaking russian presence in Siberia and the Russian far east, regions rich in the natural resources that fuel modern economies. In the Middle East, both the US and russia have levers that could help promote stability, if the two countries were working in concert, or fuel conflict, if they were not. In europe, Russian energy is critical to economic well-being and the US remains essential to security and stability. On a range of other issues – for example, civil nuclear energy, pandemic diseases, climate change – each country is capable of making a major contribution, given the vast scientific talent of each. In the former soviet space, both countries will be critical to building lasting security economic structures.</strong></u> <br />

<u>American and coalition success in Afghanistan is important for containing Iranian influence in the region, which has been surging not only across the Middle East, but into neighboring regions such as Central Asia. We could also see big power competitors of the United States, namely Russia and China, move significantly -- although not militarily -- into the region to influence outcomes since Afghanistan is on their periphery and both have concerns about Islamist movements among their populations. And, of course, <strong>failure in Afghanistan will affect America's stature in the world</strong>. As the Afghan situation unfolds in the months to come, both friends and foes will be watching closely for even subtle signs of American intentions, especially its commitment to continuing the fight. Not surprisingly, a lot of strategic hedging is going on among stakeholders in Afghanistan as America works out its strategy. <strong>Even a seeming lack of resolve will have consequences</strong>, as Afghanistan Commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal said recently in a speech in London: &quot;<strong>Uncertainty disheartens our allies, emboldens our foe</strong>.&quot; But it goes beyond that. Perceptions of who is winning and who is losing and who is staying and who is going affect the civilian population in Afghanistan -- one that is famous for bending with the prevailing political winds. Having the population on the right side is critical to any counterinsurgency campaign. It is also not outlandish to assume that defeat in Afghanistan to the Taliban would leave the United States looking soft and undependable with both allies and enemies, having a negative effect on American interests across the globe. For example, failure in Afghanistan will ripple into NATO, where America's leadership will be undermined, perhaps, convincing the Europeans of the soundness of their parallel effort to establish a European Union defense policy and force. Asian allies would certainly wonder about their American partner, too. Moreover, coming up short in Afghanistan certainly would not encourage the likes of the recalcitrant regimes in Iran or North Korea to come around to our way of thinking on negotiations over their nuclear and ballistic missile programs. And as the Pakistani foreign minister, Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi, plainly told the Wall Street Journal recently about a U.S. withdrawal before the Taliban is defeated: &quot;<strong>This will be disastrous ... you will lose credibility ... who is going to trust you again?&quot;</strong> Beyond big power politics, and although seemingly counterintuitive, Afghanistan has proven via the horrors of 9/11 that in some cases it is the weakest nations -- especially failed states -- that can be the source of some of the most significant national security threats.</u> <br />

<u><strong>What we perceive is what we believe</strong>. When other nations perceive that America will not act in its interests, they perceive us as a paper tiger. The reader may note that the “Paper Tiger” rhetoric has been absent as of late. After all, other nations perceived us conquering one country, sustaining operations in another, and persuading several other countries to sit down and play nice. Whatever other nations consider us, a paper tiger is not one of them currently. We built our credibility by doing what we said we would do. <strong>Credibility, is the lynch pin of i</strong>nternational <strong>r</strong>elations<strong>.</strong> It creates the difference between diplomatic lip service and statements that actually effect change. Some nations have a great deal of credibility - there is little doubt they will do what they threaten. The Chinese are an example of this, as was the former Soviet Union. Other nations vary in credibility. As Americans, we have seen our national credibility oscillate wildly. No matter what our credibility is, America sustains a very strong ability to project power. Other nations understand that our credibility is is a function of our will, and our will shifts. These shifts in will to enforce our decisions create credibility issues. North Korea is a credibility issue, as is Iran. Both nations routinely ignore international declarations in ostentatious ways, like launching missiles, or stating they plan to become nuclear powers. Most nations break international law in one way or another. Some do it fairly overtly, such as the Chinese claiming exorbitant swaths of sea lanes as their territory. Still others are mostly suspected of breaking the law through assassinations or other nefarious acts. When the international community, and America, tell a country not to do something, and don’t back their words with actions, credibility is lost. Any parent, schoolteacher, drill sergeant, or leader of any sort clearly understands the issue. No repercussions equates to tacit acceptance of the actions. A clear failure of actions to follow words undermines the credibility of the words. When words fail, actions tend to become necessary. This is the innate reason that words must carry weight. It is far better to deter a nation from doing something, than to revert to the use force to stop that nation further down the path. Pay now, or pay later, with interest. This applies to credit cards, education, physical fitness, and international affairs. When America says “Stop, or I will stop you” if the words do not stop the nation, America will have to act to protect its interests, potentially at a greater cost, later. It is better to stop something with words than with actions, for words are far cheaper. <strong>Words are cheap, but</strong> their <strong>credibility is bought with blood</strong> <strong>and treasure</strong>. When a nation maintains the credibility of its words, the long term cost is less. North Korea is a case in point. The international community has gotten to the point where maintaining the dysfunctional regime is preferable to ending it. If North Korea destabilizes (pretend with me that it is stable for the moment), the South will be in dire peril. Between the military and economic consequences, the South will potentially be destabilized itself. Millions of refugees with nothing more than the clothes on their back, malnourished, uneducated, and in need of a great deal of care, will come South - assuming South Korea can even take care of itself in the aftermath of potential armed conflict. The reason we don’t act now is the hope that North Korea will somehow get better, or the desire to let it be someone else’s problem. Hope is neither a plan nor a strategy. Passing the buck is not a legitimate strategy either. In the bitter, unfortunate end, North Korea must either become a legitimate state, or meet the end of illegitimate states. The question is, how much harm will North Korea inflict on the world beforehand? Paper Tigers and fallen nations go hand in hand. When other nations, or non-state actors (Bin Laden) perceive America as a Paper Tiger, they end up provoking America beyond endurance, and reap what they sow a thousand fold. As Americans, we end up paying far more than we should due to the wild oscillation of credibility we routinely engage in. If we don’t want other nations to perceive us as paper tigers and act accordingly, we have to maintain our credibility. It is better for everyone involved — especially us.</u> <br />

<u>Reputation can be defined as a judgment about an actor’s past behavior and character that is used to predict future behavior. In international politics, a major component of building or maintaining a country’s reputation involves resolve.5 Policy makers may believe that a <strong>lack of resolve in</strong> one military <strong>confrontation will be seen as an indication of general weakness</strong>.6 According to Shiping Tang, this concern frequently amounts to ‘‘a cult of reputation’’ among foreign policy makers, which he defines as ‘‘a belief system holding as its central premise a conviction (or fear) that backing down in a crisis will lead one’s adversaries or allies to underestimate one’s resolve in the next crisis.’’7 Of particular importance to the cult of reputation is concern about the consequences of withdrawal from a theater of war. The major dictate of the cult of reputation is that a country should stand firm and refuse to withdraw from a theater of war. The underlying belief is that a withdrawal would inflict a severe blow to a country’s reputation and thus ‘‘embolden’’ the adversaries by boosting commitment and recruitment to their cause.8 Since the end of World War II, a cult of reputation has evolved among certain American policy makers who maintain that <strong>being a global power means being able to convey the image of</strong> strength and <strong>resolve</strong>.9 According to this perspective, a reputation for firmness and resoluteness deters adversaries and reassures allies about U.S. commitments. Conversely, being perceived as weak and irresolute encourages adversaries to be more aggressive and results in allies being less supportive. This logic has had two general consequences for America’s use of force abroad: First, exhibiting resolve has been deemed necessary even in small and distant countries. This is <strong>because the mere perception of power generates tangible power</strong>, thereby reducing the need to use actual physical force against every adversary.10 In the 1950s and 1960s, this logic translated into military interventions in several places, notably in Korea and Vietnam, countries whose strategic value to the United States appeared questionable to some.11</u> <br />

<u><strong>Alarmists are convinced the United States is losing ground around the world. Two critical regions make them particularly anxious: Asia and the Middle East, where American power is challenged by big competitors and small rogue states. Both regions are also home to opaque nuclear programs and anti-American regimes; North Korea possesses nuclear warheads, while Iran most likely wants the same. Worse yet, America’s position is compromised by military and economic challenges, as it concludes two major wars and struggles to recover from a fierce recession. If the triple threat of China, North Korea, and Iran remains unchecked – as some claim it might–</strong> it would be news to these countries and their capitals. The US responded to each challenge symbolically and substantively in 2010. <strong>In some cases, it explicitly declared its intent while in others, it pursued bold action and empowerment measures. The return of American muscle is a reminder that no power can project force like the US and no country enjoys the multitude of friends who share its strategic vision (e.g. hemming in China, countering Iran, isolating North Korea).</strong> Any swan song is premature. <strong>This year’s warning shots were fired loudest in Asia, where the US and South Korea held a series of massive war games following North Korea’s alleged attack on a South Korean vessel in March. By July, thousands of Americans and South Koreans were mobilized for anti-submarine drills and joint maneuvers off the coast of North Korea – a combined effort that left no doubts about American resolve in Asia. &quot;These defensive, combined exercises are designed to send a clear message to North Korea that its aggressive behavior must stop, and that we are committed to together enhancing our combined defensive capabilities,&quot; read a July statement from US Defense Secretary Robert Gates. North Korea is not the only target of American posturing. The US’s expansive role in Asian waters is raising alarms in Beijing as well. US and Japanese navies are scheduled for drills off the coast of Okinawa in December. Last month, US and South Korean forces launched joint exercises in the Yellow Sea – water considered vital to China. And in August, the US staged joint maneuvers in the South China Sea with Vietnam, a country whose territorial claims frequently clash with the People’s Republic. The frequency of these drills is a direct consequence of renewed fears among China’s neighbors. China’s maritime assertiveness – specifically its claims to regional waters and recent deployments of advanced submarines and destroyers – has given new urgency to American primacy in Asia. As The Economist noted in August, “Absent without leave, America helped foster an overblown perception in the region of America’s decline and China’s ascent. It is now putting that right,” with</strong> high-profile displays of power and solidarity. <strong>Regional fears are also allowing the US to strengthen its position in the Persian Gulf, where Iran’s ambitions are creating consensus. This year has been punctuated by significant arms deals between the US and states like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. Although the $60 billion deal with Saudi Arabia received the most attention, Kuwait and the UAE are both expecting deliveries of sophisticated anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems soon, thus offsetting the threat posed by Iranian warheads. Not surprisingly, Qatar and Bahrain are both abstaining from the American-sponsored arms race, and with good reason: both maintain sizable US bases that already protect them from Iranian aggression. In May, the US broke ground in Bahrain for the purposes of doubling the size of its naval base there, which is situated directly across the Persian Gulf from Iran. This combination of new weapons systems and anti-missile technology ensures a more hostile environment for Iran, one in which its threats are cheapened and American allies are immune to intimidation. By empowering friendly states and flexing American muscle in the form of joint drills and deployments,</strong> the US is dispelling the myth that the world’s only superpower is neither super nor powerful. <strong>The Beltway is momentarily full of pessimists but</strong> America’s profile in Beijing, Riyadh, Seoul, Tehran, and Pyongyang is consequential like no other. <strong>Critical US allies are enjoying new resources and priority, while challengers to the American order suffer from isolation (North Korea), the threat of overwhelming force (Iran), and territorial push-back (China).</strong></u> <br />

<u>In August, President Obama laid out the rationale for stepping up the fight in Afghanistan: If left unchecked, the Taliban insurgency will mean an even larger safe haven from which al-Qaeda would plot to kill more Americans. So this is not only a war worth fighting. This is fundamental to the defense of our people. Obamas Af-Pak plan is, in essence, a countersanctuary strategy that denies safe havens to the Taliban and al-Qaeda, with the overriding goal of making America and its allies safer. Under Obama, the Pentagon has already sent a surge of 21,000 troops to Afghanistan, and the Administration is even weighing the possibility of deploying as many as 40,000 more. This is a sound policy. If U.S. forces were not in Afghanistan, the Taliban, with its al-Qaeda allies in tow, would seize control of the country's south and east and might even take it over entirely. A senior Afghan politician told me that the Taliban would be in Kabul within 24 hours without the presence of international forces. This is not because the Taliban is so strong; generous estimates suggest it numbers no more than 20,000 fighters. It is because the Afghan government and the 90,000--man Afghan army are still so weak.</u> <br />

<u><strong>Premature Western military disengagement from Afghanistan would risk catastrophic turmoil in the region, Western and Afghan officials say, responding to a rising tide of concern at the intensity of insurgent violence. Such greater instability would end up requiring an even bigger Western involvement to resolve in an area including nuclear-armed Pakistan and al Qaeda's main bastions, they say. The officials argue there is no substitute for a lasting commitment now that would permit a reduced military presence over time as the country stabilises. With insurgent violence at its highest since the Taliban movement was ousted from power in late 2001, public support for the war is declining in America and has plummeted in Europe. Former British High Commissioner in Pakistan Hilary Synnott, speaking at a weekend meeting of strategists in Geneva hosted by Britain's International Institute for Strategic Studies, said critics of Western strategy had to consider &quot;the very great consequences of perceived American defeat&quot;. &quot;There is real concern about Pakistan, with five times the population of Afghanistan, which has nuclear weapons and which has a new Pakistani Taliban threatening the state itself,&quot; he said. &quot;Those who argue, as some do, that the smart thing is simply to walk away would destroy everything that has been achieved,&quot; Sherard Cowper-Coles, a British special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, told delegates.</strong></u> <br />

<br />
<u><strong>In the first half of this year, al-Qaeda's core leadership was compelled to make four public appeals for cash, complaining in one case of a &quot;weakness in operations because of lack of money&quot;. Part of the reason for this is that some funding is believed to have gone to the Taliban instead. This financial squeeze has compounded the problems faced by &quot;core al-Qaeda&quot;. Highly effective attacks launched by American Predator drones have eliminated a raft of its most able leaders. Experts believe that Osama bin Laden's network is under immense pressure inside its last redoubts in the Tribal Areas lining Pakistan's north-west frontier. David Cohen, the assistant secretary at the US Treasury responsible for countering terrorist finance, said that al-Qaeda's recent appeal for funds showed its &quot;financial predicament&quot;. He added: &quot;We assess that al-Qaeda is in its weakest financial condition in several years, and that, as a result, its influence is waning. This success is important. It is a sign that we are moving in the right direction.&quot; America and its allies have taken increasingly sophisticated steps to choke the movement of funds to all terrorist groups, principally by freezing assets belonging to &quot;designated&quot; individuals, banks and companies. Traditionally, al-Qaeda's money has tended to come from the Gulf kingdoms, but there is evidence that this flow is being blocked. Carrying out terrorist attacks is relatively cheap - the bombing of the London Underground on 7 July 2005 probably cost only £8,000 - but al-Qaeda also needs cash to train new operatives and buy the safety of its leading figures in the Tribal Areas Without these funds, its ability to operate is severely constrained. Meanwhile, the drone strikes are taking a steady toll of &quot;core al-Qaeda&quot;. Pakistani authorities calculate that 14 al-Qaeda figures died in 60 American drone attacks in the Tribal Areas between January 2006 and April this year. Those who are left are forced to concentrate on securing their own safety and hunting down informers, rather than planning attacks. &quot;Operationally, it does look increasingly difficult for them to hold together as a coherent, disciplined terrorist group,&quot; said Paul Cornish, the head of international security at the Chatham House think tank.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>With the American public growing more pessimistic about Afghanistan, war proponents are renewing their case in the face of new estimates that say no more than 100 al Qaeda operatives remain in the country. In one of his first statements to Congress after being picked in June to command war operations, Army Gen. David H. Petraeus explained why nearly 100,000 troops are in Afghanistan nine years after the conflict began. &quot;In short,&quot; Gen. Petraeus said, &quot;we cannot allow al Qaeda or other transnational extremist elements to once again establish sanctuaries from which they can launch attacks on our homeland or on our allies.&quot; CIA Director Leon E. Panetta fueled the debate this summer by disclosing that his agency can count only 100 al Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan. He said the number may be as low as 50. Couple that with remarks by the former commander, retired Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who said, &quot;I do not see indications of a large al Qaeda presence in Afghanistan now,&quot; and the question arises about why the U.S. is in Afghanistan, given it was al Qaeda that attacked on Sept. 11, 2001. Why aren't U.S. troops fighting in Pakistan, where the al Qaeda leadership, including Osama bin Laden, fled and regrouped? James Jay Carafano, a military analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, said a U.S. exit from Afghanistan would bolster al Qaeda throughout South Asia. &quot;If you don't have an Afghan government that can stand by itself, the Taliban will be back,&quot; he said. &quot;That means civil war and maybe genocide. Al Qaeda will be back and so will camps that could lead to the next 9/11, plus a resurgence of terrorism across South Asia and huge propaganda victory for al Qaeda.&quot; An al Qaeda resurgence also could lead to increased violence in the Kashmir region, he said, &quot;meaning nuclear-armed Pakistan and India come to blows.&quot; &quot;NATO fails and crumbles&quot; and &quot;U.S. prestige and credibility crumbles,&quot; Mr. Carafano added. Some pro-war analysts dispute the estimates on al Qaeda. Bill Roggio, an analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who edits the LongWarJournal.org, said his sources, the enemy's martyrdom statements and a reading of command press releases indicate that many more al Qaeda operatives are in Afghanistan. &quot;I've been doing my own investigation on this, looking for al Qaeda cells in Afghanistan,&quot; Mr. Roggio said. &quot;A thousand would be my estimate. A lot are low-level fighters. But they are members of al Qaeda.&quot; A military intelligence source told The Washington Times that commanders think at least 600 al Qaeda members are fighting in Afghanistan. For Mr. Roggio and other war supporters, the key issue is not just the numbers, but what would happen if the U.S. leaves now. &quot;The Taliban and al Qaeda already have safe havens inside Afghanistan, despite a U.S. presence,&quot; Mr. Roggio said. &quot;If we walk away from Afghanistan, instead of keeping them occupied with fighting us, they are going to be free to do what they did prior to 9/11, which is plan attacks against the U.S. &quot;From a straight propaganda and recruiting standpoint, if we lose there,</strong> if we show them we are <strong>what bin Laden called</strong> the 'weak horse<strong>,' then their</strong> recruiting is going to go through the roof<strong>,&quot; he said. &quot;If they can show they are successful there, that is an incredible propaganda boon. &quot;Also, al Qaeda's donors and supporters love a winner. If al Qaeda can show them they can win there, their coffers will fill up from their big donors,&quot; Mr. Roggio said. Douglas Feith, who as the Pentagon's top policy official at the time of the Sept. 11 attacks was an architect of the war on terror, said leaving Kabul would hurt the counterterrorism campaign worldwide. &quot;There are many serious bad consequences of losing the war,&quot; Mr. Feith said. &quot;The Taliban will gain in Afghanistan and may help terrorists against us again. The Taliban would gain Pakistan and may destabilize the government there, which has nuclear weapons. &quot;Jihadists worldwide and other U.S. enemies would be emboldened by our defeat,&quot; he said. &quot;Afghans who cooperated with us would suffer. Others in the world would be reluctant to cooperate with us in the future.&quot; Mr. Panetta said the war's mission is to prevent more attacks.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>Although there has been more ethnic cleansing in Afghanistan than has been reported in the mainstream press (mostly Pashtuns migrating, voluntarily or under duress, from predominantly Tajik and Uzbek areas), interethnic antipathy hasn't metastasized as it did in Iraq. Badly mauled, the idea of Afghan fraternity still exists. The widespread savagery that we saw between Iraqi Sunni and Shiite Arabs seems unlikely to happen in Afghanistan. Some critics of Westerners in Afghanistan argue that U.S. and NATO forces, by their tactics if not their mere presence, are breathing life into the neo-Taliban, who would remain deeply unpopular among the Pashtuns if it were not for outsiders' mistakes. Although we can quickly concede that Western mistakes make the Taliban look better, Westerners in Afghanistan have actually generated much less village-level antipathy among the Pashtuns than might have been expected given the Pashtuns' reputation for xenophobia. We might yet see a Pashtun-only &quot;national liberation&quot; jihad develop in Afghanistan, but we are far from this now. Even now, &quot;our&quot; Pashtuns probably represent a big majority of their brethren. If the Americans were to leave, however, it's highly unlikely these friendly Pashtuns could long hold the high ground against a resurgent neo-Taliban movement. The Taliban possess the most effective Pashtun fighting force. Many, perhaps most, Pashtuns dislike the Taliban's aggressively inflexible religion (it's Pashtun village faith on speed), but the Taliban do have an ideology, tested repeatedly on the battlefield. It isn't just money and intimidation that bring them recruits.</strong></u> <br />

<br />
<u><strong>A growing number of people, led by Vice President Joe Biden, are advocating a so-called &quot;small footprint&quot; approach to the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan. They propose a significantly reduced military presence that focuses more on destroying al Qaeda than on building Afghanistan, and relies more on airstrikes and special forces than on conventional tactics. America will get about as much security as before, the argument goes, but at a much lower price. A return of the Taliban to power is not necessarily a problem, small footprint proponents argue, because the regime can be deterred from hosting al Qaeda by the threat of U.S. airstrikes or another invasion. One of the many assumptions behind this tempting argument is that there is a certain level of proportionality between the amount of force we use and the level of resistance we encounter. If we stop occupying Afghanistan and limit violence to the really bad guys, al Qaeda will be unable, and other radicalized Muslims unwilling, to attack the United States. This may be true for local insurgencies such as the Taliban, but not for small transnational movements such as al Qaeda. In fact, a significantly</strong> smaller U.S. presence in Afghanistan may paradoxically generate more anti-Americanism <strong>outside Afghanistan and ultimately more anti-Western terrorism than a more conventional military approach. This is because jihadi propaganda today relies on visually powerful symbols to mobilize people, and intermittent &quot;surgical&quot; strikes, and the casualties they cause, may create more such symbols than continuous conventional warfare. The history of jihadism is full of examples of seemingly small incidents having a major effect on mobilization. In August 1998, the U.S. launched missiles on Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for al Qaeda attacks on U.S. embassies in East Africa. The strikes made Mullah Omar work more closely with Osama Bin Laden and were followed by an increase in recruitment to al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. In April 2002, the Israeli military's incursion into Jenin caused a veritable political earthquake in the Muslim world, and demonstrably helped recruitment to al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. This was despite the relatively few casualties (a U.N. report concluded 52 Palestinian were killed, half of them civilians). In Pakistan, a few failed U.S. airstrikes in the Tribal Areas in 2006 and 2007 caused public outrage.and dramatically increased anti-Americanism across the country. The power of small incidents has increased in the past decade thanks to the Internet. Increasing bandwidth, cheaper digital cameras and fast-learning activists have turned the world wide web into a giant propaganda tool which can generate powerful visual messages and project them instantly to a global audience. The smallest detail can be dramatically enlarged and turned into a symbol of &quot;Muslim suffering at the hands of non-Muslims.&quot; On jihadi discussion forums such as Faloja (named after the Iraqi city whose 2004 battles between jihadis and U.S. forces made it an icon of Muslim suffering), high-quality video productions appear on a daily basis. The relationship between objective physical destruction and jihadi mobilization has never been less linear. (Of course, the non-linearity works both ways; more conventional power does not necessarily generate less powerful propaganda.) Why, then, would a small footprint approach in Afghanistan create more visual symbols of Muslim suffering? For a start, a troop reduction would not take away the occupation, at least not in the eyes of non-Afghan Islamists.</strong> Al Qaeda has a very wide definition of occupation and would frame any U.S. military presence in the region as such. <strong>Moreover, the surgical strikes would not be that surgical. A significantly smaller U.S. ground presence is likely to produce less good human intelligence, because it will be harder to protect informants. This will increase the risk of hitting, for example, wedding parties. In addition, fewer strikes means that each individual operation is more visible. This mitigates the problem of information saturation which currently frustrates jihadi propagandists. In war, many bad things happen, but individual incidents drown in the noise of the conflict. This may explain why interest in the Iraqi insurgency on jihadi forums has decreased steadily since 2005; there was so much going on that even jihadis were desensitized. A related dynamic may be behind the paradox that in Pakistan, public outrage over CIA drone strikes seems to have decreased in 2008 and 2009 as the frequency of strikes has gone up. For al Qaeda's propagandists, less can be more.</strong></u> <br />

<br />
<u><strong>The threat the United States and the region face is that the Afghan insurgency will continue to grow and that if there is a Western withdrawal from Afghanistan, Pakistan will not allow a vacuum to develop in Afghanistan and instead will abet a Taliban victory. Pakistan has had a risky dual policy of supporting the Americans in combating al-Qaeda and the Pakistan Taliban, while also supporting the Afghan Taliban. This is because the Pakistani army’s national-security logic is dominated by the struggle to keep the Indians at bay. For the army, a Taliban regime in Kabul is preferable to any other warlord regime to guarantee that the Indians and their Afghan protégés (of which Karzai is considered one) are forever kept out of having a role—as they were when the Taliban ruled the lands of Afghanistan in the 1990s. Moreover, a pro-Pakistan Taliban regime in Kabul, possibly backed by Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states and China, would create a new Pakistan-led region of influence that would reduce the role of its two other main rivals—Iran and Russia. This strategy could become more imperative with talk of less U.S. support to Afghanistan, the collapse in credibility of the Karzai government and the growing perception in Pakistan that the Taliban is winning.</strong> Every sign of the U<strong>nited</strong> S<strong>tates or NATO</strong> dithering over strategy only convinces the Pakistani military about keeping its Taliban option open<strong>. Pakistan may well be prepared to take the risk of endangering its own stability by supporting a Taliban regime in Kabul, even as it will try unsuccessfully to separate the Pakistan Taliban from its Afghan brothers. THIS IS why Pakistan is faced with a conundrum. Even as Islamabad tries to secure its interests in Afghanistan, it puts its own security at risk. Several American pundits have warned that any U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan would</strong> seriously destabilize Pakistan<strong>. That is true. The Pakistan Taliban now threatens to overrun large parts of northern Pakistan. In the last two years, the Pakistan Taliban has increasingly turned its guns on the Pakistani army and state. Monster turns on creator. This year the Pakistan Taliban’s capture of the Swat Valley north of Islamabad led to outrage from the Pakistani public and the international community. And the army was forced to take action, acknowledging for the first time that the Pakistan Taliban was now a dire threat. In recent months, the army has pushed the Taliban out of Swat and is fighting to regain control of the Khyber Pass where the Taliban has been attacking the hundreds of NATO supply containers that are trucked through to Afghanistan every day. The army has also blocked off roads into South Waziristan, where the Pakistan Taliban is based, and is using long-distance shelling and bombing to destabilize the group. The United States has helped these efforts by killing Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistan Taliban, in a drone strike. The army has recently said after much American pressure that it may soon attack South Waziristan. And thus we come to the end of the good news. If the army is now acting responsibly in dealing with the Pakistan Taliban, such is not the case with the Afghan Taliban. Key networks, such as those of Haqqani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, are based in North Waziristan, and they launch attacks into Afghanistan. For the past eight years they have never been bothered by the Pakistani army. Neither have the main Afghan Taliban leaders who live in Quetta in Baluchistan province. From Quetta, the Taliban is able to resupply its forces in Afghanistan with money, ammunition, suicide bombers and materials to make bombs and mines—all under the watchful eye of the ISI. According to intelligence sources, the Taliban leader Mullah Omar is now in a safe house in Karachi because of the fear that the United States may start using drone attacks on Quetta. Admiral Mullen and Richard Holbrooke have made major efforts to bring the army and Pakistan’s weak civilian leadership led by President Asif Ali Zardari onboard to help go after the Afghan Taliban and help stabilize rather than undermine Afghanistan. However, Pakistan’s civilian politicians are not strong enough to accept U.S. demands if it means contradicting the army’s policies. As the army takes on the Pakistan Taliban and clears Swat, its political influence and power has grown proportionally. The army still has to be won over to the simple and disturbing truth that a Taliban regime in Kabul would, through its Pakistani proxies, pose a major threat to the Pakistani state. Worse, Pakistan is far less resilient than it was a few years ago. Even as Pakistani officials bluntly criticize Holbrooke for linking Afghanistan and Pakistan in his “AfPak” strategy, some Pakistanis already see a chronic “Afghanization” of their nation. Current realities include a collapse of law and order in parts of the country, state institutions riddled with corruption and ineffectiveness, a justice system that cannot deliver, a crashing economy with severe joblessness, increasing ethnic tensions and a strong separatist movement in Baluchistan province. However, the real fear is that under such enormous external and internal pressures, there are no guarantees that the army will stay committed to a democratic system. More so, the military may not remain as united as it has been for the past six decades. What many Pakistanis fear and constantly talk about is not a traditional generals’ coup that may end democracy, but a colonels’ coup that could bring in a pro-Islamist and anti-Western coterie of officers linked to Islamic groups that would then negotiate a compromise with the Pakistan Taliban. That could put Pakistan’s nuclear weapons into the wrong hands. Neither a partial U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan nor a strategy of only using drones to target al-Qaeda could hope to handle such a regional catastrophe. And a complete American departure would seal the region’s fate.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>True, Carter (and Clinton who UJ doesn’t mention) destroyed the CIA humint capabilities, and the Obama administration has continued the war with the CIA.

I have been clear about my disdain for the use of SOF to perform ONLY raids while infantry performs ONLY policing and foot patrols. This division has hurt the readiness and capabilities of the U.S. Army. The Marines have no such division of labor. But aside from this objection, the idea that we can garrison small units of SOF in Afghanistan while the ANSF protects the countryside and ensures logistics is worse than mythical. It’s dangerous and likely to be deadly for our SOF troopers. Within a few months of withdrawal of forces, the Taliban (who are now said to have a permanent presence in 80% of Afghanistan) will have beheaded the Afghans who cooperated with the U.S. The line of logistics will have been completely shut down, and there will be no CAS because there will be no airfields. The idea that we can do this from offshore is preposterous. It will require SOF operations in order to extricate the SOF from Afghanistan once the Taliban have killed the ANP and routed the ANA. Kerry is living in a dreamland, a mythical world where the right words read from a teleprompter makes everything alright. But this world doesn’t obtain.

<u><strong>This problem could, of course, be circumvented by negotiating arrangements with Afghanistan for combat basing of Predators and strike aircraft even after Washington abandons Kabul, pulls its troops out of the country, and renounces its mission of state building in Afghanistan. Why the Afghans would have any interest in such an agreement remains inexplicable, particularly because Kabul would, through such a deal, have transformed its own country into a target for al-Qaeda attacks at precisely the time when it had lost all the substantive protections previously offered by the United States. For all these reasons, the notion that standoff attacks conducted from a distance would suffice to neutralize al-Qaeda in the face of a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan must be judged as fanciful, especially when such operations conducted under far more favorable circumstances today have produced only alloyed results. Moreover, at a time when the al-Qaeda network is becoming ever harder to distinguish from its various Taliban allies as far as threats to the United States and its partners are concerned, the idea that standoff attacks can be conducted successfully, even in the face of a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, confounds the imagination.</strong></u> <br />

<br />
<u><strong>The fundamental reason that a counterterrorism-focused strategy fails is that it cannot generate good intelligence. Al-Qaeda and the Taliban know not to use their cellphones and satellite phones today, so our spy satellites are of little use in finding extremists. We need information from unmanned low-altitude aircraft and, even more, from people on the ground who speak the language and know the comings and goings of locals. But our Afghan friends who might be inclined to help us with such information would be intimidated by insurgent and terrorist forces into silence — or killed if they cooperated — because we would lack the ability to protect them under a counterterrorism approach. Afghan forces simply do not have the capacity to do the protecting themselves at this point and, given the challenges of building up new institutions in Afghanistan after decades of war, will not have the ability until at least 2012. Even that distant date will be postponed further if we do not deploy enough forces to mentor and partner with Afghans as they build up an army and police force largely from scratch. This adds up to a prescription for a drying up of intelligence. The second reason a counterterrorism-oriented strategy would fail is that, if we tried it, we would likely lose our ability to operate unmanned aircraft where the Taliban and al-Qaeda prefer to hide. Why? If we pulled out, the Afghan government would likely collapse. The secure bases near the mountains of the Afghan-Pakistan border, and thus our ability to operate aircraft from them, would be lost. Our ability to go after Afghan resistance fighters would deteriorate. And the recent momentum we have established in going after Pakistani extremists would be lost. For those who have forgotten the realities of the 1990s — when we tried to go after Osama bin Laden without access to nearby bases by using ships based in the Indian Ocean — the two- to four-hour flight times of drones and cruise missiles operating off such ships made prompt action to real-time intelligence impractical. Third, we would likely lose our allies with this approach. A limited mission offers nothing to the Afghans, whose country is essentially abandoned to the Taliban, or to the Pakistanis, who would similarly see this as the first step toward cut and run. The NATO allies would also smell in a &quot;reduced&quot; mission the beginning of withdrawal; some if not most might try to beat us to the exit.</strong></u> <br />

<br />
<u><strong>Most worst-case scenarios appear to have an element of irreversibility. Once a species is lost, it is lost forever. The special concern for endangered species stems from the permanence of their loss (outside of Jurassic Park). One of the most serious fears associated with genetically modified organisms is that they might lead to irreversible ecological harm. Because some greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for centuries, the problem of climate change may be irreversible, at least for all practical purposes. Transgenic crops can impose irreversible losses too, because they can make pests more resistant to pesticides. If we invest significant wealth in one source of energy and neglect others, we may be effectively stuck forever, or at least for a long time. One objection to capital punishment is that errors cannot be reversed. In ordinary life, our judgments about worst-case scenarios have everything to do with irreversibility. Of course an action may be hard but not impossible to undo, and so there may be a continuum of cases, with different degrees of difficulty in reversing. A marriage can be reversed, but divorce is rarely easy; having a child is very close to irreversible; moving from New York to Paris is reversible, but moving back may be difficult. People often take steps to avoid courses of action that are burdensome rather than literally impossible to reverse. In this light, we might identify an Irreversible Harm Precautionary Principle, applicable to a subset of risks.' As a rough first approximation, the principle says this: Special steps should be taken to avoid irreversible harms, through precautions that go well beyond those that would be taken if irreversibility were not a problem. The general attitude here is &quot;act, then learn,&quot; as opposed to the tempting alternative of &quot;wait and learn.&quot; In the case of climate change, some people believe that research should be our first line of defense. In their view, we should refuse to commit substantial resources to the problem until evidence of serious harm is unmistakably clear.' But even assuming that the evidence is not so clear, research without action allows greenhouse gas emissions to continue, which might produce risks that are irreversible, or at best difficult and expensive to reverse. For this reason, the best course of action might well be to take precautions now as a way of preserving flexibility for future generations. In the environmental context in general, this principle suggests that regulators should proceed with far more aggressive measures than would otherwise seem justified.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>Fueled by the buildup of fossil fuel pollution, the world’s out-of-control climate is destabilizing many of the</strong> nations that control nuclear weapons<strong>, including Russia, China, North Korea, India, and Pakistan. Thousands have died in fires and floods, millions left homeless, and crops failed in the withering heat, the greatest the modern world has ever faced: RUSSIA Moscow has reached 102.2° F, after never before even breaking the 100-degree mark in recorded history. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and President Dmitri Medvedev have flooded the airwaves in response to outrage over the wildfires and droughts caused by the global heat wave, as officials are forced to admit the situation is out of control. The Russian government has recommended people evacuate Moscow, banned wheat exports, diverted flights, fired senior military officers, and warned the fires could pose a nuclear threat if they reach areas contaminated by Chernobyl. Medvedev called the linked disasters “evidence of this global climate change,” which means “we need to change the way we work, change the methods that we used in the past.” CHINA The worst flooding ever recorded in northeast China, caused by weeks of torrential rain with no end in sight, has caused nearly $6 billion in damage to water projects there, In addition, “52 people are reported to have died and an additional 20 are missing following rain-triggered floods in central China’s Henan Province.” “In the southwestern province of Yunnan, at least 11 people died and 11 were missing following a landslide caused by heavy rain.” INDIA “Record temperatures in northern India have claimed hundreds of lives in what is believed to be the hottest summer in the country since records began in the late 1800s.” “The death toll in flashfloods that hit the remote mountainous region of Ladakh in Indian-held Kashmir has risen to 103.” NORTH KOREA “Flooding last month caused serious damage in North Korea, destroying homes, farms, roads and buildings and hurting the economy,” the secretive dictatorship of North Korea admitted yesterday. “About 36,700 acres of farmland was submerged and 5,500 homes and 350 public buildings and facilities were destroyed or flooded,” the official Korean Central News Agency said. “The news agency had previously reported heavy rains fell in the country in mid- to late July, but those earlier reports did not mention flooding or damage. State media in the impoverished, reclusive nation often report news days or weeks after an event takes place.” PAKISTAN “Islamist charities, some with suspected ties to militants, stepped in on Monday to provide aid for Pakistanis hit by the worst flooding in memory, piling pressure on a government criticized for its response to the disaster that has so far killed more than 1,000 people.” “Thousands of people are fleeing Pakistan’s most populous areas as devastating floods” that have already affected more than 3 million people “sweep towards the south.” Fatima Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto’s niece, lashed out: “The floods are just the latest, most tragic example of how inept the Pakistani state truly is.” As warming-fueled disasters grow more intense and more frequent, they put greater</strong> pressure on the governments of these nuclear states<strong>. This threat to global security was brought to the White House’s attention as far back as 1979, when top scientists warned that global warming “would threaten the</strong> stability of food supplies<strong>, and would present a further set of intractable problems to organized societies.” As the CNA Corporation wrote in 2007, “climate change is a</strong> threat multiplier <strong>in already fragile regions, exacerbating conditions that lead to</strong> failed states <strong>— the</strong> breeding grounds for extremism and terrorism<strong>.” The Pentagon’s 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review recognized that global warming impacts and disasters will “act as</strong> an accelerant of instability or conflict<strong>.”</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>We rate Global Climate Change as a greater threat for human extinction in this century. Most scientists forecast disruptions and dislocations, if current trends persist. The extinction danger is more likely if we alter an environmental process that causes harmful effects and leads to conditions that make the planet uninhabitable to humans. Considering that there is so much that is unknown about global systems, we consider climate change to be the greatest danger to human extinction. However, there is no evidence of imminent danger. Nuclear war at some point in this century might happen. It is unlikely to cause human extinction though. While several countries have nuclear weapons, there are few with the firepower to annihilate the world. For those nations it would be suicidal to exercise that option. The pattern is that the more destructive technology a nation has, the more it tends towards rational behavior. Sophisticated precision weapons then become better tactical options. The bigger danger comes from nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists with the help of a rogue state, such as North Korea. The size of such an explosion would not be sufficient to threaten humanity as a whole. Instead it could trigger a major war or even world war. Under this scenario human extinction would only be possible if other threats were present, such as disease and climate change. We monitor war separately. However we also need to incorporate the dangers here .</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>While the U.S. and other involved governments have been consistently allowing that the NDN only ships non-lethal military support material, during a 7 May presentation at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov explicitly stated that the NDN in fact has been used to move military supplies for some time. In response to the question about whether use of the NDN might reach &quot;the level of types of supplies currently being transited through Pakistan to include armaments, or will it be only restricted to non-lethal materials&quot; Lavrov replied, &quot;The transit through Russia for the . ISAF through Russia has started long ago. It's only one year ago that we signed an agreement with NATO as an organization for non-lethal transit, but for many years lethal transit had been operating through Russia on the basis of our bilateral agreements with France, Germany, and recently the similar agreement with Spain was signed. .And by those very agreements it has provided for this transit - German, French or Spanish transit - not to be limited to their national contingents but the contingent of any other country participating in ISAF under the Security Council mandate.&quot; (Emphasis added.)

<u><strong>Russia's military could be drawn back into the Afghanistan theatre for the first time since the Red Army was forcibly expelled by US-backed mujahideen fighters in 1989 under plans being discussed by Nato officials. The proposals precede a landmark alliance summit next month, to be attended by the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev. The officials said several joint Nato-Russian initiatives on Afghanistan were on the table. They include the contribution of Russian helicopters and crews to train Afghan pilots, possible Russian assistance in training Afghan national security forces, increased co-operation on counter-narcotics and border security, and improved transit and supply routes for Nato forces. &quot;</strong>The summit can mark a new start in the relationship between Nato and Russia<strong>,&quot; said Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Nato secretary-general. &quot;We will hopefully agree on a broad range of areas in which we can develop practical co-operation on Afghanistan, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics.&quot; Rasmussen added: &quot;Russia is strongly interested in increased co-operation … Last December, when I visited Moscow, I suggested that Russia provide helicopters for the Afghan army. Since then Russia has reflected on that and there are now bilateral talks between Russia and the United States. I would not exclude that we will facilitate that process within the Nato-Russia council.&quot; Western diplomats said it was quite likely that agreements with Moscow on enhanced co-operation in Afghanistan on a range of fronts would be reached in time for the Lisbon Nato summit on 19-20 November. Officials said Russian-made helicopters were better adapted to Afghan conditions than their western equivalents. Russian forces gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the 1979-89 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, where they are still remembered with fear and loathing. With the plans yet to be finalised, officials said there was no question of Russian troops re-entering the country. A Nato spokesman said last night: &quot;There are no plans to reintroduce Russian soldiers into Afghanistan – [it's] not part of Russia's intent, not Afghan, and not ours. Russians may get involved in training helicopter pilots if they provide some helicopters, but not in Afghanistan itself. In the past, Russians have collaborated on training counter-narcotics police outside of country. None of the initiatives on the table involve Russian troops in Afghanistan.&quot; The attitude of the Afghan government of President Hamid Karzai would be key to the Russian military's mooted involvement in training Afghan national army recruits, a diplomat said. &quot;It would be welcome to Isaf [the International Security Assistance Force] if the Russians want to do it and if the Afghans welcome it, too.&quot; The summit is expected to see a big American and British push for European allies to provide more army and police trainers for Afghan security forces ahead of the scheduled 2014-15 transition to Afghan control. &quot;The Russians could make life very difficult for us in Afghanistan but they don't,&quot; a western diplomat said, going on to suggest that the difference now was that Moscow was increasingly prepared to be positively helpful. New understandings were expected on improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central Asian states such as Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the diplomat said. This is considered increasingly important given the rising number of insurgent attacks on Nato supply routes through Pakistan and a recent Pakistani government decision to temporarily close the Khyber Pass. Russian concerns about the flow of heroin from Afghanistan's poppy fields would also be addressed through new co-operative agreements, officials said. The Nato-Russian initiatives are to be accompanied by a summit declaration by Nato and the Karzai government of long-term ties extending beyond 2014-15. Medvedev (left) is keen to strengthen Russia's ties with the west after a period of friction that spiked with Russia's war with Nato partner Georgia in 2008. The Russian president is also expected to hold a separate, two-hour meeting with the US president, Barack Obama, Rasmussen and other top Nato leaders. Officials said a separate agreement on limited Russian co-operation with Nato's European missile defence plans was also in prospect. Medvedev's decision to go to Lisbon, and the raft of new agreements with Moscow, will be seen as the fruit of Obama's policy to &quot;reset&quot; relations with Russia. Nato officials said the summit would demonstrate a determination by the alliance and Russia to overcome past differences – and to reach consensus on the nature of 21st-century security threats. Nato's approach is due to be set out at the summit in a new &quot;strategic concept&quot; or mission statement.</strong></u> <br />

The president couldn't have been more clear about that.&quot; McFaul highlighted the Russians allowing 4,500 flights of American soldiers and equipment going through Russia, a country he admitted, used to be an adversary. &quot;We're talking about 4,500 flights of American soldiers and equipment going through what used to be our enemy.

<u><strong>Mexico's Foreign Minister dampened hopes Friday for a breakthrough deal at the Cancun climate change talks in November, saying negotiators are focusing on making progress on smaller issues before perhaps seeking a comprehensive agreement in 2011 or later. Speaking after a two-day meeting in Geneva that dealt with how to pay for carbon cutting projects in developing countries, Patricia Espinosa said the public shouldn't measure the success of the Cancun talks by whether countries agree on a new legally binding text to combat global warming. &quot;I don't think this is the right approach under the current circumstances,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;Throughout the world there are really very different needs and interests.&quot; Organizers of the Cancun meeting, including the United Nations and the Mexican government, are trying to inject a sense of optimism and trust among negotiators after the last major round of talks in Copenhagen ended in failure last year. Realism appears to be part of that message. Swiss Environment Minister Moritz Leuenberger, who hosted the closed-door talks in Geneva, insisted countries are &quot;no longer fixated&quot; on agreeing on a successor to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which scientists say doesn't go far enough in requiring countries to reduce their carbon emissions. Delegates travelling to Cancun, a Mexican resort city, should consider it a &quot;unique opportunity to consolidate a co-operative framework that can allow us to move to immediate action,&quot; said Espinosa, without elaborating. Rich countries like the United States, which rejected the Kyoto Protocol, want rapidly developing nations such as China and India to join in the effort to cut pollution. Poor countries say they will agree to a deal only if it includes significant financial aid to help them make their economies more green. Espinosa says such a 'green fund' might be agreed to in Cancun. But, according to Wendel Trio, climate policy co-ordinator at Greenpeace International, big differences remain over where the money should come from, who should get it, and how it would be controlled. &quot;Given that climate finance is definitely one of the issues that will need to be solved, the fact that we haven't seen progress in the last two days is an indication that</strong> governments are not <strong>yet</strong> willing to move forward<strong>,&quot; said Trio.</strong></u> <br />

<u>Clarifying commitment to Afghanistan solves insurgency</u> <br />
<u>Lynch 8 <strong>- U.S. Army Colonel, military fellow at the Brookings Institution, military special assistant to the U.S. Ambassador in Afghanistan (June 2008, Thomas, “Afghan Dilemmas: Staying in Power,” The American Interest Online WX)</strong></u> <br />
<br />
<u><strong>In mid-January, Defense Secretary Robert Gates approved an order to send an additional 3,000 U.S. marines into Afghanistan in anticipation of the now annual Taliban spring offensive. It was the right thing to do, but such a temporary force increase falls far short of what is needed. U.S. military policy is still stumbling toward failure in Afghanistan—a failure that will likely have dire consequences beyond South Asia. Let’s be clear: The mission in Afghanistan is not in jeopardy mainly because NATO members refuse to provide sufficient troops or appropriate engagement protocols for the International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF). Neither is the mission in jeopardy because of any deficiency inherent in U.S. or Coalition counterinsurgency doctrine. The problem goes deeper, into the underlying political context of Coalition military operations. The real issue is the transitory and uncertain U.S. military posture in Afghanistan (and, by implication, across South Asia), which undermines the necessary link between relevant military security operations and positive political consequences. Our uncertain commitment to Afghanistan has the effect of bolstering Taliban propaganda, which threatens to punish anyone cooperating with Coalition efforts. This intimidation of critical local U.S. allies, fueled by a credible fear that the United States will leave them in the lurch, is shaping conditions for a major failure in our counterinsurgency and counter-terror programs. Our unwillingness to commit ourselves for the long haul also provides incentives for Pakistan to hedge its bets. The U.S. government has urged the Pakistani government to act decisively to deal with its side of the Afghan-Pakistan border to dry up support for the Taliban effort in Afghanistan. But doing so entails significant risk for Pakistan, both internally and regionally. No Pakistani government, military or civilian led, will take those risks unless it knows U.S. power will remain engaged to backstop the effort. The only way to change the poisonous regional security dynamic that keeps Pakistan a safe haven for terrorists and jeopardizes Afghanistan’s future is to alter fundamentally the convoluted U.S. political strategy that has gone unchallenged over the past six years. There are understandable reasons for portraying the U.S. presence in Afghanistan as temporary, and for mixing into ISAF as many non-U.S. contributions as possible. The United States is not an imperial power and does not wish to be perceived as such in a region justifiably allergic to European colonial legacies. Nevertheless, those reasons do not outweigh the liabilities that the present policy brings. We must eliminate the uncertainty about U.S. staying power by strengthening and institutionalizing the U.S. security commitment to the region. The next administration, if not the present one, has a difficult but necessary choice to make that has been ducked for far too long.</strong></u> <br />

<br />
<u><strong>Reorienting the counterinsurgency campaign. The third important change at the strategic level that the Obama administration must direct is the reorientation of the ongoing counterinsurgency campaign to focus on the simple, yet radical, objectives of protecting civilians over destroying the enemy; protecting civilians by accepting risks if necessary to the safety of coalition forces; and protecting civilians by using at all possible times minimum rather than maximum force. The administration’s White Paper thankfully makes this objective its own when it declares that “our counter-insurgency strategy must integrate population security with building effective local governance and economic development. We will establish the security needed to provide space and time for stabilization and reconstruction activities.”77 The protection of the population must once again take center stage in the conduct of coalition military operations in Afghanistan. The U.S. Army’s new counterinsurgency manual, FM 3-24, directs that the mission be prosecuted in exactly this way. It is also the manner in which the United States systematically conducted counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan from late 2003 until 2005. After 2005, the U.S. military leadership in Afghanistan drifted back into an excessively “kinetic” approach to counterinsurgency, in which the use of superior firepower to attack insurgent groups took priority over protecting the population among whom they operated. Whatever this way of doing things gained in terms of enemy kills, it lost just as much if not more in terms of popular support for the coalition’s war against the Taliban, thanks to the awful increases in collateral damage produced by this strategy. As a result, the Taliban were able to replenish their ranks from the increasingly disaffected populace far faster than the U.S. military was able to destroy them.78 The continuance of such an attrition-centered counterinsurgency strategy will contribute ultimately to the defeat of the United States in Afghanistan because it will deepen the alienation within the population and increase support for the Taliban uprising. It is often easy to forget—especially by a technologically superior force—that the strategic goal of any counterinsurgency campaign is not the comprehensive physical destruction of the insurgents in the first instance, but rather shaping the political end game such that the people, among whom the insurgency operates, gradually shift their loyalties toward the state and away from the resistance. Strengthening this dynamic requires that the population be convinced that the government of the day will provide it, first and foremost, with personal security, namely that which Hobbes called the freedom from “fear of sudden death.” Loyalty toward the government is also enhanced by the provision of effective governance (meaning the presence of law and order and the speedy delivery of justice), responsive government (that is, rule that in some way incorporates consent and embodies binding ties between rulers and ruled at various levels), and minimal development (which must include the availability of adequate sustenance to ensure physical survival together with some opportunities to better one’s station in life). These attributes of good government are particularly essential in Afghanistan because the threats to the lives of the common folk derive not simply from the insurgency but also from local predators such as drug rings, criminals, warlords, militias, tribal and village power brokers, and even petty government officials. When the hazards of coalition military operations against the Taliban are added to this list, the net result is that the already strong anger harbored by the population toward the government for its inability to ensure personal security—the first task of any legitimate state—is deepened further and transmuted into an antagonism directed equally at Kabul and the coalition. If the United States, therefore, is to win the war against the Taliban, it must make as its primary order of business the provision of what William Maley has correctly identified as “human security”79 and that requires, as Gilles Dorronsoro notes, reversing “the current trend of ever increasing violence.”80</strong> If <strong>the U.S.</strong> co<strong>unter</strong>in<strong>surgency strategy</strong> can shift <strong>its emphasis</strong> from primarily killing <strong>the insurgents</strong> to protecting the population, the social medium within which the Taliban <strong>now</strong> thrives will <strong>progressively</strong> become inhospitable<strong>. When that outcome obtains, the insurgency will either die a slow death or be reduced to a law-and-order problem that can be controlled by local police or other law enforcement agencies. From late 2003 through 2005, the United States prosecuted counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan in exactly this way. Operating under a unified civilian-military leadership collocated at the U.S. embassy in Kabul, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and Lieutenant General David W. Barno, commander of CFC-A, implemented a comprehensive counterinsurgency strategy that combined antiterrorism and anti-insurgency operations, the training of Afghan security forces, the delivery of reconstruction and governance, and regional engagement through an “area ownership” approach that emphasized the protection of the Afghan population above all else. The strategy of area ownership was a military innovation that was uniquely Barno’s: in institutionalizing this concept of operations, he overturned—incidentally, without authority—the previous U.S. overemphasis on counterterrorism, prosecuted mainly through kinetic attacks, in favor of an integrated counterinsurgency strategy that tied together multiple political, military, development, and information operations in the service of protecting the Afghan people.81 This innovation, which occurred long before the current U.S. Army counterinsurgency manual was revised to incorporate a similar approach, paid off in spades. Consequently, even though the Taliban insurgents were slowly creeping back from Pakistan to Afghanistan during this period, the political environment within Afghanistan was quite inhospitable to their operations.82</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>Developing the Modern Silk Road would also have second- and third-order benefits that extend beyond economics. As Starr writes, ‘‘The prospect of transforming Afghanistan, and the entire region of which it is the heart, into a zone of secure sovereignties and viable market economies . . . can roll back the forces that give rise to extremism and enhance continental security.’’20 In short, the Modern Silk Road could promote security, prosperity, and connectivity within some of the most volatile, impoverished, and isolated nations on the planet. Its emergence would help the United States achieve its goals in Afghanistan in two different ways. First, the economic growth would help reduce the widespread deprivation that plays an important role in the Taliban insurgency. In Afghanistan, where 40 percent of the population is unemployed and 53 percent live below the poverty line, economic conditions directly affect the insurgency.21 According to at least one estimate, as many as 70 percent of the Taliban are ‘‘unemployed young men just looking for a way to make a living.’’22 While this figure may be debatable, several analysts have pointed to a connection between insurgency and deprivation in the region. Karin von Hippel, former director of the CSIS Post-Conflict Reconstruction Project, argues, ‘‘The ordinary volunteer or recruit in Pakistan and Afghanistan has typically been poor.’’23 To support this argument, she cited three compelling sources. First was a report by Daniel Markey from the Council on Foreign Relations, which found that ‘‘in Pakistan, Taliban recruits are drawn from Afghan refugee camps and the network of extremist madrassas in the tribal areas. Taliban foot soldiers tend to be uneducated, poor Pashtuns with few other employment prospects.’’24 Second was a study by the UN Assistance Mission for Afghanistan (UNAMA), which stated that in the absence of employment opportunities, young men join militant groups as a way to earn a living and enhance their social status.25 Finally, von Hippel cited renowned journalist Peter Bergen, who learned that Taliban fighters were paid about $300 a month, equivalent to four times the wage of an average Afghan police officer.26 The relationship between poverty and extremism in South Asia reinforces the idea that the Modern Silk Road must be developed, along with military operations, in Afghanistan as a vital component of an effective counterinsurgency campaign and a key ingredient for long-term stability. The principles of Obama’s December 1, 2009 speech on Afghanistan recognize the relationship between economic growth and the counterinsurgency mission, stating that ‘‘growth is critical to undermine extremists’ appeal in the short term and for sustainable economic development in the long term.’’27 The second reason why the emergence of the Modern Silk Road is important for U.S. goals in Afghanistan is that it would provide the Afghan government with a desperately needed revenue stream. While much of the current debate has focused on how to professionalize the Afghan National Security Forces and create a functional and legitimate Afghan government, these institutions will ultimately fail without a sustainable revenue stream to fund them. With international assistance currently accounting for ‘‘around 90% of all public expenditures’’ in Afghanistan, it is clear that more must be done to enhance the ability of the Afghan government to sustain itself.28 This is where the NDN comes in. Despite being created to serve logistical ends, the NDN is bringing about a de facto step toward the Modern Silk Road. The U.S. government should embrace this positive externality and strive to deepen Afghanistan’s connections to regional and global markets.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>How Colombia Fixed Its Army Reform of Colombia’s army began during Andrés Pastrana’s term as president (1998–2002) and accelerated during Pres. Álvaro Uribe’s tenure (2002–present).16 Three key reforms converted the Colombian army from an ineffective, garrison-bound band into an aggressive force that has crippled the FARC and ELN. New Leadership In 1998, at the urging of US officials, Pastrana replaced the top three leaders in the army with new generals (Fernando Tapias, Jorge Enrique Mora, and Carlos Ospina) who were trained at US military schools and who had extensive combat experience at the battalion and brigade levels.17 This new trio then replaced their subordinate commanders who lacked aggressiveness in the field. At this time, the Colombian army began to emphasize the selection and training of better-quality noncommissioned officers for the army’s combat units.18 In his book A Question of Command, Mark Moyar studies a variety of counterinsurgency campaigns, asserting that leadership quality rather than campaign plans or tactics is the key to success.19 Colombia’s performance against its insurgents bolsters Moyar’s argument. Reorganization Beginning with the Pastrana administration and extending into Uribe’s, Colombia reorganized its army into a mobile and highly skilled professional component; additionally, a draftee component formed for local security.20 Under the tutelage of trainers from US Army special forces, the professional component of the army established numerous air-mobile, ranger, mountain-warfare, counterdrug, and special forces battalions.21 These units improved the army’s overall effectiveness by specializing in specific tasks. Perhaps as important, Uribe focused the draftee portion of the army on village defense. He created more than 600 home-guard platoons, each composed of about 40 soldiers stationed in their hometowns, to provide basic security and collect intelligence on insurgent activity. These platoons interdicted the movement of insurgent units in the countryside and freed the professional army for offensive operations.22 The Colombian army also increased spending on logistics support and intelligence analysis, activities supported by the US advisory team.23 Helicopters Finally, Colombia’s army and police expanded their inventory of helicopters from about 20 in 1998 to 255 by late 2008. To overcome Colombia’s mountainous and forested terrain, the army needed air mobility. Today, with extensive US support, the Colombian army operates the world’s third-largest fleet of UH-60 Blackhawk assault helicopters.24 Colombia’s helicopter fleet has made possible the army’s offensive doctrine against insurgent support areas. As a result of these and other reforms, the Colombian army inflicted severe damage on the FARC and ELN. One study estimated that, between 2002 and 2008, army attacks cut FARC offensive capabilities by 70 percent. By 2008 FARC military units, which overwhelmed Colombian army battalions in the 1990s, were unable to function in units larger than squad size. Between 2006 and 2008, more than 3,000 FARC fighters deserted the organization. FARC’s remaining forces are believed to be scattered, disorganized, and cut off from their top-level leadership, which has fled into exile in Ecuador and Venezuela.25</strong></u> <br />

<u>Increasing end-strength solves overstretch and signals resolve</u> <br />
<u>New York Times 5 <strong>(editorial, “The Army We Need,” January 2, Lexis-Nexis)</strong></u> <br />
<br />
<u><strong>The nation mourns the men and women in uniform who are killed or wounded in Iraq, one by one. But the public needs to be aware, and be worried, about the larger picture too. Our military and our military readiness have been strained and risk real, permanent damage. Twenty-five years ago, America's Army was a lot larger and had a lot less to do. Now, a substantially smaller force is struggling to cope with the demands placed on it by Iraq, where boots on the ground are in chronically short supply. For much of the past two years, the bulk of America's frontline ground forces have been tied down in an open-ended counterinsurgency war they were not expected, or given the resources, to fight. These soldiers and marines, active-duty and Reserve, have shown courage and determination, despite shortages of armor and other equipment, involuntarily extended enlistments and accelerated rotations back into combat. Their fortitude has allowed the Pentagon to sustain a situation that everyone recognizes cannot go on indefinitely, even though no end to the Iraqi conflict is yet in sight. The extended unplanned deployment of American forces is taking a heavy cumulative toll, especially on the Army and Army National Guard. It is undermining readiness and morale, and limiting America's ability to send substantial ground forces elsewhere to back up its diplomacy or respond to emerging threats. The Pentagon is beginning to resemble a desperate farmer who feeds his starving family the seed corn meant for sowing next year's crop. To keep enough boots on the ground now, it is sacrificing the ability to retain the leaders of tomorrow. As overdeployment has become chronic, promising young officers are opting not to re-enlist. When new crops of young people graduate from school, they will be less willing to combine their civilian careers with service in the Army National Guard; recruitment is already down almost 30 percent. The Regular Army is hurting too. Despite enlistment bonuses, it has had to speed up its reporting schedules, sending new recruits straight into basic training. This growing crisis is not due to a lack of preparedness on the part of military brass, but to the ideology on which preparedness was based. Before Iraq, Pentagon dogma -- supported by most Republican politicians and many conservative Democrats -- held that United States troops were war fighters. Peacekeeping and nation-building were jobs for Old Europe. Well, that was then. Now, more than half of the Regular Army's fighting forces have either served in Iraq, are currently there or can expect to be on their way soon, along with a substantial fraction of the Marine Corps and historically high proportions of the Army National Guard and Reserves. Rotations are being accelerated, with units that have already served in Iraq returning for second tours. These faster rotations are degrading readiness, wearing down equipment and leaving less time for normal training exercises. Reservists, including police, firefighters and other homeland defenders, are spending lengthy tours overseas. Four out of 10 Americans now serving in Iraq come from Reserve or National Guard units None of this should lead Americans to worry that the United States -- with the world's premier Air Force, Navy and nuclear strike force fully intact -- is defenseless. If a new threat suddenly arose -- if, for example, Al Qaeda threatened Saudi oil fields, radical Islamist officers got control of Pakistani nuclear weapons or China attacked Taiwan -- Washington could respond forcefully and decisively. But that does not mean that broader American security interests are not paying a price. Any additional foreign engagement that dragged on beyond a few months and required large numbers of ground troops would require a wider call-up of reserves and perhaps a return to the draft. Many potential enemies overseas doubt that the public would have the appetite for that kind of sacrifice. As a result, America's diplomatic clout is being subtly undermined. Iranian mullahs weighing whether to give up their nuclear programs may conclude that Washington is in no position to face them down. North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong Il, may also feel freer to proceed with his nuclear plans and move troops closer to the South Korean border. Chinese leaders may see this as an opportune time to escalate their bullying of Taiwan. Listing all the dangers is much easier than coming up with solutions. But there are some obvious short-term answers. Barring any unexpected breakthroughs in Iraq, Washington needs to increase its recruitment quotas sharply for active-duty service in the Army and Marine Corps. The current Army recruitment ceiling of just above 500,000 ought to go up to nearly 600,000, still substantially below the levels of the late 1980's. The Marines' ceiling should go up from the current 178,000 to around 200,000. Attracting those recruits will require offering financial and other inducements on top of the added payroll costs.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>Co</strong>nveying the U.S. determination to stay in Afghanistan over the long term <strong>“through deeds as well as words”66</strong> is vital for changing the calculus of the country’s rivalrous neighbors <strong>as well. Because Iran, India, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Russia have interests in Afghanistan that are opposed to the Pakistani desire for paramount influence, the only way to minimize the incentives for malignant competition is to ensure that Kabul remains fundamentally nonaligned vis-à-vis these key feuding entities. Ambassador Karl F. Inderfurth and Ambassador James Dobbins have argued that the way to produce this outcome is to “establish Afghanistan as a permanently neutral state” through “a multilateral accord that establishes principles and guarantees for [such a] long-term status.”67 While this proposal should no doubt be explored carefully, it is unlikely to bear fruit any time soon because the strategic interests of the regional contenders in Afghanistan are at the moment acutely competitive. Given Kabul’s relative weakness and the historic proclivity of its neighbors, especially Islamabad, to reach consistently for self-interested gains, only a long-term U.S. presence within Afghanistan will be able to assure its neutrality and deter the regional neighbors from meddling in Afghan politics with the aim of securing political advantages over their rivals.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>To reverse the Taliban's gains, the international community and the Afghan government must recognize that, in addition to following basic tenets of counterinsurgency doctrine, there are a number of unique aspects of Helmand and Kandahar that will affect the potential success or failure of their mission. Most importantly, controlling the Pakistani border, which abuts long sections of Kandahar and Helmand, must be a top priority for international forces. The interlinking network of insurgent groups, from Mullah Omar's Quetta Shura to the forces led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Jalaluddin Haqqani, sponsor attacks within Afghanistan and also play an important role linking al Qaeda to the Taliban.</strong> Diminishing their capabilities is a precondition for success in Afghanistan. <strong>Striking a crucial blow against the insurgents can only take place with the cooperation of the Pakistani government. The international community must pressure Pakistan to deploy enough force on its side of the border to stop further cross-border movement of insurgents. Our sad experience over the last nine years has demonstrated how the Taliban used the undefended border with Pakistan to strike the Afghan people and international forces. Some pessimists have argued that securing the frontier with Pakistan is impossible, due to the mountainous terrain and vast 2,430-kilometer border. They cite the failures of the Soviet Army and previous Afghan governments, which were unable to exercise effective control of the region.</strong></u> <br />

<u>Success in Afghanistan is beginning to come in the first muddy trickles after a long drought. Small groups of Taliban fighters -- sometimes a dozen with a leader -- are approaching local Afghan government officials, asking what kind of deal they might get. &quot;First, they want to be taken off any list, so they are not targeted,&quot; explains a NATO official in Afghanistan. &quot;Second, they want protection from the insurgency. Third, some kind of economic opportunity.&quot; In counterinsurgency doctrine, this is known as &quot;reintegration.&quot; The official admits it is &quot;spotty&quot; in Afghanistan but spreading in all regions. &quot;It is happening in small numbers -- drip, drip, drip. It has not yet changed the battle space. . . . It is not a tipping point, at this point.&quot; The goal is to push these numbers much higher, with more insurgents driven to negotiation and exhaustion, so they &quot;put down their weapons and go home.&quot; Many Americans ask: What would victory look like in Afghanistan? It would look like this -- except more of it. Eighteen months ago, Afghan insurgents had the morale that comes from momentum. But the surge in NATO operations, particularly Special Operations, has started to change the psychological battlefield. Special Forces now go after eight to 10 major objectives each night -- perhaps three-quarters of these raids result in the death or capture of an insurgent leader. Two Taliban shadow governors -- a key position in the leadership structure -- were killed in the last week. Such roles are quickly refilled, but replacements tend to be less seasoned and more frightened. &quot;We hear a lot of chatter,&quot; says the official, &quot;from networks inside of Afghanistan.&quot; Some fighters don't feel &quot;a moment of peace. They can't sleep. They keep moving all the time. They can't plan attacks because they are planning to survive.&quot; And this is opening up a &quot;real rift&quot; with Taliban &quot;bosses leading from the relative comfort of Pakistan.&quot; While some units are well supplied, others are &quot;not supplied, not paid, but told to keep fighting.&quot; Reintegration of low- and mid-level fighters is based on their concern for survival. Reconciliation between the Afghan government and higher-level Taliban leaders is a political matter, gaining much recent attention. President Hamid Karzai has convened a &quot;high peace council,&quot; open to Taliban overtures but insisting on certain conditions: repudiating al-Qaeda, laying down arms, accepting the Afghan constitution. The most ideological of Taliban leaders will never reconcile. Others may calculate, as many Sunni leaders eventually did in Iraq, that their rejectionism is undermining their long-term political influence. In a national settlement, some kind of power-sharing arrangement is probably inevitable. But sharing power in a united government is very different from the concession of Taliban control over any portion of Afghanistan's territory. This would incite ethnic conflict and re-create the conditions that led to the Sept. 11 attacks. It is the definition of American defeat. Political reconciliation is the objective. But it is conceivable only if momentum toward reintegration continues and gathers -- and this, in large part, is a military task. Many have argued that an acceptable outcome in Afghanistan will not be achieved by military force alone. True. But an acceptable outcome is enabled by military pressure. That pressure is being undermined by a Taliban argument. President Obama's July 2011 deadline for the beginning of American troop withdrawals from Afghanistan is being used, according to the NATO official, as &quot;an opportunity for propaganda.&quot; &quot;They are trying to convince Afghans that we are out in July. They are saying we will be gone, telling people, 'We will remember our friends, and remember our enemies.' &quot; There are two ways to combat this claim. The first is to build up the Afghan army and police, so that an eventual American drawdown will not leave a void. &quot;This is one area,&quot; says my source, &quot;where the enemy has misjudged. They said that our training goals for the army and police were too ambitious. But we are meeting our growth numbers, and the quality of the force is taking off.&quot; The task remains &quot;very challenging,&quot; but, with enough partnership and patience, it is achievable. The second response is to make clear that America is not abandoning Afghanistan in July. The message should be, according to the official, &quot;As conditions exist, there will be a responsible drawdown.&quot;</u> <br />

<br />
<u><strong>Staying to win. The first and most important adjustment required at the strategic level is a clear public declaration by President Obama not only that the United States intends to win the war in Afghanistan but also that it will stay involved in the country over the long term. Both components of this declaration are essential. An unmistakable communication of the U.S. intention to seek victory—corroborated by committing the necessary resources to the task—is fundamentally necessary to undermine the hedging strategies currently pursued by various critical actors inside Afghanistan. Throughout the land, numerous tribal chiefs and village elders as well as provincial influentials, uncertain about whether the United States has the determination to bring its military operations to a successful conclusion, continue to withhold critical cooperation from the government of Afghanistan, which if available would help to defeat the Taliban insurgency more rapidly. Fearful that Washington might tire of the war and leave the Taliban in control of Afghanistan in the future, these important swing constituencies currently are locked in a watch-and-wait mode, tacitly aiding the Taliban on occasion while supporting the government on others but refusing to decisively partner with the coalition because of their uncertainty about Washington’s determination to eliminate the insurgents as an effective opposition. If the correlation of social forces within Afghanistan is therefore to shift in support of the Afghan government, the coalition’s determination—and, most important, America’s resolve—to see the war to a successful conclusion must become apparent to all. President Obama’s forthright declaration that defeating al-Qaeda and its affiliates, including the Taliban, represents “the goal that must be achieved” could not have come at a better time. Further, his reminder “that [this] is a cause that could not be more just,” and his categorical notice—“to the terrorists who oppose us, my message is the same: we will defeat you”—can only help to move various constituencies inside Afghanistan toward supporting their government and the United States. While it would have strengthened U.S. objectives immensely if the president had also clearly declared his intention to stay in Afghanistan for the long term, the need to carefully straddle a course that avoids unnerving domestic constituencies fearful of open-ended involvement in another Asian war, coupled with the desire to fend off perceptions of the United States as an occupying power in Afghanistan, appear to have led President Obama to tackle this issue more obliquely by noting that, “We are not in Afghanistan to control that country or to dictate its future. We are in Afghanistan to confront a common enemy that threatens the United States, our friends and our allies, and the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan who have suffered the most at the hands of violent extremists.”63 Whatever the reasons for this equivocation, it is imperative that the administration quickly clarify its intention to stay engaged in assuring Afghan security for the long term because there is no greater threat to the accomplishment of American goals than the perception within Afghanistan and elsewhere in South Asia that the United States will cut and run before the task of state building is successfully completed. Because the totality of the administration’s plans arguably conveys a longevity to the American commitment in Afghanistan, President Obama should not shy away from asserting that the United States will remain in Afghanistan for as long as is necessary to achieve its larger strategic goals and so long as its presence enjoys the support of that country’s legitimate government. Having said this, however, the next test will not be at the level of rhetoric but on the plain of action. If what comes out of Washington in regard to financial resources, troop commitments, and diplomatic attention over the next several years is hesitation, a diminution of responsibility, a competitive wrangling between the branches of government, or anything that suggests preparation for an exit, the critical constituencies whose cooperation will be necessary to defeat the Taliban will draw the conclusion that it is not worth supporting what will eventually be the losing side, thereby making NATO’s struggle against the insurgency all the harder.</strong></u> <br />

<br />
<u>Further, in NATO’s struggle against the Taliban, the coalition and the United States in particular are neither occupiers of Afghanistan nor viewed as occupiers, except by a small portion of the populace that traditionally has been suspicious of the presence of all foreigners within the country. With the exception of predominantly the Ghilzai tribes and a few others, who provide succor for most of the resistance because of their deep conservatism, their desire to preserve traditional social structures, and their determination to prevent the social change they believe will come inevitably as a result of Western presence in Afghanistan, most other social formations do not view the coalition’s presence within the country as either an occupation or corrosive to national stability. Even those Durrani tribes such as the Alizai, Ishaqzai, and Noorzai, whose members are often allied with the insurgency, oppose the coalition only because they have been losers in the internal Afghan struggle for power. Consequently, they resist NATO forces, viewing them as the protectors of the Karzai regime and the Popalzai Durrani clan from which the government draws its support, not because of any nationalist or cultural irritation precipitated by the coalition’s presence. Certainly, there are powerful personalities in Afghanistan who oppose Western military forces for both ideological and political reasons: these include Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his Hizbe Islami Gulbuddin (HIG), Anwar-ul-Haq and his Hizbe Islami Khalis (HIK), Jalaluddin Haqqani and his Haqqani network, the Afghan Taliban shura and their hard-core adherents, and the remnants of Osama Bin Laden’s International Islamic Front in Afghanistan. But the antagonism of these actors is driven entirely by fundamental differences in worldview or by competing political interests relative to the Afghan state and the West. What is most important, in any case, is that the Afghan people do not view these personalities as representing their true interests, except in certain specific districts in the southern and eastern regions of the country. The claim advanced by Gilles Dorronsoro, that “the presence of foreign troops [in Afghanistan] is the most important element driving the resurgence of the Taliban,”85 must accordingly be judged as at best a half truth. Foreign military presence is undoubtedly a precipitant for indigenous resistance in those areas populated by the most conservative rural Pashtuns, but in other cases <strong>there is no</strong> simple “<strong>link between Jihad and nationalism</strong>,”86 at least not one that justifies the speedy exit of foreign forces from Afghanistan as the solution to defanging the insurgency. In fact, to the degree that foreign forces have exacerbated the insurgency, they have done so mainly by their ineptitude. As Nathaniel C. Fick and John A. Nagl summarized it: Afghans are not committed xenophobes, obsessed with driving out the coalition, as they did the British and the Soviets. Most Afghans are desperate to have the Taliban cleared from their villages, but they resent being exposed when forces are not left behind to hold what has been cleared. They also cannot understand why the coalition fails to provide the basic services they need. Afghans are not tired of the Western presence; they are frustrated with Western incompetence.87 These facts imply that NA TO does not need many hundreds of thousands of troops to defeat the Taliban as is sometimes inferred from facile comparisons between the size of Afghanistan and the size of Iraq. The numbers of American, allied, and local casualties, too, in each of these two conflicts is highly asymmetrical, with Iraq being far more violent than Afghanistan by most measures. What is needed, therefore, in Afghanistan is the persistent presence of a smaller number of troops—allied as well as indigenous—capable of protecting the population in certain critical areas so that these inhabitants can turn against the insurgency, as they are wont to, and defeat it.</u> <br />

<u><strong>Recent US government reports reached troubling conclusions about Afghanistan’s army. For example, 19 percent of the soldiers in the Afghan army quit or desert each year.3 The Afghan army lacks competent leadership at all levels as well as the ability to generate qualified leaders rapidly. Moreover, although the US government spent more than $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2009 on training and supporting Afghanistan’s security forces, the number of Afghan battalions qualified to operate independently actually declined.4 In spite of these problems with Afghanistan’s existing army, Afghan and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) officials want to accelerate its expansion, from 97,000 troops currently to 171,600 by the end of 2011 and 240,000 within five years.5 Ten years ago, Colombia faced a security crisis in many ways worse than the one Afghanistan currently faces. But over the past decade, Colombia has sharply reduced its murder and kidnapping rates, crushed the array of insurgent groups fighting against the government, demobilized the paramilitary groups that arose during the power vacuum of the 1990s, and significantly restored the rule of law and presence of government throughout the country. Over the past decade, with the assistance of a team of US advisers, Colombia rebuilt its army. In contrast to the current plan for Afghanistan, Colombia focused on quality, not quantity. Its army and other security forces have achieved impressive success against an insurgency in many ways similar to Afghanistan’s. Meanwhile, despite the assistance of nearly 100,000 NATO soldiers and many billions of dollars spent on security assistance, the situation in Afghanistan seems to be deteriorating. Afghan and</strong> US officials struggling to build an effective Afghan army can learn from Colombia’s success<strong>. This article explores the similarities and differences between the insurgencies in Afghanistan and Colombia, examines how Colombia reformed its security forces, and discusses how to apply Colombia’s success to Afghanistan.</strong></u> <br />

<u>Counterinsurgency forces in Colombia and Afghanistan face several similar challenges.

<u>Everyone knows that corruption is a huge, crippling, corrosive problem in Afghanistan and that reducing it won’t be easy. But aside from the obvious obstacles we face — namely an entrenched political class in Afghanistan that has gotten rich from foreign lucre — there is a not-so-obvious obstacle as well: the interest that many in the U.S. government have in lubricating relationships with lots of greenbacks. In this connection the New York Times’s Dexter Filkins and Mark Mazzetti have a great scoop today about how the CIA has been paying off Mohammed Zia Salehi, the aide to President Karzai who has been charged with corruption. As the Times account notes, “Other prominent Afghans who American officials have said were on the C.I.A.’s payroll include the president’s half brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, suspected by investigators of playing a role in Afghanistan’s booming opium trade.” The list is actually considerably longer, and from the CIA’s narrow standpoint, the investments are well justified. The Times quotes an anonymous “American official” as follows: “If we decide as a country that we’ll never deal with anyone in Afghanistan who might down the road — and certainly not at our behest — put his hand in the till, we can all come home right now. If you want intelligence in a war zone, you’re not going to get it from Mother Teresa or Mary Poppins.” True, and the CIA has been paying off rogues for information ever since its inception. Such activity is to be expected from any competent intelligence service, but in Afghanistan, this has had parlous consequences. <strong>The funding that the CIA has provided</strong> — along with largesse from the U.S. military, USAID, the State Department, and other agencies — <strong>has turbo-charged</strong> the problem of <strong>corruption</strong>. It has led to the emergence of a class of malign actors, fabulously wealthy Afghans who have connections not only to the U.S. government but also to the Taliban and the drug cartels. They are widely seen as the real center of power in Afghanistan, and it is this perception, more than anything else, that fuels support for the insurgency. The problem begins at the top with Hamid Karzai who, shamefully, intervened to get Salehi sprung from jail shortly after his arrest. Some in the U.S. government believe that there is nothing to be done about such corruption and that fighting it is counterproductive because it will damage our “relationships” with key Afghans. As one “Obama administration official” tells Filkins and Mazzetti: “Fighting corruption is the very definition of mission creep.” Wrong. Fighting corruption is the only way to achieve our mission. That won’t require eliminating corruption — truly a mission impossible. <strong>But it should be possible to reduce corruption from the current, off-the-charts levels to more socially acceptable norms.</strong> In fact, this is the most urgent priority for NATO forces. To achieve that objective, President Obama will have to make sure that all U.S. government agencies and officials are on board. So far, as the Salehi scandal shows, that hasn’t been the case.</u> <br />

<u><strong>Pay Raise Comparability. The Military Coalition appreciates the Subcommittee’s leadership during the last five years in reversing the routine practice of capping servicemembers’ annual pay raises below the average American’s. In servicemembers’ eyes, all of those previous pay raise caps provided regular negative feedback about the relative value the Nation placed on retaining their services. Unfortunately, this failed practice of capping military raises to pay for budget shortfalls reared its head again earlier this year when the Director of the Office of Management and Budget proposed capping 2004 and future military pay raises at the level of inflation. The Coalition was shocked and deeply disappointed that such a senior officer could ignore 25 years of experience indicating that</strong> pay caps lead inevitably to retention and readiness problems<strong>. Not only was the proposal ill timed as troops massed for a war with Iraq—it’s just bad, failed policy. The President rejected his senior budget official’s advice for five of the seven uniformed services—but, unfortunately, the Administration’s budget for FY 2004 proposes to cap the pay of NOAA and USPHS officers at 2%. The Military Coalition strongly objects to this disparate treatment of members in those uniformed services. The Coalition urges the Subcommittee to intercede in their behalf with colleagues on the appropriate oversight committees for NOAA and USPHS personnel to ensure that these commissioned officers receive the same treatment as their fellow comrades-in-arms. Pay raise comparability with private sector wage growth is a fundamental underpinning of the all-volunteer force, and it cannot be dismissed without severe consequences for national defense. When the pay raise comparability gap reached 13.5% in 1999—resulting in a predictable readiness crises—Congress took responsible action to change the law. Largely because of your efforts and the belated recognition of the problem by the Executive Branch, the gap has been reduced to 6.4% as of 2003.</strong></u> <br />

<u>Competitive pay is clearly one of the key components to ensuring that we attract and retain the high quality, highly skilled men and women needed in our armed forces today. Compensation includes all pays and allowances: basic pay, housing and subsistence allowances, and special and incentive pays. We are grateful to the Congress for its work in significantly improving each of these areas over the past two years. Pay raises send a clear signal that our nation recognizes the courage and ideals required for military service. While we have taken some important steps in the right direction, we cannot afford to become complacent. Analysis in support of the 9th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation (9th QRMC) has taken a hard look at the pay comparability of our forces against the levels of pay they might command in the private sector based on their skills, experience, and education. The results indicate that while NCO pay would be adequate for a high school educated force, increasing percentages of the force have completed at least a year of college by the time they are E-5s. Today’s pay table does not compare favorably with the income levels of similarly educated civilian workers.</u> <br />

<u><strong>The world's great powers are growing old. Steep declines in birthrates over the last century and major increases in life expectancy have caused the populations of Britain, China, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United States to age at a substantial rate. This phenomenon will hinder the other major powers challenging America's economic and military dominance, largely because these countries are growing old faster than is the United States. Yet population aging may still threaten America's international security interests. The scope of the aging process is remarkable. By 2050 at least 20 percent of the citizens in these countries will be over 65; in Japan more than 33 percent will be. China alone will have more than 329 million people over 65. The populations of Germany, Japan, and Russia are expected to shrink significantly. Russia's population is already decreasing by nearly 700,000 people per year. The aging problem in the other great powers is so severe that, in coming decades, they will lack the resources to overtake America's huge power advantages. Graying populations will hinder countries' economic growth as working-age populations (ages 15 to 64) shrink, and will strain governmental resources as public spending for retirees' pensions and healthcare balloons. This is true even for China, America's most likely future rival. Indeed, China's economic expansion is already threatened by labor shortages due to population aging. China is also particularly unprepared to pay for the costs of an aging population. China's elderly have very little savings, the government has set aside little money for their welfare, and the family structure (the traditional form of social security) is weakening. Exploding public elderly care costs are likely to force cuts in all other discretionary spending, including for economic development and defense. Although America's population is also aging, this country is in much better shape. The United States is the &quot;youngest&quot; of all the Group of Eight nations. Because it has the highest fertility and immigration rates of all the great powers, it will maintain — even strengthen — this position in coming decades. America's working-age population as a result is expected to expand significantly in this period. Compared with other great powers, the United States also has a relatively well-funded pension system; its public welfare commitments to the elderly are modest; its citizens work many more hours per year and significantly later in life; and its tax burden is low. Although the aging crisis is less severe in the United States than in the other great powers, the challenges arising from this crisis are far from trivial. The Congressional Budget Office projects that by 2015, spending on the elderly in the United States will total almost $1.8 trillion — nearly half of the anticipated federal budget. For the United States, healthcare costs are the biggest problem presented by an aging population. This country spends more than twice as much per capita in this area than any other industrialized state. By conservative estimates, absent reforms, the costs of Medicare alone will be at least $2.6 trillion in 2050 in today's dollars — roughly the size of the current US federal budget. To pay for the massive fiscal costs associated with its aging population, the United States is likely to have to scale back its international policies. America will be less able in the future to dedicate significant resources to preventing WMD proliferation, funding nation building, and engaging in humanitarian interventions. So at the same time that global aging will help prevent the rise of great power competitors, this phenomenon may jeopardize other vital US international interests. To protect its international security, the United States needs to maintain its enviable demographic position. Specifically, it should reduce Social Security and Medicare payments to wealthier citizens, raise the retirement age to reflect increases in life expectancies, maintain largely open immigration policies, and, above all, restrain the rising costs of its healthcare system. A defining political question of the 21st century is whether US leaders have sufficient political will and wisdom to implement these and related policies. Failure to do so will significantly jeopardize future levels of America's global influence and safety.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>RIGHT now, the United States is in the midst of a financial crisis, but even more pressing problems may lie ahead — and the presidential candidates aren’t addressing them. No matter who sits in the Oval Office next year, there won’t be many degrees of freedom in the federal budget. That’s because spending on entitlement programs is largely locked into place, and the situation will become much worse as Americans age and health care costs rise. Even if the government is conservative in its spending, just paying out promised benefits implies that tax rates will rise to a crushing level — a range of 60 to 80 percent of income — well before the end of this century. The main problem is Medicare, which reimburses the elderly for many of their health care expenses. As Mark V. Pauly, professor of health care systems at the University of Pennsylvania, has said, “Medicare as we know it today cannot be sustained over the next 50 years and probably will run into financial difficulties within the next 15.” There’s one important idea lurking in the shadows that neither campaign is keen to talk about: paying out government benefits more efficiently. To put it bluntly, it means paying out full benefits only to those who really need them, and cutting back on payments to everybody else. Most recently, this notion has been proposed by Peter H. Schuck, a Yale law professor, and Richard J. Zeckhauser, a Harvard political economy professor, in their book, “Targeting in Social Programs: Avoiding Bad Bets, Removing Bad Apples.” “Means testing” — cutting back on payments to the relatively wealthy — is one way to better allocate benefits. For health care costs, this could be done by expanding Medicaid, which is focused on the needs of the poor, and making it an entirely federal program rather than one partly paid for by the states. At the same time, the government would need to limit the growth of Medicare, which is universally applied to all elderly people; as a segment of American society, the elderly are relatively wealthy. With limited resources, it would be better to reallocate health care subsidies toward the poor, whether they are young or old. Furthermore, inducing the wealthy to pay for their own health coverage would create</strong> pressures to lower costs<strong>. An alternative path is to put in place more means testing throughout Medicare. For instance, higher-income older Americans have already been paying larger Medicare premiums and receiving a lower prescription drug benefit; that’s part of what made it possible to expand the prescription benefit within budgetary constraints.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>President Barack Obama and top Congressional Democrats are leading the world toward a new global government debt bubble. The United States appears headed toward a multi-trillion-dollar increase in publicly traded federal debt in just the next two years, with much more to come. Other nations appear to be following suit. This debt explosion is likely to raise interest rates significantly for government debt, thereby increasing interest costs for future generations. More troubling at the moment, this policy will increase interest rates for all private debt such as home mortgages, consumer loans, and business loans. The near-term consequences of this debt bubble will be a deeper recession, a longer recession, and a weaker eventual recovery. The Debt Bubble Groweth By the end of 2008, the federal government had about $6.4 trillion in publicly traded debt--the net accumulation of all debt issued by the government since the founding of the republic. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts a deficit for 2009 of $1.2 trillion, excluding any effects of a stimulus bill or other new spending. The stimulus plan is still evolving, but the total under consideration at the moment is about $900 billion, some of which will be &quot;injected&quot; into the economy in 2009, some in 2010, and some in later years. In addition, the Obama Administration appears intent on using the second $350 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds. Combining the baseline deficit with expected stimulus spending and the TARP funds, total federal borrowing in 2009 will likely increase the national debt by at least $1.9 trillion to $8.3 trillion. While forecasting federal borrowing beyond 2009 is speculative, the combination of current law programs plus the stimulus--and without any additional borrowings for additional financial market interventions or other new spending--suggests at least another $1.6 trillion of new government debt, bringing the total of publicly traded federal debt to $9.9 trillion by the end of 2010. A common means of putting such figures into perspective is to compare them to the size of the economy. At the end of 2008, the ratio of federal debt to GDP was about 44.9 percent. Under the assumptions here about new issuance and using the CBO forecasts for nominal GDP, debt at the end of 2009 will be about 57.9 percent, an increase of 13 percentage points in just a single year. By the end of 2010, the debt-to-GDP ratio will have reached 67.9 percent for a two-year increase of 23 percentage points. Driving the Recession Deeper The consequences of this government debt bubble for future outlays for federal interest expense--and therefore for the long-term budget picture--are significant. Yet, this debt's effects on interest rates will have severe economic repercussions in 2009 and 2010. Analysts have argued for years over the effects of deficits and debt on interest rates. Recent research has led to a tentative consensus on the matter, especially when budget deficits and government debt issuance are in the common ranges of $200 to $400 billion, or 1-4 percent of GDP and the national debt is moving up or down by a tenth of a percent of GDP or two.[1] According to this consensus, an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio of 1 percentage point could be expected to increase long-term interest rates by between three and five basis points, or between 0.03 and 0.05 percentage points. This modest effect resulting from modest deficits is the basis for repeated conservative claims in the past that modest deficits were of little consequence. Expected federal borrowing for 2009 and 2010 will be far from modest, and the consequences will be significant for interest rates--and potentially crippling for the economy. Using just the consensus estimates, the projected increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio for 2009 alone will raise interest rates by between 0.39 and 0.65 percentage points. In today's terms, the average mortgage rate at the end of January was about 5.33 percent on a conforming loan mortgage. At the end of 2009, if nothing else occurs, this rate would be between 5.75 and 6 percent. Using the consensus estimates, by the end of 2010 interest rates will be up another 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points, for a total increase due to the government debt bubble of 0.7 and 1.1 percentage points.[2] That would mean that today's mortgage rate of 5.33 percent would be between 6 percent and 6.4 percent. Such increases in interest rates would significantly weaken the economy further and delay for many months any hope of significant recovery. Does the Consensus Hold True with Massive Debt? These estimates of the interest rates effects of the coming government debt bubble are likely to be understated for three separate reasons. 1.They assume no additional government spending, whereas President Obama and the Democratic congressional leadership have signaled large increases in new spending on infrastructure, health care, the environment, and education. The expected, partly funded expansion of the State Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) is a good example of such new spending.[3] 2.The consensus forecasts for interest rate effects from issuing government debt derive from data on relatively small changes in government debt as a share of GDP. Larger changes in the debt-to-GDP ratio pose significantly greater issues for credit markets, so the interest rate response likely increases more than proportionally. 3.The consensus estimate for interest rate effects also implicitly assumes that governments around the world are largely following their own normal fiscal policies. In contrast, the global recession has caused deficits to balloon almost everywhere, and governments worldwide are considering their own massive programs to stimulate their economies. So the United States will be offering this great wave of federal debt to the credit markets while most other countries will be doing the same. Because interest rates are set on global markets, this even larger global wave of government debt is likely to have much greater interest rate effects than would be the case if the United States were acting alone. An Effective Alternative Approach The global economy is sliding into a deep and potentially prolonged recession. Not only will the stimulus bill developing in Congress be ineffective in helping the economy but it will actually further weaken the economy by putting additional upward pressure on interest rates. There is an effective, three-part alternative. 1.Eliminate (or, at the very least, delay) the threat of a massive tax hike bearing down on the economy in 2011, and then cut marginal income tax rates on individuals and businesses further to energize the productive processes in the U.S. economy. The growth effects from the tax relief would more than offset the incremental pressures on interest rates from the higher resulting deficits.[4] 2.Aggressively reduce federal spending in 2009. Numerous studies of federal spending have highlighted programs that are inappropriate, wasteful, or ineffective. Congress should cut spending now, not increase it, to take immediate pressure off of credit markets by reducing the magnitude of federal funding in 2009 and to signal to credit markets that the U.S. government has not entirely thrown in the towel on fiscal responsibility. Cutting spending could thereby reduce the upward pressure on interest rates.[5] 3.Take immediate action to reduce future spending in the major entitlement programs, especially Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. President Obama has stated his intention to take action on these wildly unsustainable programs. In the past, entitlement reforms have been couched in terms of improving the long-term fiscal picture. Taking action on these programs today by aligning tomorrow's promised benefits with available resources would be another powerful signal to credit markets, thereby restoring the credibility of United States government's fiscal policy and further relieving the upward pressure on interest rates. Do the Opposite The U.S. economy and the global economy are sliding into a deep recession demanding effective policy responses. The prevailing policy response has been to increase spending and further increase the amount of debt the federal government must sell to progressively more worried capital markets. The effect of this policy will be to increase the already significant upward pressure on interest rates that threatens to make the recession worse. Congress and the President should do the opposite of what they apparently intend: They should cut taxes on productive activities, not increase them. They should cut spending, not increase it. And rather than increase entitlement spending as they intend with the SCHIP expansion, they should reduce future entitlement benefits to give credit markets some confidence that U.S. policymakers have not entirely abandoned fiscal discipline.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>Medicare’s obligations and financing structure are unsustainable. A number of factors will fuel growth in Medicare spending in the coming years. Demographic trends will reduce the number of workers available to finance Medicare relative to the number of beneficiaries. According to Medicare’s trustees, the ratio will fall from about 4 workers per beneficiary in 2003 to about 2.4 workers per beneficiary in 2030 and will continue to fall until there are only 2 workers per beneficiary in 2078. Health care costs will continue to climb. In 2003, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 30 percent of Medicare’s future growth would be due to society’s aging, while 70 percent would be due to the rising cost of health care. Existing revenue streams for Medicare are insufficient to keep the promises that Congress has made to future beneficiaries. Medicare’s trustees estimate that Congress would need to put</strong> over $80 trillion <strong>in an interest-bearing account in 2008 to cover those future funding gaps. In 2008, the entire economic output of the United States was less than $15 trillion. The $700 billion bailout of the financial sector enacted by Congress in late 2008 is less than 1 percent of the amount required to bail out Medicare. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if Congress were to meet that shortfall by raising income taxes, federal individual income tax rates would roughly double by 2050, with the top marginal rate reaching 66 percent. The CBO further estimates that tax increases of that magnitude could suppress national income by as much as 20 percent. A second suspect premise is that participation in Medicare is voluntary. In fact, Medicare greatly restricts the freedom of workers, seniors, and entrepreneurs. Medicare crowds out other health insurance options for seniors and forces seniors who decline Medicare benefits to forfeit all past and future Social Security benefits. It prohibits participating providers from delivering Medicare-covered services to beneficiaries on a private basis, an affront to the right of patients and doctors to make mutually beneficial exchanges that affect no one else. And of course funding Medicare is hardly voluntary; Americans are required to pay the 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax and other federal taxes, which finance the program through general revenues. A third premise is that government can or should devise a one-sizefits- all package of health insurance benefits for tens of millions of senior citizens. To reduce opposition within the health care industry and ensure enactment, Medicare’s sponsors modeled Medicare coverage on Blue Cross Blue Shield coverage as it existed in 1965. The industry wanted Medicare to pay physicians on a fee-for-service basis and to have little ability to refuse payment for low-value or inefficient services. That sounds appealing on the surface—few people like the idea of having government ration medical care. Yet Medicare ends up committing the opposite sin— wasting money on useless services—which can be just as harmful as government rationing. There is considerable evidence that Medicare wastes vast sums of money on low-value services and that fee-for-service payment is a prime contributor to such waste. Researchers at Dartmouth Medical School estimate that 30 percent of Medicare spending does nothing to make beneficiaries healthier or happier. That suggests that Medicare spends about $150 billion each year—roughly the entire economic output of South Carolina—on medical services of no discernible value. Political pressure from the industry prevents Congress or the Medicare bureaucracy from dealing with those problems. (Every dollar of wasteful Medicare spending is a dollar of income to somebody, and that somebody typically has a lobbyist.) Having locked in a payment systembased on fee-for-service reimbursement and a fragmented delivery system, Medicare suppresses competition from alternative payment and delivery systems (see also Chapter 15, ‘‘Health Care Regulation’’). When Medicare was enacted, it effectively destroyed a large and growing private market for health insurance for seniors that would have enabled greater experimentation and competition. By 1962, an estimated 60 percent of seniors had voluntary health insurance coverage, up from 31 percent in 1952. Today, seniors essentially have only one place to go for health insurance. They may augment their Medicare coverage by enrolling in a private Medicare Advantage health plan or by purchasing Medicare supplemental or ‘‘Medigap’’ coverage. Medigap plans typically make seniors even less price sensitive and more likely to overconsume care. Medicare Advantage plans (previously known asMedicareChoice plans) tend to provide an unstable alternative to traditional Medicare, as Congress frequently adjusts payment levels and private plans enter and exit the program on the basis of the (perceived) adequacy of those payments. Supporters claim that Medicare is more efficient than private insurance because it has lower administrative costs. To reach that conclusion, they ignore many of Medicare’s administrative costs, in particular the ‘‘excess burden’’ or reduced economic output caused by Medicare taxes. Those costs are estimated at 20 to 100 percent of Medicare’s expenditures, dwarfing any administrative costs of private firms. And decades of reports by government watchdogs demonstrate that the main wayMedicare avoids administrative costs is by failing to scrutinize claims to prevent fraud or to ensure value. The Government Accountability Office found that in 2004 Medicare call centers answered providers’ billing questions accurately and completely only 4 percent of the time. It is no wonder, then, that the Department of Health and Human Services reports improper Medicare payments of $12.1 billion in 2001. Medicare’s avoidance of administrative expenses is a vice, not a virtue. Reform of Priorities Medicare should be policymakers’ top health care priority, and the program demands immediate reform. Congress should focus immediately on two steps. First, it should charge premiums for all parts of Medicare, charging higher premiums to seniors with higher lifetime earnings (i.e., ‘‘means-tested’’ premiums). Generally, seniors pay premiums only for Part B (physician insurance) and Part D (prescription drug coverage), not for Part A (hospital insurance). Those combined premiums currently account for about 13 percent of total Medicare spending. Congress should increase premiums for high earners until premiums cover at least 25 percent of total outlays. Increasing premiums on high-income earners creates a problem: it discourages high-income seniors from working by penalizing them with higher premiums. Charging higher premiums to seniors with high lifetime incomes can mitigate that problem. (If past earnings are the primary factor influencing Medicare premiums, strategic behavior becomes more difficult. Seniors would be unable to alter their past earnings, and reducing their current earnings would have less of an effect on their premiums. The Social Security Administration already possesses the data necessary to calculate seniors’ lifetime earnings.) Second, Congress should allow seniors to opt out of Medicare without losing their Social Security benefits. Broader means-testing and permission for seniors to opt out ofMedicare would achieve only modest progress in shoring up the program’s finances and restoring seniors’ freedom. They would have an enormous effect, however, on the politics of Medicare. As well-to-do seniors see their premiums rise, many will decide that Medicare is a bad deal and will leave the program. If they are allowed to retain their Social Security benefits, even more will exit the program. Today, Medicare covers nearly all seniors, whose medical care is heavily subsidized by younger workers. Reducing those subsidies, and reducing the share of seniors dependent on Medicare, will change the political dynamics of the program and build a constituency among seniors for further and more substantial Medicare reforms.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>The U.S. military is starting to see signs that the troop surge in Afghanistan is working on a timetable similar to the Iraq reinforcement campaign in 2007, according to an outside adviser and military sources. &quot;</strong>There are <strong>already some early</strong> signs of a <strong>beginning of a</strong> momentum shift in our favor<strong>,&quot; retired Army Gen. Jack Keane told The Washington Times. Gen. Keane just returned from a two-week tour of the battlefield, where the focus is on ousting the Taliban from Kandahar, its birthplace, as well as from Helmand province and other southern and eastern areas. Gen. Keane reported his findings to Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Kabul, who saw the surge of 30,000 troops completed in August, placing about 100,000 American service members in country. An architect of the Bush administration's surge of troops in Iraq, Gen. Keane advised Gen. Petraeus when he was the top commander there. Gen. Keane told The Times he has witnessed in Afghanistan the same shift in fortunes: Taliban fighters are changing sides, villages are being cleansed of the enemy and protected, and intercepted communications show flagging Taliban morale. &quot;Overall, we can see now that the surge forces are starting to make a difference,&quot; he said. &quot;And you have to be encouraged by some of the progress that's being made. All that said, we're in a tough fight, and I believe</strong> we will continue to gain momentum<strong>.&quot; Gen. Keane offered two observations as evidence. First, most commanders with whom he spoke said they are encountering Taliban who want to stop fighting and reintegrate into Afghan society. &quot;That's a big deal,&quot; he said. Second, &quot;There's evidence of erosion of some of the will of the Taliban. We pick it up in interrogations, and we also pick it up listening to their radio traffic and telephone calls in terms of the morale problems they're starting to have,&quot; Gen. Keane said. A military officer in the U.S. who monitors the war confirmed that Taliban radio chatter sounds a bit frantic. &quot;The Taliban are not anxious to engage us, because we come after them once they start shooting at us,&quot; the officer told The Times on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press. &quot;One of the translations I saw came out as 'Marines are insane.' So, maybe that means that little by little things are getting better.&quot; Gen. Keane said the drop in Taliban morale can be traced to soldiers and Marines going after hillside hamlets and safe havens. The Taliban has thrived in such areas, where they regroup, plan raids and store ammunition. &quot;What is happening is, the Taliban's freedom of movement,&quot; he said. &quot;We are literally taking away from them things they are used to. We are denying them some of the safe havens that they have in the south. We are denying them the support zones they've been operating out of with impunity. &quot;Support zones are up in the mountains, where they use villagers to help hide their weapons caches. Safe havens are up there, too, usually away from everybody, and we are denying them the use of those. We are interdicting and disrupting their operating areas, which had a tendency to focus on the roads quite a bit, and we're interdicting what they're doing there.&quot; Gen. Petraeus is on a schedule to show positive results by July 2011, when President Obama's war strategy calls for the beginning of a troop exit. The four-star general's job may have gotten tougher last week, when James L. Jones, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, quit as Mr. Obama's national security adviser. He will be succeeded by Thomas Donilon, a Democratic Party operative and lawyer who served as Gen. Jones' deputy and who opposed more troops for Afghanistan, which puts him at odds with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. In a recent NPR interview, Gen. Petraeus cited the Malajat district in Kandahar city as an area infested with Taliban but now controlled by U.S. and Afghan forces. &quot;A month ago, it was a sanctuary for certain elements of the Taliban who were carrying out assassinations, intimidation activities, extortion and a variety of other illicit acts,&quot; he said. &quot;They largely controlled it. That Malajat district was [one] in which the Taliban had freedom of movement, freedom of access, and again, considerable influence in that area.&quot; Maj. Gen. Richard Mills, the top Marine in Afghanistan, who is focused on retaking Helmand, has been guarded about war progress. But last week at a change-of-command ceremony, he declared, according to press reports: &quot;</strong>We're hurting the enemy, and we're hurting him badly<strong>. For every casualty we suffer, the enemy suffers numerous casualties.&quot; Stephen Biddle, a Council on Foreign Relations analyst who advises the command in Afghanistan, like Gen. Keane, has seen territorial gains. &quot;There are places that had been deeply Taliban-held that are now certainly contested and in some places increasingly government-controlled, like the central Helmand River Valley for example,&quot; he said on the council's website. &quot;This may happen increasingly over coming weeks and months in previously dangerous parts of Kandahar province, where progress has not been as fast as many had hoped.&quot; Mr. Biddle said the Obama administration made a mistake in calling out Afghan President Hamid Karzai publicly for rampant corruption, which embarrassed him in front of his people and forced him to lash out at Washington. Now, the U.S. command and State Department have embarked on a &quot;bottom-up&quot; strategy to try to root out corruption network by network, he said.</strong></u> <br />

<u><strong>American and Afghan forces have been routing the Taliban in much of the insurgency’s base of Kandahar Province in recent weeks, forcing many hardened fighters to flee strongholds they have held for years in the face of the buildup of American forces, NATO commanders and local Afghan officials said. A series of civilian and military operations around the strategic southern province, made possible after a force of 12,000 American and NATO troops reached full strength here in the late summer, has persuaded Afghan and Western officials that the Taliban will have a hard time returning to areas they had controlled for years. Some of the gains seem to have come from a new mobile rocket that has pinpoint accuracy — like a small cruise missile — and has been used against the hideouts of insurgent commanders around Kandahar. That has forced many of them to retreat across the border into Pakistan. Disruption of their supply lines has made it harder for them to stage retaliatory strikes or suicide bombings, at least for the moment, officials and residents said. NATO commanders are careful not to overstate their successes — they acknowledge they made that mistake earlier in the year when they undertook a high-profile operation against Marja that did not produce lasting gains. But they say they are making “deliberate progress” and have seized the initiative from the insurgents. Western and Afghan civilian officials are more outspoken, saying that</strong> heavy losses for the Taliban have sapped the momentum the insurgency had in the area<strong>. Unlike the Marja operation, they say, the one in Kandahar is a comprehensive civil and military effort that is changing the public mood as well as improving security. “We now have the initiative. We have created momentum,” said Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, the British commander of the NATO coalition forces in southern Afghanistan, who has overseen the Kandahar operation for the last year. “It is everything put together in terms of the effort that has gone in over the last 18 months and</strong> it is undoubtedly having an impact<strong>.” NATO forces have experienced setbacks in other parts of Afghanistan, and some military officials say the advances in Kandahar may not represent a turning point in the overall war effort. The Taliban, for example, have surprised the Americans by asserting control over some areas in the northern part of Afghanistan, from which they had once been almost entirely eliminated. But Kandahar represent the heartland of the Taliban insurgency and are the main focus of the large influx of American troops and Afghan government forces. “Afghans will tell you, if you have a peaceful Kandahar, you will have a peaceful Afghanistan,” General Carter said. “I think only time will tell.” The civilian and military effort in Kandahar has been 18 months in the planning. Only after thousands of extra troops were in place at the end of August — part of the surge of 30,000 troops President Obama ordered last year — did the operations finally begin producing results. The combined strength of 12,000 American and NATO troops and some 7,000 Afghan security forces in the province has meant that for the first time they are able to mount operations simultaneously in all of the most critical areas of the province. Beginning in August, Afghan forces spearheaded a clearing operation in Mehlajat, on the southern edge of the city of Kandahar. Soon after, American forces pushed through much of Arghandab, a strategic rural district that leads into the city from the north. At the same time troops from the 101st Airborne Division moved into Zhare District to the southwest, where they initially encountered strong resistance. By the middle of this month, forces were poised to retake the most nefarious area of all, the horn of Panjwai, an area 19 miles long and 6 miles wide where the Taliban had built up a redoubt of command posts, courts and mined areas over the last four years. Afghan and American troops mounted an airborne assault into the region last weekend. Apparently surprised by the intensity of the strikes on their supply routes, bomb factories and command compounds, many Taliban commanders pulled out to Pakistan, and most of the fighters have also slipped away or hidden their weapons, NATO commanders, local residents and the Taliban themselves say. Lt. Col. Rodger Lemons, commanding Task Force 1-66 in Arghandab, said he had seen insurgent attacks drop from 50 a week in August to 15 a week two months later. That may be because of the onset of colder weather, when fighting tends to drop off, but Colonel Lemons said he felt the Taliban was losing heart. “A lot are getting killed,” he said. “They are not receiving support from the local population, they are complaining that the local people are not burying their dead, and they are saying: ‘We are losing so many we want to go back home.’ ” Military and civilian officials say there are also signs of a crisis in command as Taliban leaders have struggled to maintain logistics and supply routes, suicide bombers have failed to turn up for attacks, and even senior commanders were showing reluctance to follow orders from their leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, to go in to fight the NATO onslaught in Panjwai. The Taliban have described their pullback as a tactical retreat, saying that fighters have gone to the city of Kandahar instead to conduct bombings and rocket attacks like those Saturday night outside the prison and the police station. Yet residents say that the Taliban have been stunned by fast-paced raids on their leaders and bases. In particular they talk with awe of a powerful new rocket that has been fired from the Kandahar air base into Panjwai and other areas for the last two or three weeks, hitting Taliban compounds with remarkable accuracy. The rocket curls and turns in the air as it zooms in on its target and sets off secondary explosions, often burning the trees and foliage around buildings, one landowner from the Panjwai District said. In an interview, General Carter said the weapon the Afghans saw was most likely the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or Himars, a relatively new multiple rocket system. “They are extraordinarily precise; they are accurate to a meter,” he said. A Taliban fighter reached by telephone, who spoke to a reporter only on condition that he not be named, confirmed that the insurgents had pulled back but would seek to reinfiltrate once the main push was over. “We are not there anymore, we are not preparing to fight a big battle, but we are waiting,” he said. “We are waiting until this force has been exhausted and has done all they are supposed to do, and later on our fighters will re-enter the area.” But the Afghan police and officials say the Taliban have been severely weakened. “</strong>We broke their neck<strong>,” said Hajji Niaz Muhammad, the police chief in the Arghandab District. “There is no doubt they are very weak in this area now.”</strong></u> <br />

<br />
<u><strong>Long a lagging priority, the plan to produce many more highly trained Afghan troops is moving this fall at a rapid pace. Two main training sites — the Kabul Military Training Center, used principally by the Afghan Army, and the Central Training Center, used by the police — have become bustling bases, packed with trainers and recruits, and there is a sense among the officers that they are producing better soldiers than before. The military center has been graduating 1,400 newly trained soldiers every two weeks, as the Obama administration, eager to show progress in a slow-going war, has devoted more trainers and money to the effort. NATO officials hope that the clear</strong> changes in the training<strong>, both in output and atmosphere,</strong> are grounds for a measure of optimism <strong>in a war that has frustrated those waging it and provoked increasing opposition at home. The ratio of instructors to students has gone from one for every 79 trainees in 2009 to one for every 29, officers at the center say, suggesting that the new police officers and soldiers are getting more attention than in years past. The soldiers are paid better and desert less often, officials say. New Afghan infantry battalions, each with roughly 800 soldiers, are regularly leaving the capital for service in the war, sometimes making two or three battalions a month. Regional training centers are also holding more sessions, and new bases — including a flight school for Afghanistan’s nascent air force — are soon to be built. The question now is whether these new forces will allow NATO and the Afghan government to reverse the insurgency’s momentum and begin reducing the Western presence in the country. If so, will it happen quickly enough for an American public weary of the war? Or will the promise of these fresh troops also be undermined by desertion, poor leadership and the established pattern of leaving much of the most dangerous work to Western hands? Any answer must navigate a pair of remarkably different pictures of the war. Away from the capital, in the rural areas where the insurgency rages, the Afghan military has not performed well. In provinces where the Taliban are strongest and the fighting is most pitched, the common view is that the Afghan Army and the police have thus far been disappointing. At the small-unit level, Western troops and journalists have documented their corruption, drug use, mediocre or poor fighting skills and patterns of lackluster commitment, including an unwillingness to patrol regularly and in sizable numbers, or to stand watch in remote outposts. At the higher levels, Western military officers often describe patronage, favoritism and an absence of managerial acumen, rooted in part in the pervasive culture of corruption and in widespread illiteracy. (Now, 14 percent of the combined force can read or write — at the third-grade level.) There is also a strong worry about Taliban infiltration into the ranks, especially among the police.</strong> In contrast to the field<strong>, however,</strong> at the training bases the newly formed forces are clearly improving<strong>. Since last year, when President Obama’s plan dedicated more resources to Afghan development, the Pentagon has pursued what is in theory a simple, if expensive, approach: to recruit and field forces quickly, and then, over time, to improve their fighting and managerial skills. Enormous resources have been dedicated to the effort. The numbers indicate that the first step is under way. By June 2009, after more than seven years of war, the United States had helped Afghanistan field a combined army and police force of about 170,000 members. Since then, the combined force has grown by half that size again — by more than 86,000 troops. Today the Afghan Army has 136,000 members, and the police force about 120,000. Within a year, the combined forces are projected to grow by 50,000. Raw personnel numbers are only one measure. The United States is simultaneously buying and issuing new weapons, vehicles and communications gear; building barracks, classrooms and logistics depots; and developing a network of language labs to nudge the force toward literacy. It is also underwriting programs intended to expand Afghan military and police capabilities, including training bomb- and drug-detection dogs for the border police, training pilots for the small fleet of Afghan helicopters and transport aircraft, and opening so-called branch schools to focus on the technical development of Afghans with specialized military skills. “Basically, there is a big change in training, the quality of the training,” said Brig. Gen. Aminullah Patyani, the commander of the Kabul Military Training Center. This month, for example, the Afghan Defense Ministry opened a school for artillerists. Some of these programs show clear signs of progress, including scheduled flights with Afghan pilots and helicopters to transfer wounded Afghan soldiers from Kandahar to Kabul. “We’re getting to the point where we have reliable, repeatable Afghan Air Force missions,” said Brig. Gen. David W. Allvin, who commands the NATO effort to develop an Afghan aviation capability. Col. John G. Ferrari, a deputy commander of the NATO Training Mission Afghanistan, spoke of an “inevitability factor,” in which local security forces, in theory and if trained properly, rise in quantity, skill and state of equipment,</strong> sharply tilting the war in the government’s favor.</u> <br />

<u><strong>Since the end of the Cold War, the National Guard and Reserves have been transformed from a strategic to an operational force because of the demands of U.S. military involvement in Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and—most significantly— Afghanistan and Iraq (twice). While still providing strategic depth in the event of a major war, the often derided &quot;weekend warriors&quot; of yesteryear have been replaced by men and women who join the Guard and Reserves knowing full well that they will participate routinely and regularly in ongoing military missions. This transformation of the Reserve Component (RC)—comprised of approximately 1.1 million Servicemembers in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard Reserve, along with the Army and Air National Guard—has been widely acknowledged by U.S. political and military leaders. As Vice President Joe Biden said earlier this year, &quot;This ain't your father's National Guard.&quot;1 Officials also have recognized the need for new policies that will support an operational reserve. Department of Defense (DOD) Secretary Robert Gates observed, &quot;Since the Guard was considered in the past a strategic reserve, it was a lower priority for funding. That has changed.&quot;2 He later added, &quot;Today, the standard is that the Guard and Reserves receive the same equipment as the Active Force.&quot;3 DOD has moved to support an operational reserve thanks in no small part to the influence of the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves, which released its landmark final report in January 2008. Besides developing implementation plans for the majority of the commission's recommendations, Secretary Gates issued Directive 1200.17 (October 29, 2008), Directive 1235.10 (November 26, 2008), and Instruction 1235.12 (February 4, 2010), which collectively enshrined the principles and policies required to sustain the Reserve Component as an operational force. Congress assisted by fully funding RC budget requests and by instituting legislative changes to fund requirements, such as improved medical and dental screenings, that bolster operational readiness. On balance, the United States has come a long way in developing a ready, capable, and available operational reserve. DOD should be commended for its improvements during both the Bush and Obama administrations. Yet two strands of unanswered questions relating to strategic roles and missions as well as readiness and funding threaten to unravel the progress made so far. In a budgetary environment where defense spending is expected to decrease, postwar reset expenditures loom, and structural cost growth is intensifying internal competition for Pentagon resources, a fundamental question must be answered about the future of the Guard and Reserves: &quot;Operational for what?&quot; Strategic Roles and Missions The Guard and Reserves have contributed considerably to the U.S. war efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Over 770,000 RC Servicemembers have been activated since September 11, 2001, and half of all Army RC personnel are now combat veterans.4 President Barack Obama has highlighted specific capabilities that the RC brings to the fight.5 Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen recently wrote, &quot;We could not have accomplished what we have these past eight years were it not for our Reserve and National Guard forces.&quot;6 Through early July 2010, there were 184 Guardsmen and Reservists killed in Afghanistan and 820 killed in Iraq, representing nearly one-fifth of total U.S. military casualties in the conflicts. The numbers wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq stand at 959 and 6,642, respectively.7 Despite this sacrifice, the U.S. national security bureaucracy will not enact future policies and apportion future resources based solely on the Reserve's wartime contributions over the past decade. Current necessity does not equal continued relevance. Today, there is already talk of placing the RC &quot;back on the shelf,&quot; or restoring it to a strictly strategic or &quot;weekend warrior&quot; status, in order to save the additional money required to keep it operational. This is nothing new; the RC has historically been targeted for downsizing during times of diminishing Pentagon budgets, in part due to the counterproductive yet persistent rivalry between the Active and Reserve Components. Secretary Gates may have issued the directives to sustain the RC as an operational force, but unless defense policymakers coalesce soon around a shared vision for how the RC is integral to overcoming future threats—that is, unless the &quot;Operational for what?&quot; question is answered convincingly—budgetary rivalries among the Services and between the Active and Reserve Components may overwhelm larger strategic considerations. Before gazing inward at the state of U.S. planning, it helps to look outward at the policies of U.S allies and potential adversaries. Throughout the world, the most militarily powerful nations are no longer managing their reserves as a strictly strategic asset meant only to be used in the event of a &quot;big&quot; war. Australia, Canada, China, Israel, Japan, Russia, and Western European countries now increasingly rely on their reserves as complementary, integral, and operational portions of their &quot;total&quot; military force. Defense scholar Richard Weitz has labeled this transformation, which mirrors what has happened in the U.S. military, as the &quot;de facto globalization of the Abrams Doctrine&quot;—the concept espoused by former Army Chief of Staff General Creighton Abrams, which dictates that the United States should never go to war without its Guard and Reserves, as it did by and large during the Vietnam War, because it severs the American public's connection to and support for U.S. military operations.8 As a nation whose military modernization is cause for concern in East Asia, China serves as an example of the new role played by reserves. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) incorporates its 500,000 to 800,000 reservists directly into its order of battle, requires reserve units to train alongside active-duty forces, and is increasing the funding and time devoted to reserve training and equipment. The majority of PLA reservists are former active-duty soldiers, and every reserve unit includes a small contingent of active-duty personnel that forms a continuous management nucleus between and during mobilizations. In recent years, the PLA has increasingly recruited civilian reservists who lack prior military service but possess high-tech skills with military applicability. For example, reservists employed in the chemical industry serve in chemical warfare units, and reservist telecommunications workers have been assigned to new PLA units specializing in information warfare and information operations. 9 These highly skilled reservists play a growing role in China's evolving antiaccess/ area-denial strategy of using sophisticated cyber and electronic attacks to degrade the U.S. military's battle networks, forward bases, and maritime forces and thereby inhibit U.S. power projection capabilities. The 2010 U.S. Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) was supposed to offer a similarly forward-oriented vision of the future role of the Guard and Reserves. While comprehensive in its description of the emerging international security environment, however, the QDR spent much less time on the RC. It stated: Prevailing in today's wars requires a Reserve Component that can serve in an operational capacity—available, trained, and equipped for predictable routine deployment. Preventing and deterring conflict will likely necessitate the continued use of some elements of the Reserve Component—especially those that possess high-demand skill sets—in an operational capacity well into the future. . . . The challenges facing the United States today and in the future will require us to employ National Guard and Reserve forces as an operational reserve to fulfill requirements for which they are well-suited in the United States and overseas. For example, the National Guard often serves at the forefront of DoD operations.10 On the positive side, the QDR codified the &quot;likely&quot; need for an operational reserve &quot;well into the future,&quot; including in &quot;preventing and deterring conflict,&quot; one of the QDR's four priority objectives. The RC's inclusion under this objective is important because it confirms that the RC has an operational role, aside from prevailing in today's wars (another of the priority objectives), in the initiatives listed under the &quot;prevent and deter&quot; heading. Because of the enduring phenomenon Secretary Gates calls &quot;next-war-itis,&quot; these futureoriented initiatives are already attracting more of defense policymakers' attention and resources. This trend is sure to accelerate as U.S. forces leave Afghanistan and Iraq. From the perspective of the RC, it is positive to have gotten in at the ground level, doctrinally speaking, on the &quot;prevent and deter&quot; objective that is likely to dominate the post-Afghanistan/ Iraq defense planning era. On the negative side, the QDR failed to identify which specific roles and missions it envisioned the RC fulfilling. Instead, it vaguely stated that &quot;some elements&quot; of the RC, especially those with &quot;high-demand skill sets,&quot; would be needed &quot;to fulfill requirements for which they are well-suited.&quot; But which elements, which skill sets, and which requirements? As noted above, &quot;The National Guard often serves at the forefront of DoD operations&quot; was all the QDR could offer as an example. Since millions of DOD civilian and military personnel undertake scores of operations every day, however, this example did not exactly narrow things down. By specifying neither the roles and missions anticipated for the RC, nor the strength, capabilities, or equipment needed to perform those roles and missions, the QDR failed to address directly one of the 17 reporting items required by law (10 U.S.C. Section 118, as amended).11 To compensate for this disappointing omission, the QDR pledged to conduct a comprehensive Pentagon review of future RC roles and missions, including an examination of the balance between Active and Reserve forces. The last government study to devote serious thought to this issue was the 2001 QDR-directed Review of Reserve Component Contributions to National Defense published in December 2002—3 months before the U.S. invasion of Iraq intensified what would become years of heavy reliance on the Guard and Reserves. The results of the new review being spearheaded by General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Dennis McCarthy, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, are expected by spring 2011. What conclusions will this review reach, and what will the implications be? In its discussion of the future character of conflict, the 2010 QDR offered some helpful hints. It posited that in the 21st century, conventional U.S. military superiority will increasingly drive potential adversaries toward asymmetric responses to American power. It emphasized the nontraditional threats posed by weapons of mass destruction (WMD) terrorist attacks, hybrid warfare combining high- and low-tech tactics, and the loss of shared access to the global commons in sea, air, space, and cyberspace. Cueing off of this assessment, the QDR's future-oriented &quot;prevent and deter&quot; objective, mentioned above as a place where RC capabilities will likely be applied operationally, included such high-profile U.S. missions as: •contributing to homeland defense and civil support capabilities •assisting partner nations in developing and acquiring the capabilities and systems required to improve their security capacity •maintaining awareness of global threats and opportunities, including the capabilities, values, intent, and decisionmaking of potential adversaries •supporting U.S. diplomatic and development efforts and strengthening governance •extending a global defense posture composed of forward-stationed forces, prepositioned equipment and facilities, and international agreements •protecting DOD infrastructure in space and cyberspace •building tailored regional deterrence architectures and missile defenses •overcoming antiaccess weaponry and tactics (for example, &quot;AirSea Battle&quot;).12</strong></u> <br />

They are angry about our close ties with Saudi Arabia, by the drone attacks the United States is conducting in Yemen and Pakistan, and by our unstinting support for Israel.

The United States federal government should enact and fully appropriate funds for the Department of Defense’s Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Request. <br />
<br />
Approving DOD’s budget solves all of their readiness and equipment impacts<br />
Chiarelli 10—General Chiarelli, Vice Chief of Staff for the U.S. Army, former Senior Military Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, B.S. in Political Science from Seattle University, Master of Public Administration from University of Washington, Master of Arts in National Security Strategy from Salve Regina University, graduate of the U.S. Naval Command &amp; Staff College, &amp; a graduate of the Naational War college, 3-16-10 (Peter, “Military Services’ Operation &amp; Maintenance,” testimony before the House Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Readiness, CQ Congressional Testimony)<br />
<br />
As all of you know, it has been a busy time for our Nation's military. We have been at war for the past eight-plus years. With the support of Congress, the forces deployed are the very best manned, equipped, trained and led in the 234-year history of the United States Army. That said, the prolonged demand and high operational tempo over the course of this two-front war have undeniably put a strain on our people and equipment. Our shared goal must continue to be to restore balance and sustain the high quality of our All-Volunteer Force for the duration of the current fight as well as for future operations. The United States Army's FY11 Budget Request seeks to achieve the Army's four imperatives: our ability to sustain the Army's Soldiers, Families, and Civilians; prepare forces for success in the current conflict; reset returning units to rebuild the readiness consumed in operations and to prepare for future deployments and contingencies; and transform to meet the demands of the 21st century. The intent of this statement is to provide justification for the Army's request for O&amp;M funding (base and OCO) in each of these areas. 2 The FY11budget (base and OCO) requests $107.3 billion in O&amp;M funding - a $7 billion increase from [fiscal year 2010] FY10. O&amp;M is the largest portion of the total budget, at 43.7 percent, and will be used for Soldier and unit training; ground and air vehicle operating costs; depot maintenance; base operations, sustainment, restoration, and modernization; and a 1.4 percent civilian pay raise. The Army's O&amp;M base account grew by approximately $3,729M in FY11. $1,104M of this growth reflects increases in pricing and inflation. The remaining $2,625M provides funds to restore balance and supports a phased expeditionary cycle for units at various Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) readiness levels. The FY11 budget request also migrates $1B in funding for enduring missions from OCO into the base. This move is largely due to increased home station training resulting from the Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) drawdown. Specifically, the request supports readiness through increases in OPTEMPO, Depot Maintenance, Soldier well-being programs, facilities and infrastructure sustainment, training, systems and accountability improvements, and cyber and network security operations. Sustain our All-Volunteer Force Sustaining our All-Volunteer Force is our first imperative. The Soldier, as Secretary Gates has said, is our greatest strategic asset. Unfortunately, after eight-plus years of war, we continue to see the high OPTEMPO and prolonged stress and strain on our Force manifested in the increased demand for behavioral health counseling and drug and alcohol counseling; increased divorce rates; and increased numbers of Soldiers temporarily non- deployable from nagging injuries from previous deployments. 3 The FY11 O&amp;M budget request includes $1.7 billion to standardize and fund vital Family programs and services to include welfare and recreation; youth services and child care; Survivor Outreach Services; and expanded counseling and rehabilitative opportunities for Soldiers and Family Members. In particular, the budget request supports the Army's commitment to Soldiers and their Families through initiatives such as the Army Campaign Plan for Health Promotion, Risk Reduction, and Suicide Prevention (ACPHP) and the Global Assessment Tool (GAT) that provides individual feedback on five fitness dimensions. The request also provides increased funding for barracks modernization, and ensures facility Sustainment is funded at 90 percent of the Facility Sustainment Model. Additionally, in collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health, the Army began a 5-year, $50 million seminal study into suicide prevention (funded through RDT&amp;E) that will help inform the ACPHP. The Army also began instituting our Comprehensive Soldier Fitness (CSF) program, an all-inclusive approach that puts mental health on par with physical fitness. By promoting resiliency and life-coping skills, we hope to help our Soldiers, Civilians, and Family Members to better deal with stress and other challenges. By enhancing the quality of life across our Army community, we believe we will see improvement in many other areas of concern, including suicides. The Army has also initiated a comprehensive sexual assault prevention campaign, the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response Program (SHARP), focused on leaders maintaining a positive command climate, which encourages peer-to-peer intervention in an environment where Soldiers do not tolerate the types of behavior that, left unchecked, could lead to sexual assault. 4 To ensure Reserve Component Soldiers and their Families receive the same level of support and assistance, the United States Army Reserve established Army Strong Community Centers to support geographically-dispersed Soldiers and Families. Together with Army National Guard Family Assistance Centers and Soldier and Family Assistance Centers on active duty installations, these centers provide help to Soldiers' Families near their homes. Prepare our Force The FY11 O&amp;M budget request funds manning, equipping, and training goals for the current operational environments. Today, we are continuing to transform the Army to a rotational model - the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN). This model represents the core process for generating trained, ready, and cohesive units on a sustained and rotational basis - to meet current and future strategic demands. The ARFORGEN process includes three force pools Reset, Train- Ready, and Available. Each of the three force pools contains a versatile force package, available at varying time intervals based on its readiness level. The ARFORGEN process increases predictability for Soldiers, Families, employers, and communities, and enables our RC to remain an integral element of the operational force while providing the Nation with the strategic depth (i.e., those non-deployed units which are two to three years from commitment) and operational flexibility to meet unexpected contingencies. Manning The Army is currently implementing the Active Army temporary end- strength increase of up to 22,000 Soldiers approved by the Secretary of Defense in July 2009. 5 Eight-plus years of sustained combat operations have increased non-deployable rates in our units. These increasing non-deployable rates (from 11 percent in 2007 to 13 percent in 2009) require us to continue to overfill our deploying units. The Soldiers needed to overfill those deploying units come largely from resetting units, thus reducing individuals' dwell time and the strength of these and other affected units across the Army. The temporary end-strength increase is substantially augmenting the enlisted fill of our Reset forces enabling more effective ARFORGEN-based manning, equipping and training processes required to get future deployers ready, thereby improving the overall readiness of our Army. The decision was made to temporarily increase the Army end-strength by 15,000 Soldiers by the end of fiscal year 2010. This was to assist in improving fill of deploying units while mitigating the elimination of Stop Loss. We added 5,000 Soldiers in fiscal year 2009, and will add an additional 10,000 individuals in fiscal year 2010. The resulting Army end-strength will be 562,400 Soldiers. The Army is assessing the need for an additional 7,000 Soldier growth for fiscal year 2011. This would bring us to the total 22,000 increase. The decision on whether or not to add the additional 7,000 growth is pending confirmation of our immediate demand, the pace of the drawdown from Iraq, and the requirement for forces in Afghanistan. If the decision is made to add the additional 7,000 Soldiers, growth could be complete by end of 2nd quarter, FY2011. We would hold at that end-strength for the requisite 12 months before beginning the 18-month drawdown. Regardless of the decision on the 7,000 Soldier growth we 6 plan to return to the pre-increase end-strength level of 547,400 by the end of FY 2013. Equipping The Army greatly appreciates the tremendous support Congress has provided for our equipping needs, which has allowed deployed Soldiers and Army units to have the equipment needed to accomplish their missions. Because of your interest and support, today the American Soldier is the best equipped combatant in the world. Whatever the mission, from disaster relief in Haiti, to counter insurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, Army Soldiers and units have the latest and most capable military equipment in the world. Training Training is a critical part of Army readiness, and the FY11 budget request reflects our focus to improve home station training, maintain capabilities at the Combat Training Centers (CTC), and continue building the Modular Army in order to set the conditions to achieve balance as future unit dwell times increase. Fiscal year 2011 base OPTEMPO funding supports increased ground miles and increased flying hours. For the Active component, it funds ground OPTEMPO from 545 miles in FY10 to 583 miles in FY11. It funds Air OPTEMPO from 12.0 hours per crew month in FY10 to 12.3 hours in FY11. The FY11 budget also increases available training range days from 184 funded in the FY 10 budget to 216 of 242 required training days and provides additional operations capability for the Training Support Centers that maintain and manage the Training Aids, Devices, Simulations and Simulators (TADSS). 7 The FY 2011 O&amp;M base budget request funds a total of 24 rotations through the Army's Combined Arms Training Centers (CTCs) and two Exportable Training Capability (ETC) events. The CTCs are in the initial phase to transition to Full Spectrum Operations (FSO); we plan to conduct a pilot FSO rotation in FY11. Funding for Army Military and Civilian Leader Development programs remains constant in FY11. The Army sustains support for all the Army Leader Development Strategy initiatives. The Army projects increased enrollment in Professional Military Education programs as dwell time increases in FY12. We will increase resources to reduce the backlog created by years of insufficient dwell time. The Army continues to increase investment in Language Qualification Training and Cultural Awareness Training. Additional funding includes increased Mobile Language Training Teams to support the Language Proficiency Enhancement Program in support of ARFORGEN, and funding for Language Training Detachments and for the Afghanistan/ Pakistan Hands Program. The FY11 budget request funds increases in officer training and accessions. The commissioning mission increases from 5,100 in FY10 to 5,350 in FY11. The request also funds an 11.3 percent increase in enlisted and officer specialized skills training. Reset Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Reset funding has sustained the Army and maintained our operational readiness for the past 8 years. The FY11 O&amp;M OCO budget request includes $7.8 billion to Reset Army equipment. 8 Reset is an essential element of readiness and restoring balance to the Army for known requirements. It is part of the cost of war, and it prepares our Soldiers and their equipment for an unpredictable future and evolving threats. Reset is a necessary process that must continue not only as long as we have forces deployed, but an additional two to three years after major deployments end to ensure future equipment readiness. Reset is especially challenging given the extraordinary wear on vehicles, aircraft, and equipment in the harsh environments our forces operate in today. Coarse sand, fine dust, extreme temperatures, and high OPTEMPO erode sophisticated mechanical and electronic systems at altitudes and loads which near the edge of the aircraft design capabilities. Our rotary wing fleet, for example, operates up to six times non-combat usage levels. Over the past year, our depot-level Maintenance Reset workload exceeded ~100,000 items of equipment; and, we expect to sustain this pace for as long as we have substantial forces deployed. Reset timelines are directly related to the pace of the Iraq drawdown, operational decisions such as the OEF plus-up, available capacity within our industrial base (labor and physical plant capacities and long lead-time parts) and the availability and timing of funding. Given current projections, we would expect our requirements to decrease in the outyears as we complete the retrograde and Reset of equipment from Iraq. Army Prepositioned Stocks Army Prepositioned Stocks (APS) have repeatedly most recently in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) fulfilled their primary purpose of enhancing the Army's strategic agility. In order to restore balance to the Army's strategic readiness posture, it is necessary to --Reset?? these war reserve stocks. The FY 11 budget request funds APS at $400.7M, an increase of $120.9M. This funding will make available three Large Medium Speed Roll-on/Roll-off (LMSR) ships associated with APS Afloat that are currently in reduced operating status. These ships will carry one Sustainment Brigade with a Combat Support Hospital and an Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Additionally, the O&amp;M funding requested in FY11 will partially reconstitute Prepositioned Stocks in Southwest Asia (APS-5); fund reconstitution and Care of Supplies In Storage (COSIS) for an Infantry Battalion with a motorized augmentation set in Afghanistan; and, fund COSIS for existing afloat APS stocks. Transforming our Force The Army is continuously evolving our capabilities to meet current and future strategic demands. We recognize that we must ensure our Nation has the capability and range of military options to meet the evolving challenges we face in the 21st century. As Army Chief of Staff, General George W. Casey, Jr. has stated, &quot;We need an Army that is a versatile mix of tailorable and networked organizations, operating on a rotational cycle, to provide a sustained flow of trained and ready forces for full spectrum operations and to hedge against unexpected contingencies - at a tempo that is predictable and sustainable for our all- volunteer force.&quot; The centerpiece of our efforts is the shift to a modular construct focused at the brigade level, thus creating a more deployable, adaptable, and versatile force. This ongoing transformation has greatly enhanced the Army's ability to respond to any situation, quickly and effectively. However, the degree of impact continues to vary, for example, between Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), --enablers,?? the Reserve components, and individual Soldiers. The FY11 budget request supports increases to integrated management systems for Army Business Operations, enhancing communications systems, personnel systems, and financial readiness. It also funds increases in cyber and network security to enhance computer network defense and protect our information systems from unauthorized access and use. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) request O&amp;M also represents the largest portion of the OCO request, $63.4 billion or 62 percent, and will fund the day-to-day costs of the war, training to prepare units for deployment, force protection, in-theater maintenance and repair, drawdown of equipment from Iraq, and the Reset of Army Prepositioned Stocks and equipment returning from deployment. The OCO portion of the request also includes $628M for the training and sustainment of the temporary wartime increase in personnel - an increase of $242M from FY10. The FY11 OCO request for O&amp;M appropriations is $3.2 billion higher than the FY10 request ($63.4B versus $60.2B). Although the overall deployed force structure will be lower in FY11, the request reflects a full year of OEF operations at the increased force structure level and with significantly higher costs for transportation, in-theater maintenance, and support of new and expanded base camps in Afghanistan. FY 2011 Budget Risks Budget risk Army-wide is projected to be minimal if the $245.6 billion [Budget Request] is appropriated as requested. The Army continues to identify, manage and mitigate risks resulting from changes in assumptions 11 underlying the FY11 budget build, past budget builds, or any unforeseen events. Risk has been identified in the following areas: Sustained Demand Since September 11, 2001, all deploying Army units are trained, led, and equipped to the highest levels prior to deployment. However, due to sustained demand, Army units are achieving this deployment readiness closer and closer to their arrival dates in theater. OCO Funding The Army continues to rely on OCO funding to meet the full scope of training and sustainment of our forces. Personnel Mobilization Assumptions include: no significant new missions; Iraq draw down will proceed on time, and end year at less than 50K end-strength; Afghanistan surge will proceed on time and not increase beyond the planned level; and, Active Duty Operational Support (ADOS) requirement for the Reserve Component will continue to decrease parallel to Iraq draw down. Training The Army continues to accept moderate risk in the base funding of unit training for all components; training at the CTCs due to the execution of Mission Readiness Exercises for deploying units; and funding of the Training Support Systems operations while units remain deployed. Primary risks are in the acceleration of the drawdown in forces ahead of planned timeline; and the availability of OCO to support pre-deployment training for all components and readiness certification and validation during pre- and post-mobilization for the Reserve Components. 12 Base Operations Support Base Operations Support (BOS) resources the Army's installation services worldwide, ensuring an environment in which Soldiers and Families can thrive, and provides a structure that supports a campaign quality, expeditionary Army. The FY11 budget request funds BOS programs at $9.1billion across all components, an increase from FY2010 of $241M. The budget request funds new Army Senior Leadership Initiatives (SLI) to support Soldier/Family well-being at garrison/installation level, to include ACPHP, SHARP; and Contract Security Guards in Europe previously funded with OCO now funded in base. Although the Army has taken risk in BOS, the Army's Installation Management Command (IMCOM) continues to work closely with each installation to ensure its essential BOS needs are met. Earlier this month, the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff, Army, announced the Army's plan to increase BOS funding by $500M in FY10. Additionally, the Army will conduct a comprehensive mid-year review of all BOS accounts to ensure adequate funding is maintained to meet the Army's priorities through the remainder of the fiscal year. The Army's senior leaders anticipate working closely with Congress to make the necessary modifications to the Army's FY11 request as they relate to BOS needs across our installations. In the meantime, we are continuing to look for efficiencies and best practices in the use of BOS funds. You can be assured we will not shortchange Soldiers and their Families in the process. Unknown Risk We recognize that much of the risk we assume depends on minimal projected reductions in demand and corresponding savings; and the absence of unplanned events or a resurgence of tensions in ?hot spots' 13 around the world. If such unforeseen events occur, we will have to make the necessary adjustments, to include reallocation of resources. However, based on the current situation and known risks, we are confident the FY11 O&amp;M budget request, if appropriated in full, would improve the overall readiness of our Force by ensuring the Army is able to properly care for, train, equip and support our Soldiers, Civilians, and Family Members around the world.<br />

As all of you know, it has been a busy time for our Nation's military. We have been at war for the past eight-plus years. With the support of Congress, our forces deployed are the very best manned, equipped, trained and led in the 234-year history of the United States Army. That said, this success has come at the expense of our non-deployed and Generating Forces. The consequence is increased strategic risk to the Nation. The prolonged demand and high operational tempo of this two-front war have undeniably put a strain on the readiness of our Force. Our current readiness is a reflection of the total number of available Soldiers, as well as materiel resources - coupled with time to train. This sum measure of readiness is further impacted by the overall global demand for Army forces. So long as demand exceeds supply, the availability and deployability of Soldiers, units and equipment will be challenged, as will the Army's ability to build trained and ready forces. In particular, heightened, prolonged demand results in periods of degraded readiness for non-deployed forces in order to shift Soldiers and equipment to units preparing to deploy. The Army currently has limited capacity to respond to unforeseen contingencies. However, if demand for Army forces comes down as forecasted and budgetary expectations remain consistent, then we should be able to restore our full operational depth by [fiscal year 2012] FY12.Recognizing this process will be dependent upon a number of factors to include the projected drawdown of forces in Iraq; the continued implementation of the rotational Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) model; and, the continued transition of our Reserve Component(RC) force from a strategic reserve to an operational force, thus allowing the Army recurrent, assured, predictable access to the RC to meet operational requirements IAW ARFORGEN. By FY13, these actions, in part, and the resulting increase in operational depth should enable our Army to mitigate current strategic risk and reliably respond to the full range of potential, unforeseen contingencies. In the meantime, I assure the members of this subcommittee, the Army is doing everything within its control to improve our readiness and restore balance to the Force. Congress remains a vital partner in this shared endeavor.<br />

You make Obama look like a retard—kills heg <br />
Kagan and Kagan, 9 - former prof of military history @ West Point AND military historian (Fredrick W., Kimberly, “Don't Go Wobbly on Afghanistan”, 10/12/2009, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4751:http://www.aei.org/article/101110 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/article/101110" rel="nofollow">http://www.aei.org/article/101110</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4751 -->)<br />
<br />
The Obama administration is not making this decision in a vacuum. Obama ran on a platform that made giving Afghanistan the resources it needed an overriding American priority. President Obama has repeated that commitment many times. He appointed a new commander to execute the policy he enunciated in his March 27 speech, in which he noted: &quot;To focus on the greatest threat to our people, America must no longer deny resources to Afghanistan because of the war in Iraq.&quot; If he now rejects the request of his new commander for forces, his decision will be seen as the abandonment of the president's own commitment to the conflict. In that case, no amount of rhetorical flourish is likely to persuade Afghans, Pakistanis, or anyone else otherwise. A president who overrules the apparently unanimous recommendation of his senior generals and admirals that he make good the resource shortfalls he himself called unacceptable can hardly convince others he is determined to succeed in Afghanistan. And if the United States is not determined to succeed, then, in the language of the region, it is getting ready to cut and run, whatever the president and his advisers may think or say. That is a policy that will indeed have regional effects--extremely dangerous ones. <br />

<br />
&quot;The President is an elected king,&quot; wrote Randolph Bourne nearly a century ago, &quot;but the fact that he is elected has proved to be of far less significance ... than the fact that he is pragmatically a king.&quot; Bourne thereby identified a central truth of modern American politics: Stripped to its essence, our democracy has become an elaborate process of conferring enormous power on a single individual. What we choose to call an inauguration is more accurately a coronation. Nominally a chief executive, the president today occupies a position more akin to that of emperor, and Americans both expect much and demand much of their emperor. To be &quot;the most powerful man in the world&quot; is to be simultaneously worshiped and despised. To occupy the Oval Office is to become the modern-day equivalent of a Sun King, commanding deference, while also becoming the subject of endless gossip, envy, jealousy, and intrigue, all to be reported at length and ad nauseam by Bob Woodward. What lends this arrangement a semblance of legitimacy is the expectation that our president-monarch knows how to wield power effectively. Through the exercise of royal prerogatives, the king demonstrates his worthiness for high office. Should a president demonstrate an absence of mastery — if he comes across as a weakling or a ditherer — profound dysfunction results. Recall the Carter era. Jimmy Carter's inability to resolve the Iran hostage crisis reduced him to a figure of contempt and left Americans with a sense that the country itself was adrift. In short order, they stripped Carter of his crown. Yet presidential weakness — even an inkling of weakness — can have international as well as domestic implications. This is notably the case in matters related to national security. If the occupant of the Oval Office appears less than fully in command, friend and foe alike will wonder who exactly is in charge. Confusion about American priorities and intentions can thereby result. Out of confusion can come miscalculation, as allies revise downward their estimate of American reliability and adversaries persuade themselves that they can get away with mischief. In other words, the implications of weakness extend beyond the who’s up, who’s down preoccupations of garden-variety politics. This confusion describes where we find ourselves today. There is no doubting that President Obama is smart, talented, well intentioned, and smooth as they come. Yet whether he possesses the temperament to govern is fast becoming an open question. Put simply, the question is this: Does Obama have sufficient backbone?<br />

The way in which the United States deals with Afghanistan – its first conflict of the 21st century – will be studied across the globe for any portent of a decline in U.S. power. Will the United States abandon its friends when things get tough? Can the powerful U.S. military be defeated by insurgent extremists fighting a prolonged or irregular war? Is the United States going to play a major role in the resource-rich economies of Central and South Asia, or will it cede the region to other powers and return to a post-Cold War idyll that ignores the region entirely? These questions will be asked by rivals of the United States such as Iran and China as well as by U.S. allies in the region. While perceptions of U.S. power today may prove ephemeral tomorrow, an Internet-savvy, ideologically based jihadist network with global reach and aspirations might leverage a wholesale U.S. disengagement from Afghanistan to fuel a compelling narrative of revolution that would serve as a useful recruiting tool. The second-order effects of the next U.S. choices in Afghanistan should not be underestimated. <br />

Most significantly, Afghanistan has substantial deposits of rare earth minerals, estimated to be worth $7.4 billion. And why is this so important? At present, China has a near monopoly over them. It possesses about 36% of world reserves, by far the biggest share for any nation, and accounts for around 97% of global production. Five years ago Beijing substantially tightened export controls on these minerals. At this moment, officials are building a strategic reserve of them. Last August China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced it would prohibit exports of some heavy rare earth minerals and restrict exports of other rare earths to levels far below current global needs. The complete prohibition may go into effect by 2015. Beijing, unfortunately, is not content to control just its own rare earth resources. The Chinese are buying deposits around the world, including those in the U.S. and Canada. And that brings us back to Afghanistan. Beijing, not surprisingly, has already shown great interest in the resources of its troubled neighbor to the west. In 2007 a Chinese company won the concession to the Aynak copper mine in Afghanistan's Logar province--after paying, according to American officials, a bribe of $30 million to the now-former minister of mines. As the New York Times reports, the Chinese want to buy up even more of Afghanistan's resources. They will surely succeed in exploiting most of the trillion dollars of minerals if the Taliban fighters take back control of the country, as they will if President Obama adheres to his plan to begin withdrawing troops next July. The Taliban, in short, could become a minerals superpower in a few years time. That will surely mean an even larger portion of the world's rare earth deposits will be under Chinese control. Beijing has traditionally maintained strong ties to the Taliban, continuing relations even after Sept. 11. Since that horrible event, for instance, China went through with the sale of a telephone system for Kabul and, after the group's ouster, has supplied it with weapons used against NATO forces. The Pentagon, in September, is scheduled to complete its report identifying “national security risks due to rare earth material dependencies.” Yet we don't have to wait until then to know what it will say. The U.S. is not mining any rare earth minerals at the moment, and there is only one American company with commercially significant deposits of heavy rare earths. It is not entirely clear what defense planners will do when China's export ban on these minerals goes into effect. Rare earth minerals are used in every major weapons system the U.S. fields today, from M1A2 Abrams tanks to Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. There is not a plane in the American inventory that will fly tomorrow without some mineral that is now mined in China. Lasers, radar and missile-guidance systems? Yes, they all require rare earth minerals, as do the military's hard drives. So the stakes just went up in Afghanistan with the release of the information this week. The U.S. has a critical reliance on what is in the ground in that war-torn land. Kabul can undercut Beijing's virtual monopoly on rare earths--or it can help the Chinese tighten their grip over global markets. <br />

In Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Alexander Portnov, a professor specializing in geological and mineral sciences, wrote, “There can be no talk of developing nanotechnology if the country does not produce and use rare elements.” Portnov argues that a country’s extraction, production, and use of rare metals needed for technological innovation are “a precise indicator of its scientific and technical development.”32 It is possible that suitable alternatives to REEs could one day be discovered. In the meantime, however, REEs are critical to many modern technologies. China has recognized the value of REEs for over five decades. While the United States today leads in technological innovation, China’s position in the rare earth industry and its vast reserves and ability to mine and produce them, coupled with its intense research and development efforts, could one day give it a decisive advantage in military-based technologies. The U.S. military must plan for this eventuality and take appropriate actions today if it expects to maintain its lead in military technology. JFQ<br />

This exponential progress in the power of information technology goes back more than a century to the data-processing equipment used in the 1890 census, the first U.S. census to be automated. It has been a smooth -- and highly predictable -- phenomenon despite all the vagaries of history through that period, including two world wars, the Cold War and the Great Depression. I say highly predictable because, thanks to its exponential power, only technology possesses the scale to address the major challenges -- such as energy and the environment, disease and poverty -- confronting society. That, at least, is the major conclusion of a panel, organized by the National Science <br />
Foundation and the National Academy of Engineering, on which I recently participated. Take energy. Today, 70 percent of it comes from fossil fuels, a 19th-century technology. But if we could capture just one ten-thousandth of the sunlight that falls on Earth, we could meet 100 percent of the world's energy needs using this renewable and environmentally friendly source. We can't do that now because solar panels rely on old technology, making them expensive, inefficient, heavy and hard to install. But a new generation of panels based on nanotechnology (which manipulates matter at the level of molecules) is starting to overcome these obstacles. The tipping point at which energy from solar panels will actually be less expensive than fossil fuels is only a few years away. The power we are generating from solar is doubling every two years; at that rate, it will be able to meet all our energy needs within 20 years. Nanotechnology itself is an information technology and therefore subject to what I call the &quot;law of accelerating returns,&quot; a continual doubling of capability about every year. Venture capital groups and high-tech companies are investing billions of dollars in these new renewable energy technologies. I'm confident that the day is close at hand when we will be able to obtain energy from sunlight using nano-engineered solar panels and store it for use on cloudy days in nano-engineered fuel cells for less than it costs to use environmentally damaging fossil fuels. It's important to understand that exponentials seem slow at first. In the mid-1990s, halfway through the Human Genome Project to identify all the genes in human DNA, researchers had succeeded in collecting only 1 percent of the human genome. But the amount of genetic data was doubling every year, and that is actually right on schedule for an exponential progression. The project was slated to take 15 years, and if you double 1 percent seven more times you surpass 100 percent. In fact, the project was finished two years early. This helps explain why people underestimate what is technologically feasible over long periods of time -- they think linearly while the actual course of progress is exponential. We see the same progression with other biological technologies as well. Until just recently, medicine -- like energy -- was not an information technology. This is now changing as scientists begin to understand how biology works as a set of information processes. The approximately 23,000 genes in our cells are basically software programs, and we are making exponential gains in modeling and simulating the information processes that cracking the genome code has unlocked. We also have new tools, likewise just a few years old, that allow us to actually reprogram our biology in the same way that we reprogram our computers. For example, when the fat insulin receptor gene was turned off in mice, they were able to eat ravenously yet remain slim and obtain the health benefits of being slim. They didn't get heart disease or diabetes and lived 20 percent longer. There are now more than a thousand drugs in the pipeline to turn off the genes that promote obesity, heart disease, cancer and other diseases. We can also turn enzymes off and on, and add genes to the body. I'm an adviser to a company that removes lung cells, adds a new gene, reproduces the gene-enhanced cell a million-fold and then injects it back into the body where it returns to the lungs. This has cured a fatal disease, pulmonary hypertension, in animals and is now undergoing human trials. The important point is this: Now that we can model, simulate and reprogram biology just like we can a computer, it will be subject to the law of accelerating returns, a doubling of capability in less than a year. These technologies will be more than a thousand times more capable in a decade, more than a million times more capable in two decades. We are now adding three months every year to human life expectancy, but given the exponential growth of our ability to reprogram biology, this will soon go into high gear. According to my models, 15 years from now we'll be adding more than a year each year to our remaining life expectancy. This is not a guarantee of living forever, but it does mean that the sands of time will start pouring in rather than only pouring out. What's more, this exponential progression of information technology will affect our prosperity as well. The World Bank has reported, for example, that poverty in Asia has been cut in half over the past decade due to information technologies and that at current rates it will be cut by another 90 percent over the next decade. That phenomenon will spread around the globe.<br />

Rare earth elements are key to all missile guidance systems for first-strike capabilities and nuclear primacy <br />

The national defense issues are equally important. Rare earths are critical components for military jet engines, guided missiles and bombs, electrical countermeasures, anti-missile systems, satellite communication systems and armor, yet the U.S. has no domestic sources. Innovation Drives Industry – Industry Carries the Economy Advances in Materials Science are a result of tireless innovation; innovation seeking improvements in the performance and characteristics of material properties or a change in their form or function. Much of this work must eventually translate into commercial and military applications. Today many advances in material science are achieved through the application of rare earth oxides, elements and alloys. This group of elements, also known as the lanthanide series, represents the only known bridge to the next level of improved performance in the material properties for many metallurgical alloys, electrical conductivity, and instrument sensitivity and in some cases a mechanical or physical change in function. These lanthanides hold unique chemical, magnetic, electrical, luminescence and radioactive shielding characteristics. Combined with other elements they can help maintain or alter physical and structural characteristics under changing conditions. Today, these rare earth elements are essential to every computer hard drive, cell phone, energy efficient light bulb, many automotive pollution control devices and catalysts, hybrid automobiles and most, if not all, military guidance systems and advanced armor. Tomorrow, they will be used in ultra capacity wind turbines, magnetic refrigeration, zero emission automobiles, superconductors, sub-light-speed computer processors, nano-particle technologies for material and metallurgical applications, structurally amorphous metals, next generation military armor and TERFENOL-D Radar. America must lead in these developments. The entire U.S. defense system is completely interdependent upon REO enhanced technologies for our most advanced weapons guidance systems, advanced armor, secure communications, radar, advanced radar systems, weapons triggering systems and un-manned Drones. REO dependent weapons technologies are predominantly represented in our ‘first strike’ and un-manned capabilities. This national defense issue is not a case of limited exposure for first-strike capabilities. This first-strike vulnerability translates into risk exposure in every level of our national defense system, as the system is built around our presumptive technological and first-strike superiority. Yet the DoD has abandon its traditional procurement protocols for “strategic and critical” materials and components for weapons systems in favor of “the principles of free trade.”<br />

Less noticed is the continuing modernization of the existing arsenal. The remaining low-yield Minuteman III ICBM warheads will be replaced by the high-yield MX warhead and further augmented by the inclusion of GPS guidance systems. The SLBM force of highly accurate and high-yield D-5 warheads will also benefit from the addition of GPS accuracy and ground-burst capability. Even the bomber force will become armed with stealthy and low-flying cruise missiles – ideal to avoid an adversary’s early warning radar. The nuclear force may indeed be smaller, but it is also becoming more accurate and more lethal, and ideal for disarming counterforce strikes.<br />

Loss of U.S. nuclear primacy causes global nuclear war<br />
Caves 10 (John P, Senior Research Fellow in the Center for the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction at the National Defense University, January, Strategic Forum, No. 252, “Avoiding a Crisis of Confidence in the U.S. Nuclear Deterrent,” da 11/16, mat)<br />
<br />
Perceptions of a compromised U.S. nuclear deterrent as described above would have profound policy implications, particularly if they emerge at a time when a nuclear-armed great power is pursuing a more aggressive strategy toward U.S. allies and partners in its region in a bid to enhance its regional and global clout. A dangerous period of vulnerability would open for the United States and those nations that depend on U.S. protection while the United States attempted to rectify the problems with its nuclear forces. As it would take more than a decade for the United States to produce new nuclear weapons, ensuing events could preclude a return to anything like the status quo ante. The assertive, nuclear-armed great power, and other major adversaries, could be willing to challenge U.S. interests more directly in the expectation that the United States would be less prepared to threaten or deliver a military response that could lead to direct conflict. They will want to keep the United States from reclaiming its earlier power position. Allies and partners who have relied upon explicit or implicit assurances of U.S. nuclear protection as a foundation of their security could lose faith in those assurances. They could compensate by accommodating U.S. rivals, especially in the short term, or acquiring their own nuclear deterrents, which in most cases could be accomplished only over the mid- to long term. A more nuclear world would likely ensue over a period of years. Important U.S. interests could be compromised or abandoned, or a major war could occur as adversaries and/or the United States miscalculate new boundaries of deterrence and provocation. At worst, war could lead to state-on-state employment of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) on a scale far more catastrophic than what nuclear-armed terrorists alone could inflict.<br />

make nuke war impossible <br />

<br />
This second criticism has merit. Nevertheless, the benefits of maintaining effective counterforce capabilities trump the costs. Strong counterforce capabilities should make adversaries expect that escalating a conventional war will lead to a disarming attack, not a cease-fire. Beyond deterrence, these capabilities will provide a more humane means of protecting allies who are threatened by nuclear attack and give U.S. leaders the ability to pursue regime change if an adversary acts in a truly egregious fashion. Moreover, some danger of escalation is unavoidable because the style of U.S. conventional operations will inevitably blind, rattle, and confuse U.S. adversaries. If the United States has powerful counterforce tools, these may dissuade its enemies from escalating in desperate times, and U.S. leaders would have a much more acceptable option if deterrence fails. The nuclear forces the United States builds today must be able to act as a reliable deterrent, even in much darker times. Many of those who recommend a much smaller U.S. nuclear arsenal—and assign little importance to a nuclear counterforce option—fail to consider the great difficulties of maintaining deterrence during conventional wars. The U.S. nuclear arsenal should retain sufficient counterforce capabilities to make adversaries think very carefully before threatening to use, putting on alert, or actually using a nuclear weapon. Any nuclear arsenal should also give U.S. leaders options they can stomach employing in these high-risk crises. Without credible and effective options for responding to attacks on allies or U.S. forces, the United States will have difficulty deterring such attacks. Unless the United States maintains potent counterforce capabilities, U.S. adversaries may conclude—perhaps correctly—that the United States’ strategic position abroad rests largely on a bluff.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, deterrence in the twenty-first century may be far more difficult for the United States than it was in the past, and having the right mix of nuclear capabilities to deal with the new challenges will be crucial. The United States leads a global network of alliances, a position that commits Washington to protecting countries all over the world. Many of its potential adversaries have acquired, or appear to be seeking, nuclear weapons. Unless the world’s major disputes are resolved—for example, on the Korean Peninsula, across the Taiwan Strait, and around the Persian Gulf—or the U.S. military pulls back from these regions, the United States will sooner or later find itself embroiled in conventional wars with nuclear-armed adversaries. Preventing escalation in those circumstances will be far more difficult than peacetime deterrence during the Cold War. In a conventional war, U.S. adversaries would have powerful incentives to brandish or use nuclear weapons because their lives, their families, and the survival of their regimes would be at stake. Therefore, as the United States considers the future of its nuclear arsenal, it should judge its force not against the relatively easy mission of peacetime deterrence but against the demanding mission of deterring escalation during a conventional conflict, when U.S. enemies are fighting for their lives. Debating the future of the U.S. nuclear arsenal is critical now because the Obama administration has pledged to pursue steep cuts in the force and has launched a major review of U.S. nuclear policy. (The results will be reported to Congress in February 2010.) The administration’s desire to shrink the U.S. arsenal is understandable. Although the force is only one-fourth the size it was when the Cold War ended, it still includes roughly 2,200 operational strategic warheads—more than enough to retaliate against any conceivable nuclear attack. Furthermore, as we previously argued in these pages (“The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy,” March/April 2006), the current U.S. arsenal is vastly more capable than its Cold War predecessor, particularly in the area of “counterforce”—the ability to destroy an adversary’s nuclear weapons before they can be used. Simply counting U.S. warheads or measuring Washington’s counterforce capabilities will not, however, reveal what type of arsenal is needed for deterrence in the twenty-first century. The only way to determine that is to work through the grim logic of deterrence: to consider what actions will need to be deterred, what threats will need to be issued, and what capabilities will be needed to back up those threats. The Obama administration is right that the United States can safely cut its nuclear arsenal, but it must pay careful attention to the capabilities it retains. During a war, if a desperate adversary were to use its nuclear force to try to coerce the United States—for example, by threatening a U.S. ally or even by launching nuclear strikes against U.S. overseas bases—an arsenal comprised solely of high-yield weapons would leave U.S. leaders with terrible retaliatory options. Destroying Pyongyang or Tehran in response to a limited strike would be vastly disproportionate, and doing so might trigger further nuclear attacks in return. A deterrent posture based on such a dubious threat would lack credibility. Instead, a credible deterrent should give U.S. leaders a range of retaliatory options, including the ability to respond to nuclear attacks with either conventional or nuclear strikes, to retaliate with strikes against an enemy’s nuclear forces rather than its cities, and to minimize casualties. The foundation for this flexible deterrent exists. The current U.S. arsenal includes a mix of accurate high- and low-yield warheads, offering a wide range of retaliatory options—including the ability to launch precise, very low-casualty nuclear counterforce strikes. The United States must preserve that mix of capabilities—especially the low-yield weapons—as it cuts the size of its nuclear force.<br />

Yet China could keep its dominant grip on the rare-earths industry for some years. It holds 35 percent of global reserves, but supplies over 95 percent of demand for rare-earth oxides, of which 60 percent is domestic, according to Industrial Minerals Company of Australia, a consultancy. Just as important, Chinese companies, many of them state-controlled, have advanced in their quest to make China the world leader in processing rare-earth metals into finished materials. Success in this quest could give China a decisive advantage not just in civilian industry, including clean energy, but also in military production if Chinese manufacturers were given preferential treatment over foreign competitors. Cerium is the most abundant of the 17 rare earths, all of which have similar chemical properties. A cerium-based coating is non-corrosive and has significant military applications. The Pentagon is due to finish a report soon on the risks of US military dependence on rare earths from China. Their use is widespread in the defense systems of the US, its allies, and other countries that buy its weapons and equipment. In a report to the US Congress in April, the Government Accountability Office said that it had been told by officials and defense industry executives that where rare-earth alloys and other materials were used in military systems, they were “responsible for the functionality of the component and would be difficult to replace without losing performance.” For example, fin actuators in precision-guided bombs are specifically designed around the capabilities of neodymium iron boron rare-earth magnets. The main US battle tank, the M1A2 Abrams, has a reference and navigation system that relies on samarium cobalt magnets from China. An official report last year on the US national defense stockpile said that shortages of four rare earths – lanthanum, cerium, europium and gadolinium – had already caused delays in producing some weapons. It recommended further study to determine the severity of the delays.<br />

As stated in the Nano novel, Marlow's Second Paradox is this: &quot;Nanotechnology must never be developed, because it is too dangerous a thing to exist; nanotechnology must be developed-because it is too a dangerous a thing to exist in the hands of others.&quot; The first rationale-Bill Joy's relinquishment option-will be ignored. The second will drive the race for nanosuperiority. The first nanopower will, if it plays its cards right, remain unchallenged for the foreseeable future-assuming there remains a future to foresee. This is so because it will be possible to use the technology itself to prevent all others from deploying it, or to simply annihilate all others. In the entire history of the human race, there has never been such a prize for the taking, and there likely never will be again. We are embarked upon what is quite possibly Mankind's final arms race. Caution may not be a factor, because the losers in the nanorace will exist only at the whim of the winner, and many will see themselves as having nothing to lose, and the world to gain. Consider: China holds third place among nations for nanotech patents. Consider also, from Gannett News Service (February 20, 2000): &quot;Chinese military specialists urge the development of 'magic weapons' that Would allow an 'inferior to defeat a superior enemy.' The report quotes General Pan Jungfeng as calling the United States 'the enemy.' &quot; Draw your own conclusions. Given this situation, these facts, the occasional incompetence of governments and of militaries in particular, and human nature itself-the earth may well be doomed.

b) Nuclear primacy <br />
Craig 9 – Professor of International Relations at the University of Southampton (Campbell, Review of International Studies, “American power preponderance and the nuclear revolution,” 35, 27–44, Cambridge Database)<br />
<br />
As Keir Lieber and Daryl Press have suggested, the US may be on the verge of acquiring a first-strike nuclear capability, which, combined with an effective system of anti-ballistic missile defence, could allow the US to destroy a rival’s nuclear capabilities and intercept any remaining retaliatory missiles before they hit American cities. While this possibility clearly reduces the likelihood of other states seeking to match American power with the aim of fighting and winning a nuclear war, and, if their argument becomes widely accepted, could lead American policy-makers to reject the logic of the nuclear revolution and consider pre-emptive nuclear strikes against large nuclear rivals, it clearly is less germane to the question of small-state deterrence.33 Lieber and Press contend that the US may have the capability to destroy the entire nuclear arsenal of another large nuclear state lest that state use it on America first for the purposes of winning a great war. That, as they say, would mean the end of Mutual Assured Destruction as it existed during the Cold War. However, Washington would have much less reason to use its new first-strike capability against a nation that cannot threaten to destroy the US, and has no ambition to defeat America in a war, but only possesses a second-strike minimum deterrent. Such an attack would turn much of the world against a US willing to use nuclear weapons and kill hundreds of thousands or millions in order to defeat a nation that did not threaten its survival. Perhaps more to the point, an attack like this would be tremendously risky. Even after a perfect first strike some retaliation might get through, which could mean the nuclear destruction of an American city or perhaps the city of an American ally. At the very least, survivors of the attacked state and their allies would seek to unleash destruction upon the US in other ways, including an unconventional delivery of a nuclear, chemical, or biological weapon. An imperfect first strike, or, even worse, a failure of the US anti-missile system, would constitute a total disaster for the US: not only would it incur the world’s wrath and suffer the destruction of one or more of its cities, but such a failure would also expose America as both a brutal and vulnerable state, surely encouraging other states to acquire nuclear weapons or otherwise defy it. The US might have reason to launch a first strike against a large rival that deployed a major arsenal and appeared ready to attack America, as implausible as this scenario is. It would have little reason to do so against a small nation with a second-strike minimum deterrent arsenal. The nuclear revolution delivers a clear message to any large state considering major war with a powerful nuclear rival. The message is that such a war is likely to escalate to total nuclear exchange, and that in this event a large percentage of its citizenry will be killed or injured, its ability to govern what remains of the nation will be weakened or destroyed, and its power relative to other states that stayed out of the war will be radically diminished. It also delivers a message to any advanced small state eager to obtain security from the possible predation of large ones. The message is that if the small state possesses, or can quickly get its hands on, a few invulnerable and deliverable nuclear weapons, any large state contemplating invading it will have to weigh the benefits of invasion against a new kind of cost – not just a difficult or stalemated conventional war, such as the US faced in Vietnam and faces in Iraq, but the destruction of perhaps one, three, or five of its cities, and the death and injury of millions of its citizens. Unless it is able to obtain an absolutely fool-proof defence against any kind of nuclear retaliation, the choice that any large state is going to make when faced with this new circumstance is so likely to be peace that the small nuclear state can feel confident that it will be safe from conquest.34 The general relevance of these messages to American unipolar preponderance is clear. At the ‘great power’ level, rising states are unlikely to regard major war as a suitable means for overturning the international system and overthrowing American preponderance. The classic means of systemic change – hegemonic war – will not be an attractive option to any state hoping to survive, and the very existence of nuclear arsenals will make all states cautious about provoking conflict with nuclear rivals, especially the heavily armed US.35 Moreover, advanced smaller states know that they can provide for their own security, if they come to believe that it is endangered, not by embarking on large military build-ups or forming alliances with larger states, but by developing a small and invulnerable nuclear arsenal, or at least preparing the way to obtain such an arsenal quickly. This means that small states have a far greater ability to defend themselves from, and therefore be less afraid of, American predation today than comparable states facing dominant powers in previous eras.36 The main effects of the nuclear revolution, then, bolster the general claim of Power Preponderance that unipolarity is enduring. To support their claim, Brooks and Wohlforth specify three factors that dissuade would-be rivals to the US from balancing against it in traditional military terms: the effect of America’s relative geographical isolation from these potential rivals; the fact that American preponderance happened as a fait accompli about which no other nation could do anything; and the vast and growing ‘power gap’ between the US and all other rivals. The next section will describe each factor, and show how the nuclear revolution specifically reinforces each of them. <br />

The United States of course faced great challenges to its security and economy in the past, most obviously from Germany and Japan in the first half of the twentieth century and from the Soviet Union in the second half. Crucial to America’s ability to prevail over these past challenges was our technological and industrial leadership, and especially our ability to continuously recreate it. Indeed, the United States has been unique among great powers in its ability to keep on creating and recreating new technologies and new industries, generation after generation. Perpetual innovation and technological leadership might even be said to be the American way of maintaining primacy in world affairs. They are almost certainly what America will have to pursue in order to prevail over the contemporary challenges involving economic competitiveness and energy dependence. <br />

Moreover, as suggested above, as more nations seek or attain nuclear status, we may very well be entering an era in which nuclear “non-use” is ending. This means that the risk of deterrence failures is growing, and with it questions about the ability of the United States to control the escalation chain in a crisis situation. During the Cold War, escalation dominance was presumed to lie with the United States, or at least that it could be managed in the U.S.-Soviet context because the stakes of escalation were such that both states were putatively deterred from nuclear weapons use (against the other). Today, however, the same may not be true with respect to North Korea and Iran, let alone in the context of a Taiwan contingency, or with respect to India and Pakistan in a crisis over Kashmir. Deterrence failures in the regional context may result from an accident, a deliberate calculation, or the intervention of a third party (e.g., Israel or Taiwan) in a crisis contingency. However, regardless of their origins, the consequences might very well be an escalatory exchange that ultimately draws the United States into a regional nuclear conflict. Compound Escalation and Catalytic Warfare: Key Considerations in U.S. Deterrence Planning Without a doubt, deterrence planning is destined to be more complex in the 21st century and to involve numerous players. As such, it may increasingly entail considerations related to compound escalation, which involves the manipulation of seemingly unrelated issues to raise the stakes for an adversary, or catalytic warfare, a term first coined by the late deterrence theorist Dr. Herman Kahn to refer to the “notion that some third party or nation might for its own reasons deliberately start a war between two major powers.”3 According to Kahn, “the widespread diffusion of nuclear weapons would make many nations able, and in some cases also create the pressure, to aggravate an on-going crisis, or even touch off a war between two other powers for purposes of their own.”4 Israel, for example, perceiving an existential threat from Iran, could instigate military action, whereupon Iran, in turn, might retaliate against Israel and broaden the conflict to attack U.S. interests in the region or even America itself, using Hezbollah assets or possibly its own long-range missiles armed with nuclear weapons. Without overstating the likelihood for catalytic warfare along these lines, other possibilities could include contingencies tied to the India-Pakistan rivalry or to cross-strait tensions between China and Taiwan. Each of these cases suggests, moreover, that escalation dominance can no longer be presumed to reside with the United States, as regional actors look to nuclear weapons and/or contemplate their acquisition to provide an asymmetric capability for use against a “regional aggressor” or against the superior (conventional) forces of the United States. For this reason, the art of managing third party expectations and options in a crisis is destined to become a more important aspect of U.S. deterrence planning, and it will require new approaches to reassuring allies and with respect to “signaling” our strategic intent and interests to real and potential adversaries. In this context, there is no question of the need for more innovative thinking on how best to counter Iran’s future capacity to implement a strategy of compound escalation by using nuclear weapons first in a conventional warfare scenario, by widening the scope of violence to target U.S. coalition partners in the region, or by relying on proxy forces using irregular warfare (IW) tactics and strategies. In terms of escalation management, the challenges that a nuclear Iran or an Iran on the brink of acquiring a nuclear capability would present are numerous and complex. The same is true of North Korea, which might decide to use nuclear weapons first in a variety of crisis scenarios. In both instances, however, deterring an adversary from attacking the United States directly may have a better chance of success than efforts to deter it from using nuclear weapons or other WMD against our allies. The obvious purpose of extended deterrence is to reinforce the belief in the mind of the adversary that an attack on an ally is tantamount to an attack on the United States. If the United States and the ally became less vulnerable to attack because of a deterrence strategy based on denial, extended deterrence inevitably would be strengthened. Thus, while deterring an enemy attack against the United States itself must remain a central focus of U.S. deterrence planning, other considerations, including the need to dissuade leaderships from taking proliferation decisions in the first place and to reassure anxious allies and coalition partners, remain crucially important elements in U.S. deterrence planning as well, and underscore the particular need for a strategic defense component, composed of active and passive defensive measures and technologies.<br />

Seaman 10 – John Seaman, Fellow in the Center for Asian Studies at the French Institute of International Relations, September 2010, “Rare Earths and Clean Energy: Analyzing China's Upper Hand,” online: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4763:http://www.ifri.org/?page=contribution-detail&amp;id=6204&amp;id_provenance=103&amp;provenance_context_id=4 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ifri.org/?page=contribution-detail&amp;id=6204&amp;id_provenance=103&amp;provenance_context_id=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.ifri.org/?page=contribution-detail&amp;id=6204&amp;id_provenance=103&amp;provenance_context_id=4</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4763 --><br />
<br />
The world is in the midst of a blossoming &quot;clean energy&quot; transformation. Since 2005, global investments in clean energy have grown by more than 230%, with worldwide investment in 2009 totaling more than $162 billion. Projections for 2010 show that these investments could increase by 25%, reaching roughly $200 billion by the year's end.1 The recent craze for &quot;green growth&quot; among many of the world's most advanced economies is not only meant to respond to the threat of global climate change and reduce dependence on fossil fuels, but to revitalize local and national economies by creating new opportunities for growth and &quot;green jobs&quot;. But international competition over who will reap the benefits of this new growth is mounting. For many, the home-grown development of the host of technologies necessary for the clean energy transformation is already challenging enough. High costs, public apathy and misguided political interference are complicating what is already an unprecedented technical challenge. But beyond the public eye there is the potential for another challenge to low carbon technologies in the form of an ominous resource crunch in the so-called &quot;rare earth elements&quot;. There are many commercial, strategic and geopolitical dimensions to this issue that need a higher quality public debate to ensure they are adequately reflected in our strategies for a sustainable energy future. As explained further in the first part of this paper, rare earths are an increasingly strategic grouping of raw metals that are included in a broad range of cutting edge technologies including but not limited to energy-related technologies such as for windmills, hybrid or electric vehicles, and energy-saving light bulbs. Demand for these technologies, and therefore the essential rare earth elements, has and will likely continue to increase dramatically. But ensuring economically attractive access to supplies of these elements is no simple task, and many experts agree that the world is rapidly heading for an acute shortage of processed rare earths largely because of underinvestment, but geopolitics may also come into play. Since the mid-1980s China, which holds 37% of the world's current proven, accessible rare earth reserves, has progressively gained a near monopoly on the mining and separation of these elements down to their oxide form. China now controls 97% of the global market for rare earth oxides (REO) largely because other resource holders have scaled down their activities or failed to make the investments necessary. As analyzed in the second part of this paper, China has recently initiated a series of reform measures that will have consequences for the global supply of REO. Of chief concern to the rest of the world is China's policy on limiting exports of these oxides. In early July 2010. China's Ministry of Commerce announced that REO export quotas in the second half of the year would be slashed by 72% in relation to the second half of 2009. This dramatic reductio n came as a shock to many of the industry's top experts, who had expected at most only a quarter of the announced reduction. This action raises the question of global shortages for these key elements in the much more immediate future.<br />

Nonetheless, it concluded that Afghanistan might “be transformed into one of the most important mining centers in the world.” This bonanza is safely in the hands of the US military and major transnational corporations, the Times explained. “International accounting firms” are consulting with the Afghan Ministry of Mines to prepare technical data “to turn over to multinational mining companies and other potential foreign investors. The Pentagon is helping Afghan officials arrange to start seeking bids on mineral rights by next fall, officials said.” Under-Secretary of Defense Paul Brinkley told the Times: “The Ministry of Mines is not ready to handle this. We are trying to help them to get ready.” The claim that the Pentagon is “helping” the Ministry of Mines is a lie. In fact, the Ministry of Mines is apparently being kept in the dark about the contents of the survey. Contacted yesterday by Bloomberg News to obtain a statement on the Times report, Deputy Mines Minister Abdul Qudus Hamidi said the Ministry of Mines could not “comment until it receives a copy of the survey.” More broadly, the Pentagon is mainly interested in “helping” the Ministry of Mines decide who will get Afghanistan’s riches. US officials and the Times both made clear that Chinese mining firms are not acceptable buyers. The Times wrote: “Just last year, Afghanistan’s minister of mines [Muhammad Ibrahim Adel] was accused by American officials of accepting a $30 million bribe to award China the rights to develop its [Aynak] copper mine. The minister has since been replaced. … American officials fear resource-hungry China will try to dominate the development of Afghanistan’s mineral wealth, which could upset the United States.” Such statements suggest some of the broader geopolitical interests motivating Washington’s occupation of Afghanistan. In the struggle to grab Afghanistan’s raw materials and cheap labor and deny them to its rivals, Washington intends to fully exercise its one main advantage: it has more boots on the ground than its rivals. This February, after Adel was forced out over the Aynak license, Kabul canceled bidding on the massive Hajigak iron mine. Business Week explained, “Indian and Chinese companies eager to tie up resources for the world’s two fastest-growing major economies had sought the Hajigak deposit … China has wrestled with the world’s main iron ore suppliers—Brazil’s Vale SA, London- based Rio Tinto Plc and Australia’s BHP Billiton Ltd—in an attempt to circumvent rising global prices.” Iron ore prices have skyrocketed as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, and Vale have succeeded in bidding up prices in recent years, since the main importer of iron ore—China—is completely dependent on their supplies. They demanded 90-100 percent price increases for iron ore this spring, after several years of comparable price increases. Xinhua reported that Chinese steel firms would pay $110-$120 per ton of imported iron ore, compared to $62 per ton last year. Nor is the iron ore market the only one in which control of Afghan mines might prove decisive. The Times’ article yesterday reported that deposits of lithium—an essential material for laptop and smart-phone batteries—in Afghanistan’s Ghazni province alone could rival those of Bolivia, which currently has the world’s largest reserves. The Times cited an internal Pentagon memo describing Afghanistan as the “Saudi Arabia of lithium,” that is, a country whose production (of oil, in the Saudi case) would determine world market prices. A frank exposition of how US wars benefit parasitic corporate and financial interests would provoke mass outrage, in the US and abroad. As a result, the Times ludicrously presented Washington’s interest in Afghan mineral wealth as the product of the lucky work of a few isolated US geologists, who arrived in Afghanistan in 2004. Having “stumbled across an intriguing series of old charts” in Afghan libraries, they commandeered an “old Navy Orion P-3 aircraft” that—in a fit of absent-mindedness, perhaps?—had been fitted with “advanced gravity and magnetic measuring equipment.” Having flown over “70 percent of the country,” they produced a report noting that they had discovered “astonishing” mineral wealth, and returned with a more sophisticated British aircraft for further exploration in 2007. Their work, according to the Times, then “gathered dust” for two years in US offices. In fact the US government was well aware, as it invaded Afghanistan, that it was invading a country with vast mineral riches. Despite the Times’ deceptive presentation of the matter, its account objectively shows that US and NATO officials have been carefully studying and documenting these resources for years, as the war progressed. As for the Times’ absurd presentation, US documents show that Washington has long been aware of Afghanistan’s riches. <br />

But last night Jawad Omar, a senior official at the ministry, insisted: &quot;The natural resources of Afghanistan will play a magnificent role in Afghanistan's economic growth. The past five decades have shown that every time new research takes place, it shows our natural reserves are far more than what was previously found. This is a cause for rejoicing, nothing to worry about.&quot; According to The New York Times, the US Geological Survey flew sorties to map Afghanistan's mineral resources in 2007, using an old British bomber equipped with instruments that offered a 3-D profile of deposits below the surface. It was when a Pentagon task force – charged with formulating business development programmes and helping the Afghan government develop relationships with international firms – came upon the geological data in 2009, that the process of calculating the economic values began. &quot;This really is part and parcel of General [Stanley] McChrystal's counter-insurgency strategy,&quot; Colonel Lapan said yesterday. &quot;This is that whole economic arm that we talk about but gets very little attention.&quot;<br />

While the U.S. military has focused on the Taliban's southern strongholds, the militants and allied groups have been gaining ground in the north. The difficulties in Baghlan are emblematic of the uphill battle the United States and its allies face in trying to stabilize Afghanistan enough to begin drawing down troops next year. The smaller NATO units that operate in the north are under restrictions driven by opposition to the war at home. &quot;Insurgency is a naturally lazy animal,&quot; said an ISAF intelligence official who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly. &quot;Like water and electricity, it goes wherever there are the least amounts of resistance.&quot;<br />

Six major districts in southern Uruzgan province are under control of the ANSF. Most of these districts were under the control of the Taliban for the past five years prior to these combined operations of ANSF and NATO. In the region the security affairs were carried out through Dutch and Australian forces, but now all of the 1050 Dutch forces have been out of Afghanistan since the past five months and being replaced by U.S. forces. The US military forces have launched operations along with Afghan National Security Forces in Urozgan several months ago. Just recently U.S. forces and ANSF took control of the Geezab, Dehrawat and Chaharcheno districts. Most of the main roads leading to these districts were blocked as result of the security conditions since the past several years. Uruzgan Police Chief Jumah Gull Hemath admits that these operations have helped tremendously. According to Mr. Hemath the operations are results of direct coordination between U.S. and Afghan National Security Forces, as result we have better security and more districts under ANSF control. “Throughout the most intense operations especially in the past two months, we have taken almost all of Urozgan districts previously under the insurgents’ control. Now the security is tightened, and Urozgan residents can now live in much better security conditions and peace of mind”. U.S. and ANSF are in constant contact with the residents and are seeking solidarity as well as consulting and coordination with the districts residents regarding their needs and priorities on the ground so that development projects are put to work according to the residents need and with their direct assistance and guidance. Provincial council chief of Uruzgan province Amanullah Hotaki says although there are still some security problems in the region, but in most areas of the province security is better. <br />

On my previous visits to Zabul in November 2009 and April 2010, we would have had to go with a company of American maneuver troops in Humvees. This is Afghanistan’s second-poorest province, where the Taliban’s roots are deep. And while today’s trip takes three hours each way, a year ago it might have taken days, depending on how many IEDs were discovered and how many exploded. In November 2009, there were weekly suicide attacks in Zabul’s biggest town, Shajoy (population 40,000). There hasn’t been one since May. The mobile phone towers used to be shut down by Taliban decree from sunset to sunrise; now they’re open. The point of our trip is practical: to show Afghans that the road has been cleared of Taliban and is open for business. Veres—a tall, skinny recreational mountaineer with 65 marathons and ultramarathons under his belt—counts every commercial vehicle we pass along the way up to Arghandab. “Maybe there were 12 cars today. But as people learn the road is open, this will give them the opportunity to take their crops to market in Qalat.” There are now about 50 miles of paved road in Zabul besides the national ringroad, Highway One; there were none in 2007. Veres’s remark echoes the results of a recent survey of 1,000 southern Afghan men by ICOS. They cited the main contribution of foreigners to Afghanistan as roads (74 percent), schools (53 percent), jobs (21 percent), and elections (9 percent), while only 1 percent said “removing the Taliban.” The 60 or so Pashtun elders we meet in Arghandab are, according to the local Afghan National Army commander, all illiterate. The blanket and shawl distribution funded by the Americans is a big deal; the local bazaar has only two shops, one a butcher shop without any meat. The struggle for places like Arghandab isn’t easy. But Zabul seems to be on an upward path. One reason is the growing competence of the Afghan National Army here. The notoriously intractable police are also coming along. Imaginative programs have been pushed through by a series of good American commanders. A self-defense initiative by former Zabul commander Lieutenant Colonel David Oclander rewards Shajoy men who sign up to police the bazaar with $1,200 bonuses to start a business or join the security forces permanently. Veres—who also served as PRT commander here from June 2009 to March 2010—started a program that places Zabul high school graduates in provincial ministries on internships to help the under-educated directors do their jobs better. He’s part of the Afghan Hands program that aims at creating area experts in our military. Another factor is the near-doubling of foreign troop strength in Zabul over the last 12 months. In June, 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment under Colonel James R. Blackburn arrived in Zabul, joining two Romanian battalions. While the Romanians train the Afghan National Army and protect Highway One, the Stryker battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Omar Jones is responsible for the more dangerous outlying areas. <br />

U.S. troops and Afghan security forces serving in eastern Afghanistan are displacing the Taliban, making room for economic growth and governance, a task force commander serving in the area said today. Army Col. Andrew Poppas, commander of Task Force Bastogne and the 101st Airborne Division’s 1st Brigade Combat Team, briefed Pentagon reporters during a video teleconference from his headquarters at Forward Operating Base Fenty in Jalalabad, the capital of Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province. Task Force Bastogne conducts combined aggressive operations throughout its area of operation with the Afghan army, the border police and the national police, Poppas said. “Kinetic operations tend to overshadow the herculean efforts that are being made to establish long-term stability through governance and development,” the colonel said. Poppas’ 3,800-soldier brigade deployed to Afghanistan in May. The brigade’s mission is to fight insurgents and bolster governance and development in Nangarhar, Kunar and Nuristan provinces. Integrated into the task force plan are two provincial reconstruction teams, three agribusiness development teams and 10 district support teams, “all of which have been able to make demonstrable progress in over 40 districts and municipalities” in the three provinces, Poppas said. The colonel described positive achievements in 2010 in district and provincial governance and in economic development, including success at the “Torkham Gate.” Torkham -- a border town in Nangarhar linked by a highway with Jalalabad to the west and Peshawar to the east -- is the busiest port of entry between Afghanistan and Pakistan, said Poppas, noting that it forms an economic corridor that runs through Jalalabad and all the way to the Afghan capital of Kabul. “Revenue has come through the gate,” he said. “We've seen an increase in economic development [in] the area that runs through Jalalabad and then up toward Asadabad.” Agribusiness has increased exponentially, he added. Governance has progressed, Poppas said, with activities such as court trials and conflict resolution that promote the rule of law and reassure local populations about the reliability of provincial and, more recently, district legal authorities and government officials. Evidence of strengthened governance also comes from the development and stewardship of a central government budget that provides budgetary guidelines for provinces and districts, the colonel said. “I've already seen [such progress] within six months,” Poppas said, “and as we continue our operations under this umbrella of security that we're providing, along with our [Afghan security forces] brothers, you'll continue to see that development and governance progress.” <br />

Progress across the country remains uneven, with modest gains in security, governance, and development in operational priority areas. The deliberate application of our strategy is beginning to have cumulative effects and security is slowly beginning to expand. Although significant challenges exist, some signs of progress are evident. Areas of security in Kabul and the surrounding districts have allowed for improvements in development and governance. Progress is also visible in areas where Coalition forces have been on the ground for more than six months, such as Central Helmand Province. Socio-economic development throughout the country is slowly improving, as the Afghan Government shows initial signs of improving essential service delivery, although it is limited still by the security environment in some areas. Agricultural development and productivity has also improved. Overall governance and development progress continues to lag security gains. Governance capacity and economic development are long-term efforts that will require sustained support from the international community. Key strategic events during this period included the U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Dialogue in May, the National Consultative Peace Jirga in June, the Kabul Conference in July, and the Afghan Parliamentary elections in September. This period also saw the arrival of U.S. uplift forces in theater, along with more than three-fourths of the pledged North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) uplift forces and remarkable growth of Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) by about one third since November 2009. This period included several important political developments including President Hamid Karzai’s approval of the Peace and Reintegration Program (APRP), a Presidential decree establishing the Afghan Local Police (ALP), the signing of the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement, and the establishment of the Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal (“transition”) Board (JANIB). The increase in violence during this period was concurrent with the arrival of Coalition personnel, the dramatically accelerated pace of operations, and the spike of violence often seen on election day. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) is seeing some early indications that comprehensive counterinsurgency operations are having localized positive effects and are producing initial signs of progress. Indications of local resistance to insurgents continue to emerge alongside positive indications, such as newly opened schools and police stations. ISAF and ANSF forces gradually are pushing insurgents to the edges of secured population areas, in a number of important locations. The Afghan Government and ISAF continue to face a resilient enemy that exploits governance gaps and continues to fight to retain long-standing sanctuaries where the insurgency historically has had strong roots. Yet, the insurgent-generated violence remains largely localized and does not threaten all of Afghanistan: 45 percent of all violence and two-thirds of all improvised explosive device (IED) activity take place in the south.1 After taking command as Commander ISAF (COMISAF) and Commander U.S. Forces-Afghanistan (COMUSFOR-A) on July 4, 2010, General Petraeus issued a revised Tactical Directive. This directive provides guidance and intent for the employment of force. In addition, General Petraeus issued refined counterinsurgency (COIN) guidance to reinforce the principles of conducting COIN operations in Afghanistan, and new COIN contracting guidance to reinforce that contracting is “commanders’ business” and that commanders must understand the effects of contract spending. The ISAF operational main effort is focused on protecting the most threatened population in the heart of the Taliban-led insurgency in Helmand and Kandahar Provinces. The split of Regional Command-South (RC-S) and Regional Command-Southwest (RC-SW) on June 14, 2010 has allowed for more effective and streamlined command and control and improved ANSF partnering in both provinces. Comprehensive civil-military efforts in RC-S and RC-SW are making slow but steady progress. Initial signs of this progress are evident especially in Central Helmand, where ISAF and ANSF have been conducting counterinsurgency operations for over a year. Despite the enemy’s continued efforts to counter coalition and ANSF actions to expand security in the south, slow and incremental gains are being achieved. Six months ago, Marjah was an insurgent command-and-control center, a base for IED assembling, and a nexus for illegal narcotics industry activities. Now the city is controlled by the Afghan Government. Signs of progress in Marjah include voter registration, increased activity in local marketplaces, and the reopening of schools that were closed for several years. Combined ISAF and ANSF Forces in Regional Command-Capital (RC-C) continued to sustain a relatively secure environment for the people of Kabul and the surrounding districts, where approximately one-sixth of all Afghans live. Combined Afghan security forces in Kabul performed notably well in the planning and the execution of security for the Peace Jirga and the Kabul Conference, as well as during Parliamentary elections. Indeed, the transition of key security functions and responsibilities already occurring in RC-C is similar to that which is envisioned to occur across the country in the coming years. In the coming months, ISAF will focus on expanding security from Kabul into surrounding provinces, particularly in Regional Command-East (RC-E). ISAF operations in RC-E have continued to apply pressure and disrupt the leadership of the Haqqani and Taliban Networks. Combined forces in RC-E are securing critical lines of communication and infrastructure that supports the commerce to and from Pakistan. Efforts in RC-E will further increase the pressure on some of Afghanistan’s most lethal enemy networks, expand population security from Kabul to key population centers in Wardak and Logar, neutralize the Haqqani Network’s footholds and disrupt its access to Kabul, and secure the main economic border crossing point at Torkham. <br />

Despite 2010 being the worst year for Nato fatalities, with 705 dead, the casualty rate in the last six months has dropped – and this with the &quot;surge&quot; of an extra 30,000 American troops. In the British sector of central Helmand, the number of deaths since July has fallen to 38, compared with 76 in the same period last year. Commanders are understandably reticent about trumpeting success in Helmand but they are getting close enough to whisper phrases such as &quot;irreversible gains&quot; and &quot;unstoppable momentum&quot;. They also mention &quot;virtuous circles&quot;, one of which will become apparent in early spring with the next poppy harvest. If it is like last year's low yield – due in part to the farmers' fear of eradication, which led them to harvest too early – then there will be less money for the insurgents. That means fewer guns, bombs and hired foot-soldiers, which in turn means a less cowed population who will be more inclined to believe Nato's promises of security. Helmand now has 30,000 troops where there were just 3,000 in 2006. This means that ground being taken is being held. A single platoon can now guard a village of 800; soldiers and villagers will get to know each other's faces and names, bonds are built and the locals point out where bombs have been hidden or inform when outsiders appear. <br />

If everything goes as planned, Campbell hopes to start transitioning broad swaths of the provinces of Bamiyan, Panjshir, and Parwan to Afghan government control later this year. The three provinces are among the quietest parts of eastern Afghanistan, and have generally been spared the widespread violence that has wracked nearby provinces like Kunar and Paktika. <br />

The commander of the last combat brigade deployed to Afghanistan as part of the troop surge reports that from his vantage point the multipronged counterinsurgency strategy is working. Army Col. Sean M. Jenkins, commander of the 101st Airborne Division's 4th Brigade Combat Team, told reporters here via videoconference he's seeing encouraging signs of progress in the remote but strategically important Paktika province. Paktika province is beset by challenges that include poverty, illiteracy, lack of critical infrastructure and a shared border with Pakistan that gives insurgents access into Afghanistan. However, Jenkins said he has witnessed positive trend lines on a variety of fronts during the two months since he assumed command of his sprawling operating area within Regional Command East. The Afghan military and police forces his &quot;Currahee&quot; brigade soldiers partner with are gaining capability and professionalism, Jenkins said. And, he said, a new, charismatic governor is generating excitement about possibilities for the province and the broader Afghanistan. Development, which has come slower to Paktika than to more accessible parts of Afghanistan, is picking up. Meanwhile, the colonel cited what he called &quot;oil spots of security&quot; –- areas of the province where the population is aligning itself with the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. <br />

The existence of rare earth elements in Afghanistan has been known since the 1970s. Among the rare earth elements found in the country are beryllium and lithium. Beryllium's traditional application is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. However, because the radioactive metal burns cooler and allows more energy to be extracted, beryllium is quickly becoming the most sought after fuel for nuclear power plants. Wealth Daily's resident alternative energy expert, Jeff Siegel, details the exciting new nuclear applications for beryllium in his latest report, The Most Profitable Nuclear Advancement in 50 Years. Check out Jeff's report right here. There is only a handful of places in the world to find beryllium. A total of approximately 10 beryllium occurrences have been identified in Afghanistan's Laghman and Nangarhar provinces.<br />

TGR: You liked uranium early this year when we talked with you. You’d been investing in uranium stocks since 2001, when uranium was trading at a record low of $7 a pound, and said—at the time—that powerful supply-and-demand fundamentals would support a higher uranium price. You also talked about the inevitability of the nuclear renaissance. You were really big on uranium and, in fact, at that point you’d unloaded a bunch of uranium at a really high price. Now that the commodities are all shaking out, do you still see uranium as a potential good investment and, if so, why? JP: It’s very interesting that uranium, which led the energy complex on the way down, is now starting to rebound. The uranium price certainly appears to have bottomed. A lot of the uranium mines, which were for years touted as an important source of new production, are proving to be total disappointments. The billions of dollars raised by so-called uranium companies during the uranium bubble will result in very few additional pounds of production.<br />

TGR: You talked before about the importance of beryllium for certain critical components inside nuclear reactors, because of a combination of physical properties—lightweight, strong, a high melting point, efficiency as a heat conductor, resistance to corrosion and a tendency to not absorb radiation. It's lightweight, strong, and resistant to corrosion. Could you update us on the outlook for beryllium now? JP: One of the most interesting potential applications of beryllium is in mixed oxide fuel technology. Purdue University is a world leader in mixed uranium oxide fuel research. A small company has licensed uranium-beryllium mix oxide fuel technology from Purdue University and is now collaborating with Purdue to commercialize the technology. Beryllium-uranium mixed oxide fuel, which could work in existing nuclear reactors, has the potential to dramatically reduce the need for uranium and also to improve the safety profile of nuclear reactors. There’s no substitute because of the unique thermal characteristics of beryllium. This technology has the potential to transform the economics and political acceptability of nuclear power. Aside from this potential application, beryllium is used in certain critical nuclear reactor components and therefore an interesting play on nuclear power plant construction. The technology could help ease the uranium shortage. There are some efforts required to complete research, but I have a strong degree of confidence in its commercial prospects. <br />

<br />
What makes global warming so serious and so urgent is that the great Earth system, Gaia, is trapped in a vicious circle of positive feedback. Extra heat from any source, whether from greenhouse gases, the disappearance of Arctic ice or the Amazon forest, is amplified, and its effects are more than additive. It is almost as if we had lit a fire to keep warm, and failed to notice, as we piled on fuel, that the fire was out of control and the furniture had ignited. When that happens, little time is left to put out the fire before it consumes the house. Global warming, like a fire, is accelerating and almost no time is left to act. So what should we do? We can just continue to enjoy a warmer 21st century while it lasts, and make cosmetic attempts, such as the Kyoto Treaty, to hide the political embarrassment of global warming, and this is what I fear will happen in much of the world. When, in the 18th century, only one billion people lived on Earth, their impact was small enough for it not to matter what energy source they used. But with six billion, and growing, few options remain; we can not continue drawing energy from fossil fuels and there is no chance that the renewables, wind, tide and water power can provide enough energy and in time. If we had 50 years or more we might make these our main sources. But we do not have 50 years; the Earth is already so disabled by the insidious poison of greenhouse gases that even if we stop all fossil fuel burning immediately, the consequences of what we have already done will last for 1,000 years. Every year that we continue burning carbon makes it worse for our descendants and for civilisation. Worse still, if we burn crops grown for fuel this could hasten our decline. Agriculture already uses too much of the land needed by the Earth to regulate its climate and chemistry. A car consumes 10 to 30 times as much carbon as its driver; imagine the extra farmland required to feed the appetite of cars. By all means, let us use the small input from renewables sensibly, but only one immediately available source does not cause global warming and that is nuclear energy. True, burning natural gas instead of coal or oil releases only half as much carbon dioxide, but unburnt gas is 25 times as potent a greenhouse agent as is carbon dioxide. Even a small leakage would neutralise the advantage of gas. The prospects are grim, and even if we act successfully in amelioration, there will still be hard times, as in war, that will stretch our grandchildren to the limit. We are tough and it would take more than the climate catastrophe to eliminate all breeding pairs of humans; what is at risk is civilisation. As individual animals we are not so special, and in some ways are like a planetary disease, but through civilisation we redeem ourselves and become a precious asset for the Earth; not least because through our eyes the Earth has seen herself in all her glory. There is a chance we may be saved by an unexpected event such as a series of volcanic eruptions severe enough to block out sunlight and so cool the Earth. But only losers would bet their lives on such poor odds. Whatever doubts there are about future climates, there are no doubts that greenhouse gases and temperatures both are rising. We have stayed in ignorance for many reasons; important among them is the denial of climate change in the US where governments have failed to give their climate scientists the support they needed. The Green lobbies, which should have given priority to global warming, seem more concerned about threats to people than with threats to the Earth, not noticing that we are part of the Earth and wholly dependent upon its well being. It may take a disaster worse than last summer's European deaths to wake us up. Opposition to nuclear energy is based on irrational fear fed by Hollywood-style fiction, the Green lobbies and the media. These fears are unjustified, and nuclear energy from its start in 1952 has proved to be the safest of all energy sources. We must stop fretting over the minute statistical risks of cancer from chemicals or radiation. Nearly one third of us will die of cancer anyway, mainly because we breathe air laden with that all pervasive carcinogen, oxygen. If we fail to concentrate our minds on the real danger, which is global warming, we may die even sooner, as did more than 20,000 unfortunates from overheating in Europe last summer. I find it sad and ironic that the UK, which leads the world in the quality of its Earth and climate scientists, rejects their warnings and advice, and prefers to listen to the Greens. But I am a Green and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy. Even if they were right about its dangers, and they are not, its worldwide use as our main source of energy would pose an insignificant threat compared with the dangers of intolerable and lethal heat waves and sea levels rising to drown every coastal city of the world. We have no time to experiment with visionary energy sources; civilisation is in imminent danger and has to use nuclear - the one safe, available, energy source - now or suffer the pain soon to be inflicted by our outraged planet. <br />

However, Plan B—focused on targeted counterterrorism operations—would likely amount to a soft partition of the country, with a Tajik-dominated rump Afghanistan of perhaps 18—20 million people, and some 60—70 percent of the country’s land area, constituting the essence of the surviving state. Hazara, Uzbek, and Pashtun minorities would remain within the relatively safe zones, but most Pashtun areas and most of the 12—14 million Pashtuns living in contemporary Afghanistan would be on the outs—in a large swath of land effectively conceded to the Taliban (or to civil warfare) which would likely include most or all of the present-day provinces of Kandahar, Helmand, Zabul, Uruzgan, Nimroz, perhaps parts of Farah and Daykundi, and a few other central areas. 6 As Bob Woodward’s book Obama’s Wars starkly underscores, critics of current U.S. strategy have several key sympathizers in the White House, and they may still have considerable influence with the president in ongoing and future policy debates about Afghanistan. 7 Among other consequences, Plan B may encourage many Afghan fence-sitters in the current conflict to keep hedging their bets. It may convince many in the Pakistani army to keep up support for the Haqqani network and Quetta Shura Taliban as backup plans of their own. They fear a premature U.S. withdrawal either leading to complete chaos in Afghanistan or, just as bad from a Pakistani perspective, an Afghan regime dominated by the former Northern Alliance and thus too friendly to India. Since he has rejected this option twice already, Obama clearly has no particular sympathy for such a Plan B, nor is he likely to develop affection for it in the coming months. Yet, some of the best U.S. strategists of both parties are on record supporting this kind of plan, and U.S. public and congressional support for the existing war effort continues to wane. The president’s words about his future commitmentsuch as his phrase in his August 31, 2010 Oval Office speech that the U.S. drawdown next summer would be ‘‘conditions based’’are not clear enough. After all, it is possible that what he means by those words is that if conditions are bad, the United States will stop reinvesting in a failing mission, and get out of Afghanistan quickly. The president should therefore signal sooner rather than later that he understands the downsides of this ‘‘counterterrorism-plus’’ or Fortress Kabul approach. To begin, after adopting any such Plan B, the strategy for taking on any al Qaeda or other extremist bases which might be set up in Pashtun Afghanistan would not be very promising. It would be similar to the ‘‘light footprint’’ strategy attempted under George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, which led to the very resurgence of the Taliban that now afflicts Afghanistan. Long-range counterterrorism strikes are almost oxymoronic, since they cannot succeed without intelligence that can be gained only by access to the local population. Just when the United States is putting more pressure on Pakistan over that country’s safe havens, and has raised the possibility of using a ‘‘hammer and anvil’’ strategy (with Pakistani forces closing in on the FATA from the east and NATO/Afghan forces closing in from the west) against various extremist groups near the Durand Line between Afghanistan and Pakistan, it would be relenting on the pressure. Not only al Qaeda, but also Pakistan’s own Taliban, with its ambitions of destabilizing that nuclear-armed state, and the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist group, with its ambitions of attacking India and perhaps provoking Indo— Pakistani war, could take refuge in this general ‘‘Pashtunistan’’ region of Afghanistan. Those who assert that the Afghan Taliban may no longer have sympathy for these other extremists base their hopes on a thin reed. Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden continue to work together to send terrorists to the United States, as illustrated by the foiled 2009 New York metro attack planned for the eighth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The three U.S. citizens led by Najibullah Zazi, who have pleaded guilty to the plot, were referred to al Qaeda after initially approaching the Taliban to fight in Afghanistan. The Taliban were active recruiters for an al Qaeda attack on the U.S. homeland, and it is not clear why the Afghan Taliban would become more moderate at the very moment it defeated NATO and reclaimed control of its historical heartland. 8 Moreover with Plan B, the die would be cast for civil war in Afghanistan, as the Tajik-dominated northern state and the Taliban-run Pashtun belt would likely wind up fighting furiously, over Kabul in particular. Plan B may wind up as the only option, if all else fails, but it is more likely to lead to a defeat of NATO and its Afghan allies than to be a sound strategic choice for the United States. ‘‘Plan A-Minus’’ and a Gradual NATO Drawdown Tying troop drawdowns to the growth and maturation of Afghan security forces is a better option, should it become clear that Plan A cannot achieve its goals. Afghan security forces now number more than 260,000 and are due to grow to 305,000 by next fall. Further growth to 400,000 would be possible by late 2012 or 2013, and should be adopted as a formal goal by ISAF as soon as possible. That number should largely suffice for Afghanistan’s needs—based on metrics for the ratio of troops to population and the nature of the threat, which is most severe in the south and east—though it might also be complemented by the less-formalized (but still government-controlled) Afghan Local Police nowbeing developed at the community level to provide security in remote areas. 9 The particulars of NATO drawdowns should not be set to a firm timeline, and Congress should not appropriate funds for 2012 against any binding plan to reduce troops by an inflexible schedule. Battlefield conditions must influence the details of the process, but the rough contours of such an approach could be sketched out in advance. Under this plan, U.S. forces would start to decline by late 2011, or certainly by 2012, and be reduced by 20,000 to 30,000 troops a year thereafter. Nevertheless, make no mistake about it, this plan is still demanding. That is why it is described as ‘‘Plan A-’’ rather than a different form of Plan B. Some may wonder what distinguishes it from Obama’s existing approach. Since the latter has not been clearly specified in all ways, it is difficult to say, but the shortest answer is that Plan A- would not make comprehensive progress across all 125 or so current key terrain districts a precondition for initiating a drawdown. As such, it would not be open-ended in duration. Drawdown trajectories would be tied primarily to the growth and maturation of Afghan security forcesthough again, some flexibility would be retained. Plan A is clearly preferable to Plan A- if the former works. It would less likely concede even modestly sized sanctuaries to extremists for a substantial period of time. However, Plan A may not work. If violence continues to increase, the Karzai government fails to make further progress at reform, and especially if the sanctuaries for insurgents remain largely unaddressed within Pakistan, there will be a case for reappraisal. Perhaps the most significant factor of all in choosing between Plan A and Plan A- should be U.S. confidence that its presence is no longer sustaining corruption and stoking the insurgency. If the United States is having such unhelpful effects, beginning a withdrawal might improve rather than worsen the prospects of at least modest success. The United States should not withdraw quickly, however, because the Afghan army and police, while improving, are not yet ready to prevent an insurgent victory on their soil in the short term. It is also because the new training effort for Afghan forces requires intensive partnering in the field—that is, patrolling and fighting together. But under Plan A-, if some parts of the country proved difficult to stabilize in the next couple of years, the United States could view them as longer-term challenges primarily for Afghan forces rather than NATO militaries. That is both this strategy’s central appeal, and its central risk. Afghanistan would in effect have its own ‘‘Federally Administered Tribal Areas,’’ perhaps of roughly comparable population to the FATA regions of Pakistan which Islamabad is gradually seeking to stabilize. Those areas already cleared by ISAF and the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) would not be conceded back to the insurgents, but operations in areas not yet cleared might in some cases be delayed. The number of ‘‘key terrain districts’’ that ISAF sought to control and stabilize might decline modestly from the present number of about 125, and the transition from an ISAF lead role to ANSF leadership might be accelerated in places. One appeal of this alternative, relative to Plan B, is that it could be adopted as a logical extension of the current effort without any need to publicly acknowledge a setback. An even more important rationale is that NATO’s strategy for improving the Afghan army and police is now beginning to work. In fact, many changes in recent months within the effort to build the Afghan army and police offer grounds for hope, including: tripling the ratio of trainers to army and police recruits; approximately doubling pay for the typical Afghan soldier or policeman (finally outbidding the Taliban’s salaries); roughly doubling the length of training regimens; creating specialized courses for noncommissioned Army officers, as well as for special branches such as artillery and logistics; deploying most graduates of Afghanistan’s prestigious military academy to the field rather than Kabul (at least 95 percent of the class of 2009 stayed in Kabul—by last count, at least 95 percent of the class of 2010 is still in the field); creating literacy courses for 25,000 Afghan security personnel at a time; and paying soldiers and police by electronic banking (and training themto access it) to reduce the skimming of salaries by commanding officers. Best of all, perhaps, is the above-noted partnering concept. This is really a form of apprenticeship. Prior to 2009, most Afghan security forces received a modest amount of training, were quickly formed into units, and then dispatched to the field to fend largely for themselves. Under generals Stanley McChrystal and Petraeus, as well as generalsWilliam Caldwell and David Rodriguez, that has radically changed. The basic idea now is to team Afghan units with NATO partners which would normally be within one echelon of each other in size (ideally, for example, a NATO battalion would work with a larger Afghan brigade). Partnering presently involves some 90 percent of all Afghan army units in the field. About three-fourths of all such ISAF sister units are co-located with their Afghan partners or based close to each other. 10 Only about a quarter of police units have such help, but those numbers are growing. Partnering radically improves training. It also boosts confidence among Afghans since they patrol with ISAF/NATO units that can quickly call in reinforcements or airpower if ambushed. And it also helps ISAF carry out anticorruption efforts on the ground, since ISAF personnel can witness the behavior of Afghan commanders in real time and report misbehavior up the Afghan chain of command to Minister of Defense Abdul Rahim Wardak or the newMinister of Interior Bismullah Khan Mohammadi. There is progress from this system already. NATO’s new evaluation system for the Afghan army, which also evaluates anticorruption measures and leadership, now rates half of all Afghan army battalions (or ‘‘kandaks’’) as a ‘‘3’’ or above on a scale of 1—5. The equivalent of a ‘‘C’’ is not a great grade, but it is not bad as an interim result. 11 The Afghan police are further behind, but also making headway. Interior Minister Mohammadi has recently reassigned at least 27 police commanders to improve performance. He is also now famous for showing up unexpectedly at police posts to bolster moraleand to check on the performance of his units. There are, of course, still numerous problems with the Afghan security forces. These include not only the ongoing corruption already discussed, but also high attrition to the elite Afghanistan National Police Force. These problems may require the security forces to be used less intensively in coming months. There are considerable sectarian rivalries present, as the International Crisis Group usefully detailed last spring, 12 but the sectarian tensions within the armed forces have not fueled war on the streets like they did in Iraq (or the Balkans or Great Lakes region of Africa or other places where ethnicity truly turned violent). The demographics of recent recruits are roughly in balance with those of the population writ large, even if a somewhat disproportionate number of Tajiks are in key leadership positions. There is a shortage of southern Pashtuns, but the Afghan government has introduced some new approaches to recruiting, including a promise that southern recruits can serve their first tour in their home province if they like. 13 To be sure, no strategy could succeed by emphasizing only the army and police, so it would make sense, even under the proposed Plan A-Minus, to continue to strengthen other ministries and pursue other lines of effort such as economic development. If the army and police were reformed and strengthened, but the rest of the Afghan government failed to improve, the prospects for a cohesive Afghan state would be poor. But the security forces do hold considerable promise, and they also can enable ISAF/NATO troop reductions. A Better Back-up Plan Plan A still has a good chance in Afghanistan. Robust counterinsurgency, concentrated in the Pashtun belt, may succeed in largely defusing the insurgency while building up Afghan institutions including the army, police, and other parts of the government. There is more promising news of late than most realize. Having said that, responsible strategists must ask the question of what the United States should do if the current approach in Afghanistan fails. Victory cannot be assured simply through resolve; the current strategy may face challenges that prevent accomplishing its core goals. If Afghan security forces continue to improve, but trends in violence do not, the best approach may be a Plan A-Minus which emphasizes stabilizing a smaller number of key districts in Afghanistan, while building up the army and police according to current plans. The latter missions involve, importantly, partnering in the field between ISAF and Afghan units, so this plan is hardly a prescription for a rapid departure or an easy road ahead for U.S. and other foreign forces. But it would place a time limit on the operation that Plan A may not. To be sure, the slogan that ‘‘we can stand down as Iraqis stand up’’ failed in a different recent conflict. Iraq was in civil war and the violence simply needed to be contained before anything else was possible. But Afghanistan is a far less violent place today than Iraq was in 2004—2007, and it suffers less from civil violence than a localized insurgency. So, a drawdown plan tied largely to the growth and maturation of the Afghan security forces may be more workable than a similar plan proved to be in Iraq. It is not the preferred option, and it carries risks, as any sanctuaries for extremists in Afghanistan would be undesirable. But it bounds those risks relative to the increasingly popular Plan Balso sometimes described as counterterrorism-plusbeing discussed today in debates in the United States and the United Kingdom. Plan A-Minus may not offer the prospect of a ‘‘hammer and anvil’’ approach in broader Pashtunistan, with Pakistani and NATO/Afghan forces closing in from different directions, but it does offer hope of a gradually tightening vise on both sides, even if the process could be slow and uneven. It is understandably important to President Obama to reassure Americans that, while the conflict in Afghanistan is hardly near its end, it will not become his Vietnam. But it is equally important that he find a way, sooner rather than later, to convey that under no plausible circumstances will he revert next year to a ‘‘counterterrorism-plus’’ approach. The new NATO emphasis on transferring primary responsibility for security to Afghans by the end of 2014 is a good start in this regard but further clarity is still needed. By bounding the future options for Afghanistan within the current strategy of comprehensive counterinsurgency and an alternative focusing somewhat more narrowly on the Afghan security forces, the United States can improve the odds of achieving at least a minimally acceptable outcome in Afghanistan. Among its other advantages, framing the debate roughly within these parameters would reassure Afghans and Pakistanis, who are now hedging against a rapid U.S. withdrawal that they fear will begin next year. Framing the debate in this way could make them more likely to support U.S. and NATO efforts to achieve what remains a crucial strategic goal for the United States and its allies: to stabilize Afghanistan, and thereby prevent the reestablishment of what would be the largest and safest sanctuary anywhere on the planet for global extremist groups. <br />

Nuclear war <br />
Downer 10—Alexander Downer, Former Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, 7/19/10 (Advertiser &quot;We can't leave yet&quot;, lexis)<br />
<br />
Afghanistan is now the longest war in which the United States has participated. I find that a quite chilling statistic. Many more may have died in World War II, the Vietnam War, the Korean War and in earlier conflicts, but none has gone on as long as this. What is more, there seems to be no end in sight and this makes people wonder whether the sacrifice of our and our allies' soldiers in Afghanistan is worthwhile. When making an assessment of war, we are always struck by the obvious: War is ugly and our people are dying, therefore we must stop fighting. But remember, the quickest way to end a war is to lose it. So before leaping to the conclusion that surrendering to the Taliban is the least bad option, think through the consequences of defeat. Think what would happen to Afghanistan, to its neighbourhood and well beyond. First, the Taliban would seize control of most of Afghanistan fairly quickly. I doubt very much that the government of President Hamid Karzai would last long. The President himself has been a disappointment. He is relatively weak and he has appointed many poor-quality governors and other leaders throughout the country. This hasn't helped his cause. The relatively benign Karzai regime would be replaced by militant extremists. SECOND, the Taliban would once more allow Afghanistan to become a base for international Islamic extremist operations. It would certainly become both an administrative and training base for al-Qaida but it would become more than that: It would become the global focal point for Islamic extremism. Islamic fundamentalists would, in effect, have their own sovereign state from which they could launch operations anywhere in the world. Third, the collapse of the moderate Karzai administration in Afghanistan and its replacement by the Taliban would be a serious threat to the stability of Pakistan. Remember, the Taliban was established by the Pakistani intelligence services during the time of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. There are still very close links between the Taliban and some elements of the Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI. It is possible that the Taliban and other Islamic extremists could seize control of the government of Pakistan which, you will recall, has nuclear weapons. It is not certain this would happen but it could. If it did, then tensions between Pakistan and India would rise overnight, perhaps dangerously so. For the Indians, a combination of Islamic extremists and nuclear weapons on their border would be a potent mix. Fourth, this would constitute a massive and unexpected victory for Islamic extremists. For all the pain we have been through over the past nine years since 9/11, there is no doubt that Islamic extremism is very much on the retreat outside Afghanistan. There has been no terrorist attack on American soil since then - although there have been attempts - nor has there been in this country. Al-Qaida networks have been broken up throughout the Western world and in the Middle East and South-East Asia. In Europe, governments are also having much greater success now in dealing with terrorism. A Taliban victory and takeover in Afghanistan would reverse all this. We would be back where we were in 2001. And if Pakistan were taken over by Islamic extremists, we would be a good deal worse off. Globally, Islamic extremism would be energised, its morale revitalised and its activities intensified. All this explains why it is not possible to abandon the struggle against the Taliban in Afghanistan. The war itself is bad, there is no doubt about that. No victory appears to be in sight any time soon, that is true. But the alternative is a great deal worse. The challenge in Afghanistan is not to try to control the country ourselves but to strengthen the capacity of the government in Kabul to control it. This means emphasising training and recruitment in the army, effective aid programs to give Afghanistan a reasonable economic base and encouraging President Karzai to appoint better-quality public administrators.<br />

Gen Amos: No, combat operations in Afghanistan are not adversely affecting readiness and retention of active duty and reserve Marines. We are meeting our retention goals across the Marine Corps, and some of our highest retention rates come from units that have deployed. Marine Corps units, both active and reserve, are deploying for all our global mission demands (e.g. theater security cooperation initiatives, Marine expeditionary unit operations, combat operations etc.) at the highest states of readiness. As long as we maintain a deployment to dwell ratio of about 1:2, I do not foresee adverse impacts on retention. <br />

<br />
For nearly a decade, American foreign policy has been dominated by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As 2011 begins, with 50,000 US soldiers still in Iraq and another 100,000 in Afghanistan, it may not look like that era is coming to an end. But it is. Iraq, the second most expensive “war of choice” (after Vietnam) in American history, is for the United States reaching a level of effort that will no longer absorb substantial military and economic resources or garner significant domestic political attention. All US troops are due to leave Iraq by the end of 2011. Even if, as seems likely, several thousand soldiers remain, the number will be small and their role limited to advising and training Iraqi military and police forces and conducting missions against terrorists. Eight years, 4,300 lost American lives, and more than a trillion dollars later, it will be, for better or worse, mostly Iraqis who determine their country's future. The initial performance of an Iraq run by Iraqis is less than encouraging. To be sure, there have been a number of relatively fair elections, political life is active, and the economy is growing. But Iraqi leaders' difficulty in forming a government following last spring's elections bodes poorly. Indeed, a political culture of compromise has not taken root, and the country continues to be divided by geography, ethnicity, religion, and politics. There is no consensus on how to share the potential wealth from Iraq's vast energy resources. The Kurdish north is largely autonomous; where its writ ends and the central government's begins is unsettled. Iranian influence is pervasive in the south and extensive in the center. Moreover, the country still experiences regular bombings, and millions of Iraqis are either internally displaced or refugees. In short, conditions in Iraq, while significantly better than five years ago, are more likely to deteriorate than improve. Afghanistan is moving at a much slower pace when it comes to US troop reductions. The Obama administration is likely to remove a small number of US soldiers in July, the date selected by the president for the beginning of the American military drawdown. But it will be only the beginning of an extended, gradual process of American military reduction, one that looks like it will take four years – and quite possibly longer. What the US will have to show then for more than a decade of sacrifice and investment in Afghanistan is anybody's guess. The sum total of the US effort in terms of American money and lives will likely be less than in Iraq, but still substantial. And it is difficult to be optimistic about Afghanistan, given the Taliban's resilience, the weakness and corruption that plague the government, and the reality that Pakistan will continue to be a sanctuary for the Taliban and other armed groups seeking to gain a foothold (or more) in Afghanistan. An Afghanistan that resembles a normal country is virtually impossible to foresee. Nevertheless, the decisions to scale back American involvement decisively in Iraq, and gradually in Afghanistan, will ultimately have significant consequences for the US – many of them welcome. One is financial. Current US policy toward Iraq and Afghanistan costs roughly $150 billion per year, which is more than 20% of total US defense spending. Cutting this sum will free up much-needed money for other defense needs and for deficit reduction, arguably the principal national security challenge facing the US. Troop reductions in Iraq and Afghanistan will also allow the US military to begin to recover from these two conflicts. Neither soldiers nor equipment can sustain the performance that has been demanded of them. Recruitment and retention of highly skilled individuals in the US armed forces will increase as the level of effort in the two conflicts winds down, and a great deal of deferred military modernization will occur. More fundamentally, reducing US involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan will permit a rebalancing of US foreign and defense policy. The two conflicts have absorbed a disproportionate share of the country's resources – military and economic to be sure, but also the time and attention of policymakers and diplomats. In the short run, doing less in Iraq and Afghanistan will allow the US to concentrate on the two most immediate external threats to US interests: Iran and North Korea. In the long run, the US needs to generate domestic and international support for regional and global arrangements designed to manage the defining problems of this era, from the spread of nuclear materials and terrorism to maintaining an open world economy and slowing climate change. This will require a foreign policy that focuses on the emerging powers of the twenty-first century, many of which are in Asia.<br />

The public opinion climate for sending more troops is difficult -- but not impossible. When the United States first took military action in Afghanistan, there was strong bipartisan support for the war. Now, the American public is more divided, and there is a partisan split on the issue. A recent Post-ABC News poll found just 51 percent saying the war has been worth the costs; 45 percent say it has not. The public also is divided over whether the United States is making progress in achieving its goals in Afghanistan. Unlike health care and other domestic issues, resistance to the president on Afghanistan is more likely to come from within his own party. While more Democrats than Republicans approve of the president's handling of the situation, more Republicans agree with the direction of his policies there. In a Pew poll in early June, two-thirds of Republicans (67 percent) approved of President Obama's decision to send additional troops to Afghanistan; Democrats were evenly divided, with 48 percent approving and the same number disapproving. Even so, the public tends to defer to presidents on decisions about war and peace, and Obama continues to receive favorable marks, on balance, for his handling of the war: 47 percent approved in a July Pew Research Center poll, vs. 33 percent who disapproved. And the president's latitude for action may be widened somewhat by the fact that the war in Afghanistan remains below the radar for much of the public and the news media. Just 24 percent of the public said they were following news about the war very closely last week, and Pew's News Coverage Index found that just 2 percent of national news coverage was devoted to the war. <br />

Fear trumps fatigue – the public will always back a primacist grand strategy<br />
McDonough 9 (David. S. McDonough, Fellow at the Centre for Foreign Policy Studies at Dalhousie University, “Beyond Primacy: Hegemony and ‘Security Addiction’ in U.S. Grand Strategy”, Winter 2009, Orbis, ScienceDirect)<br />
<br />
The reason that the current debate is currently mired in second-order issues of multilateral versus unilateral legitimacy can be attributed to the post 9/11 security environment. A grand strategy is, after all, ‘‘a state’s theory about how it can best cause security for itself.’’ 35 It would be prudent to examine why the neoconservative ‘‘theory’’ proved to be so attractive to American decision-makers after the 9/11 attacks, and why the Democrats have begun to rely on an equally primacist ‘‘theory’’ of their own. As Charles Kupchan has demonstrated, a sense of vulnerability is often directly associated with dramatic shifts in a state’s grand strategy. Kupchan is, of course, largely concerned with vulnerability to changes in the global distribution of power. 36 Even so, the 9/11 terrorist attacks have dramatically increased the U.S. sense of strategic vulnerability to both global terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and even to more traditional threats that are seen, as Donald Rumsfeld said, ‘‘in a dramatic new light–through the prism of our experience on 9/11.’’ 37 Perhaps more than any previous terrorist action, these attacks demonstrated the potential inﬂuence of non-state terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. U.S. strategic primacy makes conventional responses unattractive and ultimately futile to potential adversaries. The country’s societal vulnerability to terrorist attacks will likewise lead to extremely costly defensive reactions against otherwise limited attacks. For both the United States and its asymmetrical adversaries, the advantage clearly favors the offense over the defense. With the innumerable list of potential targets, ‘‘preemptive and preventive attacks will accomplish more against. . .[terrorists or their support structures], dollar for dollar, than the investment in passive defenses.’’ 38 As former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith has argued, a primary reliance on defense requires instrusive security measures that would inevitably endanger American civil liberties and curtail its free and open society. 39 Strategic preponderance ensures that the United States will continue to face adversaries eager to implement asymmetrical tactics, even as it offers the very resources necessary to implement both offensive and less effective defensive measures. Unfortunately, terrorist groups with strategic reach (i.e., capable of inﬂuencing the actions of states) will likely increase in the coming years due to a combination of factors, including the ‘‘democractization of technology,’’ the ‘‘privatization of war’’ and the ‘‘miniaturization of weaponry.’’ As more groups are imbued with sophisticated technological capabilities and are able to employ increasingly lethal weapons, the United States will be forced to rely even further on its unprecedented global military capabilities to eliminate this threat. The global war on terror, even with tactical successes against al Qaeda, will likely result in an inconclusive ending marked by the fragmentation and proliferation of terrorist spoiler groups. The ‘‘Israelization’’ of the United States, in which ‘‘security trumps everything,’’ will be no temporary phenomenon. 40 Realism provides an insufﬁcient means for understanding the current post-9/11 strategic threat environment and underestimates the potential impact of the terrorist threat on the American sense of vulnerability. Globalized terrorism must be confronted by proactive measures to reduce the domestic vulnerability to attack and to eliminate these organizations in their external sanctuaries. Even then, these measures will never be able to ensure ‘‘perfect security.’’ As a result, signiﬁcant public pressure for expanded security measures will arise after any attack. The United States will be consumed with what Frank Harvey has termedsecurity addiction: ‘‘As expectations for acceptable levels of pain decrease, billions of dollars will continue to be spent by both parties in a never-ending competition to convince the American public that their party’s programs are different and more likely to succeed.’’ 41 This addiction has an important impact on the dramatically rising levels of homeland security spending. Indeed, while this increased spending is an inevitable and prudent reaction to the terrorist threat, it also creates high public expectations that will only amplify outrage in a security failure. 42 Relatedly, American strategic preponderance plays an important role in facilitating a vigorous international response to globalized terrorism, including the use of coercive military options and interventions. A primacist strategy has the dual attraction of both maximizing U.S. strategic dominance and convincing the public of a party’s national security credentials. Indeed, the Republicans had developed a strong advantage in electoral politics by its adherence to a strong military and aggressive strategy, and the Democrats in turn ‘‘learned the lesson of its vulnerability on the issue and [...] explicitly declared its devotion to national security and support for the military.’’ 43 The 9/11 attacks may not have altered the distribution of power amongst major states, but it has directly created a domestic political situation marked by an addiction to expansive security measures that are needed to satisfy increasingly high public expectations. In such a climate, it is easy to see why the neo-conservatives were so successful in selling their strategic vision. The fact that the United States has effectively settled on a grand strategy of primacy in the post-9/11 period should come as no surprise. It is simply inconceivable that a political party could successfully advocate a grand strategy that does not embrace military preeminence and interventionism, two factors that are seen to provide a deﬁnite advantage in the pursuit of a ‘‘global war on terror.’’ Political parties may disagree on the necessary tactics to eliminate the terrorist threat. But with increased vulnerability and security addiction, the United States will continue to embrace strategies of primacy– rather than going ‘‘beyond primacy’’–for much of the Long War.<br />

None of this is to suggest that staying in Afghanistan is an easy option. Wars never are. They require good men and women to put their lives on the line every day for our security. We should put them at risk only for an issue of vital national interest. Afghanistan is one such issue. And that—not cost—is the real bottom line. The war won’t bankrupt America. Multitrillion dollar proposals like “cap and trade” environmental schemes or government-managed health systems might well kill our economy. But the $30 billion required for the Afghanistan surge represents about 0.20 percent of our GDP. <br />

The past year, culminating in last week's unveiling of the White House “Afpak” review, should have put most of those doubts to rest. President Obama has had repeated chances to downsize and retreat from Afghanistan. That was the option urged on him by many in the Democratic party last June, when the president fired Gen. McChrystal. It was urged on him again before the latest policy review. But Obama has consistently refused to waver, even though it might seem to his political advantage to distance himself from an unpopular war. The key to the president's behavior may be found, we believe, in a revealing passage from Bob Woodward's latest book, Obama's Wars, which recounts the following exchange between the president and vice president. Biden reportedly told Obama: “If you do what McChrystal wants and adopt his strategy, ‘You own this war.' ” Obama shot back: “I already own it.” The president was right. And so, on Afghanistan, Obama has become a hawk in dove's plumage. He seems to understand that success in this war is vital to the success of his presidency—and he's acting and talking like it.<br />

Alarmists, who have attempted to examine the nature of current civil-military relations and the basis for military subordination to civilian control have generally started with the development of the national security state after World War II (Kohn), followed by the traumatic social upheavals of the Vietnam War (Feaver). Some even go back to the Civil War (Weigley). However, examples of significant civil-military turmoil are not limited to the dramatic and oft-cited Truman-MacArthur example, but permeate the entire American history. Cases include Andrew Jackson's martial law over New Orleans in the War of 1812, the popular protests against the Mexican American War, draft riots and other Civil War protests, Lincoln's suspension of civil liberties, including habeas corpus, military control of the South during Reconstruction, Sherman's disagreements on Indian policy after the Civil War, and significant involvement by military professionals in running governments in various countries in the twentieth century, including Cuba, the Philippines, Nicaragua, Haiti, Panama, and the Dominican Republic. Twentieth century examples include the remarkable presidential bid on the Republican ticket by active duty General Leonard Wood in 1920, Billy Mitchell's overt challenge to civilian authority, the crushing of the bonus marchers in 1932, the Admiral's revolt of the late 1940s, Army resistance to Eisenhower's Doctrine of Massive Retaliation, and periodic instances of general officers being fired for repudiating presidential authority, such as General Singlaub's removal over President Carter's proposed Korea withdrawal in the late 1970s. Thus, despite some considerable efforts at broader consideration of the historical record,48 few studies consider the broad pantheon of civil-military discourse and disruption common to the American experience. Placing the ideal of military subordination to civilian control in a more retrospective context will help correct the alarmists' inaccurate assumptions of what constitutes appropriate military behavior, and aid us in better understanding the limits of the alarmists' arguments. <br />

While the alarmists are incorrect in important aspects regarding the tradition of civil-military relations, their concerns have had the positive benefit of starting a serious debate and deeper examination over the nature and current condition of American dvil-milrtary relations. Fortunately, this debate has sparked a deeper examination of American civil-military history and tradition that illuminates a more balanced judgment of their current status, and helps guide us in outlining some considerations for what characterizes truly appropriate civil-military relations. Even some of the alarmists have suggested the need for &quot;restoring the tradition of loyal dissent,*7* yet the general tone the alarmists sounded is inaccurate, as the TISS Study indicates: &quot;Beyond [normal] tensions and conflicts, we see no real signs of crisis, no indicators of loss of effective civilian control nor of undue influence by military leaders in decisions properly the domain of elected or appointed political leaders.&quot;*0 Indeed. Don Snider makes a key point that signs of discord indicate there is a stark, but potentially healthy tension between the two imperatives and the character and ethos of their respective cultures ... between freedom and individualism ... and the corporate nature of the military that demand sacrifice ... to the higher good of the mission. ...Not all observed gaps are dangerous; at the same time, not all convergences between the two cultures are functional and thus desirable.&quot;1 Whatever the origins of and solutions to the currenl schisms, it is important to understand that they represent the necessary and inevitable tension in the fundamentally contradictory nature of civil-military relations in a democratic society. Furthermore, these problems are neither unique to the dawning twenty-first century, nor do they portend gloomy civil-military relations in the future, as some of the alarmists depict. Reduced civilian defense expertise and the increased insertion of military officers into the national security bureaucracy to deal with policy issues has expanded the limits of military participation in policy-making far beyond the mythical notion of the alarmists. <br />

<strong>The Obama administration is not making this decision in a vacuum. Obama ran on a platform that made giving Afghanistan the resources it needed an overriding American priority. President Obama has repeated that commitment many times. He appointed a new commander to execute the policy he enunciated in his March 27 speech, in which he noted: &quot;To focus on the greatest threat to our people, America must no longer deny resources to Afghanistan because of the war in Iraq.&quot; If he now rejects the request of his new commander for forces, his decision will be seen as the abandonment of the president's own commitment to the conflict. In that case, no amount of rhetorical flourish is likely to persuade Afghans, Pakistanis, or anyone else otherwise. A president who overrules the apparently unanimous recommendation of his senior generals and admirals that he make good the resource shortfalls he himself called unacceptable can hardly convince others he is determined to succeed in Afghanistan. And if the United States is not determined to succeed, then, in the language of the region, it is getting ready to cut and run, whatever the president and his advisers may think or say. That is a policy that will indeed have regional effects--extremely dangerous ones.</strong><br />

<strong>Discussion of the deep involvement of civilian leaders today in operational and even tactical matters formerly the exclusive preserve of the soldier is now the hackneyed staple of international security affairs textbooks.2 Facilitated by the revolution in communications technology that has made possible instant secure voice contact with forces scattered throughout the world, sobered by fears of sudden escalation from local dustup to wider confrontation having global reverberations, and driven by a need to contain adverse political fallout from overseas military ventures seen as both risky and controversial, civilians in positions of authority over the military have been increasingly disposed during delicate moments to seize the marshals baton themselves and bark orders directly to servicemen on the scene. In doing so, they have given rise to a new addition to the soldiers compendium of command post humor: “If you want to direct troops in battle, dont be a general, be a politician.” But in truth, far from seeing these new developments as funny, professional soldiers view them with a mixture of profound alarm, resentment, frustration, and resignation— and legitimately so.Onone hand, under Article II, Section 2, the President as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, acting directly or through his civilian seconds, has absolute constitutional authority to intervene in U.S. military operations at any level in any way he or she sees fit. This is the overriding reality and the bedrock axiom from which all discussion must begin. On the other hand, warfighting is an extremely complex and dangerous activity, requiring for its successful execution a professional class of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who have made it their careers work to master the art and science of war. In this hostile world, where other nations have it within their capability to grievously injure if not destroy us as a nation and people, the simple imperative of survival demands that we entrust our fighting to those among us best qualified to do the job. We ignore this axiom at our peril.</strong><br />

<strong>By accepting the resignation of General Stanley McChrystal and replacing him with General David Petraeus, Barack Obama has taken one of the most decisive — and dramatic acts — of his young presidency. But while the fall of Obama's top man in Afghanistan and the ascension of a military icon sometimes seen as rival to the President makes for a riveting political story, when it comes to the conduct of the war, there is less here than meets the eye. But first the storyline. Obama made clear today that, although Stanley McChrystal was faithfully executing the White House's war plan, the conduct revealed by Rolling Stone magazine amounted to insubordination that tests the sacred principle of the American military-civilian divide. The portrait captured by RS reporter Michael Hastings, Obama said, &quot;does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general&quot; and &quot;undermines the civilian control of the military that is at the core of a democratic system.&quot; Obama said that he welcomes disagreement within his foreign policy team but that he &quot;won't tolerate division.&quot; In taking that stand, and quickly installing Petraeus, Obama should quiet critics who have been mocking him for an allegedly timid approach to the BP oil spill in recent weeks. The change of generals was the firm action of a hands-on executive. And a self-confident one, too, given that Petraeus is widely viewed as retaining sympathies to the Bush administration in which he earned national prominence for leading the Iraq surge. Through Petraeus has spent much of the past year (persuasively) denying that he has presidential ambitions, some senior White House officials are said never to have fully trusted him. But Obama obviously doesn't feel too threatened by Petraeus to hand him such an essential assignment. More saliently, Obama also clearly believes that appointing Petraeus — who as head of Central Command has been closely involved in shaping Afghanistan policy, and pays regular visits to Pakistani leaders — will result in minimum disruption to the war effort.</strong><br />

<strong>Multilateralism is impossible</strong><br />
<strong>Tsai 8 Managing Editor of SAIS Review, MA Candidate at Johns Hopkins for International Studies (Frederick, The False Binary Choice between Unilateralism and Multilateralism, SAIS Review, Volume 28, Number 2, Summer-Fall 2008)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>First, American presidents have always maintained a policy of strategic flexibility. Foreign policy initiatives have been multilateral if possible, but unilateral if necessary. This has been the historical precedent. The assertion that any one administration is “unilateralist” while others have been “multilateralist” is grossly overdone. In fact, the administrations of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush have each acted unilaterally. In 1989, George H.W. Bush unilaterally ordered American forces to invade Panama and capture Manuel Noriega. The Clinton administration bypassed the UN Security Council and intervened in Kosovo with military force. Later, Bill Clinton authorized the unilateral bombings of sites in Afghanistan and Sudan after Al-Qaeda’s 1998 terrorist attacks against U.S. embassies in Africa. Even the George W. Bush administration’s much derided aversion to the Kyoto Protocol and International Criminal Court (ICC) has followed similar attitudes held by the Clinton administration. Also important is the fact that presidential preferences do not absolutely dictate foreign policy. Deference for maximum maneuverability resides not only in the Executive Branch, but also in Congress and in wider public opinion. U.S. democracy requires the consideration of domestic political forces that sometimes prefer unilateral prescriptions even more than the administration. Treaties have to be ratified and budgets must be passed by members of Congress representing a diverse patchwork of constituent and interest groups. Indeed, the traditional bipartisan consensus affirming unilateral optionality is unlikely to change, especially in the face of grave threats from terrorism and rogue regimes. Even in a world of international organizations and regional alliances, the Westphalian centrality of sovereign nation-states has not changed. To ensure state survival, foreign policy naturally should be shaped by national interests. Thus, when faced with threats, according to Hans Morgenthau, countries must “do what they cannot help but do: protect their physical, political, and cultural identity against encroachments by other nations.”3 When necessary, the United States cannot be expected to act any differently. Second, U.S. leadership in the international system precludes it from adopting the “high multilateralism” envisioned by some critics of American foreign policy. As David Skidmore puts it, genuine multilateralism, “in theory or practice,” requires an absolute commitment to (1) “invest in the creation and maintenance of international institutions,” and (2) “comply with the rules, norms, principles, and decision-making processes of these institutions on an equal basis with other states.”4 After World War II, the United States was instrumental in creating most of today’s international organizations and arrangements—from the United Nations to the World Bank—across the security and economic landscape. In doing so, the United States satisfied the first prerequisite of “high multilateralism” by vigorously constructing and investing in international organizations—in fact, it still provides 22 percent of the UN budget. Yet no president has allowed the U.S. [End Page 46] to be completely constrained by the delineating limits of the international system. As Ruth Wedgwood has noted, “in Security Council multilateralism, the United States has never operated quite as its founders envisioned.” 5 Because a superpower bears exceptional structural responsibilities, it is unreasonable to expect the United States to unfailingly adopt the second commitment of “high multilateralism.” Global security, for instance, has largely depended on the involvement of the United States in hot spots and theatres that push beyond the envelope of America’s own self interest. Thus, the complex role and broad reach of U.S. military forces makes complete oversight by an International Criminal Court (ICC) almost materially impossible. And leadership sometimes requires boldness. The United States was a tireless fighter for a World Trade Organization built on free trade, but it has also faced criticism (and sometimes WTO violations) for economic actions against brutal regimes such as Burma and Cuba. From the start, American values and power have shaped today’s international system, not the other way around. For example, a U.S. document entitled “The Essential Points in the Charter of the International Organizations” served as a draft version for the UN Charter.6 Indeed, the United States built and now maintains the international system “not as an alternative to U.S. supremacy, but as an expression of it.”7 But, unlike past empires, the United States does not use its strength to achieve imperial dominion. Instead, the United States uses its enormous influence to champion the principles of democracy, human rights, and free markets. Many of these universal ideals have been transmitted both to and through the disparate bodies, conventions, and treaties that form multilateral fora. In short, the stability and public welfare engendered by the international system are often because of, not in spite of, American exceptionalism.</strong><br />

<strong>Cooperation inev—diplomacy not key</strong><br />
<strong>Wohlforth 9—Daniel Webster Professor of Government, Dartmouth. BA in IR, MA in IR and MPhil and PhD in pol sci, Yale (William and Stephen Brooks, Reshaping the World Order, March / April 2009, Foreign Affairs Vol. 88, Iss. 2; pg. 49, 15 pgs, AMiles)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>FOR ANALYSTS such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger, the key reason for skepticism about the United States' ability to spearhead global institutional change is not a lack of power but a lack of legitimacy. Other states may simply refuse to follow a leader whose legitimacy has been squandered under the Bush administration; in this view, the legitimacy to lead is a fixed resource that can be obtained only under special circumstances. The political scientist G.John Ikenberry argues in After Victory that states have been well positioned to reshape the institutional order only after emerging victorious from some titanic struggle, such as the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, or World War I or II. For the neoconservative Robert Kagan, the legitimacy to lead came naturally to the United States during the Cold War, when it was providing the signal service of balancing the Soviet Union. The implication is that today, in the absence of such salient sources of legitimacy, the wellsprings of support for U.S. leadership have dried up for good. But this view is mistaken. For one thing, it overstates how accepted U.S. leadership was during the Cold War: anyone who recalls the Euromissile crisis of the 1980s, for example, will recognize that mass opposition to U.S. policy (in that case, over stationing intermediaterange nuclear missiles in Europe) is not a recent phenomenon. For another, it understates how dynamic and malleable legitimacy is. Legitimacy is based on the belief that an action, an actor, or a political order is proper, acceptable, or natural. An action - such as the Vietnam War or the invasion of Iraq - may come to be seen as illegitimate without sparking an irreversible crisis of legitimacy for the actor or the order. When the actor concerned has disproportionately more material resources than other states, the sources of its legitimacy can be refreshed repeatedly. After all, this is hardly the first time Americans have worried about a crisis of legitimacy. Tides of skepticism concerning U.S. leadership arguably rose as high or higher after the fall of Saigon in 1975 and during Ronald Reagan's first term, when he called the Soviet Union an &quot;evil empire.&quot; Even George W. Bush, a globally unpopular U.S. president with deeply controversial policies, oversaw a marked improvement in relations with France, Germany, and India in recent years - even before the elections of Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy in France. Of course, the ability of the United States to weather such crises of legitimacy in the past hardly guarantees that it can lead the system in the future. But there are reasons for optimism. Some of the apparent damage to U.S. legitimacy might merely be the result of the Bush administration's approach to diplomacy and international institutions. Key underlying conditions remain particularly favorable for sustaining and even enhancing U.S. legitimacy in the years ahead. The United States continues to have a far larger share of the human and material resources for shaping global perceptions than any other state, as well as the unrivaled wherewithal to produce public goods that reinforce the benefits of its global role. No other state has any claim to leadership commensurate with Washington's. And largely because of the power position the United States still occupies, there is no prospect of a counterbalancing coalition emerging anytime soon to challenge it. In the end, the legitimacy of a system's leader hinges on whether the system's members see the leader as acceptable or at least preferable to realistic alternatives. Legitimacy is not necessarily about normative approval: one may dislike the United States but think its leadership is natural under the circumstances or the best that can be expected. Moreover, history provides abundant evidence that past leading states - such as Spain, France, and the United Kingdom - were able to revise the international institutions of their day without the special circumstances Ikenberry and Kagan cite. Spain fashioned both normative and positive laws to legitimize its conquest of indigenous Americans in the early seventeenth century; France instituted modern concepts of state borders to meet its needs as Europe's preeminent land power in the eighteenth century; and the United Kingdom fostered rules on piracy, neutral shipping, and colonialism to suit its interests as a developing maritime empire in the nineteenth century. As Wilhelm Grewe documents in his magisterial The Epochs of International Law, these states accomplished such feats partly through the unsubtle use of power: bribes, coercion, and the allure oflucrative long-term cooperation. Less obvious but often more important, the bargaining hands of the leading states were often strengthened by the general perception that they could pursue their interests in even less palatable ways - notably, through the naked use of force. Invariably, too, leading states have had the power to set the international agenda, indirectly affecting the development of new rules by defining the problems they were developed to address. Given its naval primacy and global trading interests, the United Kingdom was able to propel the slave trade to the forefront of the world's agenda for several decades after it had itself abolished slavery at home, in 1833. The bottom line is that the United States today has the necessary legitimacy to shepherd reform of the international system.</strong><br />

<strong>In the short run, doing less in Iraq and Afghanistan will allow the US to concentrate on the two most immediate external threats to US interests: Iran and North Korea. In the long run, the US needs to generate domestic and international support for regional and global arrangements designed to manage the defining problems of this era, from the spread of nuclear materials and terrorism to maintaining an open world economy and slowing climate change. This will require a foreign policy that focuses on the emerging powers of the twenty-first century, many of which are in Asia.</strong><br />

<strong>Climate multilateralism fails – domestic politics block any solution</strong><br />
<strong>Hale 11—PhD Candidate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University and a Visiting Fellow at LSE Global Governance, London School of Economics (Thomas, © 2011 Center for Strategic and International Studies, The Washington Quarterly, 34:1 pp. 89-101, “A Climate Coalition of the Willing,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4794:http://www.twq.com/11winter/docs/11winter_Hale.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.twq.com/11winter/docs/11winter_Hale.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.twq.com/11winter/docs/11winter_Hale.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4794 -->, RBatra)</strong><br />

<strong>Intergovernmental efforts to limit the gases that cause climate change have all but failed. After the unsuccessful 2010 Copenhagen summit, and with little progress at the 2010 Cancun meeting, it is hard to see how major emitters will agree any time soon on mutual emissions reductions that are sufficiently ambitious to prevent a substantial (greater than two degree Celsius) increase in average global temperatures.</strong><br />
<strong>It is not hard to see why. No deal excluding the United States and China, which together emit more than 40 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases (GHGs), is worth the paper it is written on. But domestic politics in both countries effectively block ‘‘G-2’’ leadership on climate. In the United States, the Obama administration has basically given up on national cap-and-trade legislation. Even the relatively modest Kerry-Lieberman-Graham energy bill remains dead in the Senate. The Chinese government, in turn, faces an even harsher constraint. Although the nation has adopted important energy efficiency goals, the Chinese Communist Party has staked its legitimacy and political survival on raising the living standard of average Chinese. Accepting international commitments that stand even a small chance of reducing the country’s GDP growth rate below a crucial threshold poses an unacceptable risk to the stability of the regime. Although the G-2 present the largest and most obvious barrier to a global treaty, they also provide a convenient excuse for other governments to avoid aggressive action. Therefore, the international community should not expect to negotiate a worthwhile successor to the Kyoto Protocol, at least not in the near future.</strong><br />

<strong>Alt causes to multilateral climate deal collapse</strong><br />
<strong>Hale 11—PhD Candidate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University and a Visiting Fellow at LSE Global Governance, London School of Economics (Thomas, © 2011 Center for Strategic and International Studies, The Washington Quarterly, 34:1 pp. 89-101, “A Climate Coalition of the Willing,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4795:http://www.twq.com/11winter/docs/11winter_Hale.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.twq.com/11winter/docs/11winter_Hale.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.twq.com/11winter/docs/11winter_Hale.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4795 -->, RBatra)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>It is important to understand why the intergovernmental approach is no longer sufficient. First, consider its record. Since the Rio Earth Summit of 1992, almost every country in the world has met regularly to coordinate a global response to climate change. Two decades of this multilateralism, under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), have resulted in exactly one treaty requiring GHG reductionsthe 1997 Kyoto Protocol that committed rich nations to a miniscule five percent average reduction in emissions relative to 1990 levels. Even this proved too much for the United States, which refused to adopt the protocol, and indeed for many signatoriessuch as Canadathat are failing to meet their commitments. Developing countries faced no requirements at all.</strong><br />
<strong>Kyoto, which expires in 2012, was meant to pave the way for more significant cuts, but that goal remains distant as the breakdown in Copenhagen and continuing inaction in Cancun demonstrate. This is not to say that the UNFCCC process has not been usefulindeed, it is absolutely essential, coordinating scientific knowledge about the issue, establishing a global carbon-trading mechanism, placing the issue at the top of the international agenda, etc.but the principal goal, preventing catastrophic climate change, is the only one that ultimately matters.</strong><br />
<strong>To be fair, no one expected the problem to be solved easily. Collective action problems tend to be more difficult when the number of actors is high, costs are proximate and clear while the benefits are distant and diffuse, and individuals have strong incentives to free ride on the sacrifices of others. By these measures, climate change is perhaps the toughest collective action problem society has ever faced. But even these issues could be overcome with strong leadership from the major powers. Unfortunately, domestic politics prevent the two countries that contribute more to climate change than any others, the United States and China, from adopting the international obligations required by the multilateral approach. Consider each in turn.</strong><br />
<strong>One might think that, with the Democrats in control of both Congress and the White House for the last two years, political conditions in the United States have been optimal for climate legislation. But that is wishful thinking, for two reasons. First, climate is not just a partisan issue. Although Republicans are almost unanimous in their opposition to firm caps on carbon reductions, Democrats face dissent within their ranks from members representing conservative, energyintensive, or agricultural states. This imbalance is rooted in the Constitution of the United States. Although Senate action is required to ratify any international treaty, Senate votes are awarded equally to the 50 states, not weighted by population, meaning that less populated, carbon-dependent rural interests tend to disproportionately dominate.2 And even in the House, climate legislation passed by only seven votes, with 43 Democrats joining the Republican opposition.</strong><br />
<strong>Second, on top of this structural bias, the U.S. political system has recently showed little capacity for far-reaching change. A culture of partisan obstructionism has brought public business to a standstill. Because the Obama administration needs to spend vast amounts of political capital to get anything through Congress, it has prioritized health care and job creation over climate change. The locus of this dysfunction is, again, the Senate, where a de facto super-majoritarian rule and a 59—41 partisan divide have made it impossible to pass ambitious legislation. With Republicans taking control of the House, climate legislation is unlikely to surface for at least two years.</strong><br />
<strong>The domestic politics of climate in China are less transparent than in the United States, but the outcome is equally clear. It is common to portray the Chinese Communist Party as an all-powerful ruler that could dictate changes in emissions policy tomorrow, if it decided to. In some sense, though, the party is even more constrained than the Obama administration. According to the Institute of Environmental Economics at Renmin University, the cost of strict emissions reductions would amount to about seven percent of GDP in 2050.3 In the eyes of Party leaders, these costs are incompatible with maintaining the rising standard of living to which urban Chinese have become accustomed. Worse, they are incompatible with the rapid job creation needed to employ the millions of Chinese moving from the countryside to the cities. For a party judged largely on economic performance, policies that threaten to reduce annual GDP growth below some minimal thresholdcommonly believed to be about eight percent would put the very stability of the regime into question.</strong><br />
<strong>It is also important to note the regional and sectoral dynamics at play within China. China’s dynamic export sector requires cheap energy and is agnostic about its source. This is not true of China’s enormous state-owned coal industry, concentrated in the central northern regions of the country. In poor provinces such as Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, coal is one of the most important industries. This concentration ensures that China’s coal industrywhich provides more than half the country’s energy needshas a strong voice at the national level, including among top leaders. The Party is no doubt reluctant to induce economic disaster in poor, politically important areas of the country. In addition, provincial governments retain enormous power over policy implementation, and are adept at resisting national policies through half-hearted implementation and misreporting. Such tactics have done much to undermine environmental regulation in China generally. For Beijing to overcome these habits, it would have to invest significant political capital in badgering regional governments to reduce emissions.</strong><br />

<strong><u>U.S. deterrence strong now in Asia and Middle East – North Korea, China and Iran perceive U.S. superiority</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Reed, 10/11</strong> (Matthew M. Reed, Managing Editor, 10/11/10, International Affairs Review, “The Return of American Muscle,” <span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iar-gwu.org/node/202" rel="nofollow">http://www.iar-gwu.org/node/202</a></span>, JMP)<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>Alarmists are convinced the United States is losing ground around the world. Two critical regions make them particularly anxious: Asia and the Middle East, where American power is challenged by big competitors and small rogue states. Both regions are also home to opaque nuclear programs and anti-American regimes; North Korea possesses nuclear warheads, while Iran most likely wants the same. Worse yet, America’s position is compromised by military and economic challenges, as it concludes two major wars and struggles to recover from a fierce recession. If the triple threat of China, North Korea, and Iran remains unchecked – as some claim it might– <strong>it would be news to these countries and their capitals. The US responded to each challenge symbolically and substantively in 2010.</strong> In some cases, it explicitly declared its intent while in others, it pursued bold action and empowerment measures. The return of American muscle is a reminder that no power can project force like the US and no country enjoys the multitude of friends who share its strategic vision (e.g. hemming in China, countering Iran, isolating North Korea). <strong>Any swan song is premature.</strong> This year’s warning shots were fired loudest in Asia, where the US and South Korea held a series of massive war games following North Korea’s alleged attack on a South Korean vessel in March. By July, thousands of Americans and South Koreans were mobilized for anti-submarine drills and joint maneuvers off the coast of North Korea – a combined effort that left no doubts about American resolve in Asia. &quot;These defensive, combined exercises are designed to send a clear message to North Korea that its aggressive behavior must stop, and that we are committed to together enhancing our combined defensive capabilities,&quot; read a July statement from US Defense Secretary Robert Gates. North Korea is not the only target of American posturing. The US’s expansive role in Asian waters is raising alarms in Beijing as well. US and Japanese navies are scheduled for drills off the coast of Okinawa in December. Last month, US and South Korean forces launched joint exercises in the Yellow Sea – water considered vital to China. And in August, the US staged joint maneuvers in the South China Sea with Vietnam, a country whose territorial claims frequently clash with the People’s Republic. The frequency of these drills is a direct consequence of renewed fears among China’s neighbors. China’s maritime assertiveness – specifically its claims to regional waters and recent deployments of advanced submarines and destroyers – has given new urgency to American primacy in Asia. As The Economist noted in August, “Absent without leave, America helped foster an overblown perception in the region of America’s decline and China’s ascent. It is now putting that right,” with <strong>high-profile displays of power and solidarity.</strong> Regional fears are also allowing the US to strengthen its position in the Persian Gulf, where Iran’s ambitions are creating consensus. This year has been punctuated by significant arms deals between the US and states like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. Although the $60 billion deal with Saudi Arabia received the most attention, Kuwait and the UAE are both expecting deliveries of sophisticated anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems soon, thus offsetting the threat posed by Iranian warheads. Not surprisingly, Qatar and Bahrain are both abstaining from the American-sponsored arms race, and with good reason: both maintain sizable US bases that already protect them from Iranian aggression. In May, the US broke ground in Bahrain for the purposes of doubling the size of its naval base there, which is situated directly across the Persian Gulf from Iran. This combination of new weapons systems and anti-missile technology ensures a more hostile environment for Iran, one in which its threats are cheapened and American allies are immune to intimidation. By empowering friendly states and flexing American muscle in the form of joint drills and deployments, <strong>the US is dispelling the myth that the world’s only superpower is neither super nor powerful.</strong> The Beltway is momentarily full of pessimists but <strong>America’s profile in Beijing, Riyadh, Seoul, Tehran, and Pyongyang is consequential like no other.</strong> Critical US allies are enjoying new resources and priority, while challengers to the American order suffer from isolation (North Korea), the threat of overwhelming force (Iran), and territorial push-back (China).<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>WASHINGTON, Sept. 16, 2010 - The sinking in March of the South Korean ship Cheonan <strong>underscores the importance of U.S. troops</strong> to security in Northeast Asia and the defense of South Korea, top defense officials told Congress today. &quot;North Korea's torpedo attack is a somber reminder of the active threat North Korea poses to regional stability,&quot; Wallace &quot;Chip&quot; Gregson, assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs, said. &quot;In such a high-threat environment, the [U.S.-South Korean] alliance mission to deter and defend takes on added significance and is our primary focus.&quot; Speaking to the Senate Armed Service Committee, Gregson expressed his concern with North Korea's attack, which killed 46 South Korean sailors, and its continued pursuit of nuclear weapons. North Korean arms sales and continued defiance of United Nations security resolutions, he added, pose a threat not only to South Korea, but also to the entire region. &quot;[North Korea's] proven track record of marrying capabilities with deadly intent has resulted in <strong>unnecessary crisis, tension escalation</strong>, and as the attack on the Cheonan demonstrated, tragic loss of life,&quot; he said. Gregson, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general, said deterring North Korea requires a complex military solution. North Korea's conventional threat and pursuit of ballistic and nuclear capabilities causes concern in Washington and in the South Korean capital of Seoul, he said. North Korea's military is adapted to the U.S.-South Korea conventional military partnership, Gregson said, and has developed tactics and weapons systems that may allow North Korea to avoid confronting its targets. &quot;In the context of [North Korean] efforts to develop a nuclear program, its ballistic missile efforts become an even greater concern,&quot; he said. &quot;Nuclear and ballistic missiles, if developed and fielded, would pose a threat to regional peace and stability that would be <strong>orders of magnitude greater</strong> than the already heightened threat. &quot;North Korea may become embolden to pursue even more provocative activities than we have witnessed in recent years,&quot; he continued, &quot;if it makes significant strides in its development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology.&quot; Gregson said he is confident the U.S.-South Korean partnership will improve peace in the region, but to sustain international peace and security, <strong>the U.S. military must remain postured in South Korea.</strong> &quot;To preserve our security commitment to the Republic of Korea, the United States <strong>must maintain a forward military posture,&quot;</strong> he said. &quot;[Having] 28,500 troops stationed somewhere in the United States does not have the same deterrent effect as the same number stationed in Korea. It is our forward presence that most effectively <strong>communicates our resolve to defend our allies and preserve our vital interests in Asia. Successful deterrence relies on credibility as much, if not more than, capability.&quot;</strong> The Strategic Alliance 2015 agreement ensures nearly 30,000 American troops will remain in South Korea until 2015. According to the 1953 armistice that established a cease-fire to the Korean War, the U.S. military would maintain operational control of combined defenses until 2012. But South Korean President Lee Myung-bak asked to extend the transition to 2015 as a result of the Cheonan attack. President Barack Obama agreed. Army Gen. Walter L. &quot;Skip&quot; Sharp, commander of U.S. forces in Korea, testified with Gregson. He said he believes the Cheonan attack will not be the last by North Korea, and that the regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons and long-range capabilities suggest North Korea will continue to threaten the region. &quot;The conventional threat continues, but we now face an enemy capable of using a number of asymmetrical means to threaten its neighbors, while also violating past agreements, international norms and the United Nations Security Council resolution,&quot; he said. The new alliance agreement, which Sharp introduced last week, means more joint training and exercises. The two nations have launched a series of air, land and sea exercises to better prepare South Korea defenses, he said. Strategic Alliance 2015 synchronizes South Korean and U.S. transformation initiatives as the alliance prepares for the transfer of operational control for combined defense, Sharp said, and it demonstrates the U.S. commitment to South Korea. &quot;Strategic Alliance 2015 will enable the Republic of Korea and U.S. forces to successfully confront future security challenges and set the conditions for lasting peace in the Korean peninsula and the region,&quot; the general said. &quot;The Republic of Korea and the United States are more strongly united than ever before to deter North Korean provocations and aggression, and to defeat them if necessary.&quot;<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u>The impact is a collapse of global hegemony, rapid Japan remilitarization, Taiwan conflict and instability in India-Pakistan and Korea</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Goh, 8</strong> – Lecturer in International Relations in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the Univ of Oxford (Evelyn, International Relations of the Asia-Pacific, “Hierarchy and the role of the United States in the East Asian security order,” 2008 8(3):353-377, Oxford Journals Database, JMP)<strong></u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u></strong>The centrality of these mutual processes of assurance and deference means that the stability of a hierarchical order is fundamentally related to a collective sense of certainty about the leadership and order of the hierarchy. This certainty is rooted in a combination of material calculations – smaller states' assurance that the expected costs of the dominant state conquering them would be higher than the benefits – and ideational convictions – the sense of legitimacy, derived from shared values and norms that accompanies the super-ordinate state's authority in the social order. The empirical analysis in the next section shows that regional stability in East Asia in the post-Second World War years can be correlated to the degree of collective certainty about the US-led regional hierarchy. East Asian stability and instability has been determined by U.S. assurances, self-confidence, and commitment to maintaining its primary position in the regional hierarchy; the perceptions and confidence of regional states about US commitment; and the reactions of subordinate states in the region to the varied challengers to the regional hierarchical order. 4. Hierarchy and the East Asian security order Currently, the regional hierarchy in East Asia is still dominated by the United States. Since the 1970s, China has increasingly claimed the position of second-ranked great power, a claim that is today legitimized by the hierarchical deference shown by smaller subordinate powers such as South Korea and Southeast Asia. Japan and South Korea can, by virtue of their alliance with the United States, be seen to occupy positions in a third layer of regional major powers, while India is ranked next on the strength of its new strategic relationship with Washington. North Korea sits outside the hierarchic order but affects it due to its military prowess and nuclear weapons capability. Apart from making greater sense of recent history, conceiving of the US' role in East Asia as the dominant state in the regional hierarchy helps to clarify three critical puzzles in the contemporary international and East Asian security landscape. First, it contributes to explaining the lack of sustained challenges to American global preponderance after the end of the Cold War. Three of the key potential global challengers to US unipolarity originate in Asia (China, India, and Japan), and their support for or acquiescence to, US dominance have helped to stabilize its global leadership. Through its dominance of the Asian regional hierarchy, the United States has been able to neutralize the potential threats to its position from Japan via an alliance, from India by gradually identifying and pursuing mutual commercial and strategic interests, and from China by encircling and deterring it with allied and friendly states that support American preponderance. Secondly, recognizing US hierarchical preponderance further explains contemporary under-balancing in Asia, both against a rising China, and against incumbent American power. I have argued that one defining characteristic of a hierarchical system is voluntary subordination of lesser states to the dominant state, and that this goes beyond rationalistic bandwagoning because it is manifested in a social contract that comprises the related processes of hierarchical assurance and hierarchical deference. Critically, successful and sustainable hierarchical assurance and deference helps to explain why Japan is not yet a ‘normal’ country. Japan has experienced significant impetus to revise and expand the remit of its security forces in the last 15 years. Yet, these pressures continue to be insufficient to prompt a wholesale revision of its constitution and its remilitarization. The reason is that the United States extends its security umbrella over Japan through their alliance, which has led Tokyo not only to perceive no threat from US dominance, but has in fact helped to forge a security community between them (Nau, 2003). Adjustments in burden sharing in this alliance since the 1990s have arisen not from greater independent Japanese strategic activism, but rather from periods of strategic uncertainty and crises for Japan when it appeared that American hierarchical assurance, along with US' position at the top of the regional hierarchy, was in question. Thus, the Japanese priority in taking on more responsibility for regional security has been to improve its ability to facilitate the US' central position, rather than to challenge it.13 In the face of the security threats from North Korea and China, Tokyo's continued reliance on the security pact with the United States is rational. While there remains debate about Japan's re-militarization and the growing clout of nationalist ‘hawks’ in Tokyo, for regional and domestic political reasons, a sustained ‘normalization’ process cannot take place outside of the restraining framework of the United States–Japan alliance (Samuels, 2007; Pyle, 2007). Abandoning the alliance will entail Japan making a conscience choice not only to remove itself from the US-led hierarchy, but also to challenge the United States dominance directly. The United States–ROK alliance may be understood in a similar way, although South Korea faces different sets of constraints because of its strategic priorities related to North Korea. As J.J. Suh argues, in spite of diminishing North Korean capabilities, which render the US security umbrella less critical, the alliance endures because of mutual identification – in South Korea, the image of the US as ‘the only conceivable protector against aggression from the North,’ and in the United States, an image of itself as protector of an allied nation now vulnerable to an ‘evil’ state suspected of transferring weapons of mass destruction to terrorist networks (Suh, 2004). Kang, in contrast, emphasizes how South Korea has become less enthusiastic about its ties with the United States – as indicated by domestic protests and the rejection of TMD – and points out that Seoul is not arming against a potential land invasion from China but rather maritime threats (Kang, 2003, pp.79–80). These observations are valid, but they can be explained by hierarchical deference toward the United States, rather than China. The ROK's military orientation reflects its identification with and dependence on the United States and its adoption of US' strategic aims. In spite of its primary concern with the North Korean threat, Seoul's formal strategic orientation is toward maritime threats, in line with Washington's regional strategy. Furthermore, recent South Korean Defense White Papers habitually cited a remilitarized Japan as a key threat. The best means of coping with such a threat would be continued reliance on the US security umbrella and on Washington's ability to restrain Japanese remilitarization (Eberstadt et al., 2007). Thus, while the United States–ROK bilateral relationship is not always easy, its durability is based on South Korea's fundamental acceptance of the United States as the region's primary state and reliance on it to defend and keep regional order. It also does not rule out Seoul and other US allies conducting business and engaging diplomatically with China. India has increasingly adopted a similar strategy vis-à-vis China in recent years. Given its history of territorial and political disputes with China and its contemporary economic resurgence, India is seen as the key potential power balancer to a growing China. Yet, India has sought to negotiate settlements about border disputes with China, and has moved significantly toward developing closer strategic relations with the United States. Apart from invigorated defense cooperation in the form of military exchange programs and joint exercises, the key breakthrough was the agreement signed in July 2005 which facilitates renewed bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation (Mohan, 2007). Once again, this is a key regional power that could have balanced more directly and independently against China, but has rather chosen to align itself or bandwagon with the primary power, the United States, partly because of significant bilateral gains, but fundamentally in order to support the latter's regional order-managing function. Recognizing a regional hierarchy and seeing that the lower layers of this hierarchy have become more active since the mid-1970s also allows us to understand why there has been no outright balancing of China by regional states since the 1990s. On the one hand, the US position at the top of the hierarchy has been revived since the mid-1990s, meaning that deterrence against potential Chinese aggression is reliable and in place.14 On the other hand, the aim of regional states is to try to consolidate China's inclusion in the regional hierarchy at the level below that of the United States, not to keep it down or to exclude it. East Asian states recognize that they cannot, without great cost to themselves, contain Chinese growth. But they hope to socialize China by enmeshing it in peaceful regional norms and economic and security institutions. They also know that they can also help to ensure that the capabilities gap between China and the United States remains wide enough to deter a power transition. Because this strategy requires persuading China about the appropriateness of its position in the hierarchy and of the legitimacy of the US position, all East Asian states engage significantly with China, with the small Southeast Asian states refusing openly to ‘choose sides’ between the United States and China. Yet, hierarchical deference continues to explain why regional institutions such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN + 3, and East Asian Summit have made limited progress. While the United State has made room for regional multilateral institutions after the end of the Cold War, its hierarchical preponderance also constitutes the regional order to the extent that it cannot comfortably be excluded from any substantive strategic developments. On the part of some lesser states (particularly Japan and Singapore), hierarchical deference is manifested in inclusionary impulses (or at least impulses not to exclude the United States or US proxies) in regional institutions, such as the East Asia Summit in December 2005. Disagreement on this issue with others, including China and Malaysia, has stymied potential progress in these regional institutions (Malik, 2006). Finally, conceiving of a US-led East Asian hierarchy amplifies our understanding of how and why the United States–China relationship is now the key to regional order. The vital nature of the Sino-American relationship stems from these two states' structural positions. As discussed earlier, China is the primary second-tier power in the regional hierarchy. However, as Chinese power grows and Chinese activism spreads beyond Asia, the United States is less and less able to see China as merely a regional power – witness the growing concerns about Chinese investment and aid in certain African countries. This causes a disjuncture between US global interests and US regional interests. Regional attempts to engage and socialize China are aimed at mediating its intentions. This process, however, cannot stem Chinese growth, which forms the material basis of US threat perceptions. Apprehensions about the growth of China's power culminates in US fears about the region being ‘lost’ to China, echoing Cold War concerns that transcribed regional defeats into systemic setbacks.15 On the other hand, the US security strategy post-Cold War and post-9/11 have regional manifestations that disadvantage China. The strengthening of US alliances with Japan and Australia; and the deployment of US troops to Central, South, and Southeast Asia all cause China to fear a consolidation of US global hegemony that will first threaten Chinese national security in the regional context and then stymie China's global reach. Thus, the key determinants of the East Asian security order relate to two core questions: (i) Can the US be persuaded that China can act as a reliable ‘regional stakeholder’ that will help to buttress regional stability and US global security aims;16 and (ii) can China be convinced that the United States has neither territorial ambitions in Asia nor the desire to encircle China, but will help to promote Chinese development and stability as part of its global security strategy? (Wang, 2005). But, these questions cannot be asked in the abstract, outside the context of negotiation about their relative positions in the regional and global hierarchies. One urgent question for further investigation is how the process of assurance and deference operate at the topmost levels of a hierarchy? When we have two great powers of unequal strength but contesting claims and a closing capabilities gap in the same regional hierarchy, how much scope for negotiation is there, before a reversion to balancing dynamics? This is the main structural dilemma: as long as the United States does not give up its primary position in the Asian regional hierarchy, China is very unlikely to act in a way that will provide comforting answers to the two questions. Yet, the East Asian regional order has been and still is constituted by US hegemony, and to change that could be extremely disruptive and may lead to regional actors acting in highly destabilizing ways. <strong>Rapid Japanese remilitarization, armed conflict across the Taiwan Straits, Indian nuclear brinksmanship directed toward Pakistan, or a highly destabilized Korean peninsula are all illustrative of potential regional disruptions.</strong> 5. Conclusion To construct a coherent account of East Asia's evolving security order, I have suggested that the United States is the central force in constituting regional stability and order. The major patterns of equilibrium and turbulence in the region since 1945 can be explained by the relative stability of the US position at the top of the regional hierarchy, with periods of greatest insecurity being correlated with greatest uncertainty over the American commitment to managing regional order. Furthermore, relationships of hierarchical assurance and hierarchical deference explain the unusual character of regional order in the post-Cold War era. However, the greatest contemporary challenge to East Asian order is the potential conflict between China and the United States over rank ordering in the regional hierarchy, a contest made more potent because of the inter-twining of regional and global security concerns. Ultimately, though, investigating such questions of positionality requires conceptual lenses that go beyond basic material factors because it entails social and normative questions. How can China be brought more into a leadership position, while being persuaded to buy into shared strategic interests and constrain its own in ways that its vision of regional and global security may eventually be reconciled with that of the United States and other regional players? How can Washington be persuaded that its central position in the hierarchy must be ultimately shared in ways yet to be determined? The future of the East Asian security order is tightly bound up with the durability of the United States' global leadership and regional domination. At the regional level, the main scenarios of disruption are an outright Chinese challenge to US leadership, or the defection of key US allies, particularly Japan. Recent history suggests, and the preceding analysis has shown, that challenges to or defections from US leadership will come at junctures where it appears that the US commitment to the region is in doubt, which in turn destabilizes the hierarchical order. At the global level, American geopolitical over-extension will be the key cause of change. This is the one factor that could lead to both greater regional and global turbulence, if only by the attendant strategic uncertainly triggering off regional challenges or defections. However, it is notoriously difficult to gauge thresholds of over-extension. More positively, East Asia is a region that has adjusted to previous periods of uncertainty about US primacy. Arguably, the regional consensus over the United States as primary state in a system of benign hierarchy could accommodate a shifting of the strategic burden to US allies like Japan and Australia as a means of systemic preservation. The alternatives that could surface as a result of not doing so would appear to be much worse.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>6. Interstate War, Down but Far from Out Logically, the reverse side of the coin which proclaims a trend favoring political violence internal to states is the claim that interstate warfare is becoming, or has become, a historical curiosity. Steven Metz and Raymond Millen assure us that “most armed conflicts in coming decades are likely to be internal ones.”21 That is probably a safe prediction, though one might choose to be troubled by their prudent hedging with the qualifier “most.” Their plausible claim would look a little different in hindsight were it to prove true except for a <strong>mere one or two interstate nuclear conflicts,</strong> say between India and Pakistan, or North Korea and the United States and its allies. The same authors also offer the comforting judgment that “decisive war between major states is rapidly moving toward history’s dustbin.”22 It is an attractive claim; it is a shame that it is wrong. War, let alone “decisive war,” between major states currently is enjoying an off-season for one main reason: So extreme is the imbalance of military power in favor of the United States that potential rivals rule out policies that might lead to hostilities with the superpower. It is fashionable to argue that major interstate war is yesterday’s problem—recall that the yesterday in question is barely 15 years in the past—because now there is nothing to fight about and nothing to be gained by armed conflict. Would that those points were true; unfortunately they are not. The menace of major, if not necessarily decisive, <strong>interstate war will return to frighten us when great-power rivals feel able to challenge American hegemony.</strong> If you read Thucydides, or Donald Kagan, you will be reminded of the deadly and eternal influence of the triad of motives for war: “fear, honor, and interest.”23<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Withdrawal causes miscalc, arms racing, and regional conflicts that escalates to nuclear use</u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u></strong>Rumors of a substantial drawdown or complete withdrawal of US Forces Korea (USFK) have been around for decades. After years of a South Korean administration generally hostile to US regional objectives and priorities, perhaps the rumors are finally becoming a reality. That would be a tragedy for both sides. If the US were to leave Korea, how would US influence in the region be altered? How would Korea's relationships with China and Japan change? What about the strengthening US-Japan alliance? What if North Korea collapsed? These questions have largely escaped critical consideration in the current debate. Despite President Roh Moo-hyun's stunning obliviousness to political and security realities, South Korea would be particularly vulnerable without USFK, or even with a token force left in place. For its part, the US cannot realistically expect to maintain or improve its ability to exert regional influence by leaving Korea. Like US Forces Japan (USFJ), America's Korean contingent helps prevent conflict by acting as a strong deterrent for any nation that might consider military actions or threats, at the same time moderating the responses of the host nation in tense situations. Obviously, the original purpose of the US-South Korea alliance was to counter the North Korean threat. However, as that threat has waned, a more important, diplomatically incorrect <strong>mission has evolved</strong> in addition to deterring North Korea: ensuring stability among China, Japan and Korea. The North Korean threat is nonetheless the reason for the majority of South Korea's defenses, even if Seoul won't say so in defense white papers. No conventional military calculus suggests the possibility of a North Korean victory in a second Korean War, but <strong>a weaker South Korean military could cause Pyongyang to miscalculate.</strong> South Korea's defenses must remain strong. Regional tensions, but stability Even with USFK in Korea, issues from the region's long and often confrontational history cause tensions to flare. Chinese claims that Koguryo, an ancient ethnically Korean kingdom whose territories extended into present-day China, was in fact a Chinese kingdom have raised Korean hackles on several occasions. The move is viewed as the possible groundwork for justifying a Chinese invasion of the northern half of the peninsula, perhaps to &quot;help&quot; a North Korea on the verge of implosion, or after collapse. China's plans to register Mount Baekdu (Changbai in Chinese) as a Chinese historical site with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Geopark list was also viewed as a possible prelude to claiming North Korean territory. The mountain, sacred to both sides, straddles the border. A 1962 agreement between the two countries split ownership of the mountain. This view is bolstered by the fact that China prefers to retain border buffer zones and would not relish having a reunified Korea, potentially with US forces just across the Yalu River. South Korea could not prevent China from sending troops into North Korea, and the US likely would not risk war with China over North Korea. Japan's colonial domination of Korea from 1910 to 1945 has left a deep and bitter resentment in both Koreas that is apt to provoke emotional and drastic responses. One high-profile manifestation of this is the decades-long dispute over the ownership of some relatively insignificant islets in the waters between the peninsula and the archipelago, the Liancourt Rocks. Known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan, South Korea has stationed a Coast Guard contingent on the island since 1954 to enforce its claim. Both nations claim the area as a part of their exclusive economic zones (EEZs). In 2005 South Korea scrambled fighters to intercept a civilian Japanese Cessna aircraft nearing Dokdo airspace. When Japan announced plans to conduct a hydrographic survey of the area, South Korea made vague threats alluding to possible military action against the research vessels. Japan backed down. Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's numerous visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, dedicated to Japan's war dead including some convicted war criminals, have raised diplomatic tensions with both South Korea and China on several occasions, including a temporary recall of South Korea's ambassador in Japan. Ripe for an arms race South Korea wants to be the &quot;hub&quot; of something in East Asia, and it may finally have its chance, thanks to the Roh administration. The current US-South Korea situation is a case of &quot;be careful of what you ask for because you might get it&quot;. Even so, the <strong>psychological impact</strong> on South Korea of a significant USFK departure likely would not be immediate but should not be underestimated. A massive reduction of US troop levels and capabilities could have the same effect as a complete withdrawal on Seoul's planning processes. It might begin with regretful concern, but could <strong>quickly become panic.</strong> At this point it should be noted that even if the USFK withdraws from Korea, some sort of collaborative security agreement will remain in place. However, South Korea's perception of America's commitment to security on the peninsula is the decisive factor in how it will react to real and perceived threats. What are now relatively minor disagreements with Japan and China would take on a more serious dimension. Without USFK, South Korea would need to vastly increase its defense budget to make up for functions long taken for granted. With American forces on its soil as a safety net, South Korea didn't have to be overly concerned with being attacked or invaded. Many Koreans would perceive that era over. Another factor is the closer US-Japan security partnership, which causes both China and South Korea concern. Some in the South Korean defense sector are undoubtedly jealous of the relationship Japan enjoys with the US. Japan would also need to take into consideration a South Korea without the moderating influence of USFK, although the role of USFJ in Japan would reduce much concern. In such an environment it's not unthinkable that a few minor skirmishes could occur, between South Korean and Japanese navel vessels in the vicinity of Dokdo, for example. This would be the slow start of a regional arms race, with Korea and Japan joining China's ongoing buildup. A reunified Korea could go nuclear North Korea is the wildcard. If in the next few years reunification were to occur - through a North Korean collapse, the death of Kim Jong-il, or a possible but unlikely mutual agreement - South Korea would suddenly find itself straddled with the enormous cost of integrating North Korea. These costs would dwarf the already massive increase South Korea would have been undertaking in defense spending, something it would clearly be unprepared and unable to accomplish while maintaining its defense investment. A Korea faced with an economic dilemma of such magnitude would find maintaining its conventional military forces at current levels impossible. At the same time, it would feel more vulnerable than ever, even with US security assurances. For a nation paranoid about the possibility of outside influence or military intervention, strapped for cash, and obsessed about its position in the international hierarchy, the obvious route might be to either incorporate North Korean nuclear devices (if they actually exist), or build their own, something South Korean technicians could easily accomplish. North Korea, after all, has set the example for economically challenged nations looking for the ultimate in deterrence. One might argue that clear and firm US security guarantees for a reunified Korea would be able to dissuade any government from choosing the nuclear option. If making decisions based purely on logic the answer would be probably yes. Unfortunately, the recent Korean leadership has established a record of being motivated more by emotional and nationalistic factors than logical or realistic ones. Antics over Dokdo and the Yasukuni Shrine and alienating the US serve as examples. But the continuation of the &quot;Sunshine Policy&quot; tops those. Instead of admitting they've been sold a dead horse, the Roh administration continued riding the rotting and bloated beast known as the Sunshine Policy, until all that are left today are a pile of bones, a bit of dried skin, and a few tufts of dirty hair. Roh, however, is still in the saddle, if not as firmly after North Korea's recent missile tests. Japan must then consider its options in countering an openly nuclear, reunified Korea without USFK. Already building momentum to change its constitution to clarify its military, it's not inconceivable that Japan would ultimately consider going nuclear to deter Korea. As in South Korea, there is <strong>no technological barrier</strong> preventing Japan from building nuclear weapons. While the details of the race and escalation of tensions can vary in any number of ways and are not inevitable, that an arms race would occur is probable. Only the perception of threat and vulnerability need be present for this to occur. East Asia could <strong>become a nuclear powder keg</strong> ready to explode over something as childish as the Dokdo/Takeshima dispute between Korea and Japan, a Diaoyu/Senkakus dispute between China and Japan, or the Koguryo dispute between Korea and China. The arms race need not occur One could argue that the US would be able to step in and moderate things before such an escalation could occur. Considering the recent US record on influencing either North or South Korea, it is perhaps unwise to count on it being able to do so at some crucial point in the future. One could also argue that the US need not be involved in a future East Asian war. Like assuming there is no need for USFK since North Korea is considered less of a threat to Seoul, that is wishful thinking. The US has too many political and diplomatic ties, aside from alliance obligations, to ignore such a war. For American policymakers, the notion that a withdrawal is a deserved payback for the rampant anti-Americanism in South Korea, or that the few billion we spend on defense there is a catastrophic waste, need to be discarded. The potential cost of a war would be far greater in both American lives and in dollars, the benefits of continued peace immeasurable. Vastly reducing or withdrawing USFK can only harm US security, it cannot help it. USFK has helped maintain peace and allowed the US to <strong>project influence</strong> in the region for the past six decades; removing that presence would be foolish and difficult to replicate once done. It is also important to keep in mind that the next presidential election will likely result in a less anti-American administration. South Korean policymakers and citizens alike need to come to terms with the fact that Korea will probably never be a powerful nation, but because of its location it will always be important in the geopolitical sense. Because of this, Korea can never take the middle ground or play a &quot;balancing&quot; role; Korea must choose sides. Finally, the reality that both American and South Korean policymakers need to come to terms with is that USFK deterring a second North Korean invasion has become a secondary mission to maintaining regional stability, even in a reunified Korea.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Arms races cause extinction</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Cimbala, 10</strong> - Prof. of Political Science @ Penn State, (Stephen, Nuclear Weapons and Cooperative Security in the 21st Century, p. 117-8)<strong></u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u></strong>Failure to contain proliferation in Pyongyang could spread nuclear fever throughout Asia. Japan and South Korea might seek nuclear weapons and missile defenses. A pentagonal configuration of nuclear powers in the Pacific basis (Russia, China, Japan, and the two Koreas – not including the United States, with its own Pacific interests) could put deterrence at risk and create <strong>enormous temptation toward nuclear preemption</strong>. Apart from actual use or threat of use, North Korea could exploit the mere existence of an assumed nuclear capability in order to support its coercive diplomacy. As George H. Quester has noted: If the Pyongyang regime plays its cards sensibly and well, therefore, the world will not see its nuclear weapons being used against Japan or South Korea or anyone else, but will rather see this new nuclear arsenal held in reserve (just as the putative Israeli nuclear arsenal has been held in reserve), as a deterrent against the outside world’s applying maximal pressure on Pyongyang and as a bargaining chip to extract the economic and political concessions that the DPRK needs if it wishes to avoid giving up its peculiar approach to social engineering. A five-sided nuclear competition in the Pacific would be linked, in geopolitical deterrence and proliferation space, to the existing nuclear deterrents in India and Pakistan, and to the emerging nuclear weapons status of Iran. An arc of nuclear instability from Tehran to Tokyo could place U.S. proliferation strategies into the ash heap of history and call for more drastic military options, not excluding preemptive war, defenses, and counter-deterrent special operations. In addition, an eight-sided nuclear arms race in Asia would increase the likelihood of accidental or inadvertent nuclear war. It would do so because: (1) some of these states already have histories of protracted conflict; (2) states may have politically unreliable or immature command and control systems, especially during a crisis involving a decision for nuclear first strike or retaliation; unreliable or immature systems might permit a technical malfunction that caused an unintended launch, or a deliberate but unauthorized launch by rogue commanders; (3) faulty intelligence and warning systems might cause one side to misinterpret the other’s defensive moves to forestall attack as offensive preparations for attack, thus triggering a mistaken preemption.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong><span style="color: black;">Conclusion </span><strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong><span style="color: black;">South Korea can be considered a relatively stable nation, even though it still is participating in the later stages of an emerging market economy. North Korea, on the other hand, is at the extreme &quot;nation in crisis&quot; end of the spectrum. North Korea's ability to survive as a nation intact, given its recent economic failure and continuing questionable government, is the dominant factor in North-South relations and a significant factor in focusing so much U.S. interest on this region of the world. Stability on the Korean peninsula is vital to the security of East Asia, and the security of East Asia is, in turn, vital to the security of the United States. The foundation of relations with a reunified Korea in the next century will be laid in the U.S. actions of this decade. Forward presence is the linchpin of any Pacific strategy and U.S. forces on the Korean Peninsula provide the framework for engagement and enlargement outlined in the National Security Strategy. </span><strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong><span style="color: black;">It should be remembered that the incident which precipitated the Korean War was a speech by U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson in January 1950 which diagrammed a U.S. insular defense that excluded Korea, giving the impression to Kim Il Sung that there would be no interference from Washington in a Korean conflict. There is no better insurance against a repeat performance and no better way for the United States to demonstrate a commitment to the security of its Korean ally than forward deployed American forces. An agreement made in good faith now with the ROK has the best chance of surviving the Korean reunification and will create a solid foundation for what is sure to be turbulent political and economic times. Fostering a long-term relationship requires new thinking on the alliance framework between the United States and South Korea to achieve a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without conflict.(21) </span><strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>However, Carpenter has long advocated a unilateral withdrawal of our U.S. forces from the Republic of Korea, under the guise of arguing that such a reduction of U.S. forces would save tax-payer dollars, as well as U.S. lives, should there be an armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>In fact, Carpenter, in conversations I have had with him, readily agrees that a U.S. withdrawal from the Korean Peninsula might very well precipitate an invasion by the communists in the North with the aim of quickly capturing Seoul and then suing for peace in an agreement that would eventually give control over a unified country to the communists.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Apart from the fact that U.S. forces withdrawn from the ROK would be redeployed elsewhere in the U.S. and thus save the U.S. taxpayers nothing and given that U.S. military forces deployed overseas and at home have declined by over 1 million soldiers since the end of the Cold War, a withdrawal from the ROK by the United States would do nothing except cause another Korean War, kill millions of Korean civilians and soldiers and place in danger the ability of Japan to maintain its economy in the face of a Korean Peninsula in communist hands. As every Commander of U.S. forces in Korea since 1979 has told Congress in public testimony, Japan is not defensible if Korea is taken by the communists. A blockade of trade routes to and from Japan would become a realistic weapon in the hands of the PRC, not dissimilar to a blockade of Taiwan by the PRC portrayed by Patrick Robinson in Kilo Class.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>Regional tasks – From a regional, strategic point of view, the importance of the US forces is threefold: preventing any changes in the balance of power in the region (Cumings, 1983; Clark, 1992); acting as a regional pacifier by allowing the US to respond very quickly and prevent a conflict from escalating in case a conflict arises outside or within the Korean Peninsula; and signaling US commitment not only to Korea but also to Japan and other Asian US allies in the region (Lee, 1978, pp. 107–108, 1982, p. 102).<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>Today, North Korea provides an ideal excuse for some Japanese to discuss openly their country’s nuclear option. At this point, only Pyongyang poses a real threat to war in Asia, but the probability of this is still low. The world does not need George W. Bush in the White House to know what the United States will do to North Korea if it decided to attack South Korea or Japan. The response would be immediate and devastating, creating reconstruction and refugee problems. <strong>If</strong>, in this horrendous scenario, <strong>the U</strong>nited <strong>S</strong>tates <strong>proved insufficient to deter North Korean aggression</strong>, than <strong>it is hard to imagine how Japan could do any better</strong>. If Tokyo were to embark on a nuclear program, the historical antagonism between Japan and North Korea would only contribute to provoking Pyongyang in a manner the international community is trying so hard to avoid. Any escalation of the threat carries the danger of breaking down deterrence. So, even among Tokyo’s hawks, a nuclear Japan, propelled by fear of abandonment and North Korean belligerence, makes little security sense.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>An emerging challenge illustrated by the spread of SARS in 2004 is the need to coordinate in response to the spread of pandemic diseases. In many ways, the SARS epidemic was a wake-up call that served to raise awareness among publics and governments of the need to promote functional cooperation in this area. The promotion of a coordinated political response that explicitly includes coordination on threats to nontraditional security issues such as the spread of pandemic diseases not only provides an opportunity to encourage new forms of coordinated early warning and response capacity—for instance, through the promotion of new and closer relationships between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and South Korean counterpart agencies—but also can serve to promote technical exchange and capacity building to enhance the capability of both nations to respond. Some of this work has already been initiated through global and regional coordination efforts under the auspices of the United Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), and respective national emergency management and health administration authorities including the KCDC (Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). As an industrialized nation with an advanced health research sector, South Korean scientists are well-placed to take leading roles in coordination, detection, and prevention efforts in connection with the H5N1 virus and mutated strains of bird flu. Many of these strains are originating in Southeast Asia, but the migratory path of some species of these birds puts South Korea on the front line as a population that could be affected by such mutations.32 In addition, given KOICA’s level of commitment and activity in Southeast Asia, the agency might consider focusing some of its ODA and technical cooperation toward the building of capacity to respond to such pandem- ics—for instance, by providing anti-virals and test kits, supporting distribution planning, develop- ing relevant human resources, and enhancing surveillance systems. The alliance provides an existing infrastructure and opportunity to promote technical cooperation among military specialists on the broader security implications of fighting against pandemic diseases and opportunities for coordinated action in response to such a threat. For instance, pro- motion of best practices in response to any outbreak of infectious disease and capacity to respond to such a threat, information sharing, and joint research on causes of and responses to pandemic diseases may provide both governments with early warning regarding new types of threats and a resulting enhanced capacity to protect publics in both countries from harm.33<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Turns regionalism—Goh says that the biggest internal link into Asian stability is US presence—prefer our evidence—it’s based on empirical reactions to changes in US force posture and the perception of decreased commitment—solves cooperation</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Ryoo, 4</strong> (Winter 2004, Jae-Kap Ryoo, Kyonggi University, “U.S.-Korea Security Alliance in Transition: A ROK Perspective,” International Journal of Korean Studies, Fall/Winter 2004, Vol. IIX, No. 1)<strong></u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u></strong>Within this framework combining bilateralism and multilateralism, the ROK-U.S. alliance system can be re-adjusted and re-defined to maintain in the near future regional peace and stability. To achieve this goal, the United States should re-adjust and re-define the strategic role of U.S. forces in Korea, to act not only from the perspective of the Korean peninsula but also from the broader framework of maintaining the geopolitical equilibrium, or balance of power, in Northeast Asia.78 From the Chinese perspective, the ROK-U.S. alliance is a stabilizing force that restrains South Korea against the North and reassures Japan as well.79 If the primary goal of the U.S. strategy in Northeast Asia is to achieve regional stability and security, Washington must strengthen and consolidate its bilateral alliances with South Korea and Japan, so that North Korean threats can be deterred and the regional peace maintained. The U.S. military presence in South Korea is therefore closely associated with American strategy for Northeast Asia. Even after the realization of peaceful coexistence between the two Koreas and eventual national unification, U.S. forces should continue to maintain themselves on the peninsula as a deterrent to the potential regional hegemony of China or Japan, and as an effective apparatus for encouraging cooperative efforts to resolve regional issues. This will certainly benefit Korea.80<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Today the U.S. military presence in both South Korea and Japan plays an important role in dampening the potential for tensions arising from regional armed competition. 81 The strongest mechanism to achieve the ultimate goal of more permanent regional peace is certainly to institutionalize a more comprehensive regional collective security organization (i.e., NEATO). But if it is not possible to achieve this end in the immediate future, it is possible and desirable to expand the positive aspects of the bilateral alliance into a broader regional framework. If the bilateral networks based upon the United States’ closer security ties with South Korea and Japan can be “quasi-multilateralized,” it will help induce other countries, including China, to participate more actively in regional, multilateral structures, such as ARF and the Northeast Asia Security Dialogue (NEASED).82 This process of “quasi-multilateralization” of the existing alliance system can be seen as expanding a “virtual alliance” network of U.S. allies. The creation of a “virtual alliance” can be achieved by maintaining the U.S. – Japan alliance, the U.S. – South Korean alliance, and strengthening the bilateral security cooperation between Tokyo and Seoul. Such necessary and achievable steps can contributable to the interests of preserving the long-term peace and stability of the region.83 In creating an inclusive regional security community based on the concept of “cooperative security,” the United States will be exercising its leadership.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>To show that China is not a revisionist state, Chan examines China's adherence to international rules and norms and finds that China not only has refrained from exercising its veto power in the UN Security Council but also has ratified a number of major human rights instruments. China's military expenditures as a percentage of gross national product (GNP) have declined from 3.4 percent in 1989 to 2.3 percent in 1999. Chan concludes that, compared to the United States, &quot;China's conduct and experience do not quite qualify it for revisionism when viewed in a comparative context.&quot; Nonetheless, <strong>such a conclusion confuses revisionist behavior with intentions</strong>. For offensive realism, revisionism refers to intentions, not behavior. A revisionist state is one that harbors malign intentions and is &quot;inclined to look for opportunities to gain more power.&quot;25 A state does not necessarily exhibit revisionist behavior because it may not have the capacity to do so, even though it still harbors revisionist intentions.2 6 <strong>Should the opportunity arise, states will seek to revise the balance of power</strong> in their favor if the expected benefits outweigh the costs. China's current power does not qualify it as a potential hegemon. According to the World Bank, the GDP of the United States in 2002 was US$10.4 trillion, comprising 32.29 percent of the world's total output. China's GDP was US$1.24 trillion, about 12 percent of the size of the American economy.27 China's defense expenditures lag far behind those of the United States. In that same year, the United States spent US$335.7 billion on defense, comprising 42.81 percent of the world's total defense expenditures, while China spent US$31.1 billion, about 9 percent of the U.S. total.28 Given this great disparity in power, China is ill-poised to challenge the United States at this point in time. As Mearsheimer points out, &quot;great powers facing powerful opponents will be less inclined to consider offensive action and more concerned with defending the existing balance from threats by theirmore powerful opponents. Let there be an opportunity for those weaker states to revise the balance in their own favor, however, and they will take advantage of it.&quot;29<strong></u></strong><br />

Japan, of course, would bear the brunt of these consequences, but it could be harmful to U.S. interests as well.

Asia is not where Europe or Latin America are in terms of regional amity. The US presence is more needed in this region, and it earns the US the friendship of the local democracies. It is hard to see how a spiraling arms race, as Japan and China openly start competing for regional leadership, plus perhaps India and China, would help the US.

<strong><u>An American troop withdrawal from Korea, or the downgrading of the U.S. presence into a peacekeeping force, would generate far-reaching reverberations-though some U.S. analysts favor such a course of events. One such reverberation would concern the future of U.S. forward bases in Japan. For Japan to be the only East Asian state hosting U.S. troops, this on top of the continuing controversy in Japanese domestic politics with regard to Okinawa, might be hard to sustain for long. Thus, an American military pullout from South Korea, far from leading to a bolstering of U.S. forces elsewhere in East Asia, might trigger a major diminution of American influence in the Pacific. The worst of all outcomes would be a politically rancorous American withdrawal from Korea at a time when a highly armed North Korean state fronting an effective charm offensive saw opportunities to further its old ambition-the re-unification of the peninsula under its aegis. Those particulars could all too easily set the stage for a potentially</strong> devastating conflict in Korea, with spillover potential to other major powers. <strong>But even presuming genuine rapprochement between North and South and some measure of stability in Korea, an American withdrawal from Korea would still create a security vacuum and invite a latter-day version of the Great Game of realpolitik the Pacific powers played so roughly in the region a century ago. A U.S. military withdrawal from Korea might be welcomed in Moscow or Beijing, but, in truth, both are ambivalent about the departure of the American military presence in Korea. In public they support U.S. withdrawal, but</strong> privately they recognize <strong>that Northeast Asia would be a less stable neighborhood-and a region less disposed to economic growth-without the U.S. military presence. Although any losses-in terms of diminished economic potential and reduced national security-would be distributed unevenly in the region, all the Pacific powers and South Korea would lose from an end to the U.S.-ROK military alliance and the U.S.-dominated security order in East Asia. Of all the political actors in East Asia, only the DPRK-the region's lone radical revisionist state-could reasonably expect any benefits.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Despite this litany of problems both real and perceived, the U.S.-Japan alliance, and the broader relationship it embodies, remains the keystone of U.S. policy in the Asia-Pacific region. There is little doubt that America and Japan share certain core values that tie us together, including a belief in democracy, the rule of law, and civil and individual rights, among others, which should properly inform and inspire our policies abroad. Moreover, after the cataclysm of World War II, we have worked together to maintain stability in the western Pacific, throughout the Cold War and after.</strong> Without the continued Japanese hosting of U.S. forces, our forward-based posture is untenable<strong>, particularly in a period of growing Chinese military power in which the acquisition of advanced weapons systems indicates increased vulnerability of U.S. forces over time. There are over 35,000 U.S. military personnel in Japan, and another 11,000 afloat as part of the 7th Fleet, while three-quarters of our military facilities are in Okinawa. Maintaining this presence is a full-time job for officials on both sides of the Pacific. Both Washington and Tokyo have revised the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) governing the U.S. military in Japan to respond to local concerns over judicial access to U.S. service members, and domestic pressures to reduce Japan's $4 billion annual Host Nation Support (HNS) are a continuing feature of bilateral discussions. The new Japanese government has indicated its desire to consider further revision of SOFA and HNS, which portends continued, sometimes difficult negotiations between both sides, though I would be surprised by any significant changes in either. It is clear, however, that the presence of U.S. military forces is welcomed by nearly all nations in the Asia-Pacific region and</strong> sends a signal of American commitment to the region. <strong>From a historical standpoint, the post-war American presence in the Asia-Pacific has been one of the key enablers of growth and development in that maritime realm. And today, for all its dynamism, the Asia-Pacific remains peppered with territorial disputes and long-standing grievances, with few effective multilateral mechanisms such as exist in Europe for solving interstate conflicts. Our friends and allies in the area are keenly attuned to our continued forward-based posture, and</strong> any indications <strong>that the United States was reducing its presence might be</strong> interpreted by both friends and competitors as a weakening of our long-standing commitment <strong>to maintain stability in the Pacific. The shape of Asian regional politics will continue to evolve, and while I am skeptical of what can realistically be achieved by proposed U.S.-Japan-China trilateral talks, it seems evident that we must approach our alliance with Japan from a more regionally oriented perspective, taking into account how our alliance affects the plans and perceptions of other nations in the region.</u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u>As world events influence changes in U.S. interests, the objectives of the forward military presence in Korea already relate to more than just fulfilling a promise to the Korean nation and opposing North Korean aggression. Serious reduction of U.S. forces, or diplomatic and political activities, may be</strong> interpreted throughout Asia as a declining commitment <strong>to regional stability. After all, the United States maintains forces in Germany today, despite the demise of the Soviet Union and its threat more than ten years ago. In this region, with reliance on bilateral relationships, the effect of U.S. reduced effort in any way would be more profoundly felt. The time is ripe for the United States to lay a foundation and prepare for a future of opportunities, instead of waiting for the inevitable challenges. If the United States desires to protect its national interests in regard to Northeast Asian regional stability, ensure nuclear weapon nonproliferation, access to key markets and resources, and enhance force projection capabilities, the US must maintain a forward-based military presence in a unified Korea.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Nowhere is the trinity of transformation, realignment, and restructuring more vividly demonstrated than in South Korea. There U.S. bases are being consolidated to facilitate the “strategic flexibility” of the U.S. forces. With this flexibility, various U.S. forces can be flown in from outside the region and assembled into a lethal force, and U.S. forces in Korea can be projected out of Korea and Asia to be parts of a larger force. According to the Pentagon plan, the new bases will function as lily pads on which new high-tech forces will land to jump off to far away places. Welcome to the Pentagon’s new world.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Realigning Bases in South Korea</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>This new world entails a major reshuffling of overseas bases, including a significant realignment of U.S. bases in South Korea. The most ambitious part of the realignment is to consolidate most of the U.S. military facilities, now scattered south of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates South Korea from the North, in Pyongtaek City, about 55 miles south of Seoul. Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek City, currently home to U.S. Army Garrison Command and the Area III Support Activity of the U.S. Army Installation Management Command Korea, is expected to absorb most of them. As one of only two planned “enduring hubs,” the camp is slated to grow by as much as 500% by 2012, rocketing from its current 3,500-troop population to more than 17,000, and making it the largest installation on the peninsula. Combined with family members, civilian staff, and contractors, the population is expected to grow to more than 44,000, according to official estimates.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>Ground troops are uniquely key to credible deterrence – navy and air forces aren’t suitable<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Singh and Il-Young, 3 <strong>– <span style="color: black;">senior research fellow at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul and president of the Indo-Korean Policy Forum</span> [2003, Lakhvinder Singh and Il-Young Kim , “Time to Keep Going: The Role and Structure of U.S. Forces in a Unified Korea,” Pacific Focus, Volume 18 Issue 1, Pages 65 – 87, Center for International Studies, Inha University]</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Such intelligence capabilities of the U.S. forces would be a key element of deterrence, and would provide the capability to</strong> swiftly repel enemy attack <strong>with minimal casualties in a unified Korea. In particular, the awareness of Korea's neighbors of such intelligence capabilities would in and of itself, have a</strong> substantial deterrent effect<strong>.27 The U.S. forces in a unified Korea, equipped with high-tech equipment, would be capable of bringing new forms of warfare in the 21st century28 The ROK armed forces has endeavored to acquire and enhance its intelligence collection and management system during the past ten years. However, considering the probable future economic status of a unified Korea, it would be hard to expect South Korea to keep an independent and complete eye on potential enemies. For example, it costs 1 million US dollars per mission for the U-2 reconnaissance aircraft. Considering the fact that the U.S. operates an overlapping reconnaissance aircraft and surveillance system manned 24 hours a day, the total sum of such an operation is astronomical. These U.S. intelligence forces, thus must constitute the core of U.S. forces in a unified Korea. In a unified Korea, China and Russia would be the two main countries with which Korea could possibly have a military conflict.29 Both these countries have modem military technology which makes naval and air forces very vulnerable. High-tech sensors in their possession would make it difficult for American naval and air forces to operate because they stand out against the back-ground of air and sea and thus would be easy to locate and destroy. On the other hand,</strong> American ground forces, given the mountainous terrain of Korea, are less vulnerable to advanced technology and thus could operate more easily<strong>.30</strong> Air and naval forces would have a very limited role to play in any future war in Korea<strong>. As the Gulf War should, it was American tanks which destroyed more Iraqi tanks than the allied air forces, even though the terrain and the absence of an opposing air force facilitated the task of allied pilots.31</strong> Any possible future military conflict involving Korea would almost certainly be won or lost on land<strong>. Ac­cordingly, infantrymen and tanks must remain a</strong>n essential component of the American forces in Korea<strong>. What's more,</strong> dependence on air and naval forces for the protection of Korea would weaken traditional alliances and deterrents <strong>as well as American support for the very values and political principles that make other countries respect and trust the United States.32 As has been shown in the recent military conflicts in Europe and South Asia, almost all military contingencies still require the use of ground forces to fight or to deter wars, despite the increasingly excessive use of air or naval force.</strong> Thus, even if U.S. air and naval forces remained stationed in Korea, the absence of U.S. ground forces would seriously undermine the deterrent and fighting power of the United States in the region<strong>.</strong> American soldiers have a stronger deterrent value because they represent the world's only superpower on both a direct and symbolic level<strong>. One country fighting another nation, which is helped only by U.S. air and naval forces, may rethink that it can escape a frontal clash with the United States; but no rational aggressor would dream of simultaneously fighting U.S. ground forces while avoiding confrontation with America.33 Though there is no doubt that in this age of supersonic speed, ground forces can be flown or shipped anywhere in the world in a short span of time in case of some military contingency, they do not have the same deterrent effect as the advance deployment of forces in places where the chances of military conflict are high. This can be clearly seen in the context of the Gulf War crisis. Despite the American diplomatic commitment to the region, Saddam Hussein occupied Kuwait. He</strong> underestimated the American resolve <strong>because of the absence of any U.S. troops in the region.</strong> American verbal commitment to the region failed to deter him<strong>, and, despite the massive use of high­speed ships and airplanes, it took the U.S. more than 6 months to build up the forces to where they were strong enough to take on and overcome Saddam Hussein's aggressive actions. In case of war on the Korea peninsula, the U.S. might not have that much time available. Given the firepower of bordering countries, it is commonly accepted among military analysts that Seoul would be completely destroyed within the first few hours of a war. Thus the situation on the Korean peninsula is very peculiar and resembles no other situation in the rest of the world. For the protection of Seoul and thus the whole of South Korea, it would be necessary to push the aggressor back in the first few hours of any conflict and not allow him to seriously damage Seoul. To accomplish this, the ability to gather massive ground force within the shortest possible time would be necessary.</strong> American air and naval forces alone would not be enough to stop powerful militaries marching towards Seoul<strong>. Though South Korean forces are much better equipped than ever before, they may not be able to stop the marching forces from bombing Seoul with artillery and short-range missiles.</strong> Only the U.S. forces equipped with state-of-the-art, high-tech weapons, stationed in Seoul in advance, would the have this ability to defend Seoul<strong>. Thus any argument for the withdrawal of U.S. ground forces from Korea must take this point into account.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Proponents maintain that the combination of a U.S. military withdrawal from South Korea and North Korean threats of nuclear proliferation would prompt other countries in the region to build up their own military capabilities to counter those of North Korea. South Korea and Japan, they say, might pursue nuclear programs of their own if they feel threatened. China might increase its missile capabilities in response, which in turn could lead its adversaries, such as Taiwan, to expand their own military options, supporters argue. The absence of U.S. forces countering North Korea could increase the threat of military confrontation in the area and lead to a general trend of nuclear development, supporters warn. The U.S. military presence in South Korea, they say, provides a security guarantee to the region and helps keep the balance between competing powers. Removing U.S. forces could damage cohesion in the area, they argue. &quot;To pull our troops out of South Korea would risk creating a leadership vacuum in the region and cause further destabilization,&quot; says William Cohen, who was secretary of defense under President Bill Clinton (D, 1993-2001). Supporters contend that removing U.S. troops from the South could be seen as backing down from a confrontation with the North. Such a move might be</strong> seen around the world as a sign of weakness<strong>, they caution, which could embolden U.S. adversaries and encourage similarly aggressive and belligerent positions in other situations. That precedent would be especially dangerous when applied to nuclear proliferation, they argue. &quot;Any movement of American forces would almost certainly involve countries and individuals</strong> taking the wrong message<strong>,&quot; says Kurt Campbell, former deputy assistant secretary of defense. &quot;The main one would be this: receding American commitment, backing down in the face of irresponsible North Korean behavior.&quot;</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>An absence of U.S. military power in the region, supporters argue, would also encourage other regional powers to increase their military forces in defense against the threat posed by North Korea. That, in turn, could cause other countries to arm themselves against potential threats, sparking an escalating arms race that could spread throughout the region and beyond, supporters contend. It is possible that one or more countries involved would soon develop nuclear weapons, they say. Removing troops from South Korea would also be bad policy for the U.S., supporters argue. It would be taken as a</strong> sign of weakness, <strong>they contend, and a victory on the part of North Korea.

<strong><u></strong>Japan has the technology to develop nuclear weapons<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Feasibility</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Technologically, Japan is capable of developing nuclear weapons if it invests considerable time and money. A major nuclear energy user possessing 55 nuclear reactors and committed to its nuclear fuel cycle program, Japan possesses high-level nuclear technologies, a substantial amount of plutonium and the capability to enrich uranium. Although nearly all this plutonium is reactor-grade plutonium unsuitable for nuclear explosion, Japan does possess a small amount of high-grade plutonium. A majority of its uranium is low-enriched, but Japan is capable of producing highly-enriched uranium if it wishes. Japan indeed retains highly-enriched uranium for use in research and experiments, albeit in an extremely small amount. Nevertheless, it is virtually unthinkable for this country to divert nuclear fuel to make bombs in secret. Its plutonium and uranium are kept under strict IAEA verification, and Japan is a highly transparent society. Even if Japan succeeds in manufacturing nuclear warheads, where is it going to test them? Some people say simulation technology can substitute for an onsite test, but the first nuclear warhead at least would require an onsite test. However, there is no geographically suitable place for such a test in Japan.</u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u>Third, because everyone sees beforehand that the United States is departing, changes to the strategic and security landscape commence long before the actual pull-out of U.S. troops from South Korea. Indeed by the time troops depart most actors have designed strategies that anticipate the consequences of U.S. withdrawal. Rather than a one-time event, this scenario is a long process with many different timelines and expectations. Fourth, in this scenario</strong> incentives to go nuclear are extremely powerful<strong>. Japan is likely to be the trigger, Taiwan will likely move in this direction, and even South Korea will find the strategic logic of becoming a nuclear weapons state difficult to resist. Thus, a wave of proliferation could flow: if Japan goes nuclear, Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia, and perhaps others will likely be close behind. Fifth, the rapid shifting of alliances and relationships in this scenario is creating strange bedfellows—some for only tactical advantage, some issue-based and of short duration. This strategic dance will accelerate and intensify as the breakdown of the U.S.-ROK alliance becomes evident. Any attempt by South Korea to go it alone in this world is difficult to imagine; to the contrary, Seoul’s objectives will need to be adjusted to reflect the realities of the new partnerships occurring around South Korea. Sixth, in the absence of the alliance—or even with the threat of dissolution—a number of other actors rapidly acquire incentives to stimulate the ROK’s sense of threat from North Korea. Seventh, the Japan that eventually emerges from this process—more nationalistic, assertive, well armed, and nuclear—may not be the Japan other Asian countries wish to see. Japan has over the last few decades tempered its historical persona among Asians who used to fear first and foremost that this Asian state would become a “normal nation.” Do the dynamics associated with a breakdown of the U.S.-ROK security alliance encourage the evolution of a Japan that is again “abnormal”?</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Strategic withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea would present some unique economic challenges for the United States. As discussed earlier, removal of forces might promote a peaceful solution that affords the U.S. and other regional actor’s access to a new and emerging North Korean market. Although remotely possible, this is highly unlikely given the North’s past history and aggressive nature. More than likely, the U.S. would lose global and regional credibility, unfettered access to the Asian-Pacific market, and the ability to influence regional economic policies. Our departure might also lead to reduced levels of foreign investment (other than by U.S.) due to security concerns.</strong> Loss of this foothold in the Asian- Pacific market would be cataclysmic to the U.S. economy. <strong>Approximately 25 percent of our annual imports come from this region.14 In addition, the emergence of China as a potential global super power will require that the U.S. remain fully entrenched in this region in order to contain and shape China’s ascendancy into the global marketplace.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u><span style="margin-right: .2in;">Of course, the report encompasses more than economics and indeed believes the future is likely to be the result of a number of intersecting and interlocking forces. With so many possible permutations of outcomes, each with ample Revisiting the Future opportunity for unintended consequences, there is a growing sense of insecurity. Even so, history may be more instructive than ever. While we continue to believe that the Great Depression is not likely to be repeated, the lessons to be drawn from that period include the </span></strong>harmful effects on fledgling democracies <strong>and multiethnic societies (think Central Europe in 1920s and 1930s) and on the</strong> sustainability of multilateral institutions <strong>(think League of Nations in the same period). There is no reason to think that this would not be true in the twenty-first as much as in the twentieth century. For that reason, the ways in which</strong> the potential for greater conflict could grow <strong>would seem to be even more apt in a constantly volatile economic environment as they would be if change would be steadier. In surveying those risks, the report stressed the likelihood that terrorism and nonproliferation will remain priorities even as resource issues move up on the international agenda.</strong> Terrorism<strong>’s appeal will decline if economic growth continues in the Middle East and youth unemployment is reduced. For those terrorist groups that remain active in 2025, however, the diffusion of technologies and scientific knowledge will place some of the world’s most</strong> dangerous capabilities <strong>within their reach. Terrorist groups in 2025 will likely be a combination of descendants of long established groups_inheriting organizational structures, command and control processes, and training procedures necessary to conduct sophisticated attacks and newly emergent collections of the angry and disenfranchised that become self-radicalized, particularly in the absence of economic outlets that would become narrower in an economic downturn. The most dangerous casualty of any</strong> economically-induced drawdown of U.S. military presence <strong>would almost certainly be the Middle East. Although Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons is not inevitable, worries about a nuclear-armed Iran could lead states i n the region to develop new security arrangements with external powers,</strong> acquire additional weapons<strong>, and consider pursuing their own</strong> nuclear ambitions<strong>. It is not clear that the type of stable deterrent relationship that existed between the great powers for most of the Cold War would emerge naturally in the Middle East with a nuclear Iran. Episodes of low intensity conflict and terrorism taking place under a nuclear umbrella could lead to an</strong> unintended escalation <strong>and</strong> broader conflict <strong>if clear red lines between those states involved are not well established. The close proximity of potential</strong> nuclear rivals <strong>combined with underdeveloped surveillance capabilities and mobile dual-capable Iranian missile systems also will produce inherent difficulties in achieving reliable indications and warning of an impending nuclear attack. The lack of strategic depth in neighboring states like Israel, short warning and missile flight times, and uncertainty of Iranian intentions may place more focus on</strong> preemption <strong>rather than defense, potentially leading to</strong> escalating crises<strong>. 36 Types of conflict that the world continues to experience, such as over resources, could reemerge, particularly if protectionism grows and there is a resort to neo-mercantilist practices. Perceptions of renewed energy scarcity will drive countries to take actions to assure their future access to energy supplies. In the worst case, this could result in</strong> interstate conflicts <strong>if government leaders deem assured access to energy resources, for example, to be essential for maintaining domestic stability and the survival of their regime. Even actions short of war, however, will have important geopolitical implications. Maritime security concerns are providing a rationale for naval buildups and modernization efforts, such as China’s and India’s development of blue water naval capabilities. If the fiscal stimulus focus for these countries indeed turns inward, one of the most obvious funding targets may be military. Buildup of regional naval capabilities could lead to increased tensions, rivalries, and counterbalancing moves, but it also will create opportunities for multinational cooperation in protecting critical sea lanes. With water also becoming scarcer in Asia and the Middle East, cooperation to manage changing water resources is likely to be increasingly difficult both within and between states in a more</strong> dog-eat-dog world<strong>. </u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Despite all the recent huffing and puffing from Pyongyang, U.S. officials say they’ve seen little physical evidence that North Korea might actually be preparing to go to war. Just hours after Seoul blamed the North for the March 26 sinking of the South Korean naval vessel Cheonan, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il publicly ordered his armed forces to get ready for military action, according to sources quoted in The Guardian. But two U.S. national security officials, asking for anonymity when discussing sensitive information, tell Declassified they’re not aware of any intelligence reporting on significant military mobilization or redeployments inside North Korea. The North Korean military is always on the move somewhere, one of the officials said, but at the moment whatever movements are being noted by Western intelligence agencies are regarded as not particularly threatening. A third U.S. foreign policy official, who also asked for anonymity, told Declassified that U.S. agencies are picking up “nothing of extreme concern” in what North Korean forces are currently up to. Pyongyang could still launch some form of surprise military action if it really wanted to. For one thing, South Korea’s capital and largest city, Seoul, is only 30 miles south of the Demilitarized Zone, within easy artillery range. The North Koreans keep their forward artillery batteries stocked with enough ammunition to do serious damage, one of the officials points out. But</strong> there are no indications <strong>that the North is preparing to embark on any such adventure, which would almost certainly risk a wider conflict. There’s also the possibility that Pyongyang might try to intimidate its neighbors by setting off another missile or nuclear test. And although the North might be able for the most part to conceal preparations for an underground nuclear explosion, the West’s detection equipment would probably pick up signs that the North was planning a major new missile test, and according to one of the officials, no such preparations appear to be under way.</u></strong><br />

Pyongyang has vehemently denied any involvement with the Cheonan sinking and today alleged that the United States and the South had fabricated evidence as &quot;a golden opportunity to ignite the second Korean War.&quot; South Korea is expected to request that the Security Council punish or at the minimum censure the North over the incident. Seoul has already lined up backing from Japan and Washington but would need the support of Russia and China, two veto-holding permanent members of the council, for any resolution against North Korea to pass. The Russian Foreign Ministry has declared that it requires &quot;100 percent proof&quot; of North Korean complicity. Its experts planned to talk with the international investigators, check the halved ship and go to the location where the sinking occurred, AFP reported. &quot;Russia's direct trust in our investigation results will make this case clear, and it's part of our stepped-up effort to muster international support,&quot; said one official. South Korea has invited Beijing to have its own specialists review the probe's findings, local news organizations reported, with some stating that the request had been turned down.</strong> Seoul has already ruled out launching a punitive military strike <strong>on the aspiring nuclear power to the north. South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan said further reducing North Korea's revenue stream would be a strong response to the situation. &quot;If the cash inflow into North Korea is restricted, I think it will lower the possibility of nuclear weapons development and deter belligerent behavior,&quot; Yu told the BBC. During a trilateral summit this past weekend with the leaders of South Korea and Japan, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao rebuffed prodding to punish the North through the United Nations (Agence France-Presse/Yahoo!News, June 1). Wen's refusal to condemn North Korea could indicate that China is seeking to privately prod its ally to own up to its role in the sinking, the Associated Press reported Sunday. &quot;The urgent task for the moment is to properly handle the serious impact caused by the Cheonan incident, gradually defuse tensions over it and avoid possible conflicts,&quot; Wen said. Should the issue come before the United Nations, there is the chance that Beijing would back sanctions as it did last summer following the North's detonation of a second nuclear test device. High-level U.S. officials conjectured that Beijing would move incrementally to support the contention that Pyongyang ought to be penalized for the ship sinking. Wen informed the South Koreans that his government would &quot;defend no one&quot; once it had reached a conclusion on the situation, Seoul said (Young-Joon Ahn, Associated Press/Yahoo!News, May 30). The three-way summit Sunday did produce an agreement that Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing would work together on lowering tensions over the ship sinking, Kyodo News reported. &quot;We have reached a common understanding that the sinking is a very serious issue for stability in Northeast Asia,&quot; Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama told journalists at a joint news briefing following the talks (Kyodo News/Breitbart.com, May 30). Meanwhile, alarmed by the apparent ease with which the South Korean warship was attacked, high-ranking U.S. officials said they were looking into ways to improve South Korean naval security, the New York Times reported yesterday. While multiple rounds of U.N. sanctions have left the North financially bereft and unable to maintain military parity with the South, officials said Pyongyang has responded by focusing its limited resources on developing covert, clandestine technological capabilities that can cause notable destruction. The United States has drawn down its military footprint in South Korea as the result of Seoul's heightened armed forces spending. High-level U.S. defense officials said new heavy weaponry such as warships and fighter jets ought to be more than enough to make up for a reduced U.S. deployment levels (Shanker/Sanger, New York Times I, May 30). Elsewhere, the two Koreas each took steps to lower tensions on the Korean Peninsula yesterday, with Seoul suggesting that it could decide to halt once again a border propaganda campaign against the North and Pyongyang voicing a wish to maintain a joint industrial site with the South, the Times reported. &quot;Neither side can afford to keep building up tensions,&quot; Seoul-based North Korea expert Kim Yong-hyun said. &quot;Both sides have been raising tensions the way you blow into your balloon, and now they need an excuse for each other to stop blowing so that the balloon won’t burst&quot; (Choe Sang-hun, New York Times II, May 31). Despite North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's reported public command that his military make preparations for armed conflict, intelligence efforts have brought back no reports of notable troop movements within the country, U.S. security officials told Newsweek.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>&quot;The North Korean regime cannot risk any further destruction of the economy at this point,&quot; Myers said.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>China, the North's only major benefactor, offers Kim one of his few ways out.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Beijing fears a collapse of his government would bring chaos to its border and has blocked any global economic push that would significantly destabilize Pyongyang. It has also supplied food, oil and money to keep his government afloat.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>China appears to want to augment social stability along its three provinces that border North Korea by increasing investment with the state, according to John Park, an expert on the region with the United States Institute of Peace.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>SEOUL (Reuters) - Policy blunders and an economic crunch have put North Korean leader Kim Jong-il into one of the riskiest periods of his iron rule, which could make him turn even more aggressive in his dealings with the outside world.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>But even if he chooses to resort once again to scare tactics to try to boost his bargaining power, he lacks a game-changing ace to play that would seriously rattle the international community or spook markets long used to his grandstanding.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Unless he is prepared to sail dangerously close to provoking a suicidal war -- and <strong>most experts firmly believe he is not</strong> -- then the most he can do is demonstrate incremental advances in the destructive capability of his armory or boost weapons sales to other countries at odds with the United States.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>He is quite capable of provoking annoyance and concern, analysts say, but much <strong>less able to generate the kind of alarm that would cause a serious reassessment of the risks facing governments</strong> and financial markets in a region that includes the powerful economies of China, Japan and South Korea.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>In fact, a signal of reconciliation may be his first step by ending a more than year-long boycott of international nuclear disarmament-for-aid talks, possibly within the next month.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>South Korea's president on Friday gave the clearest signal yet Seoul had no plan to launch a revenge attack, <strong>calming investors worried that armed conflict would damage the South's rapidly recovering economy</strong>. &quot;The probably catastrophic costs of a war on the peninsula will greatly constrain the U.S. and South Korean options for a military response, which thus remains an unlikely trigger for major military conflict,&quot; the global strategy group Control Risks wrote in a research note this week. The front end of the ship was raised by a giant sea crane and drained before being placed on a barge. One body has been found so far in the just-raised wreckage and six sailors were still missing, Yonhap news agency reported. The bodies of most of the 46 missing were found in the stern section raised earlier this month. Another 58 were rescued alive. &quot;The way a hatch (near where the ship split in two) had been thrown off its hinge indicates there had been a very strong external impact,&quot; Yonhap quoted an un identified military official as saying, adding weight to the torpedo theory.<strong></u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u></strong>Another element often cited is the rise of regional identity in East Asia, a development to which South Korea has made important contributions. This is being driven by rising economic interdependence in the area. The extensive bilateral economic ties between the US and many countries in the region are now mediated by the rise of China as more and more investment money (American included) has poured into China to make the cheap goods that flow to the US. Countries all over the region are depending very heaving on selling raw materials, machinery and semi-finished goods to China. South Korea aspires to an important role in the region, and, since many others have reservations about the dominance of the US, a relaxation in USROK relations is useful to the ROK. On the other hand, there is no evidence that a better relationship with other East Asian governments could only have been obtained by letting the alliance erode. No other country except North Korea has made that a prerequisite to expanded ties.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>Visiting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao focused his efforts on promoting cooperation with South Korea and in East Asia on Saturday, the second day of his three-day tour in South Korea. BLUEPRINT FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION At an annual trilateral summit held in South Korea's southern resort of Jeju, Premier Wen, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama unveiled a blueprint for trilateral cooperation in economy, security, environmental protection, cultural exchange and other areas in the next decade. The leaders agreed that after making clear the detailed objectives and long-term goals within the next decade, all sides need to concentrate efforts on boosting trilateral cooperation to a new height, so as to further consolidate partnership, achieve more in mutually beneficial cooperation in all aspects and enhance friendship between the peoples of the three countries. They also agreed to set up a more cooperative mechanism to increase strategic mutual trust, which involves setting up a trilateral cooperation secretariat in South Korea in 2011 to jointly tackle natural disasters, discuss the possibility of a mechanism of trilateral defense dialogue to enhance security contacts, strengthen political dialogue and cooperation in police affairs, and boost government exchanges at local levels among the three nations. On developing sustainable economic cooperation and common prosperity, the leaders pledged efforts to finish by 2012 a joint feasibility study of trilateral free trade agreement, which was launched in May 2010, and to expand trade volume ahead of 2020 for the benefit of regional economic growth and integration. The leaders said the three countries will complete negotiations on investment agreement and provide a favorable investment environment to facilitate the operation of enterprises in the region. They also reiterated the importance of customs cooperation, and vowed to further cooperation in finance, science and technology, innovation, as well as policy cooperation and negotiations in such areas as energy efficiency and resources. &quot;An open, fair and liberalized multilateral trade system is not only conducive to China, Japan and South Korea, but also important for the world. We must oppose protectionism of any form to safeguard and consolidate the system,&quot; said the document. On cooperation in environmental protection, the leaders said the three countries should jointly push for achievements at the climate change summit to be held in Mexico this year, including an effective international cooperation framework in this regard after 2012, under the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, especially the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. On regional peace and stability, the three leaders said the denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula is very much conducive to lasting peace, security and economic prosperity in Northeast Asia. &quot;Therefore, we will make efforts to achieve the goals set in the Sept. 19 joint statement in 2005 through the Six-Party talks,&quot; the document said.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Any evidence from before 2009 doesn’t apply—regional cooperation has significantly deepened</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Rathus 10</strong>—Monbusho Scholar, Meiji U and researches East Asian regional integration (Joel, China-Japan-Korea trilateral cooperation and the East Asian Community, 15 June 2010, <span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/06/15/china-japan-korea-trilateral-cooperation-and-the-east-asian-community/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/06/15/china-japan-korea-trilateral-cooperation-and-the-east-asian-community/</a></span>, AMiles)<strong></u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u></strong>Since its inception on the sidelines of the ASEAN Plus Three (APT) summit over a decade ago, China-Japan-Korea trilateral cooperation <strong>has deepened significantly</strong>. The trilateral cooperation is an important development in regional politics and economics. But the way in which it will affect an East Asian economic community remains uncertain. Cooperation between China, Japan and Korea has historically been stunted. In 1999, an agreement was reached for heads of state from each of the three countries to meet on the sidelines of the APT summit. This agreement initially constituted little more than an annual informal breakfast, and was established more to right perceived imbalances between the ‘plus three’ countries and ASEAN within the APT than because of any desire to improve problematic relations. In any case, Japan’s worsening relations with its neighbours under the Koizumi administration precluded any deepening of the process. In December 2008, the trilateral cooperation finally formally separated itself from the ASEAN Plus Three process and acquired its own identity. But the scope of the trilateral cooperation remained relatively limited, focusing upon annual meetings at Head of State and Foreign Minister level, discussions in the areas of environment, energy and education, and continued informal study of a trilateral free trade area. Even as a separate forum, it seemed unlikely that the trilateral cooperation would prove to be able to lead the creation of an East Asian community and therefore be of any great significance. <strong>This all changed in 2009,</strong> when Japan, China and Korea were forced to coordinate and cooperate more closely to manage the regional effects of the global financial crisis. In their joint statement on the crisis, the trio identified the need to cooperate on global issues (such as financial risk) and in global institutions, including at the G20. While a reaction to global events, this cooperation began to significantly affect the management of East Asia. Over the course of 2009, the three nations resolved their long running dispute over contributions (and thus voting weight) in the Chiang Mai Initiatives, the first major ‘success’ of the ASEAN Plus Three process. The three nations also worked together to push through a general capital increase at the Asian Development Bank to help it fight the effects of the global financial crisis, a decision mandated by the G20 but about which the US appeared ambivalent. The fact that 2009 was the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the trilateral cooperation also provided an opportunity to make the trilateral cooperation more meaningful. Japan’s then newly installed PM Yukio Hatoyama provided impetus by proposing that the long-delayed China-Japan-Korea FTA be subject to an official international study. Hatoyama’s offer represented a major break from Japan’s previous policy to avoid negotiations over an FTA without actually having to say no. Between 2002 and 2009 Japan requested that further domestic and unofficial study be undertaken as an excuse not to start the negotiations. Indeed, some the economists involved in informal FTA studies declined to participate after becoming aware of this delaying strategy.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Strong alliance with South Korea is key to multilateral security regime</u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>*Note – USFK = U.S. Forces in Korea<strong></u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Moreover, a strong alliance between the U.S. and South Korea can facilitate the establishment of a multilateral security regime in Northeast Asia. Korea’s strategic positioning,</strong> along with the support of USFK <strong>lend Korea the military capacity to serve as a balancer or stabilizer within the region. Thus, after the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, the U.S.-ROK alliance should be transformed from a collective defense organization aimed solely at deterring North Korea to a regional cooperative security regime that would promote and maintain peace and stability in Northeast Asia. The USFK can play a similar role that American troops stationed in European countries have done for securing a multilateral peace community, such as NATO. Bilateral alliances between the U.S. and Northeast Asian countries would not only</strong> complement multilateral security regime<strong>, but also bind loose ties of the regional security networks.7</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Many have said that the existing bilateral alliances might act as barriers to multilateral dialogues in Northeast Asia. But I believe the contrary, that the</strong> existing bilateral alliances could be complementary to multilateral security cooperation, and vice versa. <strong>Strong bilateral alliances and bilateral trust can serve as the foundation for greater multilateral cooperation among partner countries. Northeast Asian countries that have pressing needs for multilateral security cooperation, may encourage their bilateral partners to participate in a multilateral security framework, not to replace bilateral cooperation, but to increase the scope and reach of what can be accomplished toward mutual goals.

<strong><u></strong>South Korea is already playing a greater role with regional countries – balancing against the U.S. on certain issues<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Lee, 9 <strong>– Seoul National University (December 2009, Geun, “The Nexus between Korea’s Regional Security Options and Domestic Politics,” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/" rel="nofollow">www.cfr.org</a></span>, JMP)</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Korea’s Choices: Past and Present</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Interestingly, Korea’s diplomatic history shows a somewhat consistent pattern of loyalty relations with superpowers. In the premodern era, China exchanged protection, economic benefits, and legitimization for Korea’s loyalty. As Asia opened to modernity, Japan colonized Korea, forcing Korean loyalty to the empire. With the end of the Korean War in 1953, Korea invested its full loyalty in the United States, which yielded military and economic gains.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>But as the international context changed, the exclusive U.S.-Korea relationship became more flexible. When the bipolar system collapsed at the end of the Cold War, former enemies began transforming their own identities, which allowed Korea to consider new diplomatic relationships. This new pattern of engagement resulted in “issue-oriented balancing,” or issue-specific coalitions among different groups of countries.4 For example, South Korea joined North Korea and China in criticizing Japan on the textbook issue and the Yasukuni Shrine, pitting Korea with two Cold War enemies against its Cold War friend. At</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>the Six Party Talks, the views of the Roh Moo-hyun administration were more similar to those of China and Russia than those of the United States and Japan. After the Cold War, Korea was able to spread risks through a more symmetrical loyalty portfolio.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Korea seems increasingly inclined to explore exit options in the U.S.-Korea alliance</strong> because its voice has been repeatedly ignored <strong>in the United States. When the Clinton administration discussed preemptive strikes against North Korea, it failed to consult with the Korean government in advance. During the 1997 financial crisis, the Clinton administration was reluctant in arranging quick rescue funds to Korea.5 In June 2002, the United States hurriedly released its soldiers who were involved in a vehicle accident that killed two middle-school girls in Korea. In 2008, the U.S. ambassador made a careless comment that “Koreans should learn the science” about mad cow disease. And the United States has been reluctant to pay for the environmental pollution and damage committed by the U.S. army in the Yongsan military base. Based on these experiences, many South Koreans believe there is an asymmetry between their loyalty and voice in the U.S.-Korea relationship, and they are turning their eyes toward possible exit options.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Obama is trying to hold the line against China bashing now – will wreck the U.S. economic recovery</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Hadar, 9/14 (Leon, 9/14/10, Business Times Singapore, “Trade policies emerge as political issues in US,” Factiva, JMP)</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Depending on who is making the calculation, the Chinese yuan or renminbi is estimated to be 30-40 per cent undervalued, relative to the US dollar.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>According to a study published by the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington- based progressive think-tank, the growth of the US trade deficit with China between 2001 and 2008 eliminated 2.4 million jobs, while ending the currency manipulation by the Chinese now could create at least one million jobs in the US.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>That is an argument that tends to win the attention of the American voters and their representatives in Washington.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Obama administration officials share these concerns, especially at a time when the continuing high rate of unemployment has been strengthening voter sentiment against the Democrats and President Barack Obama. Moreover, the officials, reflecting the consensus among economists, reiterate that without dealing with structural imbalances in trade and capital flows between China and the US, there is a danger that the global economy could face another crisis in the near future.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>But Mr Summers and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, backed by President Obama, have been expressing their hopes that the Chinese currency problem could be resolved in quiet diplomatic exchanges between Washington and Beijing in bilateral Strategic and Economic Security Dialogue (S&amp;ED) meetings and in other forums. They have warned that the politicisation of the issue could ignite more economic tensions between the two countries and put even more downward pressure on the US economic recovery.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>As part of an effort to defuse the issue, the currency report issued by the US in July (after its release had been delayed for several months) concluded that 'no major trading partner of the United States' was manipulating its exchange rate, although it suggested that the Chinese yuan 'remains undervalued'.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>The report and other indications that the Obama administration was not going to take any action against the Chinese in response to their currency exchange policy have angered Democratic and Republican lawmakers in the Senate and the House of Representatives, who are now threatening to use their power to force the administration to punish Beijing.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Two leading committees in the Senate and the House are scheduled to hold hearings on the issue of China's exchange rate this week and lawmakers are expected to grill Mr Geithner and find out whether or not the administration is planning to toughen its approach towards the Chinese.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>The plan would cause backlash from the China threat lobby.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Feffer, co-director of Foreign Policy In Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies, ’10 (John, Mar. 6, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4797:http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/LC06Dh02.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/LC06Dh02.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/LC06Dh02.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4797 -->, twm)</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Not surprisingly, China's bedazzlement policy has set off warning bells in Washington, where the People's Republic is still a focus of primary concern for a cadre of strategic planners inside the Pentagon. The Futenma base - and its potential replacement - would be well situated, should Washington ever decide to send rapid response units to the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, or the Korean peninsula. Strategic planners in Washington like to speak of the &quot;tyranny of distance&quot;, of the difficulty of getting &quot;boots on the ground&quot; from Guam or Hawaii in case of an East Asian emergency.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Yet the actual strategic value of Futenma is, at best, questionable. The South Koreans are more than capable of dealing with any contingency on the peninsula. And the United States frankly has plenty of firepower by air (Kadena) and sea (Yokosuka) within hailing distance of China. A couple thousand Marines won't make much of a difference (though the leathernecks strenuously disagree). However, in a political environment in which the Pentagon is finding itself making tough choices between funding counterinsurgency wars and old Cold War weapons systems, the &quot;China threat&quot; lobby doesn't want to give an inch. Failure to relocate the Futenma base within Okinawa might be the first step down a slippery slope that could potentially put at risk billions of dollars in Cold War weapons still in the production line. It's hard to justify buying all the fancy toys without a place to play with them. And that's one reason the Obama administration has gone to the mat to pressure Tokyo to adhere to the 2006 agreement. It even dispatched Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to the Japanese capital last October in advance of president Obama's own Asian tour. Like an impatient father admonishing an obstreperous teenager, Gates lectured the Japanese &quot;to move on&quot; and abide by the agreement - to the irritation of both the new government and the public. (See Gates gets grumpy in Tokyo, October 28, 2009) The punditocracy has predictably closed ranks behind a bipartisan Washington consensus that the new Japanese government should become as accustomed to its junior status as its predecessor and stop making a fuss. The Obama administration is frustrated with &quot;Hatoyama's amateurish handling of the issue,&quot; writes Washington Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt. &quot;What has resulted from Mr Hatoyama's failure to enunciate a clear strategy or action plan is the biggest political vacuum in over 50 years,&quot; adds Victor Cha, former director of Asian affairs at the National Security Council. Neither analyst acknowledges that Tokyo's only &quot;failure&quot; or &quot;amateurish&quot; move was to stand up to Washington. &quot;The dispute could undermine security in East Asia on the 50th anniversary of an alliance that has served the region well,&quot; intoned The Economist more bluntly. &quot;Tough as it is for Japan's new government, it needs to do most, though not all, of the caving in.&quot;</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Obama must expend political capital to prevent domestic pressures from undermining relations with China and sparking a trade war</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Thai News Service, 9/10 (“United States/China: US, China Meet to Smooth Ties; Analysts Say Big Challenges Remain,” 9/10/10, Factiva, JMP)</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Section: General News - Two senior U.S. advisers have wrapped up talks in Beijing with top officials that included a rare meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao. While both sides stressed the importance of expanding cooperation and promoting healthy U.S.-China relations, analysts note that a wide range of challenges will continue to test ties - with the value of the Chinese currency and trade relations chief among them.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Chinese President Hu Jintao rarely meets with lower ranking visitors. Some analysts believe it is significant that Jintao sat down Wednesday with President Barack Obama's economic adviser Larry Summers and national security adviser Thomas Donilon.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>China Center Director Kenneth Liberthal is with Washington, D.C.'s Brookings Institution - a government policy research group. He said, &quot;That suggests that the discussion that had occurred during the previous several days in Beijing had gone very well.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>&quot;So that President Hu is now prepared to associate himself with a line of argument that says this is an extremely important relationship we should not overstress our differences, we should be able to work out things, tensions should be reduced and so forth,&quot; said Liberthal.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>The White House said the talks touched on a wide range of topics, including North Korea, and Iran, as well as economic and security issues.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>The meeting comes after months of discord and as the two countries continue to grapple with trade disputes. The lagging global economy also is translating into political pressure.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Liberthal noted that with some U.S. lawmakers running for re-election this November, and China already into its succession politics, the leaders of both countries are going to face increasing challenges.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>&quot;Given the combination of politics and economic concerns, both political leaders are going to have to be prepared to spend a fair amount of political capital to keep the trade relationship from slipping into a more contentious posture,&quot; said Liberthal.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>In November, American voters will elect new legislators in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Chinese President Hu Jintao is slated to step down from office in 2012.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Professor Patrick Chovanec of Beijing's Tsinghua University says trade relations are very tense. &quot;People have been wondering for some time now whether there is going to be a trade war break out between the United States and China; well in many ways for the past several months there has been a low-level trade war.&quot;</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Inside US-China Trade, 9/15 (“Think Tank Panel Warns Against House Passage of China Currency Bill,” 9/15/10, Vol. 10, No. 36, Factiva, JMP)</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>*Note – Linda Menghetti is the Vice President of the Emergency Committee for American Trade (ECAT)</u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Note – Derek Scissors is a Research Fellow – Heritage Asian Studies Center<strong></u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u></strong>Although it is in China's own interest to revalue its currency and it may take small steps in that direction while the U.S. Congress threatens currency legislation, the danger is that once a bill is actually passed, China will retaliate, he said. This will impose costs on U.S. exports, Scissors said.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>For U.S. business groups, Menghetti said, one of the main fears is that passing the Ryan-Murphy bill will &quot;take the oxygen out&quot; of the U.S.-China relationship and prevent progress on more important commercial issues. Those include Chinese indigenous innovation policies that restrict foreign firms' market access, rampant intellectual property piracy in China, discriminatory government procurement policies, financial-services barriers and a lack of transparency in economic policy-making, among other issues.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>China is the only major international market that can generate sufficient growth to allow the Obama administration to meet its goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years, she said.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>For Scissors, Chinese regulatory mandates to dominate entire industries and restrict foreign ownership in key sectors has more impact on U.S. exports and jobs than the value of its currency. The U.S. should also give more emphasis to supporting the liberalization of China's balance of payments regime, he said.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Levy took issue with the Sept. 13 call by New York Times columnist and Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman for imposing tariffs on imports from China to create leverage for currency revaluation. That call for unilateral action is based on a &quot;fairly blinkered analysis&quot; that does not examine possible unintended consequences and appears to ignore that fact that the U.S. is committed to not exceeding its bound tariff rates at the World Trade Organization, he said.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Legislation that would alter U.S. antidumping law, such as those advocated in the Ryan-Murphy bill and the Senate bill sponsored by Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), are problematic as well, although in more &quot;subtle&quot; ways, he said. One such subtlety is the difficulty of demonstrating that an undervalued currency is &quot;specific&quot; to a particular group and therefore functions as an actionable subsidy, he said.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>In Menghetti's view, U.S. antidumping methodology for non-market economies (NMEs) already largely takes into account China's undervalued currency by using surrogate country data when calculating dumping margins. &quot;There's no basis for doing the double counting that this legislation is proposing,&quot; she said in reference to the Ryan-Murphy bill.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>She noted that last month's Commerce Department decision not to investigate claims that China's undervalued currency served as a subsidy to coated paper or aluminum extruder exports because the claims lacked proof of specificity or of contingency on exports, as required under international subsidies disciplines, did not examine whether the currency policy actually makes a financial contribution to the exporting companies.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Multilateral approaches to achieve currency reform are also imperfect, Levy noted. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has not been empowered to criticize its major members' macroeconomic policies, and those countries, including the U.S. and China, have shown little interest in giving the IMF that power.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Bringing a WTO challenge against China's currency regime under Article 15 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on nullification and impairment of benefits would be &quot;ill-advised&quot; and &quot;fraught with problems,&quot; Levy said. Bringing such a case would put pressure on the WTO as an institution, is not likely to succeed, and &quot;could backfire,&quot; he argued.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>For instance, because Article 15 defers to the IMF on exchange rate matters, in order to rule in favor of the U.S., the dispute panel would &quot;have to make up all the details that are missing,&quot; he said. And if the panel declined to be pro-active in that way, it would likely rule in China's favor, giving Beijing international support for its currency practices.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Levy said Congress is preparing to act against the smallest of three disruptions impacting the U.S. economy -- international trade -- because it is easier to take action on than the other two: technological change and domestic competition. Even though its expanding current account surplus has led to a &quot;fairly broad consensus&quot; in U.S. policy circles that China's currency is undervalued, that does not mean that punitive legislation is the best way to achieve revaluation, he said.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>&quot;There is relatively little evidence that China responds well to threats from the United States,&quot; Levy said.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>To frame the importance of this discussion and the topics that must be met, Siegal used the analogy of “the U.S. and China having their hands around each other’s necks and we’re both going over the waterfall.” After that comment a man in the audience then suggested that in that case both countries would have to look to the other for help and teamwork would be the only way to survive.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>That theme resonated from coast to coast. At the University of California-Berkeley, speaker Sidney Rittenberg took a more intimate approach to U.S.-China relations. A man who lived in China for 35 years, Rittenberg has worked for the past two decades as an advisor to major corporations doing business in China such as AIG, Intel, Hughes Aircraft, Pricewaterhouse Coopers, and Ford. At the Bay Area gathering he emphasized respect and dignity through his own stories, and instead of categorizing the issues into right and wrong Rittenberg advocates looking at the bigger picture. For him the imperative for Americans is to learn to get along with the Chinese.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>Congressional pressure is increasing to take a hardline on China – political capital is key to hold off proponents<strong></u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u></strong>National Economic Council Director Larry Summers’ trip this weekend to China for a series of high-level meetings is a rare opportunity for the Obama administration to deliver a potent message to the Chinese government.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>The message: Domestic patience with China is running out. The messenger: Summers, an unlikely diplomat by most accounts, whose brusque personality and communication style may be just what the White House needs to inject a sense of urgency into the tense negotiations.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>The trip comes at a time when the Obama administration is seeking to strike a conciliatory, but firm balance in its talks with China on a range of issues, including currency valuation and its relationship with North Korea and Iran.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>And after months of largely unproductive diplomatic talks, the White House is sending a representative whose penchant for straight talk is matched by his influence in the West Wing.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>“It could be a good cop-bad cop thing, in a sense,” said Michael Green, a senior adviser and the Japan Chair for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Summers … can go and say: ‘Here’s the bottom line for the president. Here’s what really has to be done.’ In a large negotiation with a large delegation, it’s harder to do that.”<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Earlier trips by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner — a Mandarin speaker and East Asia scholar — and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were diplomacy-laden affairs that have not been especially successful in moving the Chinese government.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>This visit is a more low-key, joint national security mission with Deputy National Security Adviser Tom Donilon that has been billed by the White House as an opportunity for the two close Obama advisors to “discuss a wide range of issues touching on bilateral and international issues.”<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Green said that a message from senior advisers like Summers and Donilon is “just as authoritative as a message from the president” - and that such a message may do more than an official visit to move sensitive discussions along.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Others say that the transition from Geithner to Summers is a recognition that Geithner’s expertise in East Asia has not been especially helpful in convincing the Chinese to make concessions.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Geithner has spent much of his career, both academic and professional, focused on the Asian economy — a characteristic that most observers say is invaluable in a senior U.S. official, especially in light of the continent’s rising economic influence.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>“Geithner, despite his relative youth, qualifies as an old hand — an old friend of China. He has a lot of experience with China,” said James Mann, author-in-residence at the Foreign Policy Institute at Johns Hopkins University.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>But Mann says that even Geithner’s background has not changed China’s longstanding resistance to allowing the value of its currency to rise relative to the dollar.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>In the last 18 months, this administration’s relationship with China has followed the same patterns of previous administrations. Weeks after Geithner’s surprise trip to Beijing in May, China announced that it would allow more flexibility in its currency. But since then, the value of the yuan, China’s currency, has not budged.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Meanwhile, the drumbeat on Capitol Hill to chastise the rising superpower is growing loader.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>A bill sponsored by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) that could lead to higher tariffs on Chinese imports is likely to be taken up in Congress this fall. And the administration is hoping to signal to Chinese President Hu Jintao that it is running out of political capital to fight it.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>“People are frustrated -- they’re impatient. They do see U.S. trade policies as one of the key problems that’s led to loss of jobs,” said Thea Lee, the policy director and chief international economist at the AFL-CIO, a key labor constituency for congressional Democrats. “That’s something that we take very seriously, and we’re going to be reaching out to members of Congress and making sure they understand how important issue is.”<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>With the economic recovery appearing to plateau, concerns about the rising trade deficit and outsourced jobs will resonate even more strongly with Democrats — many of whom have ties to labor unions and the manufacturing sector — ahead of the midterm elections.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Green cautions that action on the bill will almost certainly further alienate China and steel its resolve against adjusting its currency in a way that could damage its economy. But he says that the legislation could be an opportune bargaining chip during this weekend’s talks.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>“You want the crazy gorilla in the cage when you’re negotiating,” said Green, who is a former senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. “On the other hand, if the crazy gorilla gets out, you have a problem.”<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>Hence, it can therefore be argued that the increasingly confrontational way in which America has engaged China can lead to the Taiwan Strait becoming a &quot;flashpoint&quot; of the Asia Pacific region. This is because the US had generally been adopting closer ties with Taiwan, believing the defence of the territory to be integral towards the preservation of its security interests in Asia, especially in the accessing of Taiwan's ports to preserve the freedom of navigation and the flow of commerce. In addition, Taipei's economic prosperity was advantageous to the cultivation of Washington's diplomatic and political ties with Beijing, especially since Taiwan was investing a large amount of capital in business ventures with China, encouraging economic reform and ultimately political liberalisation.[20] Particularly due to growing perceptions that China would emerge to be an American competitor, any military action by Beijing would probably encounter US resistance, an act that could possibly erupt into general war, taking into account the interlocking American system of alliances in the region.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>Past presidents have visited Canada, Mexico and the UK for maiden voyages, but by heading to China, Obama would signal that America understands the massive shift of wealth and power to the East that has occurred over the last decade<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>President-elect Obama’s transition team faces daunting challenges at home and abroad. From the collapsing economy to dealing with deteriorating situation in the broad arc of South Asia, the next administration must calculate exact priorities and their sequence. In addressing multiple and immediate crises, however, there’s a danger that the new president may put aside some of the most basic relationships critical to nearly everything the US does. Case in point: building stronger ties to China.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>From an economic perspective, the US will be joined at the hip to China for decades to come. It needs China’s continued investment, help in managing global currencies, cooperation in strengthening the WTO and liberalising trade, strong involvement in establishing a new set of rules to address global warming, participation in moving from a world governed by the G-7 to one managed by the G-20.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>From a security standpoint, China’s policies are key to dealing with such hotspots as Iran, North Korea and Pakistan, but its broader influence matters well beyond, for Asia in general, African resource-rich nations or any issue that arises in the UN Security Council.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>In short, the Middle Kingdom is inextricably linked to America’s domestic and foreign policy interests, more so than any other country. And this connection is likely to deepen in the years ahead, given China’s growth rate, its $2 trillion in reserves, its growing role in the world economy and its increasingly global reach.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>With these considerations in mind, the Obama team should consider a break with tradition and prepare for the new president making his first overseas visit to China soon after the inauguration. Past presidents have visited Canada, Mexico and the UK for maiden voyages, but by heading to China, Obama would signal that America understands the massive shift of wealth and power to the East that has occurred over the last decade. It would be acknowledging the intertwined nature of domestic and international issues and China’s pivotal role in that complex equation.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>Kills the economy<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Reuters, 8 (Emma Graham-Harrison, “RPT-ANALYSIS-Economy looms as China, US celebrate relations,” 12/30/2008, Factiva, JMP)<strong></u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u></strong>BEIJING, Dec 31 (Reuters) - China and the United States should be kicking off 2009 with a celebration of three decades' hard work building one of the world's most crucial diplomatic relationships.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Instead the superpower and the rising power are fighting their way through an economic crisis that may be the biggest strain yet on the web of ties they have created.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Following a ground-breaking visit by former U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1972, the United States switched diplomatic recognition from democratic Taiwan to Communist China on Jan. 1, 1979, recognising &quot;one China&quot; and marking Beijing's emergence from diplomatic and economic isolation.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>It smoothed and accelerated reforms that would transform China from a Cold War backwater into the world's fourth-largest economy at astonishing speed.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>&quot;This is a very tough thing to manage because of historical precedents of rising powers and the reactions they provoke from other countries,&quot; said Susan Shirk, a professor at the University of California San Diego and former U.S. diplomat.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>&quot;Historically, rising powers almost always mean war.&quot;<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>In the search for a relationship that will be the cornerstone of peace, they have weathered an embassy bombing and a spy plane crash, a military crackdown on pro-democracy protests, and more recently, tensions over trade and the value of China's currency. But U.S. President-elect Barack Obama has vowed to put more pressure on China over export incentives and managed currency, and upbraided Beijing over human rights abuses and failure to enforce labour, environment and product safety standards.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Analysts say a more aggressive U.S. stance, particularly on trade, risks testing delicate relations amid rapidly rising unemployment and a gloomy economic outlook in both countries.<strong></u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u></strong>Have you noticed, by the way, that there’s always some obstacle in the path of withdrawal? Right now, in Iraq, it’s the aftermath of the March 7th election, hailed as proof that we brought democracy to the Middle East and so, whatever our missteps, did the right thing. As it happens, the election, as many predicted at the time, has led to a potentially explosive gridlock and has yet to come close to resulting in a new governing coalition. With violence on the rise, we’re told, the planned drawdown of American troops to the 50,000 level by August is imperiled. Already, the process, despite repeated assurances, seems to be proceeding slowly. And yet, the thought that an American withdrawal should be held hostage to events among Iraqis all these years later, seems curious. There’s always some reason to hesitate -- and it never has to do with us. Withdrawal would undoubtedly be far less of a brain-twister if Washington simply committed itself wholeheartedly to getting out, and if it stopped convincing itself that the presence of the U.S. military in distant lands was essential to a better world (and, of course, to a controlling position on planet Earth). A Brief History of American Withdrawal Of course, there’s a small problem here. All evidence indicates that Washington doesn’t want to withdraw -- not really, not from either region. It has no interest in divesting itself of the global control-and-influence business, or of the military-power racket. That’s hardly surprising since we’re talking about a great imperial power and control (or at least imagined control) over the planet’s strategic oil lands. And then there’s another factor to consider: habit. Over the decades, Washington has gotten used to staying. The U.S. has long been big on arriving, but not much for departure. After all, 65 years later, striking numbers of American forces are still garrisoning the two major defeated nations of World War II, Germany and Japan. We still have about three dozen military bases on the modest-sized Japanese island of Okinawa, and are at this very moment fighting tooth and nail, diplomatically speaking, not to be forced to abandon one of them. The Korean War was suspended in an armistice 57 years ago and, again, striking numbers of American troops still garrison South Korea. Similarly, to skip a few decades, after the Serbian air campaign of the late 1990s, the U.S. built-up the enormous Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo with its seven-mile perimeter, and we’re still there. After Gulf War I, the U.S. either built or built up military bases and other facilities in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain in the Persian Gulf, as well as the British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. And it’s never stopped building up its facilities throughout the Gulf region. In this sense, leaving Iraq, to the extent we do, is not quite as significant a matter as sometimes imagined, strategically speaking. It’s not as if the U.S. military were taking off for Dubuque. A history of American withdrawal would prove a brief book indeed. Other than Vietnam, the U.S. military withdrew from the Philippines under the pressure of “people power” (and a local volcano) in the early 1990s, and from Saudi Arabia, in part under the pressure of Osama bin Laden. In both countries, however, it has retained or regained a foothold in recent years. President Ronald Reagan pulled American troops out of Lebanon after a devastating 1983 suicide truck bombing of a Marines barracks there, and the president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, functionally expelled the U.S. from Manta Air Base in 2008 when he refused to renew its lease. (&quot;We'll renew the base on one condition: that they let us put a base in Miami -- an Ecuadorian base,&quot; he said slyly.) And there were a few places like the island of Grenada, invaded in 1983, that simply mattered too little to Washington to stay. Unfortunately, whatever the administration, the urge to stay has seemed a constant. It’s evidently written into Washington’s DNA and embedded deep in domestic politics where sure-to-come &quot;cut and run&quot; charges and blame for &quot;losing&quot; Iraq or Afghanistan would cow any administration. Not surprisingly, when you look behind the main news stories in both Iraq and Afghanistan, you can see signs of the urge to stay everywhere. In Iraq, while President Obama has committed himself to the withdrawal of American troops by the end of 2011, plenty of wiggle room remains. Already, the New York Times reports, General Ray Odierno, commander of U.S. forces in that country, is lobbying Washington to establish “an Office of Military Cooperation within the American Embassy in Baghdad to sustain the relationship after... Dec. 31, 2011.” (“We have to stay committed to this past 2011,” Odierno is quoted as saying. “I believe the administration knows that. I believe that they have to do that in order to see this through to the end. It’s important to recognize that just because U.S. soldiers leave, Iraq is not finished.”) If you want a true gauge of American withdrawal, keep your eye on the mega-bases the Pentagon has built in Iraq since 2003, especially gigantic Balad Air Base (since the Iraqis will not, by the end of 2011, have a real air force of their own), and perhaps Camp Victory, the vast, ill-named U.S. base and command center abutting Baghdad International Airport on the outskirts of the capital. Keep an eye as well on the 104-acre U.S. embassy built along the Tigris River in downtown Baghdad. At present, it’s the largest “embassy” on the planet and represents something new in “diplomacy,” being essentially a military-base-cum-command-and-control-center for the region. It is clearly going nowhere, withdrawal or not. In fact, recent reports indicate that in the near future “embassy” personnel, including police trainers, military officials connected to that Office of Coordination, spies, U.S. advisors attached to various Iraqi ministries, and the like, may be more than doubled from the present staggering staff level of 1,400 to 3,000 or above. (The embassy, by the way, has requested $1,875 billion for its operations in fiscal year 2011, and that was assuming a staffing level of only 1,400.) Realistically, as long as such an embassy remains at Ground Zero Iraq, we will not have withdrawn from that country. Similarly, we have a giant U.S. embassy in Kabul (being expanded) and another mega-embassy being built in the Pakistani capital Islamabad. These are not, rest assured, signs of departure. Nor is the fact that in Afghanistan and Pakistan, everything war-connected seems to be surging, even if in ways often not noticed here. President Obama’s surge decision has been described largely in terms of those 30,000-odd extra troops he’s sending in, not in terms of the shadow army of 30,000 or more extra private contractors taking on various military roles (and dying off the books in striking numbers); nor the extra contingent of CIA types and the escalating drone war they are overseeing in the Pakistani tribal borderlands; nor the quiet doubling of Special Operations units assigned to hunt down the Taliban leadership; nor the extra State department officials for the “civilian surge”; nor, for instance, the special $10 million “pool” of funds that up to 120 U.S. Special Operations forces, already in those borderlands training the paramilitary Pakistani Frontier Corps, may soon have available to spend “winning hearts and minds.” Perhaps it’s historically accurate to say that great powers generally leave home, head elsewhere armed to the teeth, and then experience the urge to stay. With our trillion-dollar-plus wars and yearly trillion-dollar-plus national-security budget, there’s a lot at stake in staying, and undoubtedly in fighting two, three, many Afghanistans (and Iraqs) in the years to come.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>Obama must corral Congressional Democrats to prevent China bashing which will spark another global depression<strong></u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u></strong>A bad recession in the early 1930’s turned into the Great Depression largely because politicians did what they are wont to do. Legislate badly. We may be staring down the barrel of that gun once more.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>A short article in the New York Times which deserves to be much longer points out that relations between China and the U.S. are deteriorating and the governing class has plans to dump some gasoline on the fire.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Specifically, business, unions and lawmakers are getting ready fo force the Obama administration to walk a hard line with the Chinese on their currency value and trade policies. Recall, that Obama ran a campaign that was just a step away from outright protectionism. He hewed to the conventional wisdom that if we could just bring the Chinese, Mexicans, Canadians and assorted other villains to heel then our balance of trade problems would be cured. Now those campaign chits are being called in at the worst of all possible times.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>The head of the Senate Finance Committee, Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, plans legislation to raise tariffs on dumped imports from China and elsewhere. And new Democratic congressmen like Larry Kissell of North Carolina and Dan Maffei of New York have pledged actions to stop jobs from being shipped to China.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>China’s exports declined in November for the first time in seven years, and economic growth may slow by more than half to as little as 5 percent in 2009, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland. That has prompted China’s leaders to increase tax rebates on thousands of exported products; meanwhile, the yuan’s steady rise against the dollar stalled in July, and the currency has barely budged since.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>American companies are preparing trade complaints that could lead to increased tariffs. Lawyers representing companies like Nucor, a large steel maker, NewPage, a maker of coated paper, and smaller textile and steel pipe makers say they are considering new trade complaints against China. Policies in both countries are shaped by the need to cope with steep falls in employment.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>If this doesn’t resonate with you, it should. One of the roots of the Great Depression was the collapse of world trade brought about by protective tariffs. The lesson, which no one has ever disputed, is that if ever again faced with a similar situation, cooperation and concession must be the order of the day. Now faced with a similar situation, we seem to be in danger of repeating the same mistakes.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>Before this spins out of control, Summers, Geithner and even Obama have got to make it clear that no good will come from protectionism at this point in time. That means whipping the Congressional Democrats into line. There will be a time and place at which to address these issues. Now is neither.<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>If you read this blog much, you know that I consider the current problems as they exist within this country fixable. I may disagree with the methods but I believe we can muddle through without too much damage. At the same time, I fear that events outside this country could run completely out of control and destroy our ability to manage the issues. If we contribute to that sort of instability then we may well deserve the fate we create.<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u><span class="Underline">Japan's annual defense report released on Friday underlined the vital role played by U.S. military forces stationed in Japan in protecting Japan and its neighbors in the region. The 488-page Defense of Japan 2010 report also stressed Japan 's bilateral security alliance with the United States, noting that U.S. military presence in Japan was significant in providing deterrence against a possible attack on Japan. The report document said the U.S. Marines stationed in Japan need to be positioned at a strategic place to ensure this deterrence. It hinted that the southwestern prefecture of Okinawa is a better geographic location for the Marines to respond to emergencies in East Asia than Hawaii, Guam or the U.S. mainland. Tokyo and Washington agreed in May to move the U.S. Marine Corps' Futenma Air Station from the densely populated residential area of Ginowan in Okinawa to the less crowded Henoko district at the Marines' Camp Schwab in Nago within the prefecture by 2014. The report reviewed defense-related developments in the past year ending mid-August. It was the first defense white paper unveiled by the government led by the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ). In addition, the document said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) nuclear programs and missile activities are an &quot;extremely destabilizing factor&quot; for the security of Japan and other countries in the Northeast Asian region. </span></u></strong><br />

<strong><u><span class="Underline">Wherever the US military puts down its foot overseas, movements have sprung up to protest the military, social, and environmental consequences of its military bases. This anti-base movement has notched some successes, such as the shut-down of a US navy facility in Vieques, Puerto Rico, in 2003. In the Pacific, too, the movement has made its mark. On the heels of the eruption of Mt Pinatubo, democracy activists in the Philippines successfully closed down the ash-covered Clark Air Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Station in 1991-1992. Later, South Korean activists managed to win closure of the huge Yongsan facility in downtown Seoul. Of course, these were only partial victories. Washington subsequently negotiated a Visiting Forces Agreement with the Philippines, whereby the US military has redeployed troops and equipment to the island, and replaced Korea's Yongsan base with a new one in nearby Pyeongtaek. But these not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) victories were significant enough to help edge the Pentagon toward the adoption of a military doctrine that emphasizes mobility over position. The US military now relies on &quot;strategic flexibility&quot; and &quot;rapid response&quot; both to counter unexpected threats and to deal with allied fickleness. The Hatoyama government may indeed learn to say no to Washington over the Okinawa bases. Evidently considering this a likelihood, former deputy secretary of state and former US ambassador to Japan Richard Armitage has said that the United States &quot;had better have a plan B&quot;. But the victory for the anti-base movement will still be only partial. US forces will remain in Japan, and especially Okinawa, and Tokyo will undoubtedly continue to pay for their maintenance. Buoyed by even this partial victory, however, NIMBY movements are likely to grow in Japan and across the region, focusing on other Okinawa bases, bases on the Japanese mainland, and elsewhere in the Pacific, including Guam. Indeed, protests are already building in Guam against the projected expansion of Andersen Air Force Base and Naval Base Guam to accommodate those Marines from Okinawa. And this strikes terror in the hearts of Pentagon planners. In World War II, the United States employed an island-hopping strategy to move ever closer to the Japanese mainland. Okinawa was the last island and last major battle of that campaign, and more people died during the fighting there than in the subsequent atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined: 12,000 US troops, more than 100,000 Japanese soldiers, and perhaps 100,000 Okinawan civilians. This historical experience has stiffened the pacifist resolve of Okinawans. The current battle over Okinawa again pits the United States against Japan, again with the Okinawans as victims. But there is a good chance that the Okinawans, like the Na'vi in that great NIMBY film Avatar, will win this time. A victory in closing Futenma and preventing the construction of a new base might be the first step in a potential reverse island hop. NIMBY movements may someday finally push the US military out of Japan and off Okinawa. It's not likely to be a smooth process, nor is it likely to happen any time soon. But the kanji (a form of Japanese writing) is on the wall. Even if the Yankees don't know what the Japanese characters mean, they can at least tell in which direction the exit arrow is pointing. </span></u></strong><br />

<strong><u><span class="Underline">Japan voiced concern over China's growing military muscle in a defence paper Friday, as a row with Beijing continued over the arrest of a Chinese trawler captain in disputed waters. In its annual Defence of Japan report, Tokyo pointed to increased Chinese naval activities near its shores, including tense incidents this year in which Chinese helicopters staged close fly-bys of Japanese warships. As it has in past years, the defence ministry report, approved by Prime Minister Naoto Kan's cabinet in the morning, urged Beijing to be clearer about its military spending, including on its blue-water fleet. &quot;China has been intensifying its maritime activities, including those in waters near Japan,&quot; the document said, adding that Beijing had failed to &quot;disclose a clear, specific future vision of its military modernisation&quot;. &quot;The lack of transparency of its national defence policies and the military activities are a matter of concern for the region and the international community, including Japan, which require prudent analysis,&quot; it said. Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa told reporters that China's military strength has significantly changed from last year through this year. &quot;It is the reality. By clearly writing that... I think we were able to firmly express our current understanding,&quot; he said. The report came amid growing concern in the region over China's increased assertiveness in claiming maritime territories, including in the South China Sea, where it has competing claims with Vietnam and other countries. A Pentagon report last month said China was ramping up investment in nuclear weapons, long-range missiles, submarines, aircraft carriers and cyber warfare, and building up a force that could strike as far as the US territory of Guam. In March, China said it was raising its defence budget by 7.5 percent to 532.1 billion yuan -- 77.9 billion dollars at the exchange rate of the time. The Pentagon paper estimated China's overall military-related spending was more than 150 billion dollars in 2009, with areas included that did not figure in the publicly released budget. Japan's report was released in a week when Beijing and Tokyo both issued diplomatic protests in a war of words over Japan's arrest Wednesday of a Chinese skipper whose boat collided with two Japan Coast Guard vessels. The incident took place near an uninhabited island chain in the East China Sea -- a string of rocky outcrops known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China -- which lie in rich fishing ground. China's foreign ministry on Thursday called the captain's arrest &quot;absurd, illegal and invalid&quot; and warned that, if badly handled, it &quot;could have a serious impact on the larger interests of China-Japan relations&quot;. Tokyo suspects the captain deliberately rammed the two Japanese vessels in a confrontation near the disputed island chain. The Asian giants have started talks to jointly exploit energy deposits in maritime areas where their exclusive economic zones overlap, but tense incidents at sea have often set back relations between the traditional rivals. In April, Japanese warships followed a Chinese naval flotilla of 10 vessels, including submarines and destroyers, that sailed in international waters between far-southern Japanese islands, an unusual move that jittered Tokyo. In response to the surveillance, the Chinese fleet sent helicopters to buzz the Japanese ships in close fly-bys, sparking diplomatic protests from Japan. The increased Chinese activity in its southern waters has sparked a defence rethink in which Japan plans to deploy more forces to its scattered southern islands and away from Cold War-era locations in the north near Russia. The defence report also stressed the importance of Japan's 50-year-old security alliance with the United States, which has dozens of bases and almost 50,000 troops stationed in the island nation. The wide-ranging paper also highlighted the threat posed by communist North Korea, calling its nuclear and missile programmes an &quot;extremely destabilising factor&quot;, and looked at emerging threats such as cyber warfare. It also maintained Japan's claims on small islands disputed with South Korea, which are called Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in Korean. Japanese officials reportedly delayed the publication of the white paper by more than a month to avoid angering Seoul ahead of the August 29 centennial of imperial Japan's annexation of the Korean peninsula. </span></u></strong><br />

<strong><u><span class="Underline">Japan's Defense Ministry stressed the importance of U.S. military forces in Japan and cast a wary eye on China's military expansion in an annual report Friday, as diplomatic tensions with China rose following a collision near disputed islands. The annual defense policy report also said a group of South Korean-controlled islands, called Dokdo in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese, were an &quot;integral&quot; part of Japanese territory — prompting protesters in South Korea's capital to try to burn a Japanese flag in a show of anger. The report's release comes amid a growing diplomatic dispute between Japan and China. Beijing has warned Tokyo that bilateral ties could be damaged over the arrest of a Chinese fishing boat captain whose ship collided with two Japanese patrol vessels Tuesday near disputed islands in the East China Sea. China has increased its activity in Japanese waters to defend its territory, protect its maritime interests and deter Taiwanese independence, the defense report said. Highlighting China's increased military spending, it said Beijing's lack of openness in its defense policies and military activities were &quot;a matter of concern for the region and the international community, including Japan, which should require prudent analysis.&quot; It said China has not disclosed specific information about its weapons, procurement goals, details of major units and its national defense budget. China has released defense reports every two years since 1998 but has not yet achieved the level of transparency expected for &quot;a responsible major power in the international society,&quot; it said. China also is developing the technology needed for possessing its own aircraft carrier, it said. The report highlighted the importance of American forces based in Japan under a security pact that marks its 50th anniversary this year, saying they act as a deterrence that contributes to Japan's defense as well as regional security. In particular, having U.S. forces on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa offers a strategic advantage because of its geographic location, allowing them to respond more quickly to emergencies in East Asia than if they were based in Hawaii, Guam or the U.S. mainland, it said. However, many residents of the island of Okinawa, which hosts three-quarters of all U.S. military facilities in Japan, want the bases moved off the island. Under a 2006 agreement to reorganize the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan, Washington is to move 8,000 Marines from Okinawa to the U.S. territory of Guam and relocate U.S. Marine Air Station Futenma, set in the middle of a city, to a less crowded part of the island by 2014. The report said that moving Futenma out of Okinawa — as proposed by former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama — would hinder the Marines' response capabilities, and it was &quot;unavoidable&quot; to keep the base's operations on the island. </span></u></strong><br />

<strong><u><span class="Underline">China's military puts the scare into Japan and the U.S. is a key to keeping peace in the region, Japan's Defense Ministry said in a white paper Friday. &quot;The lack of transparency in [Chinese] national defense policies and the direction of military power are a concern for the region and the international community, including our country, and we need to carefully analyze it,&quot; the 488-page Defense of Japan 2010 report says, according to Japan's Kyodo news agency. The annual report cites worrisome moves by China's military, including 10 Chinese submarines and destroyers being spotted west of Japan's Okinotori Island in April 2010 and a Chinese nuclear submarine entering Japanese waters in November 2004. Conflicting claims to territorial waters and islands -- and the natural resources that go with them -- are one of the Asia-Pacific region's flashpoints. China disputes most of its neighbors' claims and claims nearly the entire South China Sea as its own. Japan and China are currently involved in a conflict over a Chinese trawler that collided with Japanese patrol ships Tuesday off the disputed Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea. The Japanese coast guard arrested the trawler's captain, alleging that he obstructed public officers while they performed their duties. &quot;China will never accept the Japanese side's applying domestic law to the Chinese fishing boat operating in that area,&quot; said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu, according to state-run media. Japan's handling was &quot;absurd, illegal and invalid,&quot; he said, reported the Xinhua news agency. The Japanese defense white paper also focused on the role of the U.S. military in protecting Japan from possible attack. In that role, the U.S. military is best positioned on the Japanese island of Okinawa, the report indicated. </span></u></strong><br />

More often than not, activists face significant structural constraints. In all anti-base movements, whether in Okinawa, South Korea, Guam or the Philippines, activists face great challenges when confronting U.S. base issues because political elites tend to prioritize robust alliance relations with the U.S. Whether a progressive or conservative-leaning government, regardless of who comes to power, political leaders in Tokyo and Seoul generally accept in principle the necessity for U.S. forces to provide regional stability in the mid- to long-term.</strong> A pro-U.S. consensus among political leaders <strong>and bureaucracies, particularly within the defense and foreign policy establishments,</strong> drowns out activist calls<strong></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">for an alternative security framework centered on a reduction of U.S. forces. This ideological constraint makes it difficult for anti-base movements to shift public discussion on U.S. base issues. Moreover, host governments constantly receive a mixture of political pressure and economic incentives to support U.S. alliance obligations. While some government elites are genuinely sympathetic to the plight of local residents, in most cases political and economic forces prevent these actors from executing policy changes that would significantly eliminate or ameliorate the negative effects of U.S. military presence.</span></span></u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Prime Minister Naoto Kan on Friday reiterated his resolve to ease the burden on Okinawa of hosting the bulk of U.S. military bases in Japan, as a council for the national and local governments to discuss the prefecture's future development convened for the first time in more than five years. ''The panel is important and I'm grateful that it was organized for the first time since the change of government (last year),'' Kan said. ''I'm hoping for serious consideration on a range of issues related to the prefecture, including its development measures and how to lessen the burden of hosting the bases.'' Kan is not an official member of the panel but attended the meeting, held for the first time since April 2005, as the prime minister is serious about Okinawa matters, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito Sengoku said at a news conference. At the meeting, Okinawa Gov. Hirokazu Nakaima and all of Kan's Cabinet members agreed to launch two subcommittees, one tasked with the future development of the prefecture and the other with the alleviation of the base-hosting burden. So far, the council has no plans to address the issue of relocating the U.S. Marine Corps' Futenma Air Station within the prefecture, Sengoku said. The convening of the panel comes as local opposition to the central government remains strong over an agreement it reached in May with the United States to relocate the base within the prefecture.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>With a rising China, a destabilizing North Korea and a politically shifting Japan, Northeast Asia poses some big challenges for U.S. policymakers, two former National Security Council officials said recently at an informal briefing at the East-West Center. But some of the Obama administration’s biggest policy hurdles related to the region may actually lie at home, they said, such as securing congressional approval on critical trade agreements. During the informal session with journalists and EWC officials, Victor Cha, now director of Asian studies at Georgetown University and Michael Green, associate professor at Georgetown and the Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, discussed evolving security, economic and social concerns in the region. Both held National Security Council staff positions in the George W. Bush administration. They were in Honolulu working on research projects as EWC visiting fellows. During the discussion, East-West Center President Charles E. Morrison noted that Northeast Asia is an area “where we have a nuclear proliferation threat in North Korea; where we have an emerging power, China, whose economy may surpass that of the United States in the coming decades; and where we have a traditional ally, Japan, that is going through some very difficult leadership and political challenges.” Green said the March sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan in what a multinational investigation team concluded was a North Korean torpedo attack sent a shockwave of effects through the entire region. For example, he said, the implications of the attack contributed to the recent leadership change in Japan, and caused some factions there to reconsider their criticism of the U.S. military presence in the country. The abrupt resignation of short-lived Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama was only the latest twist in the seemingly ever-changing Japanese leadership saga that has made it harder for the U.S. to maintain a strong strategic relationship there, he said.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>The sinking of the South Korean naval vessel, Cheonan, by North Korea served as a dramatic reminder that Northeast Asia is still “a dangerous neighborhood.”</strong> The Japanese Cabinet noticed<strong>. The Japanese government also experienced some difficulties in its relationship with China, in which it had invested a considerable amount. The DPJ has come to understand with increasing clarity that others in the region have been watching closely the U.S.-Japan alliance, and Japan could not afford the impression of a rift to “gain traction.”</strong> It turns out that all politics is not 100 percent local, <strong>as it had been seen in Japan for some months before then. The decision came against a series of other policy decisions by the Japanese government that demonstrate that the alliance is about more than basing issues. Japan has allocated $900 million in its current budget towards a multi-year, $5 billion, pledge to the Afghan Army and police, including for rehabilitation and training of demobilized Taliban and important development projects. Japan, like the United States, believes that peace and security in Afghanistan depend significantly on stability in Pakistan, and Tokyo has pledged $1 billion in assistance to Pakistan and hosted a major pledging conference. Japan has strongly backed the Republic of Korea, in the face of aggression from the North, in the wake of the Cheonan incident. Its solidarity with South Korea has been firm and public. Japan has sought trilateral cooperation with the U.S. and South Korea, and taken a leading role in fashioning a UN Security Council response. As a member of the UN Security Council, this year, Japan is supporting the U.S.–led draft of a resolution on Iran. Prime Minister Kan – Prime Minister to be Kan – indeed reiterated that support in his first conversation with President Obama, this past week. Japan’s leadership has made clear recently that it favors U.S. participation in an eventual East Asian Community, a change taken from the DPJ position last fall. Japan strongly supported President Obama’s initiatives in the April Nuclear Security Summit and worked closely with the U.S. delegation at the NPT Review Conference in May. So, nine months after the DPJ’s electoral victory, the scorecard, from the U.S. perspective, at last, is positive and improving. There has been lots of attention to what a rough ride it has been, to the precipitous decline in Hatoyama’s polling numbers and, ultimately, his demise, his political demise, to the difficulties of the DPJ government in “getting its feet under it.” And now the – as I said – the resignation. I’ll leave to experts on Japan the analysis of these, but from the viewpoint of the U.S., the larger issue, in conclusion, is this:</strong> That Japan has gone through the single most dramatic political change in 50 years – after 50 years of stasis in party rule, and the U.S.-Japan alliance has emerged in sound condition, having been scrutinized and ultimately validated by the new political leadership. This is, in one sense, not surprising, since 80 percent of all Japanese, in polling, support the alliance. <strong>That is the indispensible foundation for the alliance.</u></strong><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><strong><u>One thing that has not changed about the U.S.-Japan security alliance in the fifty years that it has existed is that it is supposed to have maintained regional stability. If stability is defined as a state where war or the high level threat of war does not exist, then the alliance has not been terribly effective. Although the Soviet Union never attacked Japan during the Cold War, other serious destabilizing forces have appeared despite the continued existence of the bilateral alliance. The Korean War, which began in June 1950, did not end after the signing of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty in 1951 nor after the accord went into effect in 1952. The alliance did not prevent China from developing nuclear weapons-hardly a stabilizing event in the region. The U.S.-Japan alliance did not prevent or end the Vietnam War. More recently, the U.S.-Japan security alliance did not stop the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) from beginning a nuclear weapons program in the early 1990s, thwart Pyongyang's missile development efforts, or discourage it from launching a projectile over Japan without prior notice in August 1998. With the bilateral alliance in effect for decades, China went ahead with nuclear testing in 1995 to assure that its nuclear arsenal was capable of neutralizing the threats it perceives from the other nuclear powers.</u></strong></span><br />

<strong><u>TOKYO—When President Barack Obama arrives in Yokohama for an Asian-Pacific summit Friday, he will find some welcome news: a marked improvement in the recently testy security relationship with Japan, America's most important ally in the region. While the two countries remain prominently at loggerheads over the relocation of a U.S. Marine base on the island of Okinawa, officials on both sides of the Pacific say that, behind the scenes, they have seen a</strong> subtle but swift improvement in ties <strong>on a number of fronts. The two governments have resumed a stalled dialogue to define military roles, missions and capabilities. After floating the idea of cutting the amount it spends to support U.S. troops in Japan last year, Tokyo has now ruled out any reduction in what is known as host-nation support, or HNS, even as the rest of its budget faces spending cuts to rein in its massive outstanding debt. &quot;In this environment of uniform budget cuts, HNS is being given special protection,&quot; said Jun Azumi, Japan's senior parliamentary vice minister of defense. &quot;That should send an important message to the U.S.&quot; HNS pays for various labor, facilities, utilities and other costs for U.S. forces in Japan, which help protect the country. Under Japan's postwar constitution, its military is limited to self-defense. However, it has become one of Asia's most powerful armed forces. Prime Minister Naoto Kan's government is moving toward easing a ban on arms exports in order to foster cross-border weapons development with the U.S. That initiative, Japanese officials say, will likely be included in a five-year defense-spending plan and a set of strategic defense guidelines due out in December. Officials say those initiatives may eventually lead to the purchase of U.S.-made F-35 stealth jet fighters and unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles to upgrade and expand Japan's military capabilities. Although the Okinawa base debate is mired in local politics, there has been a significant shift in how the national Japanese government views the matter.</strong> Tokyo <strong>says it</strong> is now committed to keeping the base on the island <strong>in some form. &quot;Maintaining the bilateral alliance is like gardening,&quot; said Takashi Shiraishi, a Cabinet Office adviser to Mr. Kan and a member of the Japanese government's advisory panel setting up the defense guidelines. &quot;If you don't tend to it frequently, it will go to seed.&quot; Not all Japanese officials are as sanguine. Critics blame Mr. Kan's center-left Democratic Party of Japan—which took power for the first time a year ago after defeating the long-ruling center-right Liberal Democratic Party—for sending mixed messages to the U.S. and inviting a recent Chinese incursion into Japanese-administered waters. In September, Japan detained a Chinese captain for several weeks after his fishing trawler collided with a Japanese coast-guard cutter near a chain of disputed islands. &quot;They kept sending wrong messages to our ally, the U.S.,&quot; said Takeshi Iwaya, an opposition LDP member and former parliamentary vice minister of defense. &quot;China saw that the U.S.-Japan relationship was on shaky ground and took advantage of it.&quot; A year ago, under Mr. Kan's predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama, the U.S. and Japan appeared to be drifting apart due to a combination of mistrust and misunderstanding. Messrs. Kan and Hatoyama are both members of the DPJ, but the foreign-policy contrast between them has been striking. In October 2009, the newly elected Mr. Hatoyama openly mulled a reduction in funding for U.S. troops in Japan during parliamentary debate and called for a &quot;comprehensive review&quot; of military ties with the U.S. His foreign-policy agenda sought to upgrade ties within Asia by taking up a long-dormant initiative for an East Asian Community excluding the U.S., with which he sought a more &quot;equal alliance&quot; bilaterally. The Japanese media dubbed the new policy direction &quot;datsubei-nyua,&quot; which roughly translates as &quot;Exit America, Enter Asia.&quot; Now, Asia experts note an improvement in the tone of bilateral relations. They credit policy makers on both sides of the Pacific. &quot;After this real worry in the region that the U.S.-Japan alliance was coming off the rails,</strong> they've shifted it out of reverse<strong>,&quot; said Michael Green, a Japan specialist with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and former special adviser to President George W. Bush. &quot;The Kan cabinet came in with some real realists and the Obama administration deserves credit for smart engagement and patience&quot; with Japan. The recent</strong> standoff between China and Japan <strong>over the handful of uninhabited islands</strong> served as a wake-up call to policy makers <strong>and has led to a broad-based reaffirmation of support for the bilateral defense relationship. While Washington officially remains neutral, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in October reasserted the U.S.'s commitment to defend all Japanese-administered territory—including the disputed islands claimed by China. Mrs. Clinton's vocalization of that implicit stance was warmly received in Tokyo and symbolized the new level of bilateral engagement. At a time of continual budget cuts, Japan's Defense Ministry has requested a 0.6% increase in spending next year for a total of 4.71 trillion yen ($57.3 billion), including 189 billion yen in funding earmarked for U.S. forces in Japan. In an interview last week, Mr. Kan called the U.S.-Japan alliance &quot;extremely important&quot; and indicated the tone had improved in recent months, saying &quot;I do believe the bilateral relationship is currently in a very good condition.'</u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>Two events brought this period of drift in the alliance to an end<strong>. The first was the Democratic Party of Japan’s maturation. While the DPJ has a long way to go toward transitioning from an opposition to a governing party, the intraparty election two months ago provided a turning point. By winning a convincing victory over Ichiro Ozawa (the man who created the party), Naoto Kan solidified his authority. In addition, the election accelerated the ascendance of a younger generation of politicians, including but by no means limited to foreign minister Seiji Maehara, who take a pragmatic stance on security issues, strongly support the alliance, and are determined for Japan to make a greater contribution in the world. The election dispelled much of the political uncertainty overhanging Tokyo and refashioned the DPJ into a more effective US partner. The second event was a maritime confrontation between Japan and China. On September 7, as video footage demonstrates, a Chinese fishing trawler rammed two Japanese Coast Guard vessels patrolling near the Senkakus – an island group administered by Tokyo but also claimed by Beijing. When Japan took the trawler captain into custody, China retaliated by cutting off exports of rare-earth elements, minerals vital to Japan’s high-tech industry. For</strong> the DPJ as well as the Japanese public, <strong>this crisis underscored the value of the alliance.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Washington can take some comfort that the DPJ is showing signs that it will be less obstreperous than it was upon first assuming office last year.

<strong><u></strong>The DPJ government had a belated epiphany that Japan resides in a dangerous neighborhood necessitating a strong security relationship with the U.S. <strong>Of course, that realization necessitated the DPJ jettisoning its prime minister, its corrupt party leader, and large parts of its election platform and reversing itself on key security policies.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u></strong>The DPJ now seeks to repair its <strong>strained</strong> alliance <strong>with the U.S.</strong> Simmering bilateral tension is down<strong>, but Washington continues to await Japanese implementation of an agreement on realigning U.S. forces on Okinawa.

<strong><u>The new DPJ administration thought not. Its leaders saw these steps as an extension of Japanese submission to the United States. The DPJ therefore adopted a different tack for an activist but more independent role. No one understood the predicament of Japan in the post—Cold War era better than Ichiro Ozawa, who is the real power in the part and who is, in his own way, no less shrewd than Yoshida and no less determined to carve out a sphere of autonomous action. “We are depending too heavily on the U.S..” he said recently, “which is why we are so obedient to wishes of American. If Japan would make up its mind about itself there would be no need for the U.S. to have itsforces on the frontline in Japan.” Ozawa wants to open up space between Japan and the United States. He sees the triangular U.S.-Japan-China relationship as becoming an equilateral triangle and does not want Japan to be held hostage to U.S. policy toward China and North Korea or to U.S. global strategy. Ozawa’s trip to China last December with a party of 639 people, including 143 mostly young new Diet members of his part, in tow on five airplanes was a deliberate stunt to demonstrate a will for autonomous foreign policy. In a book published in 2006 entitled <em>Ozawa shugi</em> (<em>The Principles of Ozawa</em>), he laid out his strategy and wrote that “the biggest foreign policy problem for Japan is its relationship with the United States, especially how to deal with America’s ‘war on terrorism.’” The essence of Ozawa’s foreign policy strategy is a UN-centered one that would allow dispatch of Japanese forces abroad only where there is a UN resolution to support it. The alliance would remain principally in the U.S. naval base at Yokosuka, and Japan would work to establish its more independent Asian policy. Ozawa’s UN-centered policy would constitute a new firewall to deter pressure from Washington to accept U.S. foreign policy priorities. It would also help to bridge differences within the DPJ and among the Japanese people with regard to a more activist role in international politics. Ozawa himself must realize that his goals can hardly be achieved in the near future, but he wants to stir sentiment for a more independent foreign policy.</u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u>The opinion piece entitled &quot;Putting Okinawa Air Base in Perspective&quot; by Michael O'Hanlon carried in The Daily Yomiuri on Feb. 3 is a thoughtful discussion of the U.S.-Japan alliance. We fully agree with the &quot;need to lift our sights above bickering over bases and put strategy and [dealing with] the world's real problems back at the center of our alliance,&quot; but we believe Mr. O'Hanlon does not fully appreciate the importance of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma or understand the complex dynamics of the so-called &quot;Okinawa problem.&quot; Moreover,</strong> he downplays the vital role that forward-deployed <strong>United States</strong> Marines fulfill <strong>in meeting the obligations of the 1960 United States-Japan Treaty of Mutual Security and Cooperation.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>There is much to rebut in his op-ed, but we will concentrate on the following four faulty premises: 1) that the functions of MCAS Futenma are less important than Kadena Air Base (KAB) and thus can be forfeited as a political pawn; 2) that sacrificing MCAS Futenma would make KAB less of a political target and thus satisfy anti-base activists in Okinawa and elsewhere; 3) that the U.S. government has not regularly &quot;factored in local sensitivities&quot; into alliance management issues and has done nothing in the past to alleviate local concerns; and 4) that a contingency basing formula in which civilian airports are used is an operationally practical solution.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>While both KAB and MCAS Futenma are co-located in central Okinawa, they have fundamentally different roles and missions. Yet,</strong> there is an important synergy <strong>between the two airfields in daily operations as well as in a contingency if deterrence failed. A loss of the capabilities of</strong> either airfield <strong>could</strong> significantly impact operations during a crisis<strong>. When discussing them, it is not an either/or choice but a clear</strong> requirement for both<strong>. While scholars can hope for the best, planners need to prepare for the worst. One airfield reduces contingency options and creates a military planner's worst nightmare: a single point of failure.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>We disagree that this option is a &quot;tolerable one,&quot; as he suggests, by any means, regardless of whether contingency access to other airfields is improved or not. There are numerous political and operational challenges to the concept of contingency use but the bottom line up front is:</strong> moving <strong>or spreading the functions of</strong> Futenma outside of <strong>the main island of</strong> Okinawa not only would critically affect <strong>the ability of the Marine Corps to perform its daily</strong> operations and <strong>training to sustain</strong> combat readiness as well as to ably and quickly respond to crises, but could also impair <strong>the</strong> deterrence <strong>functions</strong> and credibility of our alliance and <strong>thus</strong> security in the entire region<strong>.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>The USMC takes seriously &quot;local sensitivities&quot; in all aspects of our training and operations, and it was the U.S. and Japanese governments' efforts to address these concerns that were behind the 1996 and 2006 agreements to return Futenma, which were conditioned on a replacement site being found within the prefecture. A replacement facility then and now remains important because the capabilities Futenma possesses are vital to the mission of the Marine Corps and other U.S. forces in Okinawa, as well as being a United Nations Command (Rear) Airfield and a diversion airfield for civilian aircraft. Not only do the Marines provide</strong> significant contributions to deterrence <strong>and defense of Japan and peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region, but are also actively involved in HA/DR missions and Theater Security Cooperation (TSC), which is designed to build transparency and trust in this region. Significantly, there have been hundreds of thousands of lives saved in the region by U.S. Marines, such as during the 12 significant HA/DR operations in the past five years alone, including the 2004 tsunami and the disastrous tropical cyclones in 2007 in Bangladesh and 2008 in Burma in which units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa either directly led or significantly contributed to response efforts.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>The implied argument in the op-ed--that the forfeiting of MCAS Futenma and removal of all Marines from Okinawa would &quot;preserve local support for Kadena&quot;--is misplaced. Regrettably, the fact is</strong> anti-base, anti-alliance activists will only pocket concessions and continue to press for the next one<strong>.</strong> Following the closure of <strong>MCAS</strong> Futenma without a replacement<strong>,</strong> as recommended by <strong>Mr</strong>. O'Hanlon, the activists will likely turn their attention next to closing Kadena <strong>Air Base, which would further degrade alliance capabilities.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>The sinking of the South Korean naval vessel, Cheonan, by North Korea served as a dramatic reminder that Northeast Asia is still “a dangerous neighborhood.”</strong> The Japanese Cabinet noticed<strong>. The Japanese government also experienced some difficulties in its relationship with China, in which it had invested a considerable amount. The DPJ has come to understand with increasing clarity that others in the region have been watching closely the U.S.-Japan alliance, and Japan could not afford the impression of a rift to “gain traction.”</strong> It turns out that all politics is not 100 percent local, <strong>as it had been seen in Japan for some months before then. The decision came against a series of other policy decisions by the Japanese government that demonstrate that the alliance is about more than basing issues. Japan has allocated $900 million in its current budget towards a multi-year, $5 billion, pledge to the Afghan Army and police, including for rehabilitation and training of demobilized Taliban and important development projects. Japan, like the United States, believes that peace and security in Afghanistan depend significantly on stability in Pakistan, and Tokyo has pledged $1 billion in assistance to Pakistan and hosted a major pledging conference. Japan has strongly backed the Republic of Korea, in the face of aggression from the North, in the wake of the Cheonan incident. Its solidarity with South Korea has been firm and public. Japan has sought trilateral cooperation with the U.S. and South Korea, and taken a leading role in fashioning a UN Security Council response. As a member of the UN Security Council, this year, Japan is supporting the U.S.–led draft of a resolution on Iran. Prime Minister Kan – Prime Minister to be Kan – indeed reiterated that support in his first conversation with President Obama, this past week. Japan’s leadership has made clear recently that it favors U.S. participation in an eventual East Asian Community, a change taken from the DPJ position last fall. Japan strongly supported President Obama’s initiatives in the April Nuclear Security Summit and worked closely with the U.S. delegation at the NPT Review Conference in May. So, nine months after the DPJ’s electoral victory, the scorecard, from the U.S. perspective, at last, is positive and improving. There has been lots of attention to what a rough ride it has been, to the precipitous decline in Hatoyama’s polling numbers and, ultimately, his demise, his political demise, to the difficulties of the DPJ government in “getting its feet under it.” And now the – as I said – the resignation. I’ll leave to experts on Japan the analysis of these, but from the viewpoint of the U.S., the larger issue, in conclusion, is this:</strong> That Japan has gone through the single most dramatic political change in 50 years – after 50 years of stasis in party rule, and the U.S.-Japan alliance has emerged in sound condition, having been scrutinized and ultimately validated by the new political leadership. This is, in one sense, not surprising, since 80 percent of all Japanese, in polling, support the alliance. <strong>That is the indispensible foundation for the alliance.</u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u>In recent months there has been a blizzard of journalistic commentary on Futenma—hundreds of op ed pieces and television specials on the issue, replete with short-term forecasts on how it may affect the incumbent Japanese administration or the U.S.-Japan alliance. Yet there has been remarkably little serious research—and no at-length historical studies covering the evolution of the controversy from its origins—on just how we got to where we are today. This analytical gap is not only unfortunate from a scholarly standpoint; it also blinds us to important political dynamics, and policy options, that have been relevant in the past, and may well shape the future.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>We could not ask for a more appropriate analytical viewpoint on such a hybrid policy-research question than that of Bill Brooks, a valued colleague here at SAIS, wit njkh a Columbia Ph.D., with whom I worked closely at US Embassy Tokyo a decade ago. Bill served for fifteen years, until 2009, as head of the Office of Translation and Media Analysis at the Embassy, monitoring and analyzing political-economic developments in Japan, and Japanese reactions to them, for U.S. government officials in both Tokyo and Washington. His research and advice were always well respected, and his appreciation of subtle developments within Japan, as an American fully fluent in Japanese language and culture, were unequalled. Now, for the first time, we get his public view of fateful events that Dr. Brooks witnessed directly and at close hand as a public servant, although the analysis itself draws only—Bill is careful to add—on openly available sources. It is for the reader to decide how he or she views this unique analysis, on an issue fraught with public controversy. It needs to be read completely, and a brief summary cannot do it justice. That said, there are recurring themes it is useful to stress from the outset:</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>(1) The Lessons of History. The Futenma controversy has been boiling on for over fifteen years, but the basic options—relocation to the vicinity of Henoko; choices among mobile basing, reclamation, land-based options inside Camp Schwab, and the so-called QIP method—remain remarkably constant. So do many of the political responses to each of the options.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>(2) The Centrality of Politics. Time and again, political decisions—at the national level and at the prefectural and local levels within Okinawa— have complicated resolution of what seemed originally to be a promising, simple, and creative resolution to the pressing imperative of closing an aging military facility in a crowded urban area, and moving it to a less threatening environment. Interested parties transformed the initial, relatively simple option of a heliport at Henoko, inside Camp Schwab, into a variety of complex permutations. New administrations felt the need to impose their own resolutions, even when doing so opened Pandora’s boxes. And within Okinawa itself, the preferred option again and again was simply indecision—keeping base issues in play, so as to extract maximum benefit from all parties, without the downside of implementing something distasteful.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>(3) The “Mission Creep” Dynamic. The original proposal for Futenma relocation was relatively simple—a land-based heliport inside Camp Schwab. For a variety of reasons, on both the American and the Japanese sides, the plans that ultimately emerged were, time and time again, much more elaborate. Technological change, and the related introduction of new operating equipment and logistical requirements, was one reason; political and economic pressures had their impact also.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u></strong>They’re wrong—80% of the public like military presence<strong></u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u>At another level, though, Japanese voters and bureaucrats have clearly indicated their preference for a continued close alliance relationship with the United States. The fact that the latest annual poll conducted by Japan’s Cabinet Office in December 2009 found the highest level of friendly feelings toward the United States (78.9%) since the polling began in the mid-1970s and that 81.8% of respondents held a favorable view of U.S.-Japan relations should encourage leaders of both states. Voters have criticized the DPJ for undermining U.S.-Japan relations, criticism the DPJ must effectively address to remain in power. The latest <em>Diplomatic Bluebook</em> issued by Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in April 2010 also underscores the importance of the alliance to Japan’s overall foreign policy.</u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u>The continued U.S. military presence in Japan has been a growing concern for the Japanese public, and last week it became a lever to pry Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama from office. The first Democratic Party Prime Minister in half a century may have brought that fate upon himself by promising during last fall's election campaign to move a key U.S. air base off Okinawa, and perhaps out of Japan entirely. That promise broke with his predecessors' tradition of treating the U.S. presence in Japan as an American birthright, but what proved to be Hatoyama's undoing was his failure to deliver.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Despite the Hatoyama government's intentions, Washington refused to back down from a 2006 pact between the two nations permitting its continued base rights on Okinawa, nearly 1,000 miles south of Tokyo. A legacy of World War II, 47,000 U.S. troops are based in Japan within two or three days' sail of potential hot spots on the Korean peninsula and the Taiwan Strait. Hatoyama's fall suggests that</strong> despite the Japanese people's desire for a reduced U.S. military presence, they aren't ready to give up the protection it offers<strong>. &quot;Hatoyama got into difficulty with the Japanese people because it was perceived that he was weakening the security of Japan,&quot; says Tom Schieffer, U.S. ambassador to Japan from 2005 to 2009. &quot;The security of Japan is tied to the U.S.-Japanese alliance, and it has been that way since the end of the war.&quot;</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Japan's new Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, confirmed his nation's inherent conservatism on Sunday. In a 15-min. phone call with President Obama, the new Japanese leader pledged that he would work to fulfill the 2006 deal under which the U.S. Marines' Futenma air base on Okinawa would be relocated from its current cramped quarters to a more remote part of the island. Kan honored the agreement by confirming on Tuesday that he would move the base to a less-crowded part of Okinawa, as well as try to reduce the burden on the island for hosting the many U.S. military bases that are part of the joint security pact.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>The issue of the U.S. military presence on Okinawa is a highly sensitive one. The tragic rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl by American servicemen in 1995 brought problems to a head, but trouble had been brewing for years. About 20,000 Marines and 7,000 Air Force troops--more than half the total U.S. troop strength in Japan--are based on Okinawa. U.S. bases cover almost one-fifth of the densely populated island.

<strong><u>A Japanese schoolgirl, allegedly the victim of a hit-and-run accident involving a U.S. Marine, has died, hospital officials said Thursday. Yuki Uema, an 18-year-old high school student, died in the hospital of injuries sustained in the October 7 accident, they said. She never regained consciousness after the initial impact, hospital officials said. CBS News Correspondent Barry Petersen reports that the incident has intensified Japanese protests of the American military presence on Okinawa and sent U.S. officials scrambling to contain the damage. Japanese investigators said Uema was riding a motorcycle around 4.30 a.m. in a village in Okinawa when she was struck by a car driven by 23-year-old Randall Eskridge. &quot;This is a tragic, needless loss,&quot; said the commander of Japan's U.S. Marine Corps bases, Lt. Gen. Frank Libutti. &quot;We know there is little we can say to ease the Uema family's pain and grief but we are very sorry.&quot; The incident added further damage to already frayed relations between the U.S. military and Okinawa residents, many of whom want U.S. forces withdrawn from the southernmost Japanese prefecture. In a rare criticism Thursday, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka expressed anger over Uema's death at a news conference, and said the U.S. should improve the standards of conduct of its troops in Japan. &quot;We would like to express our strong sense of regret to the United States government and ask them to take the strongest possible steps to prevent the recurrence of such an incident,&quot; Nonaka said. The U.S. military on Tuesday handed Eskridge over to Japanese prosecutors, who have indicted him on charges of drunken driving, leaving the scene of an accident and professional negligence to cause injury. Eskridge, a native of La Porte, Indiana, is a flight equipment technician at Futenma Marine Corps air station near the Okinawan capital, Naha. The incident has prompted a flurry of official apologies from the U.S. government, including one from U.S. Ambassador to Japan Thomas Foley. A Marine Corps spokesman said Marines on Okinawa this week are spending half a day in briefings on alcohol use and moral values. The sessions include a period of reflection on Uema's family, he said. The girl's funeral is scheduled for Friday. The presence of nearly 27,000 U.S. servicemen on the island is an irritant that spilled over into outrage three years ago when three U.S. servicemen were accused of raping an Okinawa girl. They were convicted of the 1995 crime.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>It is also evident from researching the Japanese press that politics played a dominant role, sometimes for the better but more often for the worse, during the various negotiations. But the political strategies and even artifices that can be seen playing out at the central and local government levels in the two earlier sets of negotiations seem oddly missing from the efforts of the current political administration since last fall. Earlier sets of talks practiced a kind of brinksmanship and sometimes threatened to reach crisis proportions. But in the end, both sides always pulled away from the brink to reach a compromise that eased tensions and ultimately resolved the issue, often with the intervention of strong leaders, seeking to balance alliance and Okinawa interests as best as possible. The U.S. in the past was always closely involved – these were bilateral negotiations -- unlike the current unilateral process done in isolation by a small group of coalition leaders each with pet proposals, none of which had even been vetted with others, not to mention the U.S. and affected local leaders and communities. The outcome from such an unstructured and haphazard process to most observers seemed doomed to failure from the start.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u></strong>Carriers fail<strong></u></strong><br />

<strong><u>&quot;Aircraft carrier battle groups are the mainstay of US military and protect commerce supremacy which is primarily through ocean-transit. They serve as America’s chief instrument for global power projection and world dominance. In this capability, the US has no equal. At the moment, the US maintains a total of 12 aircraft carrier battle groups. In comparison, China has none. However, China’s strategy in defeating the superior by the inferior is shashaojian or the &quot;assassin’s mace&quot;. &quot;Mace&quot; is not only a blinding spray; it is also a meaner and deadlier weapon, a spiked war club of ancient times used to knock out an adversary with one blow. The spikes of the modern Chinese mace may well</strong> spell the end for aircraft carriers<strong>. The first of these spikes consists of medium- and short-range ballistic missiles (modified and improved DF 21s/CSS-5 and DF 15s) with terminally guided maneuverable re-entry vehicles with circular error probability of 10 meters. DF 21s/CSS-5s can hit slow-moving targets at sea up to 2,500km away. The second spike is an array of supersonic and highly accurate cruise missiles, some with range of 300km or more, that can be delivered by submarines, aircraft, surface ships or even common trucks (which are ideal for use in terrain like that of Iran along the Persian Gulf). These supersonic cruise missiles travel at more than twice the speed of sound (mach 2.5), or faster than a rifle bullet. They can be armed with conventional, anti-radiation, thermobaric, or electro-magnetic pulse warheads, or even nuclear warheads if need be. The Aegis missile defense system and the Phalanx Close-in Defense weapons of the US Navy are ineffective against these supersonic cruise missiles. A barrage of these cruise missiles, followed by land-based intermediate- or short-range ballistic missiles with terminal guidance systems,</strong> could wreak havoc on an aircraft carrier battle group<strong>. Whether there are seven or 15 carrier battle groups, it will not matter, for China has enough ballistic and cruise missiles to destroy them all. The first and second spikes of the &quot;assassin’s mace&quot; are sufficient to render the aircraft carrier battle groups obsolete. But there is a third spike which is equally dreadful. This is the deadly SHKVAL or &quot;Squall&quot; rocket torpedo developed by Russia and passed on to China. It is like an under-water missile. Its high speed makes evasive maneuvers by carriers or nuclear submarines highly difficult. It is truly a submarine and carrier buster. The &quot;assassin’s mace&quot; has still more spikes. The fourth spike consists of extra-large, bottom-rising, rocket-propelled sea mines laid by submarines along the projected paths of advancing carrier battle groups. These sea mines are designed specifically for targeting aircraft carriers. They can be grouped in clusters so that they will hit the carriers in barrages. The final spike of the mace is a fleet of old fighter aircraft (China has thousands of them) modified as unmanned combat aerial vehicles fitted with extra fuel tanks and armed with stand-off anti-ship missiles. They are also packed with high explosives so that after firing off their precision-guided anti-ship missiles on the battle group, they will then finish their mission by dive-bombing &quot;kamikaze&quot; style into their targets. If we now combine the mace as a means of blinding an adversary and the mace as a spiked war club, one can see the complete picture of how China will use the &quot;assassin’s mace.&quot; Although China does not possess a single operational aircraft carrier, it has converted their entire navy into a &quot;virtual aircraft carrier&quot; that is unsinkable and capable of devastating aircraft carrier battle groups that the US and its allies can muster.&quot;</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>This is no longer the case. The U.S. faces no great maritime challengers. While China appears to be toying with the idea of building a serious Navy</strong> this is many years off<strong>. Right now it appears to be designing a military to keep others, including the United States, away, out of the Western Pacific and Asian littorals. But even if it were seeking to build a large Navy, many analysts argue that other than Taiwan it is difficult to see a reason why Washington and Beijing would ever come to blows. Our former adversary, Russia, would have a challenge fighting the U.S. Coast Guard, much less the U.S. Navy. After that,</strong> there are no other navies of consequence<strong>. Yes, there are some scenarios under which Iran might attempt to close the Persian Gulf to oil exports, but how much naval power would really be required to reopen the waterway? Actually, the U.S. Navy would probably need more mine countermeasures capabilities than it currently possesses.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>More broadly, it appears that the nature of the security challenges confronting the U.S. has changed dramatically over the past several decades. There are only a few places where even large-scale conventional conflict can be considered possible.</strong> None of these would be primarily maritime <strong>in character although U.S. naval forces could make a significant contribution by employing its offensive and defensive capabilities over land. For example, the administration’s current plan is to rely on sea-based Aegis missile defenses to protect regional allies and U.S. forces until a land-based variant of that system can be developed and deployed. The sea ways, sometimes called the global commons, are predominantly free of dangers. The exception to this is the chronic but relatively low level of piracy in some parts of the world. So, the classic reasons for which nations build navies, to protect its own shores and its commerce or to place the shores and commerce of other states in jeopardy, seem relatively unimportant in today’s world.</u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u>With an eye on diminishing budgets and rising tensions with Iran and North Korea, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead on June 24 called for continued international partnerships to hone a “just and sustainable international order.” He also continued his call for fiscal restraint, emphasizing that the Navy “cannot afford a tailor-made solution to every need that we have.” But the CNO still is adamant that a 313-ship Navy is needed to</strong> maintain maritime security<strong>. Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of Lexington Institute, a military consulting firm, said he “skimmed the report and moved on,” but also cautioned that the recommendations reflect the kind of political environment the Navy will be facing in the next decade. “It will have to fight every budget year to prove the fleet is relevant,” he said. “We are talking about a country that is spending a trillion dollars each year it does not have. At some point, something has to give.” Thompson took issue with, and laughed at, some of the report’s recommendations, notably that the military does not need a new fighter jet. “The Super Hornet is a great aircraft,” Thompson said. “But the F-35 purchase covers the next four decades, and I’m not sure I would want to fly a non-stealthy aircraft against Chinese air defenses 20 years from now.” Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., also takes issue with some of the report’s recommendations — specifically, the call to reduce ballistic-missile subs to seven. The plan for 12 new boomers to replace the retiring Ohio class is a standing point of contention, as it carries an $80 billion price tag. That would consume half of the Navy’s shipbuilding budget for 14 years. While the task force looks to reduce boomers to save money, Courtney is looking for alternate funding. He wants to separate programs like SSBN(X) — the replacement for the Ohio class — from the military’s budget and place them in their own national security funding stream, in much the same way missile defense and sealift/auxiliary ships are funded. He said that “no serious analysis” has said it is possible to meet mission requirements with fewer than 48 attack subs and 12 boomers: At that point, he said, “you’re ending up with shadow Navy.”</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>On August 1, 2008, the TSBF numbered 280 ships of all types (see Figure One).3 Predictably, naval advocates fretted that the smaller fleet posed a great risk to US national security. For example, Seth Cropsey, a Deputy Undersecretary of the Navy in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, cautioned that, “Without intending it, US policy is verging toward unilateral naval disarmament.”4 He went on to say: The Navy’s focus is [unclear]. Its [280] combat ships — a number that House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton called “shocking” — comprise a force that is less than half the size achieved during the Reagan years . . . The last time the US possessed so small a fleet was sometime between December 1916 and April 1917, on the eve of the nation’s entry into World War I. While technically true, these dire comments are misleading. Of the many ways to gauge US naval power, comparing the size of the current US battle force to that of past US fleets is the least useful. Past TSBFs are reflections of different strategic environments, federal budgets, national grand strategies, and stages of technological development. They also reflect the state of the contemporary global naval competition. In 1916, although the TSBF numbered only 245 ships of all types, the 36 battleships of the Navy’s battle line placed it second among world navies behind the British Royal Navy. Despite having “only” 245 ships, it could safely assume it would never have to fight the Royal Navy, and be relatively confident that it could fight and defeat any other navy in the world. During the 1980s, even as it grew to a post-Vietnam high of nearly 600 vessels, the Navy was fighting off a concerted effort by the Soviet Navy to knock it out of the top spot.5 In other words, whether today’s TSBF is as big as the US fleets in 1916 or 1987 is utterly irrelevant. Far more important is the answer to the following question: how does the US Navy stack up against its potential contemporary competitors? And the answer to this question paints a very different picture than comparing today’s TSBF with that of past US fleets. SECOND TO NONE The first true indicator of US naval dominance comes from comparing the size of the US battle force with other world navies. What alarmists over fleet size fail to mention is that although the US TSBF is the smallest it has been in over ninety years, so too are the rest of the world’s navies.6 At the height of its naval dominance, Great Britain strove to achieve at least a “two-navy standard.” That is, the Royal Navy aimed to maintain a fleet and battle line that was as large as the combined fleets of the two closest naval powers. Today, counting those ships that can perform naval fire and maneuver in distant theaters — aviation platforms of all types, tactical submarines (nuclear and diesel-electric attack boats and conventional guided-missile submarines), and surface combatants and amphibious ships with full load displacements greater than 2,000 tons7 — the next two largest contemporary navies belong to Russia and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Together, they operate a total of 215 warships of all types. The US Navy alone operates</strong> 203 such warships<strong>, very close to, but not quite, a two-navy standard.8 However, when factoring in a second important indicator of naval power — aggregate fleet displacement (tonnage) — the US Navy enjoys considerably more than a two-navy standard. As naval analyst Geoffrey Till explains, “[t]here is a rough correlation between the ambitions of a navy and the size and individual fighting capacity of its main units, provided they are properly maintained and manned.”9 Therefore, full load displacements and aggregate fleet warship displacements are the best proxies available to measure a ship’s and a fleet’s overall combat capability, respectively. Accordingly, both are useful measures for sizing up the contemporary global hierarchy of naval competitors.10 When considering aggregate fleet displacements, the US Navy’s overwhelming advantage in combat capability is readily apparent. Besides the United States, there are only twenty navies in the world that operate fleets with aggregate displacements of 50,000 tons or more. In order of fleet displacement (largest to smallest), these navies are operated by: Russia, the PRC, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, India, Taiwan, Italy, Indonesia, Spain, South Korea, Brazil, Turkey, Australia, Greece, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Peru, and Singapore. Together, these twenty navies operate a total of 719 ships with a combined displacement of 3,632,270 tons.11 In comparison, the combined displacement of the US Navy’s 203 fighting warships totals 3,121,014 tons — which exceeds the total tonnage of warships operated by the next thirteen navies combined. In other words, in terms of overall fleet combat capability, the US Navy enjoys a thirteen-navy standard. However, it is important to note that of the twenty countries discussed above, eighteen are formal US allies (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom), governments friendly to the United States, (Peru, Brazil, Indonesia, and Singapore), or emerging strategic partners (India). Moreover, all of these nations are either full or partial democracies. The likelihood of the United States ever finding itself in a war or naval confrontation with any of these countries is extremely remote. Indeed, if anything, during times of crisis the US Navy can normally count on receiving important naval contributions from some or all of these nations. At the turn of the twentieth century, the officers of the British Royal Navy concluded that they would never again fight the US Navy, and could remove its rapidly expanding fleet from calculations over the minimal two-navy standard. Similarly, eight years after the turn of the twenty-first century, the US can confidently exclude these eighteen navies from its naval force planning calculations. This is the implicit message of the Navy’s recently published Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower, which seeks to foster and sustain cooperative maritime relationships with more international partners.12</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>Despite the institutional development of the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) for the coordination of Okinawa’s issues, Okinawa has continued to suffer from its subordination to the U.S. military. More importantly, the democratic decision-making process continues to be ignored by Tokyo. The most recent contentious issue was over the relocation of the functions of Futenma airbase to a new offshore heliport in Henoko. Since ‘</strong>relocation’ is fundamentally different from ‘reduction’<strong>, citizens formed a grassroots opposition movement to this plan. As a result, Nago City, which had already negotiated with Tokyo, reluctantly held a plebiscite. The result was the rejection of the heliport plan (52.86% against, 45.33% for this plan). Nevertheless, Mayor Higa Tetsuya pledged his city’s support for the plan and then resigned.23 Ota Masahide, the governor of Okinawa, endorsed the plebiscite and skillfully attracted the media’s attention by contacting Washington officials directly and refusing to sign off the enforced leasing of Okinawa’s land.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>In the north, the United States may also have options to better exploit its close security relationship with Japan. Should the U.S. Marine Corps force on Okinawa be reduced or even eliminated, the United States should investigate the possibility of establishing the current Marine Corps air station at Futenma as a collocated operating base (COB) for USAF fighters. Kept in a caretaker status during peacetime, the base would be prepared to accept a rapid influx of combat and support aircraft in a crisis. An auxiliary Marine Corps airfield on Ie Jima could also be used, and the USAF may be able to deploy some assets to the Japan air self-defense force base at Naha.20</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Implications for the Military and USAF: The Challenges of Change 73 Okinawa itself lies only about halfway down the Ryukyu Island chain. Further southwest—and hence considerably closer to Taiwan—are a number of islands. Figure 4.5 shows the locations of a number of existing airfields in these islands, and Table 4.2 displays some of their more salient characteristics.21 Shimojishima, for example, is less than 250 nm from Taipei and has a commercial airport with a 10,000- foot runway; the island also features a sizable port that serves as a base for Japanese patrol boats. Basing on one or more of the southern Ryukyus would clearly be advantageous for the defense of Taiwan; however, it is unclear how much investment would be needed to create adequate facilities (by extending runways, installing munitions storage facilities, and so on).</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Whether an expanded or at least southward-shifted USAF base posture in Japan would be feasible from Tokyo’s point of view remains to be evaluated. U.S. basing has long been a contentious issue within the Japanese body politic, and any attempt to create new bases—or even COBs—would almost certainly provoke controversy. This might be especially true of requests to use airfields in the Southern Ryukyus, which the Okinawa prefecture wishes to promote as ecologically friendly vacation destinations.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>One way to</strong> overcome resistance <strong>to an initiative to</strong> permit U.S. access <strong>to the Southern Ryukyus might be either explicitly or implicitly to offer the Japanese government in general—and the Okinawan people in particular—a</strong> quid pro quo arrangement<strong>. The removal or reduction of U.S. forces elsewhere in the islands, such as the withdrawal of the Marines from Okinawa, could be the currency with which Washington might pay for a foothold in the</strong> critical area <strong>surrounding the</strong> troubled waters of the Taiwan Strait<strong>.’</u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u><span style="margin-right: .2in;">The Doomsday Scenario – The high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -horror of horrors -raise the possibility of a nuclear war. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation. There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a nuclear Armaggedon over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else. </span></u></strong><br />

By one estimate, local consumption by U.S. base personnel and their dependents totals 477 million yen per year, including rental payments for off-base housing in addition to consumer goods and services.58 In 1999, U.S. service members paid over 13 million yen in local road taxes and locally provided car insurance alone.59 As a total contribution to economic activity, U.S. bases over the past decade have directly accounted for about 5.5 percent of Okinawa’s annual gross prefectural product.60</strong><br />

<strong><span style="margin-right: .2in;">With that said, it must be noted that for a number of reasons, Shimoji is an ideal location for a U.S.-Japanese air base. First, the 4 square-mile island has a population of only about 75 people, which means U.S. forces and Tokyo will not have to worry about local backlash from the presence of U.S. soldiers — unlike the situation in Okinawa. The island also already has a 10,000-foot concrete runway, which would be sufficient to service a variety of military aircraft, including Japan’s F-15C fighter jet. </span></strong><br />

<strong>When the incentives are outlined, the behavior of Okinawan political agents becomes readily explainable. Although antimilitarist and antibase norms may inform the collective identity of a society,</strong> they do not necessarily generate actual political interests. <strong>Collective identities are important but often remain politically indeterminate when they are overridden by well-targeted material incentives to groups and individuals. Even in a society like Okinawa, where a strong and pervasive norm of antimilitarism dominates local institutions and collective memories, the government of Japan can secure tacit acquiescence to the continued U.S. basing presence through an elaborate set of economic inducements. The triangle of interests held by Washington, Tokyo, and local Okinawans has allowed the American base presence to endure despite decades of protest, while other bases (such as those in the Philippines and Puerto Rico) have been shut down in the face of seemingly similar activism.</strong><br />

Conditions are an important part of our military presence in Japan<br />

<br />
<strong>The issue of U.S. bases in Okinawa is indeed particularly complex because it combines different logics and sometimes contradictory dynamics at three levels of governance. Internationally, the presence of American forces on its soil is a quid pro quo for US protection of Japan in the case of an attack. The bases are also key focal points of Washington’s regional and global military presence. At the local level, the U.S. military presence has shaped the history, the territory, as well as the economic, social nad cultural profile of Okinawa over the last sixty years. It also causes significant disturbances to local communities. The management of these issues by the central government in Tokyo raises the question of its relationships with geographical and cultural fringe regions of Okinawa.</strong><br />

<strong>Washington can also do more to strengthen the foundations of the alliance, primarily via direct engagement of the people of Okinawa. It is time for the United States to revive long-dormant efforts to revitalize Okinawa’s economy with foreign investment, educational aid and exchanges, and infrastructure improvements. Okinawa is Japan’s poorest prefecture, and its resentment of its disproportional basing burden should not be a surprise. Further, a major public diplomacy effort in Okinawa – one that explains the purpose of US bases, listens to local concerns, and can be effective in addressing them – is in order. With a more robust and forthright engagement of Okinawa, the US can begin to address some of the local challenges that has made a basing agreement so difficult to conclude.</strong><br />

<strong>It’s not too late for the US and Japan to turn the Futenma controversy into a win-win situation, but that would require US willingness to discuss significant restructuring of the Marine presence on Okinawa, beyond what is already planned. The first, interim step would be a sincere effort by the US to significantly relocate Marine and Air Force training exercises to different parts of Japan.</strong><br />
<strong>Rather than spending political capital on promoting the wildly unpopular Henoko plan, Kan would be better off pressing governors in other prefectures to accept more US military personnel for basing and training purposes.</strong><br />
<strong>Beyond that, the US and Japan should lock in a firm bilateral understanding on the vital need for a continued, long-term US air and naval presence at Kadena and Yokosuka respectively.</strong><br />
<strong>Japan should be fully part of US regional force structure planning for East Asia, looking at opportunities for joint basing of US and SDF forces, and for ways in which expanded Japanese operational capabilities could best complement those of US forces and alliance goals.</strong><br />
<strong>Seen in that context, the Futenma issue becomes more of a manageable irritant than a perilous fault line that threatens to shake the alliance to its core.</strong><br />
<strong>The Obama administration shows no signs of seeing the issue this way, however, which unfortunately sets the stage down the road for renewed tensions between Washington and Tokyo.</strong><br />

<strong>Not surprisingly, China's bedazzlement policy has set off warning bells in Washington, where the People's Republic is still a focus of primary concern for a cadre of strategic planners inside the Pentagon. The Futenma base - and its potential replacement - would be well situated, should Washington ever decide to send rapid response units to the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, or the Korean peninsula. Strategic planners in Washington like to speak of the &quot;tyranny of distance&quot;, of the difficulty of getting &quot;boots on the ground&quot; from Guam or Hawaii in case of an East Asian emergency.</strong><br />
<strong>Yet the actual strategic value of Futenma is, at best, questionable. The South Koreans are more than capable of dealing with any contingency on the peninsula. And the United States frankly has plenty of firepower by air (Kadena) and sea (Yokosuka) within hailing distance of China. A couple thousand Marines won't make much of a difference (though the leathernecks strenuously disagree). However, in a political environment in which the Pentagon is finding itself making tough choices between funding counterinsurgency wars and old Cold War weapons systems, the &quot;China threat&quot; lobby doesn't want to give an inch. Failure to relocate the Futenma base within Okinawa might be the first step down a slippery slope that could potentially put at risk billions of dollars in Cold War weapons still in the production line. It's hard to justify buying all the fancy toys without a place to play with them. And that's one reason the Obama administration has gone to the mat to pressure Tokyo to adhere to the 2006 agreement. It even dispatched Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to the Japanese capital last October in advance of president Obama's own Asian tour. Like an impatient father admonishing an obstreperous teenager, Gates lectured the Japanese &quot;to move on&quot; and abide by the agreement - to the irritation of both the new government and the public. (See Gates gets grumpy in Tokyo, October 28, 2009) The punditocracy has predictably closed ranks behind a bipartisan Washington consensus that the new Japanese government should become as accustomed to its junior status as its predecessor and stop making a fuss. The Obama administration is frustrated with &quot;Hatoyama's amateurish handling of the issue,&quot; writes Washington Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt. &quot;What has resulted from Mr Hatoyama's failure to enunciate a clear strategy or action plan is the biggest political vacuum in over 50 years,&quot; adds Victor Cha, former director of Asian affairs at the National Security Council.

<br />
<strong>&quot;PRO-FUTENMA&quot; MOTIVATIONS: On the US side, many considerations (aside from automatic pilot) went into the lingering hardline stance on Futenma. ONE: Interservice rivalries. From the beginning, the US Air Force and the US Marines heatedly argued against merging Futenma's operations into the US Air base at Kadena. Skipping the (admittedly existing) complications, I have no doubt that if the President said &quot;get it done,&quot; the Marines would be up at Kadena in no time -- and with no where near the reduction in operational capabilities they claim would be entailed. In the late 1990s, Kurt Campbell argued in favor of the Kadena merger. At the time, General Gregson was his aide. They lost. Simply put: A Washington that is now sending young Marines into battle in Afghanistan is not in the mood to tell the Marine Corps leadership to come up with an alternative to Henoko. That is a legitimate point that Japanese officials and politicians should take into account. TWO: The role of Congress. As it is, there are cost-overruns on the huge expansion of military capabilities on Guam. It would not be easy -- short of spending a lot of political capital -- to go back to Congress and say more Marines than expected will be going to Guam.</strong><br />

<strong>One thing that has not changed about the U.S.-Japan security alliance in the fifty years that it has existed is that it is supposed to have maintained regional stability. If stability is defined as a state where war or the high level threat of war does not exist, then the alliance has not been terribly effective. Although the Soviet Union never attacked Japan during the Cold War, other serious destabilizing forces have appeared despite the continued existence of the bilateral alliance. The Korean War, which began in June 1950, did not end after the signing of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty in 1951 nor after the accord went into effect in 1952. The alliance did not prevent China from developing nuclear weapons-hardly a stabilizing event in the region. The U.S.-Japan alliance did not prevent or end the Vietnam War. More recently, the U.S.-Japan security alliance did not stop the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) from beginning a nuclear weapons program in the early 1990s, thwart Pyongyang's missile development efforts, or discourage it from launching a projectile over Japan without prior notice in August 1998. With the bilateral alliance in effect for decades, China went ahead with nuclear testing in 1995 to assure that its nuclear arsenal was capable of neutralizing the threats it perceives from the other nuclear powers.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The opinion piece entitled &quot;Putting Okinawa Air Base in Perspective&quot; by Michael O'Hanlon carried in The Daily Yomiuri on Feb. 3 is a thoughtful discussion of the U.S.-Japan alliance. We fully agree with the &quot;need to lift our sights above bickering over bases and put strategy and [dealing with] the world's real problems back at the center of our alliance,&quot; but we believe Mr. O'Hanlon does not fully appreciate the importance of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma or understand the complex dynamics of the so-called &quot;Okinawa problem.&quot; Moreover, he downplays the vital role that forward-deployed United States Marines fulfill in meeting the obligations of the 1960 United States-Japan Treaty of Mutual Security and Cooperation.</strong><br />
<strong>There is much to rebut in his op-ed, but we will concentrate on the following four faulty premises: 1) that the functions of MCAS Futenma are less important than Kadena Air Base (KAB) and thus can be forfeited as a political pawn; 2) that sacrificing MCAS Futenma would make KAB less of a political target and thus satisfy anti-base activists in Okinawa and elsewhere; 3) that the U.S. government has not regularly &quot;factored in local sensitivities&quot; into alliance management issues and has done nothing in the past to alleviate local concerns; and 4) that a contingency basing formula in which civilian airports are used is an operationally practical solution.</strong><br />
<strong>While both KAB and MCAS Futenma are co-located in central Okinawa, they have fundamentally different roles and missions. Yet, there is an important synergy between the two airfields in daily operations as well as in a contingency if deterrence failed. A loss of the capabilities of either airfield could significantly impact operations during a crisis. When discussing them, it is not an either/or choice but a clear requirement for both. While scholars can hope for the best, planners need to prepare for the worst. One airfield reduces contingency options and creates a military planner's worst nightmare: a single point of failure.</strong><br />
<strong>We disagree that this option is a &quot;tolerable one,&quot; as he suggests, by any means, regardless of whether contingency access to other airfields is improved or not. There are numerous political and operational challenges to the concept of contingency use but the bottom line up front is: moving or spreading the functions of Futenma outside of the main island of Okinawa not only would critically affect the ability of the Marine Corps to perform its daily operations and training to sustain combat readiness as well as to ably and quickly respond to crises, but could also impair the deterrence functions and credibility of our alliance and thus security in the entire region.</strong><br />
<strong>The USMC takes seriously &quot;local sensitivities&quot; in all aspects of our training and operations, and it was the U.S. and Japanese governments' efforts to address these concerns that were behind the 1996 and 2006 agreements to return Futenma, which were conditioned on a replacement site being found within the prefecture. A replacement facility then and now remains important because the capabilities Futenma possesses are vital to the mission of the Marine Corps and other U.S. forces in Okinawa, as well as being a United Nations Command (Rear) Airfield and a diversion airfield for civilian aircraft. Not only do the Marines provide significant contributions to deterrence and defense of Japan and peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region, but are also actively involved in HA/DR missions and Theater Security Cooperation (TSC), which is designed to build transparency and trust in this region. Significantly, there have been hundreds of thousands of lives saved in the region by U.S. Marines, such as during the 12 significant HA/DR operations in the past five years alone, including the 2004 tsunami and the disastrous tropical cyclones in 2007 in Bangladesh and 2008 in Burma in which units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa either directly led or significantly contributed to response efforts.</strong><br />
<strong>The implied argument in the op-ed--that the forfeiting of MCAS Futenma and removal of all Marines from Okinawa would &quot;preserve local support for Kadena&quot;--is misplaced. Regrettably, the fact is anti-base, anti-alliance activists will only pocket concessions and continue to press for the next one. Following the closure of MCAS Futenma without a replacement, as recommended by Mr. O'Hanlon, the activists will likely turn their attention next to closing Kadena Air Base, which would further degrade alliance capabilities.</strong><br />
<strong>Fortunately, there has been a realization that the United States and Japan need to do more at the political level to help ensure the smooth implementation of the bilateral security treaty as well as to educate our respective publics more on the importance of the alliance.</strong><br />
<strong>Equally important is that Japan's SDF be allowed to play a larger operational role in the alliance and in the region. The proposal by Mr. O'Hanlon for Japan to send &quot;substantial numbers of peacekeeping troops to Sudan and the Congo&quot; is also good, but has no bearing on the strategic situation in Northeast Asia or even the Asia-Pacific. Having only recently adopted a &quot;joint&quot; approach to operations, the SDF is trying to operate more closely with the military forces of its only ally to develop these capabilities. Working with the U.S. and increasingly with the militaries of other countries, the SDF is gaining experience and confidence. While it was given a mandate to participate in more international HA/DR operations abroad, the SDF is faced with a declining budget and decreasing personnel numbers. In the interim, the U.S. Marines, being the only truly rapidly deployable ground troops in Northeast Asia, will continue to be the first responders--the 911 force--to any crisis and continue to represent, along with the Navy, Air Force, and Army service components of U.S. Forces Japan and U.S. Pacific Command, the American commitment to the region. The Marines' capabilities, experience, and proven record of success are hard to replicate, something the SDF, particularly the Ground Self-Defense Forces, look to as they further develop their capabilities and jointness.</strong><br />
<strong>At the end of his opinion piece, the author refers to the late Ambassador Mike Mansfield's description of the U.S.-Japan alliance as being the most important, bar none. We entirely agree. But we would also remind him that out of all of Mr. Mansfield's accomplishments including educator, senator, majority leader, and ambassador, he was most proud of his service as a United States Marine and had written on his tombstone in Arlington National Cemetery after his death in October 2001 the following simple epitaph: &quot;Michael Joseph Mansfield, Pvt. U.S. Marine Corps.&quot;</strong><br />

<strong>We won’t get kicked out—history, politics, and diplomacy prove—reject their evidence as ungrounded media</strong><br />
<strong>Calder 10—Director, Reischauer Center for East Asian Studies, Johns Hopkins University (Kent, “The Politics of the Futenma Base Issue in Okinawa: Relocation Negotiations in 1995-97, 2005-06,” May 17, 2010, www.sais-jhu.edu/centers/reischauer/The%2520Politics%2520of%2520the%2520Futenma%2520Base%2520Issue%25, CJin)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In recent months there has been a blizzard of journalistic commentary on Futenma—hundreds of op ed pieces and television specials on the issue, replete with short-term forecasts on how it may affect the incumbent Japanese administration or the U.S.-Japan alliance. Yet there has been remarkably little serious research—and no at-length historical studies covering the evolution of the controversy from its origins—on just how we got to where we are today. This analytical gap is not only unfortunate from a scholarly standpoint; it also blinds us to important political dynamics, and policy options, that have been relevant in the past, and may well shape the future.</strong><br />
<strong>We could not ask for a more appropriate analytical viewpoint on such a hybrid policy-research question than that of Bill Brooks, a valued colleague here at SAIS, wit njkh a Columbia Ph.D., with whom I worked closely at US Embassy Tokyo a decade ago. Bill served for fifteen years, until 2009, as head of the Office of Translation and Media Analysis at the Embassy, monitoring and analyzing political-economic developments in Japan, and Japanese reactions to them, for U.S. government officials in both Tokyo and Washington. His research and advice were always well respected, and his appreciation of subtle developments within Japan, as an American fully fluent in Japanese language and culture, were unequalled. Now, for the first time, we get his public view of fateful events that Dr. Brooks witnessed directly and at close hand as a public servant, although the analysis itself draws only—Bill is careful to add—on openly available sources. It is for the reader to decide how he or she views this unique analysis, on an issue fraught with public controversy. It needs to be read completely, and a brief summary cannot do it justice. That said, there are recurring themes it is useful to stress from the outset:</strong><br />
<strong>(1) The Lessons of History. The Futenma controversy has been boiling on for over fifteen years, but the basic options—relocation to the vicinity of Henoko; choices among mobile basing, reclamation, land-based options inside Camp Schwab, and the so-called QIP method—remain remarkably constant. So do many of the political responses to each of the options.</strong><br />
<strong>(2) The Centrality of Politics. Time and again, political decisions—at the national level and at the prefectural and local levels within Okinawa— have complicated resolution of what seemed originally to be a promising, simple, and creative resolution to the pressing imperative of closing an aging military facility in a crowded urban area, and moving it to a less threatening environment. Interested parties transformed the initial, relatively simple option of a heliport at Henoko, inside Camp Schwab, into a variety of complex permutations. New administrations felt the need to impose their own resolutions, even when doing so opened Pandora’s boxes. And within Okinawa itself, the preferred option again and again was simply indecision—keeping base issues in play, so as to extract maximum benefit from all parties, without the downside of implementing something distasteful.</strong><br />
<strong>(3) The “Mission Creep” Dynamic. The original proposal for Futenma relocation was relatively simple—a land-based heliport inside Camp Schwab. For a variety of reasons, on both the American and the Japanese sides, the plans that ultimately emerged were, time and time again, much more elaborate. Technological change, and the related introduction of new operating equipment and logistical requirements, was one reason; political and economic pressures had their impact also.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>History proves their evidence is just brinksmanship rhetoric</strong><br />
<strong>Brooks 10—adjunct professor for Japan Studies AT Johns Hopkins, has 15 years of experience as head at the Embassy Tokyo’s Office of Media Analysis, Ph.D. from Columbia in East Asian Studies (William L., “The Politics of the Futenma Base Issue in Okinawa: Relocation Negotiations in 1995-97, 2005-06,” May 17, 2010, www.sais-jhu.edu/centers/reischauer/The%2520Politics%2520of%2520the%2520Futenma%2520Base%2520Issue%25, CJin)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>It is also evident from researching the Japanese press that politics played a dominant role, sometimes for the better but more often for the worse, during the various negotiations. But the political strategies and even artifices that can be seen playing out at the central and local government levels in the two earlier sets of negotiations seem oddly missing from the efforts of the current political administration since last fall. Earlier sets of talks practiced a kind of brinksmanship and sometimes threatened to reach crisis proportions. But in the end, both sides always pulled away from the brink to reach a compromise that eased tensions and ultimately resolved the issue, often with the intervention of strong leaders, seeking to balance alliance and Okinawa interests as best as possible. The U.S. in the past was always closely involved – these were bilateral negotiations -- unlike the current unilateral process done in isolation by a small group of coalition leaders each with pet proposals, none of which had even been vetted with others, not to mention the U.S. and affected local leaders and communities. The outcome from such an unstructured and haphazard process to most observers seemed doomed to failure from the start.</strong><br />

<strong>Public opposition will never kick the US military presence out</strong><br />
<strong>Yeo 10 (Andrew, “Anti-Base Movements in South Korea: Comparative Perspective on the Asia-Pacific”, 14 June 2010, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4814:http://www.japanfocus.org/-Andrew-Yeo/3373 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.japanfocus.org/-Andrew-Yeo/3373" rel="nofollow">http://www.japanfocus.org/-Andrew-Yeo/3373</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4814 -->, ZBurdette)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Although anti-base movements may successfully mobilize, as witnessed in Maehyangri and Pyeongtaek, they may not be equally successful in shaping policy outcomes. More often than not, activists face significant structural constraints. In all anti-base movements, whether in Okinawa, South Korea, Guam or the Philippines, activists face great challenges when confronting U.S. base issues because political elites tend to prioritize robust alliance relations with the U.S. Whether a progressive or conservative-leaning government, regardless of who comes to power, political leaders in Tokyo and Seoul generally accept in principle the necessity for U.S. forces to provide regional stability in the mid- to long-term. A pro-U.S. consensus among political leaders and bureaucracies, particularly within the defense and foreign policy establishments, drowns out activist calls for an alternative security framework centered on a reduction of U.S. forces. This ideological constraint makes it difficult for anti-base movements to shift public discussion on U.S. base issues. Moreover, host governments constantly receive a mixture of political pressure and economic incentives to support U.S. alliance obligations. While some government elites are genuinely sympathetic to the plight of local residents, in most cases political and economic forces prevent these actors from executing policy changes that would significantly eliminate or ameliorate the negative effects of U.S. military presence.</strong><br />

<strong>No impact to public outcry—they can’t force change</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The DPJ has had limited success in its battle against recession; the unemployment rate is still disturbingly high, but exports have slowly picked up. Getting rid of the American base in Okinawa has turned out to be a different story. Japan is, if no longer the second, at least the third largest industrial economy in the world; it is a valued member of the elite G-8 group of nations, its clout in both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund is much greater than that of China or India, it has never strayed in international discourse away from toeing the American line. And yet, on the demand for removing the US naval base in Okinawa, neither its economic prowess nor its formal political sovereignty has been of any avail. At the height of the anti-draft agitation in the 1960s, American youth, reluctant to go to Vietnam, would rent the sky with the full-throated chant, &quot;Hell, no,/ We won't go.&quot; The US response to the notice served on them by the new Japanese administration to quit Okinawa has been identical: no, the United States will not oblige; Okinawa may be Japanese territory, Japan may be a fully independent and an economically powerful nation, the Americans could not care less; never mind the electoral verdict of the Japanese people, Okinawa will remain an American naval base, maybe for eternity, just like the one at Guantanamo in communist Cuba.</strong><br />

<strong>At another level, though, Japanese voters and bureaucrats have clearly indicated their preference for a continued close alliance relationship with the United States. The fact that the latest annual poll conducted by Japan’s Cabinet Office in December 2009 found the highest level of friendly feelings toward the United States (78.9%) since the polling began in the mid-1970s and that 81.8% of respondents held a favorable view of U.S.-Japan relations should encourage leaders of both states. Voters have criticized the DPJ for undermining U.S.-Japan relations, criticism the DPJ must effectively address to remain in power. The latest Diplomatic Bluebook issued by Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in April 2010 also underscores the importance of the alliance to Japan’s overall foreign policy.</strong><br />

<strong>Alliance is strong now—all politics isn’t local and 80% of the Japanese public know the alliance is really important.</strong><br />

<strong>The sinking of the South Korean naval vessel, Cheonan, by North Korea served as a dramatic reminder that Northeast Asia is still “a dangerous neighborhood.” The Japanese Cabinet noticed. The Japanese government also experienced some difficulties in its relationship with China, in which it had invested a considerable amount. The DPJ has come to understand with increasing clarity that others in the region have been watching closely the U.S.-Japan alliance, and Japan could not afford the impression of a rift to “gain traction.” It turns out that all politics is not 100 percent local, as it had been seen in Japan for some months before then. The decision came against a series of other policy decisions by the Japanese government that demonstrate that the alliance is about more than basing issues. Japan has allocated $900 million in its current budget towards a multi-year, $5 billion, pledge to the Afghan Army and police, including for rehabilitation and training of demobilized Taliban and important development projects. Japan, like the United States, believes that peace and security in Afghanistan depend significantly on stability in Pakistan, and Tokyo has pledged $1 billion in assistance to Pakistan and hosted a major pledging conference. Japan has strongly backed the Republic of Korea, in the face of aggression from the North, in the wake of the Cheonan incident. Its solidarity with South Korea has been firm and public. Japan has sought trilateral cooperation with the U.S. and South Korea, and taken a leading role in fashioning a UN Security Council response. As a member of the UN Security Council, this year, Japan is supporting the U.S.–led draft of a resolution on Iran. Prime Minister Kan – Prime Minister to be Kan – indeed reiterated that support in his first conversation with President Obama, this past week. Japan’s leadership has made clear recently that it favors U.S. participation in an eventual East Asian Community, a change taken from the DPJ position last fall. Japan strongly supported President Obama’s initiatives in the April Nuclear Security Summit and worked closely with the U.S. delegation at the NPT Review Conference in May. So, nine months after the DPJ’s electoral victory, the scorecard, from the U.S. perspective, at last, is positive and improving. There has been lots of attention to what a rough ride it has been, to the precipitous decline in Hatoyama’s polling numbers and, ultimately, his demise, his political demise, to the difficulties of the DPJ government in “getting its feet under it.” And now the – as I said – the resignation. I’ll leave to experts on Japan the analysis of these, but from the viewpoint of the U.S., the larger issue, in conclusion, is this: That Japan has gone through the single most dramatic political change in 50 years – after 50 years of stasis in party rule, and the U.S.-Japan alliance has emerged in sound condition, having been scrutinized and ultimately validated by the new political leadership. This is, in one sense, not surprising, since 80 percent of all Japanese, in polling, support the alliance. That is the indispensible foundation for the alliance.</strong><br />

<strong>Despite its shortcomings, the alliance is critical to fulfilling current U.S. strategic objectives, including maintaining peace in the region. The forward deployment of a large U.S. military force in Japan deters military aggression by North Korea, signals Washington's resolve in defending U.S. allies, and provides an irreplaceable staging area should military action be necessary. Japan hosts the largest contingent of U.S. forces in Asia, including the only aircraft carrier home-ported outside the United States and one of three Marine Expeditionary Forces, as well as paying for a major portion of the cost of stationing U.S. forces there. Japan is America's principal missile defense partner in the world.</strong><br />

<strong>Fearing the undermining of the alliance, the five-year administration of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and his LDP successors began a steady incremental remilitarization in order to respond to American impatience and the changed international situation. Each incremental step, however, was weighed carefully so as to preserve as much autonomy as possible while still doing just enough to propitiate American impatience. By the time of last summer’s election, all of what I have called the “eight no’s” had been steadily modified: the SDF were dispatched to aid in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts; the principle of collective self-defense was about to be acknowledged; the taboo on discussion of nuclear weapons ended; power projection ability was quietly acquired through Boeing refueling tankers and proto aircraft carriers; cooperation in ballistic missile defense with the United States began in earnest, which breached the principles of not exporting military technology; spy satellites were put up; and a new law provided for a national security strategy relating to space and the development of rockets and satellites for information gathering communications. The LDP administrations in short began to remilitarize and to become a stronger and more engaged ally, and in this way carved out a new activist foreign policy. The question remained, however, could these measures restore the independence and autonomy that Japan has aspired to?</strong><br />

<strong>Kan faces a moribund economy and a snowballing government debt. His immediate task would be fiscal reconstruction and plug holes that have led to debts increasing endlessly, amounting to some 180 per cent of the gross domestic product. Hiking the consumption tax is one option but can prove risky. Even the popular Koizumi was tempted for a while but refrained from this step due to fear of a public backlash. Kan is likely to unveil in late June a national economic growth strategy and fiscal discipline aimed at stimulating demand. As the deputy prime minister, Kan had declared in November 2009 that Japan was in a state of deflation for which liquidity crunch was the main reason since Japanese people and companies have a great propensity to save money instead of purchasing and investing. Being an advocate of a weaker yen, he has pressured the Bank of Japan to adopt more aggressive monetary policies so that the pressure on the business community is eased somewhat.</strong><br />
<strong>Though foreign affairs are important, getting the economy back on track would be Kan’s top most priority. With an image of a fiscal conservative, he is in favour of raising Japan’s 5 per cent sales tax. Economists say that this is vital to raise funds needed for meeting the huge social welfare costs of a greying society. In particular, if Kan pursues his fiscal policies aimed at keeping the yen weak, one can expect buoyancy in the stock market in the coming months. A weaker currency will help the Nikkei to inch closer to the 10,000-mark. If Kan can make that happen, one can expect the Japanese economy to rebound slowly.</strong><br />

<strong>The original Neo-Malthusian premise was that population would grow exponentially. Indeed until the latter decades of the 20th century, these concerns seemed well founded, as technological change increased the rate of population growth by reducing mortality rates. However, the rate of population increase has slowed in recent decades. In the five years from 1965 to 1970, the World’s population grew by 10.6 per cent. By contrast, the current rate of population growth has fallen to 6.0 per cent every five years and is expected to fall further (UNPD 2007). Accordingly, recent population projections show that population should peak during this century, perhaps at less than 9 billion. Lutz et al. (2007) claim that there is a 90 percent probability that global population will not exceed 11.5 billion in 2100. Nevertheless, while most experts currently discount the possibility of exponential population increase, the notion lingers on in the popular mind (see, e.g., Revkin 2008). This tends to color discussions on environmental matters. In any case, Neo-Malthusians insist that even current population levels may be catastrophic for humanity, with some suggesting that the earth’s sustainable limit may be anywhere between 0.5 to 2 billion (Dahl 2005). The onset of the decline in growth rate was more or less concurrent with mortality rate declines in general, and preceded the appearance of AIDS. The proximate cause is obviously a decline in total fertility rate (TFR), that is, the number of children borne by a woman, which seems to have occurred worldwide, but to a differing extent in each country and culture. What are the underlying causes of the decline in TFR?</strong><br />

<strong>The intuitive inference that population increases should result in an intensifying resource scarcity (and perhaps to attendant social stresses or political conflicts) seems only natural and reasonable on its face. A review of the empirical record, however, should prompt us to reexamine and qualify our expectations. Over the course of the twentieth century, there has been a tremendous surge in the demand for all manner of goods and services, including natural resources. The increase in demand has been driven not only by the tremendous increase in population, but also by widespread and notable increases in per capita incomes. Maddison, for example, estimates that global GDP was over 14 times higher in 1992 than it had been in 1900.[24] Despite this explosion of demand, however, real prices for natural resources have not moved appreciably upwards. Just the opposite: long-term prices for primary commodities--foodstuffs, agricultural goods, timber, minerals, energy products, and the like--have fallen sharply and unmistakably. According to one careful study, the inflation-adjusted price of primary commodities (energy products included in the mix) fell by over a third between 1900 and the early 1980s. The long-term rate of decline in real prices for these natural resources, according to these estimates, was proceeding at about 0.4 percent per year.[25] In the 1990s, real prices of primary commodities have continued on this secular downward trend.</strong><br />

<strong>4. Population growth is not the driving force behind environmental degradation. Blaming environmental degradation on overpopulation lets the real culprits off the hook. In terms of resource consumption alone, the richest fifth of the world’s people consume 66 times as much as the poorest fifth. The U.S. is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases responsible for global warming—and the least willing to do anything about it. And just who is destroying the rain forest? While poor peasants sometimes play a role, corporate ranching, mining and logging operations are chiefly responsible for tropical deforestation. Worldwide militaries are major agents of environmental destruction. War ravages natural landscapes and military toxics pollute land, air and water. Nuclear weapons, reactors and waste pose the most deadly environmental threat to the planet. Imagine what a different world it would be if all the resources invested in producing deadly armaments went instead to environmental restoration and the development of cleaner, greener energy sources and technologies. Focusing on population also blinds us to the positive role many poor people play in protecting the environment. In many parts of the world, small farmers, especially women, are the main preservers of plant biodiversity through cultivating local crop varieties, preserving seeds, and forest stewardship. Recent research in Africa reveals that increasing population densities, if combined with sound agricultural practices, can actually stimulate environmental improvements.</strong><br />

<strong>Analysts praised Kan for restoring normality to foreign policy, as opposed to the unconventional Hatoyama, whose moves were almost impossible to predict, they said.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;Usually, you can't pull off magic tricks in diplomacy,&quot; Tanaka said. &quot;Rather than trying out unconventional methods, it is better to use diplomats and implement normal diplomacy.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>With the DPJ's foreign policy back on track, Tanaka pointed out that the party now needs to devise a comprehensive global strategy to tackle various key issues, including climate change, official development assistance, the participation of the Self-Defense Forces in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and Japan's possible participation in a U.S.-backed trans-Pacific free-trade agreement.</strong><br />

<strong>While analysts gave Kan low marks for his handling of last year's diplomatic tensions, they expressed hope that this year he will be able to lay the foundations of his government's foreign policy and set strategic long-term goals.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;It is hard to say that the Kan Cabinet has been effectively laying down long-term strategic foreign policies based on Japan's national interests,&quot; said Akihiko Tanaka, professor of international politics at the University of Tokyo. &quot;But as Kan himself said, he has been operating on a learner's permit and what is important is what the prime minister intends to do now, with a full license.&quot;</strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">As the physical security of TNWs is one main concern of those trying to put these weapons on the arms control and disarmament agenda, measures to address this subject directly may appear attractive to some. While it appears obvious that NWSs themselves share a keen interest in keeping their weapons as secure as possible, a consensus on common standards may provide welcome and useful reassurance. The following proposal uses the model of both the &quot;Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials&quot; and the guidelines on the same subject issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which establish standards for good practice, without compromising national security considerations by requiring intrusive verification measures. Countries, would of course, be free to establish practices stricter than those contained in the agreement. Such an agreement may establish the obligation to equip all TNWs with electronic locks—permissive action links—that prevent unauthorized use and to withdraw weapons from stockpiles and dismantle them if they do not have these features and if it is impossible, too expensive or undesirable to change their design accordingly. A second obligation would be to keep only weapons with safe designs that are not prone to explode or fizzle as a consequence of accident. TNWs, thus, should contain insensitive chemical explosives and should be one-point safe. Thirdly, TNWs should be stored in secure storage sites, in locked vaults that cannot be easily penetrated. Fourthly, storage sites should be protected by armed guards, the reliability of which should be checked regularly. Countries should make it a crime, subject to strict penalties, to interfere or to plan to interfere with nuclear weapons. Similar strict rules must guide the transport of these devices, and their handling at the entry or exit of production facilities. The agreement would provide for regular reports by the parties on actions taken to implement their treaty obligations. Reports should be specific enough for the partners to assess implementation, yet general enough to protect the security of the reporting State.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Meanwhile, the United States' own nuclear weapons complex, considered the most technologically advanced in the world, is showing security cracks. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently forced the resignations of the top Air Force leadership over their lax stewardship of the U.S. nuclear stockpile.Lapses included inadvertently flying nuclear missiles across the country on a B-52 bomber and mistakenly shipping nuclear fuses to Taiwan. A follow-up Air Force investigation concluded that hundreds of sensitive nuclear missile components are unaccounted for and may be missing. Furthermore, &quot;most sites&quot; that house deployed U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe--many of them relatively transportable &quot;tactical&quot; weapons--fail to meet the Pentagon's security requirements. A report from the Air Force Blue Ribbon Review of Nuclear Weapons Policies and Procedures, which the Federation of American Scientists obtained and made public through a Freedom of Information Act request, catalogs inadequate security systems and poorly trained military and private security personnel at nuclear weapons sites in Europe. &quot;Without an alert commitment for 17 years,&quot; the report concluded, referring to a nuclear alert by the U.S. Air Force, &quot;the bomber force has seen a dramatic atrophy of its nuclear operational and academic skills set.&quot; Taken together, the developments have convinced many close observers that the nonproliferation regime of arms control treaties, multilateral and bilateral agreements, threat reduction programs, counter-proliferation and interdiction operations, and sanctions--constructed over a half-century to contain the nuclear menace--may be nearing a potentially devastating collapse. </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">With growing concerns about the threat of nuclear terrorism after September 11, 2001, officials in the United States and NATO have pointed to a lingering problem regarding Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal (a class of weapons similar to the type of U.S. nuclear weapons deployed on the soil of several NATO member states in Europe). TNW's are potentially vulnerable to terrorists or nations who might try to buy or steal them. These weapons are smaller and more portable than strategic nuclear weapons and could be used without the authority of centralized command and control oversight mechanisms. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Despite several decades of nuclear arms control initiatives, non-strategic, or TNWs, are not covered by any formal treaties. The U.S. and Russian Presidential nuclear initiatives of the early 1990's called for voluntary controls on the vast stocks of these weapons. While significant reductions resulted from the Presidential initiatives, they were informal and lacked a codified agreement setting out verification and legal obligations. </span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In order for Turkey to play a leadership role in addressing the Iranian nuclear dilemma, it must learn from its past mistakes. The Turkish-Brazilian deal achieved with Ankara to swap Iranian nuclear fuel was successful, but insufficient. On the one hand, it suffered from Turkey's miscommunication with the United States, and on the other hand the fact that it did not meet the full criteria that the U.S. and the international community had sought. In particular, Iran has continued to evade unimpeded inspections by the IAEA and, despite the Iran-Turkey-Brazil arrangement, Tehran has yet to disclose all of its nuclear plant locations. In addition, instead of ending enrichment of uranium in accordance with UN resolution 1929, Iran has pledged to continue enriching uranium beyond 20 percent, bringing it closer to weapons grade. Moreover, as confirmed by a recent report of the IAEA, Iran still refuses to comply with the demands of international inspectors to disclose the design plans of its nuclear plans and continues with its increasingly aggressive program to enrich uranium, which is unacceptable to the international community. Any future efforts by Turkey must be predicated on Ankara gaining the trust of the United States and significantly strengthening its coordination and cooperation with the global community. In this regard, the recent comment by Glyn Davies, United States Ambassador to the IAEA, suggesting that Turkey, and potentially Brazil as well, could play a meaningful role in the negotiations with Iran going forward, is a positive sign that the United States recognizes the importance of involving Turkey. However, for Turkey to ultimately succeed, it must learn to walk the moral high ground by setting a new tone to its regional leadership. The kind of heated rhetoric displayed by Prime Minister Erdogan in the wake of the flotilla incident, as well as following the United Nations Security Council resolution, harms Turkey's ability to reach its potential as an honest broker, not to speak of a regional and global leader. For example, Erdogan's comment during a breakfast meeting in Paris last April, that Israel was &quot;the principle threat to peace&quot; in the Middle East certainly did not serve to advance the cause of peace and security in the region. Turkey should avoid such rhetoric and instead gain moral authority by displaying political integrity and pragmatic leadership. It should start to do so by more publicly recognizing its own concerns regarding Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons. As Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said this past spring, &quot;We don't want Iran to have nuclear weapons, and we don't want any military tension in our region.&quot; This is a message that should be increasingly communicated to Iran, the United States and Israel. Turkey should also not dismiss Israel's genuine security concerns when it comes to Iran's nuclear ambitions. Even more, in the spirit of searching for a realistic solution, Turkey should de-link the Iranian nuclear program from Israel's nuclear posture. Focusing on the question of Israel's nuclear capability will have the opposite effect of what Ankara would like to achieve. Israel will not relinquish its nuclear posture without a sustainable and comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace agreement in place that will include some of the leading Islamic states, especially Iran. Instead, Turkey should proactively call for both a stop to Iran's nuclear efforts and a comprehensive regional peace, which together would provide the foundation necessary for a Middle East free of nuclear weapons. By promoting regional peace and security in this way, Turkey could also begin to heal the current tensions with Israel, and provide Israelis with confidence in Turkey's diplomatic leadership vis-à-vis Iran. Finally, in coordinating its efforts with the United States and the international community, Turkey should be willing to convey to Iran the potential consequences of its continued defiance of the international community, including the likelihood of additional crippling sanctions by nations across the globe. </span></strong><br />

<strong>But there is a deeper, more homegrown challenge to American leadership. Some Americans no longer believe that America has the moral stature to be a world leader. Their doubts about traditional American values lead them to be skeptical about the assertion of American power abroad. In other words, they have doubts about us as a nation, mak­ing them reluctant to support an assertive foreign policy abroad. They fall back into a mindset like that of our European friends; they want to constrain and tame American power--to make us atone for our alleged sins and to create a nation not unlike what you may find in the European Union.</strong><br />

Discourse at the high school academic level uniquely key—leftist critique paralyses the US and appeases terrorists <br />

<strong>Rather than springing from realpolitik, sloth, or fear of oil cutoffs, much of our appeasement of Middle Eastern terrorists derived from a new sort of anti-Americanism that thrived in the growing therapeutic society of the 1980s and 1990s. Though the abrupt collapse of communism was a dilemma for the Left, it opened as many doors as it shut. To be sure, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, few Marxists could argue for a state-controlled economy or mouth the old romance about a workers’ paradise—not with scenes of East German families crammed into smoking clunkers lumbering over potholed roads, like American pioneers of old on their way west. But if the creed of the socialist republics was impossible to take seriously in either economic or political terms, such a collapse of doctrinaire statism did not discredit the gospel of forced egalitarianism and resentment against prosperous capitalists. Far from it. If Marx receded from economics departments, his spirit reemerged among our intelligentsia in the novel guises of post-structuralism, new historicism, multiculturalism, and all the other dogmas whose fundamental tenet was that white male capitalists had systematically oppressed women, minorities, and Third World people in countless insidious ways. The font of that collective oppression, both at home and abroad, was the rich, corporate, Republican, and white United States. The fall of the Soviet Union enhanced these newer post-colonial and liberation fields of study by immunizing their promulgators from charges of fellow-traveling or being dupes of Russian expansionism. Communism’s demise likewise freed these trendy ideologies from having to offer some wooden, unworkable Marxist alternative to the West; thus they could happily remain entirely critical, sarcastic, and cynical without any obligation to suggest something better, as witness the nihilist signs at recent protest marches proclaiming: “I Love Iraq, Bomb Texas.” From writers like Arundhati Roy and Michel Foucault (who anointed Khomeini “a kind of mystic saint” who would usher in a new “political spirituality” that would “transfigure” the world) and from old standbys like Frantz Fanon and Jean-Paul Sartre (“to shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same time”), there filtered down a vague notion that the United States and the West in general were responsible for Third World misery in ways that transcended the dull old class struggle. Endemic racism and the legacy of colonialism, the oppressive multinational corporation and the humiliation and erosion of indigenous culture brought on by globalization and a smug, self-important cultural condescension—all this and more explained poverty and despair, whether in Damascus, Teheran, or Beirut. [continues] This nonjudgmentalism—essentially a form of nihilism—deemed everything from Sudanese female circumcision to honor killings on the West Bank merely “different” rather than odious. Anyone who has taught freshmen at a state university can sense the fuzzy thinking of our undergraduates: most come to us prepped in high schools not to make “value judgments” about “other” peoples who are often “victims” of American “oppression.” Thus, before female-hating psychopath Mohamed Atta piloted a jet into the World Trade Center, neither Western intellectuals nor their students would have taken him to task for what he said or condemned him as hypocritical for his parasitical existence on Western society. Instead, without logic but with plenty of romance, they would more likely have excused him as a victim of globalization or of the biases of American foreign policy. They would have deconstructed Atta’s promotion of anti-Semitic, misogynist, Western-hating thought, as well as his conspiracies with Third World criminals, as anything but a danger and a pathology to be remedied by deportation or incarceration.</strong><br />

<strong>Instead, we have the leisure to engage in utopian musing, assured that our economy, our unseen soldiers, or our system working on autopilot will always ensure us such prerogatives. And in the la-la land of Washington and New York, it is especially easy to forget that we are not even like our own soldiers in Iraq, now sleeping outside without toilets and air conditioners, eating dehydrated food, and trying to distinguish killers from innocents. What does all this mean? Western societies from ancient Athens to imperial Rome to the French republic rarely collapsed because of a shortage of resources or because foreign enemies proved too numerous or formidable in arms—even when those enemies were grim Macedonians or Germans. Rather, in times of peace and prosperity there arose an unreal view of the world beyond their borders, one that was the product of insularity brought about by success, and an intellectual arrogance that for some can be the unfortunate by-product of an enlightened society. I think we are indulging in this unreal hypercriticism—even apart from the election season antics of our politicians—because we are not being gassed or shot or even left hot or hungry. September 11 no longer evokes an image of incinerated firefighters, innocents leaping out of skyscrapers, or the stench of flesh and melted plastic but rather squabbles over architectural designs, lawsuits, snarling over John Ashcroft’s new statutes, or concerns about being too rude to the Arab street. Such smug dispensation—as profoundly amoral as it is—provides us, on the cheap and at a safe distance, with a sense of moral worth. Or perhaps censuring from the bleachers enables us to feel superior to those less fortunate who are still captive to their primordial appetites. We prefer to cringe at the thought that others like to see proof of their killers’ deaths, prefer to shoot rather than die capturing a mass murderer, and welcome a generic profile of those who wish to kill them en masse. We should take stock of this dangerous and growing mind-set—and remember that wealthy, sophisticated societies like our own are rarely overrun. They simply implode—whining and debating to the end, even as they pass away.</strong><br />

Nuke war<br />
Ferguson 4 <strong>– History Professor, Harvard (Niall, A World Without Power, Foreign Policy)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The reversal of globalization--which a new Dark Age would produce--would certainly lead to economic stagnation and even depression. As the United States sought to protect itself after a second September 11 devastates, say, Houston or Chicago, it would inevitably become a less open society, less hospitable for foreigners seeking to work, visit, or do business. Meanwhile, as Europe's Muslim enclaves grew, Islamist extremists' infiltration of the EU would become irreversible, increasing trans-Atlantic tensions over the Middle East to the breaking point. An economic meltdown in China would plunge the Communist system into crisis, unleashing the centrifugal forces that undermined previous Chinese empires. Western investors would lose out and conclude that lower returns at home are preferable to the risks of default abroad. The worst effects of the new Dark Age would be felt on the edges of the waning great powers. The wealthiest ports of the global economy--from New York to Rotterdam to Shanghai--would become the targets of plunderers and pirates. With ease, terrorists could disrupt the freedom of the seas, targeting oil tankers, aircraft carriers, and cruise liners, while Western nations frantically concentrated on making their airports secure. Meanwhile, limited nuclear wars could devastate numerous regions, beginning in the Korean peninsula and Kashmir, perhaps ending catastrophically in the Middle East. In Latin America, wretchedly poor citizens would seek solace in Evangelical Christianity imported by U.S. religious orders. In Africa, the great plagues of AIDS and malaria would continue their deadly work. The few remaining solvent airlines would simply suspend services to many cities in these continents; who would wish to leave their privately guarded safe havens to go there? For all these reasons, the prospect of an apolar world should frighten us today a great deal more than it frightened the heirs of Charlemagne. If the United States retreats from global hegemony--its fragile self-image dented by minor setbacks on the imperial frontier--its critics at home and abroad must not pretend that they are ushering in a new era of multipolar harmony, or even a return to the good old balance of power. Be careful what you wish for. The alternative to unipolarity would not be multipolarity at all. It would be apolarity--a global vacuum of power.</strong><br />

Wohlforth 8<strong>—Daniel Webster Professor of Government, Dartmouth. BA in IR, MA in IR and MPhil and PhD in pol sci, Yale (William, Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War, October 2008, World Politics Vol. 61, Iss. 1; pg. 28, 31 pgs, Proquest, AMiles)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="tab-stops: .25in;">Despite increasingly compelling findings concerning the importance of status seeking in human behavior, research on its connection to war waned some three decades ago.38 Yet empirical studies of the relationship between both systemic and dyadic capabilities distributions and war have continued to cumulate. If the relationships implied by the status theory run afoul of well-established patterns or general historical findings, then there is little reason to continue investigating them. The clearest empirical implication of the theory is that status competition is unlikely to cause great power military conflict in unipolar systems. If status competition is an important contributory cause of great power war, then, ceteris paribus, unipolar systems should be markedly less war-prone than bipolar or multipolar systems. And this appears to be the case. As Daniel Geller notes in a review of the empirical literature: &quot;The only polar structure that appears to influence conflict probability is unipolarity.&quot;39 In addition, a larger number of studies at the dyadic level support the related expectation that narrow capabilities gaps and ambiguous or unstable capabilities hierarchies increase the probability of war.40 These studies are based entirely on post-sixteenth-century European history, and most are limited to the post-1815 period covered by the standard data sets. Though the systems coded as unipolar, near-unipolar, and hegemonic are all marked by a high concentration of capabilities in a single state, these studies operationalize unipolarity in a variety of ways, often very differently from the definition adopted here. An ongoing collaborative project looking at ancient interstate systems over the course of two thousand years suggests that historical systems that come closest to the definition of unipolarity used here exhibit precisely the behavioral properties implied by the theory. 41 As David C. Kang's research shows, the East Asian system between 1300 and 1900 was an unusually stratified unipolar structure, with an economic and militarily dominant China interacting with a small number of geographically proximate, clearly weaker East Asian states.42 Status politics existed, but actors were channeled by elaborate cultural understandings and interstate practices into clearly recognized ranks. Warfare was exceedingly rare, and the major outbreaks occurred precisely when the theory would predict: when China's capabilities waned, reducing the clarity of the underlying material hierarchy and increasing status dissonance for lesser powers. Much more research is needed, but initial exploration of other arguably unipolar systems-for example, Rome, Assyria, the Amarna system-appears consistent with the hypothesis.43 Status Competition and Causal Mechanisms Both theory and evidence demonstrate convincingly that competition for status is a driver of human behavior, and social identity theory and related literatures suggest the conditions under which it might come to the fore in great power relations. Both the systemic and dyadic findings presented in large-N studies are broadly consistent with the theory, but they are also consistent with power transition and other rationalist theories of hegemonic war. </span></strong><br />

Vietnam was justified to defeat communism and we should do it again <br />
Webb 3 <strong>– former secretary of the Navy and the author of numerous books about Vietnam (James, September, Why We Fought &amp; Why We Would Do it Again, <span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jameswebb.com/articles/variouspubs/amlegionwhywefought.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jameswebb.com/articles/variouspubs/amlegionwhywefought.htm</a></span>, AG)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Atrocities? We made errors, although nowhere on the scale alleged by those who have a stake in disparaging our effort. Fighting a well-trained enemy who seeks cover in highly contested populated areas where civilians often assist the other side is the most difficult form of warfare. The most important distinction is that the deliberate killing of innocent civilians was a crime in the U.S. military. We held ourselves accountable for My Lai. And yet we are still waiting for the communists to take responsibility for the thousands of civilians deliberately killed by their political cadre as a matter of policy. A good place for them to start holding their own forces accountable would be Hue, where during the 1968 Tet Offensive more than 2,000 locals were systematically executed during the brief communist takeover of the city. [continues] On a national level, and in the eyes of history, the answer is easier. One can gain an appreciation for what we attempted to achieve in Vietnam by examining the aftermath of the communist victory in 1975. A gruesome holocaust took place in Cambodia, the likes of which had not been seen since World War II. Two million Vietnamese fled their country – mostly by boat. Thousands lost their lives in the process. This was the first such diaspora in Vietnam’s long and frequently tragic history. Inside Vietnam, a million of the south’s best young leaders were sent to re-education camps; more than 50,000 perished while imprisoned, and others remained captives for as long as 18 years. An apartheid system was put into place that punished those who had been loyal to the United States, as well as their families, in matters of education, employment and housing. The Soviet Union made Vietnam a client state until its own demise, pumping billions of dollars into the country and keeping extensive naval and air bases at Cam Ranh Bay. In fact, communist Vietnam did not truly start opening up to the outside world until the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Would I Do It Again? Others are welcome to disagree, but on this I have no doubt. Like almost every Marine I have ever met, my strongest regret is that perhaps I could have done more. But no other experience in my life has been more important than the challenge of leading Marines during those extraordinarily difficult times. Nor am I alone in this feeling. The most accurate poll of the attitudes of those who served in Vietnam – Harris, 1980 – showed that 91 percent were glad they’d served their country, and 74 percent enjoyed their time in the service. Additionally, 89 percent agreed that “our troops were asked to fight in a war which our political leaders in Washington would not let them win.” On that final question, history will surely be kinder to those who fought than to those who directed – or opposed – the war.</strong><br />

Bombing Hiroshima saved millions of lives<br />
Donnelly 5 <strong>– AEI fellow in national security (Thomas, Bearing the Burden, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 61.4, proquest, AG)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In Goodbye Darkness, his memoir of World War II in the Pacific, historian William Manchester wrote, &quot;After [the campaign on the Indonesian island of] Biak, the enemy withdrew into deep caverns. Rooting them out became a bloody business which reached its ultimate horrors in the last months of the war. You think of the lives which would have been lost in an invasion of Japan's Home Islands— a staggering number of Americans but millions more of Japanese—and you thank God for the atomic bomb.&quot; To writer and literary critic Paul Fussell, an infantry lieutenant who fought in Germany before being shipped to the Pacific, Manchester's blunt words so obviously and perfectly captured the grunt's-eye view that he took them as the title for his greatest collection of essays. Alas, this rather simple but profound understanding of Harry S. Truman's &quot;decision&quot; to use atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki—which wasn't really that agonizing for the president—has been lost with time. We Americans have also convinced ourselves, as our power and military prowess have grown to the almost absurd point where we talk about &quot;precision warfare,&quot; that war can never again become so desperate or defeat so vivid that we might again consider the nuclear option. War is not meant to be murder, but it does mean killing, and victory requires killing enough of the enemy to make them stop trying to kill us. In 1945, how much killing would be required remained very much an open question, even after the Nazis surrendered. Japanese propaganda called for &quot;One Hundred Million Souls for the Emperor,&quot; and there is no debate that an invasion of the Home Islands would have been a ghastly and bloody affair; nor was victory preordained. Indeed, it's hard not to find more than a little moral vanity in our second-guessing of President Truman from the safe distance of several decades. &quot;Having found the bomb,&quot; the president said with typical plainness, &quot;we have used it. We have used it to shorten the agony of young Americans.&quot; No commander-in-chief could have acted otherwise. In the Pacific, E. B. Sledge recorded the reaction of his fellow marines to the news of the bombing; that the war might end was beard &quot;with quiet disbelief coupled with an indescribable sense of relief. We thought the Japanese would never surrender. . . . Sitting in stunned silence, we remembered our dead. So many dead. So many maimed. So many bright futures consigned to the ashes of the past. So many dreams lost in the madness that bad engulfed us. Except for a few widely scattered shouts of joy, the survivors of the abyss sat hollow-eyed and silent, trying to comprehend a world without war.&quot; The use of atomic weapons did not bring a world without war, but it did bring to an end the most lethal conflict in human history, during which two fascist regimes employed a variety of ingenious methods to systematically and barbarically destroy tens of millions of their fellow men. Thank God, again, for the atomic bomb--and for Harry Truman's willingness to bear the burden of using it. And if I had been in Truman's place? I hope I would have made the same decision to shorten the agony that was World War II in the Pacific. Having found the bomb, I would have used it.</strong><br />

Otherization and moral outrage at terrorism sustains great power coalitions <br />
Dibb 2 <strong>(Paul, head of the Strategic and Defense Studies Centre, The Future of International Coalitions, Washington Quarterly 25:2, lexis, AG)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="tab-stops: .25in;">The United States is leading a moral campaign. In World War II, the firm conviction that evil was being fought greatly simplified the Allied effort. n10 The image of a &quot;just war&quot; nourished the Allies' willingness to fight the war to the bitter end. The difference between the war against terrorism and World War II, of course, is that in World War II the Allied powers were all the victims of aggression, simplifying the task of constructing a wartime consensus. Until and unless terrorists attack other Western powers, maintaining the coalition in the longer term will be difficult. The sense of moral outrage, however, has certainly led to the view that this war is just. </span></strong><br />

Biggest risk of great power wars is collapse of a common enemy to sustain coalitions <br />

<br />
<strong>There may even be a hidden benefit in the concept of a &quot;war on terror.&quot; It is a profoundly dishonest concept, since it is actually directed mainly against Muslim groups that have grievances against the various great powers: Chechens against Russia, Muslim Uyghurs against China, Kashmiri Muslims and their Pakistani cousins against India, and practically everybody in the Arab world and Iran against the U.S. and Britain. The terrorists' methods are reprehensible, but their grievances are often real. The determination of the great powers to oppose not only their methods but their goals is also real. That gives them a common enemy and a shared strategy. The main risk at this point in history is that the great powers will drift back into some kind of alliance confrontation. Key resources are getting scarcer, the climate is changing, and the rise of China and India means that the pecking order of the great powers is due to change again in the relatively near future. Given those preconditions, any strategic analyst worth his salt could draw up a dozen different scenarios of disaster by lunchtime.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Evil exists. It is real, and it means to harm us. I believe this strongly, and not just because of my Catholic faith, although that's the root of it. When you work in the news business, you deal with the ugly side of life. Every day across your desk comes story after story about man's inhumanity to man, from mass murderers to child molesters to mothers who drown their children to husbands who murder their pregnant wives. These stories push the limits of our ability to imagine man's potential for depravity, and yet they are horrifically true. Still, isolated events like these pale beside the pure evil of September 11. How could anyone witness the horrors of that day, or the mass graves discovered in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein, and dismiss the idea of evil? And yet many people do -- most of them political liberals. Even when they can bring themselves to acknowledge the brutality of a venal tyrant such as Saddam Hussein, they qualify it. &quot;We are not denying that Saddam is a repressive dictator,&quot; they say, &quot;but we don't believe we should have attacked Iraq without giving him more time to comply with the U.N. resolutions.&quot; For the appeasement-minded liberals of our country, there's always a &quot;but.&quot; It's difficult for liberals to see such moral questions clearly, because most of them are moral relativists. They reject absolute standards of right and wrong. In their worldview, man is perfectible, human nature is on a linear path toward enlightenment, and the concept of sin is primitively biblical. In their view, society's unfairness compels people to break the law. To them people like Saddam and Osama bin Laden are not morally depraved murderers, but men driven to their bad acts by the injustices of Western society. The emphasis is always on giving bad actors -- domestic and foreign -- the benefit of the doubt, never on personal accountability. After all, if we can blame external circumstances or internal imbalance, then we can avoid the messy business of calling the evildoers to account. This kind of thinking s all too familiar from our courtrooms at home. The justice system today is crawling with &quot;experts&quot; eager to exonerate the most heinous criminals on the grounds that they're &quot;genetically predisposed&quot; to murder, rape, take drugs, or otherwise endanger the welfare of others; the media fills its airwaves with liberal advocates eager to sympathize with murderers on death row, instead of the families of the innocent victims. The trouble with tolerating evil, of course, is that while we're averting our eyes, the evil itself only grows and festers around the world. This has been true throughout history. Neville Chamberlain assured a wary England that an appeasement pact with Adolf Hitler would lead to &quot;peace in our time.&quot; Cold War liberal elitists ignored or downplayed the atrocities of communism, from the gulag of &quot;Uncle Joe&quot; Stalin to the killing fields of Cambodia. Bill Clinton stood idly by while Islamic terrorists attacked American targets throughout the 1990s, in a long prelude that should have alerted us to their burgeoning war on America. The primary evil we face today is terrorism. But we will never triumph over the terrorists until we realize that groups like al Qaeda are not working alone. Without the deep pockets of terrorist-friendly dictatorships like Saddam Hussein's Iraq to support them, the loose networks of Islamic terrorism would pose only a fraction of the danger to civilization they currently do. And those dictatorships, we must realize, are the same brutal regimes that have oppressed their own people for generations. As President Bush has declared, we can no longer wait around for terrorists to attack us. We must take the war to them, rooting them out of their swamps and destroying the despotic regimes that furnish their lifeblood.</strong><br />

<strong>Such piety is always ridiculous but never more ridiculous than today. Never in American history has fear been a more appropriate feeling. Never has addressing that fear been a more relevant issue in a political campaign. Shortly after Hiroshima, wrote physicist Richard Feynman in his memoirs, &quot;I would go along and I would see people building a bridge ... and I thought, they're crazy, they just don't understand, they don't understand. Why are they making new things? It's so useless.&quot; Useless because doomed. Futile because humanity had no future. That's what happens to a man who worked on the Manhattan Project and saw with his own eyes at Alamogordo intimations of the apocalypse. Feynman had firsthand knowledge of what man had wrought--and a first-class mind deeply skeptical of the ability of his own primitive species not to be undone by its own cleverness. Feynman was not alone. The late 1940s and '50s were so pervaded by a general fear of nuclear annihilation that the era was known as the Age of Anxiety. That anxiety dissipated over the decades as we convinced ourselves that deterrence (the threat of mutual annihilation) would assure our safety. Sept. 11 ripped away that illusion. Deterrence depends on rationality. But the new enemy is the embodiment of irrationality: nihilists with a cult of death, yearning for the apocalypse--armed, ready and appallingly able. The primordial fear that haunted us through the first days and weeks after 9/11 has dissipated. Not because the threat has disappeared but for the simple reason that in our ordinary lives we simply cannot sustain that level of anxiety. The threat is as real as it was on Sept. 12. It only feels distant because it is psychologically impossible to constantly face the truth and yet carry on day to day. But as it is the first duty of government to provide for the common defense, it is the first duty of any post-9/11 government to face that truth every day--and to raise it to national consciousness at least once every four years, when the nation chooses its leaders. Fearmongering? Yes. And very salutary. When you live in an age of terrorism with increasingly available weapons of mass destruction, it is the absence of fear that is utterly irrational.</strong><br />

<strong>Judging by a June 2003 Pew Global Attitudes survey, many people are likely to conclude the latter. The poll found that over 90 percent of Jordanian, Moroccan, Palestinian, and Turkish respondents and over 80 percent of Indonesian and Pakistani respondents felt that the United States &quot;didn't try very hard&quot; to avoid civilian casualties in Iraq. That view was shared outside the Muslim world by over 70 percent of the Brazilians, French, Russians, and South Koreans polled. And yet, despite some dark spots on its record, the U.S. military has done a better job of respecting noncombatant immunity in Iraq than is commonly believed. Over the past year, I have conducted dozens of interviews with commanders, judge advocates, and others who have served in Iraq; investigated operational &quot;lessons learned&quot; during a recent trip to Baghdad; observed the predeployment training of forces; and extensively reviewed unclassified Pentagon documents, official and unofficial histories, troops' memoirs and blogs, and human rights reports. I have found not only that U.S. compliance with noncombatant immunity in Iraq is relatively high by historical standards but also that it has been improving since the beginning of the war.</strong><br />

Realism is true and inevitable – trying to shift away by reducing military presence causes great power war<br />
Mearsheimer 1 <strong>[professor of political science at University of Chicago, <em>The Tragedy of Great Power Politics</em>, pg. 361]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The optimists' claim that security competition and war among the great powers has been burned out of the system is wrong. In fact, all of the major states around the globe still care deeply about the balance of power and are destined to compete for power among themselves for the foreseeable future. Consequently, realism will offer the most powerful explanations of international politics over the next century, and this will be true</strong> even if the debates among academic <strong>and policy</strong> elites are dominated by non-realist theories<strong>. In short, the real world remains a realist world. States still fear each other and seek to gain power at each other's expense, because international anarchy-the driving force behind greatpower behavior-did not change with the end of the Cold War, and there are few signs that such change is likely any time soon. States remain the principal actors in world politics and there is still no night watchman standing above them. For sure, the collapse of the Soviet Union caused a major shift in the global distribution of power. But it did not give rise to a change in the anarchic structure of the system, and without that kind of profound change, there is no reason to expect the great powers to behave much differently in the new century than they did in previous centuries. Indeed, considerable evidence from the 1990s indicates that power politics has not disappeared from Europe and Northeast Asia, the regions in which there are two or more great powers, as well as possible great powers such as Germany and Japan. There is no question, however, that the competition for power over the past decade has been low-key. Still, there is potential for intense security competion among the great powers that might lead to a major war. Probably the best evidence of that possibility is the fact that the United States maintains about one hundred thousand troops each in Europe and in Northeast Asia for the explicit purpose of keeping the major states in each region at peace.</strong><br />
<br />
Other states will inevitable act realist—trying to shift away collapses hegemony<br />
Mearsheimer 1 <strong>[professor of political science at University of Chicago, <em>The Tragedy of Great Power Politics</em>, pg. 2]</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><strong>There are no status quo powers in the international system, save for the occasional hegemon that wants to maintain its dominating position over potential rivals. Great powers are rarely content with the current distribution of power; on the contrary, they face a constant incentive to change it in their favor. They almost always have revisionist intentions, and they will use force to alter the balance of power if they think it can be done at a reasonable price. At times, the costs and risks of trying to shift the balance of power are too great, forcing great powers to wait for more favorable circumstances. But the desire for more power does not go away, unless a state achieves the ultimate goal of hegemony. Since no state is likely to achieve global hegemony, however,</strong></span><br />
the world is condemned to perpetual great-power competition<strong>. This unrelenting pursuit of power means that great powers are inclined to look for opportunities to alter the distribution of world power in their favor. They will seize their opportunities if they have the necessary capability. Simply put, great powers are primed for offense. But not only does a great power seek to gain power at the expense of other states, it also tries to thwart rivals bent on gaining power at its expense. Thus, a great power will defend the balance of power when looming change favors another state, and it will try to undermine the balance when the direction of change is in its own favor. Why do great powers behave this way? My answer is that the structure of the international system forces states which seek only to be secure nonetheless to act aggressively toward each other. Three features of the international system combine to cause states to fear one another: 1) the absence of a central authority that sits above states and can protect them from each other, 2) the fact that states always have some offensive military capability, and 3) the fact that states can never be certain about other states’ intentions. Given this fear—which can never be wholly eliminated—states recognize that the more powerful they are relative to their rivals, the better their chances of survival. Indeed, the best guarantee of survival is to be a hegemon, because no other state can seriously threaten such a mighty power. This situation, which no one consciously designed or intended, is genuinely tragic. Great powers that have no reason to fight each other—that are merely concerned with their own survival—nevertheless have little choice but to pursue power and to seek to dominate the other states in the system. This dilemma is captured in brutally frank comments that Prussian statesman Otto von Bismarck made during the early 1860s, when it appeared that Poland, which was not an independent state at the time, might regain its sovereignty. “Restoring the Kingdom of Poland in any shape or form is tantamount to creating an ally for any enemy that chooses to attack us,” he believed, and therefore he advocated that Prussia should “smash those Poles till, losing all hope, they lie down and die; I have every sympathy for their situation, but if we wish to survive we have no choice but to wipe them out.” Although it is depressing to realize that great powers might think and act this way,</strong> it behooves us to see the world as it is, not as we would like it to be<strong>. For example, one of the key foreign policy issues facing the United States is the question of how China will behave if its rapid economic growth continues and effectively turns China into a giant Hong Kong. Many Americans believe that if China is democratic and enmeshed in the global capitalist system, it will not act aggressively; instead it will be content with the status quo in Northeast Asia. According to this logic, the United States should engage China in order to promote the latter’s integration into the world economy, a policy that also seeks to encourage China’s transition to democracy. If engagement succeeds, the United States can work with a wealthy and democratic China to promote peace around the globe. Unfortunately, a policy of engagement is doomed to fail. If China becomes an economic powerhouse it will almost certainly translate its economic might into military might and make a run at dominating Northeast Asia. Whether China is democratic and deeply enmeshed in the global economy or autocratic and autarkic will have little effect on its behavior, because democracies care about security as much as non-democracies do, and hegemony is the best way for any state to guarantee its own survival. Of course, neither its neighbors nor the United States would stand idly by while China gained increasing increments of power. Instead, they would seek to contain China, probably by trying to form a balancing coalition. The result would be an intense security of great-power war hanging over them. In short, China and the United States are destined to be adversaries as China’s power grows.</strong><br />

Predator states<br />
Wendt 92 – <strong>Professor of Political Science, Ohio State (Alexander, Anarchy is what States Make of it, International Organization 46.2, p 407-8, AG)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The predator argument is straightforward and compelling. For whatever reasons-biology, domestic politics, or systemic victimization-some states may become predisposed toward aggression. The aggressive behavior of these predators or &quot;bad apples&quot; forces other states to engage in competitive power politics, to meet fire with fire, since failure to do so may degrade or destroy them.</strong> One predator will best a hundred pacifists <strong>because anarchy provides no guarantees. This argument is powerful in part because it is so weak: rather than making the strong assumption that all states are inherently power-seeking (a purely reductionist theory of power politics), it assumes that just one is power-seeking and that the others have to follow suit because anarchy permits the one to exploit them.</strong><br />

<strong>Japan's coalition government appears to have decided yesterday to delay the fielding of additional Patriot Advanced Capability 3 air defense interceptors, Kyodo News reported (see GSN, Nov. 25). Government sources said that Tokyo would deploy additional systems no sooner than fiscal 2011, which begins in April of that year in Japan. The deployment program appears set for inclusion in a defense document to be published at the end of 2010. There has been some criticism in Japan's new left-of-center government over high costs and questions of effectiveness of the missile defense shield the country spent years constructing with support from the United States. The system is built on land-based PAC-3 interceptors and-ship based Standard Missile 3 systems and is intended to protect against a possible strike from North Korea.</strong><br />

<strong>Missile Defense and the US-Japan Alliance Development of missile defense cooperation has been critical to a process of “alliance transformation” that ranges from an updated concept of roles missions and capabilities for defense cooperation, to a realignment of the US force structure in Japan.8 BMD matters have had significant impact on key areas of alliance activity: • Policy: Moving from agreement on the need for missile defense to implementing BMD cooperation has brought policy planners on both sides into closer consultation on regional security strategy, arms control/non-proliferation policy, and an expanding scope of bilateral cooperation. The US government has been obliged to rethink its positions on alliance participation in US missile defense programs, as well as the release of sensitive defense technologies to key allies. Similarly, development of BMD activities will compel the Japanese government to reconsider long-standing positions on such policy-sensitive matters as Japan’s self-imposed ban on collective defense operations, and its inflexible approach to arms export controls (see below). • Operations: Cooperation between Japan and the US on BMD operations in Northeast Asia will require a level of coordination between US and Japanese defense forces that gives unprecedented meaning to the term ‘interoperability.’ Issues of concern here include timely sharing of critical intelligence data, development of an effective command, control, and communications (C3) infrastructure, and revision of outdated polices that obstruct joint response to imminent missile threats. • Acquisitions: The SCD project initiated last year is also unprecedented in being the first effort to jointly develop a defense system for use by both countries – and probably third country allies as well. While this effort may not seem remarkable to those familiar with multinational defense projects in NATO or the EU, implementing SCD has required substantial adjustments in interaction among program management bureaucracies and defense industries on both sides. Here too BMD cooperation has brought both sides beyond the limits of long-established practices and attitudes. Missile defense cooperation points to a critical influence on US-Japan alliance evolution often overlooked in discussion of political leaders or key administration officials – the growth of institutional interaction between the US and Japanese defense establishments. Both in operational activities and capability development, missile defense programs have encouraged interaction among a broad range of government and industry stakeholders with little experience in such engagement, or perceived need for it. This strengthening of institutional foundations for cooperative defense efforts could prove critical to managing further problems in BMD programs that arise from changes in plans and budgets.9 Recent progress in implementing missile defense cooperation is all the more impressive given differing perspectives and agendas that the US and Japan have brought to BMD activities. As noted above, initial US engagement of Japan on BMD matters made little progress given indecision over the nature and timing of US commitments. Uncertainty in direction and funding for BMD efforts – especially in the area of maritime missile defense – continued even after the launching of JCR projects with Japan.10 Another area of concern for US defense officials has been in determining the appropriate level of engagement in joint programs with Japan, or any other international partner. Is Japan to be little more than a component supplier for US developed and managed systems? Or should Japan be a partner with a substantial role in development (and perhaps production) of systems meeting US as well as Japanese requirements? Initially conservative US views on these questions have evolved over the past several years, partly through recognition of common requirements for maritime BMD and partly through appreciation of Japan’s commitment to alliance operations, including missile defense capability. For Japan, missile defense is critical to an emerging security posture that takes a more dynamic approach to the ‘sword and shield’ concept of defense cooperation with the US.11 For a number of years concerns over feasibility, cost, and political controversy caused the Japanese government to defer action on missile defense acquisition. However, well before a formal commitment to BMD, the Japanese defense community had already focused on its interests in missile defense programs with the US. In the face of continuing shifts in US positions on maritime BMD programs, Japan has consistently pressed for joint efforts focused on Aegis system and SM-3 upgrades.</strong><br />

<strong>Nuclear war</strong><br />

<strong>Asia, in the throes of historic change, should carry major weight in the calculus of American political, security, economic, and other interests. Accounting for 53 percent of the world’s population, 25 percent of the global economy, and nearly $600 billion annually in two-way trade with the United States, Asia is vital to American prosperity. Politically, from Japan and Australia, to the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Indonesia, countries across the region are demonstrating the universal appeal of democratic values. China is facing momentous social and economic changes, the consequences of which are not yet clear. Major war in Europe is inconceivable for at least a generation, but the prospects for conflict in Asia are far from remote. The region features some of the world’s largest and most modern armies, nuclear-armed major powers, and several nuclear-capable states. Hostilities that could directly involve the United States in a major conflict could occur at a moment’s notice on the Korean peninsula and in the Taiwan Strait. The Indian subcontinent is a major flashpoint. In each area, war has the potential of nuclear escalation. In addition, lingering turmoil in Indonesia, the world’s fourth-largest nation, threatens stability in Southeast Asia. The United States is tied to the region by a series of bilateral security alliances that remain the region’s de facto security architecture. In this promising but also potentially dangerous setting, the U.S.-Japan bilateral relationship is more important than ever. With the world’s second-largest economy and a well equipped and competent military, and as our democratic ally, Japan remains the keystone of the U.S. involvement in Asia. The U.S.-Japan alliance is central to America’s global security strategy. Japan, too, is experiencing an important transition. Driven in large part by the forces of globalization, Japan is in the midst of its greatest social and economic transformation since the end of World War II. Japanese society, economy, national identity, and international role are undergoing change that is potentially as fundamental as that Japan experienced during the Meiji Restoration. The effects of this transformation are yet to be fully understood. Just as Western countries dramatically underestimated the potential of the modern nation that emerged from the Meiji Restoration, many are ignoring a similar transition the effects of which, while not immediately apparent, could be no less profound. For the United States, the key to sustaining and enhancing the alliance in the 21st century lies in reshaping our bilateral relationship in a way that anticipates the consequences of changes now underway in Japan. Since the end of World War II, Japan has played a positive role in Asia. As a mature democracy with an educated and active electorate, Japan has demonstrated that changes in government can occur peacefully. Tokyo has helped to foster regional stability and build confidence through its proactive diplomacy and economic involvement throughout the region. Japan’s participation in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Cambodia in the early 1990s, its various defense exchanges and security dialogues, and its participation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum and the new “Plus Three” grouping are further testimony to Tokyo’s increasing activism. Most significantly, Japan’s alliance with the United States has served as the foundation for regional order. We have considered six key elements of the U.S.-Japan relationship and put forth a bipartisan action agenda aimed at creating an enduring alliance foundation for the 21st century. Post-Cold War Drift As partners in the broad Western alliance, the United States and Japan worked together to win the Cold War and helped to usher in a new era of democracy and economic opportunity in Asia. In the aftermath of our shared victory, however, the course of U.S.-Japan relations has wandered, losing its focus and coherence— notwithstanding the real threats and potential risks facing both partners. Once freed from the strategic constraints of containing the Soviet Union, both Washington and Tokyo ignored the real, practical, and pressing needs of the bilateral alliance. Well intentioned efforts to find substitutes for concrete collaboration and clear goal-setting have produced a diffuse dialogue but no clear definition of a common purpose. Efforts to experiment with new concepts of international security have proceeded fitfully, but without discernable results in redefining and reinvigorating bilateral security ties. This lack of focus and follow-through has been evident in both countries. Some in Japan have been drawn to the notion of “Asianization” and the hope that economic interdependence and multilateral institutions would put the region on a path similar to that of Europe. Many in the United States regarded the end of the Cold War as an opportunity to return to economic priorities. The early 1990s was a period of heightened bilateral tensions, primarily over the question of access to Japanese markets. Some Americans saw economic competition from Japan as a threat. In the past five years, however, trade tensions have diminished. Envy and concern over Japanese economic prowess have turned to dismay over the Japanese recession and building financial crisis. Neither country dealt with the need to redefine and reinvigorate the alliance. In fact, both took it for granted. The drift in the alliance was obvious until the mid-1990s when the crisis on the Korean peninsula—punctuated by the horror of the Okinawa rape incident— captured the attention of policymakers in Washington and Tokyo. These episodes prompted them to recognize belatedly the costs of neglecting the bilateral relationship. The subsequent Taiwan Strait confrontation in March 1996 gave even more impetus to efforts on both sides of the Pacific to reaffirm the bilateral security alliance. The 1996 U.S.-Japan Joint Security Declaration went a long way toward directing attention in both capitals toward the need to refurbish the alliance, and led to concrete changes that updated defense ties in the form of the revised Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation, the 1996 report of the Special Action Committee on Okinawa, and the bilateral agreement to cooperate in theater missile defense research. But the symbolism of the 1996 declaration stood alone, unsupported by sustained high-level attention. As a result, the United States and Japan soon returned to bickering and poor policy coordination. The costs of the deterioration in the U.S.- Japan relationship have been insidious as well as obvious. By the end of the 1990s, many U.S. policymakers had lost interest in a Japan that appeared incapable of renewing itself. Indeed, Japan’s prolonged recession has discouraged or dispirited even some Japanese officials. In Tokyo, many see Washington as arrogant and unable to recognize that its prescriptions are not universally applicable to others’ economic, political, and social needs. A number of government officials and opinion-makers perceived the U.S. approach as a self-serving rationale for commercial and economic interests and grew resentful of a United States seemingly preoccupied with its own self-centered version of globalization. It has been obvious that U.S. attention and interests have turned elsewhere in Asia. More recently, the principal focus of American policymakers has been the bilateral relationship with China—a relationship characterized by a series of crises ever since the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations. Neither Washington nor Tokyo followed through aggressively on the security agenda set forth in the 1996 declaration, in large measure because of concerns over Beijing’s hostile reaction to the reinvigoration of the security partnership. Beijing let it be known in no uncertain terms that it regarded the U.S.-Japan partnership as an important element of a broader effort by Washington to constrain its regional diplomacy. And as the United States and—to a lesser extent—Japan sought to improve relations with China, both demonstrated a clear desire to downplay the notion of a containment strategy. In fact, the only active security dialogue between the United States and Japan has been a byproduct of a desire to coax North Korea out of its self-imposed isolation. The United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea all concur that close cooperation and unity of purpose offer the most effective strategy to deal with Pyongyang. This record of diffidence, uncertainty, and indirection has no single father, nor does it support an oversimplified laying of blame. Rather, it demands a recognition that the time has arrived for renewed attention to improving, reinvigorating, and refocusing the U.S.- Japan alliance. Both the United States and Japan face an uncertain security environment in Asia at a time of political transition and important change in both countries—for the United States, a new national leadership, and for Japan, a continuing process of economic, political, and social transformation. At the same time, political and economic uncertainties in China and Russia, the fragile nature of detente on the Korean peninsula, and the prospect of protracted instability in Indonesia— all pose shared challenges. For those who argue that Japan is a “wasting asset” in irreversible decline, it might be useful to recall that it has been only a decade since it was taken as an article of faith that American power was ebbing on the international scene. It would be foolhardy to underestimate the enduring dimensions of Japanese power, much as it was unwise for some Japanese to dismiss the latent and enduring qualities of American power in the 1980s and 1990s. Politics Over the past decade, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), faced with internal divisions, a clash of traditional interest group agendas, and a growing split among key constituencies, has focused primarily on hanging on to its dwindling power. At the same time, the political opposition has failed to produce credible, well-conceived policy proposals. The net effect is an LDP struggling to maintain its grip on the reins of government, an opposition unable to provide a governing alternative, and a Japanese public, faced with a lack of credible alternative leadership, reluctantly returning the LDP to office. The result has been a govern government stuck in neutral, incapable of more than muddling through. Nevertheless, the necessity of economic reform and restructuring, driven by the pressures of a relentless globalization of the international economy, are likely to lead to political change. These economic forces are breaking apart the monopoly power of the so-called Iron Triangle—the heretofore collusive relationships among politicians, business, and the bureaucracies—and making power more diffuse. The Japanese political order is experiencing protracted change. Political changes in Japan could lead to unprecedented opportunities to reinvigorate the U.S.-Japan relationship—as well as test it further. The end of bipolar ideological confrontation in Japanese politics and the emergence of a new pragmatism about security affairs among a younger generation of elected officials provide fertile soil for creative new approaches to leadership. It would be unrealistic to expect the current leadership suddenly to embrace reform or to assume a higher profile on the global stage. The demands of Japan’s parliamentary system make it difficult to implement policies, that require short-term pain in exchange for longterm gain. The political system is risk-averse. But the successor generations of politicians and the public-at-large also recognize that economic power alone will no longer be enough to secure Japan’s future. Moreover, the Japanese public, by giving official standing to the national flag and anthem, and in focusing on such territorial claims as the Senkaku islands, has evidenced a new respect for the sovereignty and integrity of the nation state. The implications for the U.S.-Japan relationship stemming from these changes are profound. A similar process is at work in the United States. The growing role of Congress as a force in foreign policy, the rising influence of state and local governments, and the dramatic transformation of the private sector as the initiator of economic change—driven by technology and the empowerment of the individual— are altering the influence of once-central foreign policymaking institutions. But, just as Japan’s risk-averse political leadership has held back the nation’s economic transformation, the lack of clear direction from Washington also has taken a toll. Episodic executive branch leadership has failed to produce a well-conceived game plan for America’s relationship with Japan. This, in turn, has accelerated the erosion of political support and popular understanding of the importance of the alliance. In short, the political, economic, and social changes underway in the United States put an even greater premium on executive branch leadership in foreign affairs. If the United States can exercise leadership— that is to say, excellence without arrogance— in its relations with Japan, the two countries will be better able to realize the full potential for cooperation nurtured during the past 50 years. If the changes underway in Japan ultimately produce a stronger, more responsive political and economic system, the synergy in U.S.-Japan relations will enhance our abilities to play an engaged, mutually supportive, and fundamentally constructive role in regional and global arenas in the years to come Security Because the stakes are so high in Asia, it is urgent that the United States and Japan develop a common perception and approach regarding their relationship in the 21st century. The potential for conflict in Asia is lowered dramatically by a visible and “real” U.S.-Japan defense relationship. The use of bases granted by Japan allows the U.S. to affect the security environment from the Pacific to the Persian Gulf. The revised Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation, the basis for joint defense planning, should be regarded as the floor—not the ceiling—for an expanded Japanese role in the transpacific alliance, and the uncertainties of the post-Cold War regional setting require a more dynamic approach to bilateral defense planning. Japan’s prohibition against collective self defense is a constraint on alliance cooperation. Lifting this prohibition would allow for closer and more efficient security cooperation. This is a decision that only the Japanese people can make. The United States has respected the domestic decisions that form the character of Japanese security policies and should continue to do so. But Washington must make clear that it welcomes a Japan that is willing to make a greater contribution and to become a more equal alliance partner. We see the special relationship between the United States and Great Britain as a model for the alliance. This arrangement requires the following elements: Reaffirming the defense commitment. The United States should reaffirm its commitment to the defense of Japan and those areas under the administrative control of Japan, including the Senkaku Islands.</strong><br />

<strong>And, the alliance solves warming</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Lastly, the alliance can complement existing initiatives to address “natural security” threats – environmental challenges like global warming and resource competition.⁶ To date, the alliance agenda has yet to take up natural security concerns in any serious way. This is unfortunate. Although removed from the more traditional threats the alliance has traditionally countered, natural security threats pose a considerable challenge to the United States and Japan given their reliance on energy imports and the centrality of critical minerals to their high-technology sectors. Moreover, with two of the world’s leading science establishments, the United States and Japan have an unparalleled capacity to address natural security threats. Putting natural security squarely on the alliance agenda will ensure it receives adequate attention from high-level policymakers rather than languishes as one of many areas comprising the bilateral relationship. Under the auspices of the alliance, the United States and Japan should launch bilateral collaboration to develop clean energy technology, establish a common U.S.-Japan standard for mitigating greenhouse gases and work to devise substitutes for critical minerals. To be sure, natural security will never displace the many traditional security challenges the alliance confronts, but it constitutes an important future area for alliance cooperation.</strong><br />

The hour is late. Leading climate scientists such as James Hansen are literally shouting at the top of their lungs that the world needs to reduce emissions by 20-40% as soon as possible, and 80-90% by the year 2050, if we are to avoid climate chaos, crop failures, endless wars, melting of the polar icecaps, and a disastrous rise in ocean levels. Either we radically reduce CO2 and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e, which includes all GHGs, not just CO2) pollutants (currently at 390 parts per million and rising 2 ppm per year) to 350 ppm, including agriculture-derived methane and nitrous oxide pollution, or else survival for the present and future generations is in jeopardy. As scientists warned at Copenhagen, business as usual and a corresponding 7-8.6 degree Fahrenheit rise in global temperatures means that the carrying capacity of the Earth in 2100 will be reduced to one billion people. Under this hellish scenario, billions will die of thirst, cold, heat, disease, war, and starvation.<br />

While US officials still debate the appropriate extent of their engagement with Japan, their Japanese counterparts are intent on not only acquiring BMD capability, but having a voice in the direction of future program development and ensuring that missile defense contributes to the development of Japan’s defense industrial/technology base. Japanese Ministry of Defense (JMoD) and industry officials expect a broader role in BMD systems development, and assume that current joint development projects will lead to joint production of missiles and related hardware as well – not a safe assumption given an all but certain collision between the Japanese government’s rigid approach to arms exports restrictions and likely US insistence on making any jointly developed/produced BMD products available to third country allies.12 <br />

Concerns about Perceptions of Japan’s Southeast Asian Neighbors. Japan is also aware of negative ramifications that deployment of a BMD system could have on its diplomatic profile in Asia, especially among its Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) neighbors. As past victims of Japanese World War II aggression, many of the countries of Southeast Asia still harbor fears of Japanese remilitarization. Hence, many if not most countries in Southeast Asia view the U.S.-Japan alliance in a favorable light, for it signifies a continuing U.S. engagement in regional security and deters Japan from re-emerging as an independent military power. In this respect, joint deployment of a BMD system would tend to be less worrisome to most Southeast Asian countries than would Japan’s acquisition of an independent capability, but some Japanese policymakers are concerned that even this would be unduly provocative, and would partly negate Tokyo’s effort to improve its relations in the context of a de facto rivalry with China for influence in an area Japan once viewed as its “backyard.” <br />

Critics of Japanese participation in a U.S.-led BMD system argue that any missile defense system beyond a limited, lower-tier system will overwhelm Japan’s limited national security resources and absorption capabilities and pose unmanageable strategic dilemmas for Washington and Tokyo (both factors are discussed in some detail in Chapter Three). In contrast, in addition to the burden-sharing and enhanced defense cooperation arguments mentioned above, U.S. proponents of Japanese participation insist that Tokyo’s acquisition of a BMD system would enhance both countries’ strategic position in Asia by strengthening extended deterrence and reducing the overall vulnerability of Japan and U.S. forces in Japan to limited ballistic missile threats during a regional crisis. Moreover, proponents argue that the United States will in any event eventually deploy a TMD system to defend its forces in Japan and under such circumstances could not conceivably deny such a system to the Japanese government, since a U.S-only TMD force would allegedly impede interoperability and defense cooperation, and perhaps provoke resentment among the Japanese public.3 The U.S. Nay and several U.S. Navy defense contractors are particularly strong supporters of Japanese acquisition of the naval-based TMD systems.<br />

Fourth, a Japanese BMD system might also facilitate the acquisition of sophisticated technologies and industrial capabilities, such as software and systems integration and missile technology, that would be of significant use to both the self-defense forces and private industry. The indigenous development or acquisition of these and other technologies and development processes could strengthen Japan’s ability to adopt a more independent defense posture, should the need arise. Such technologies and processes might also strengthen Japan’s overall defense industrial base, benefit ailing defense industry corporations, or generate significant spin-off advantages to Japan’s commercial sector. The cooperative development and technology sharing required could also benefit both the Japanese self-defense forces and the private sector by leading to the relaxation of Japan’s stringent arms export controls, thereby expanding the market and reducing the costs of defense-related technologies. <br />

For the time being, Beijing is less concerned with the effectiveness of these emerging missile defense capabilities than with what these developments indicate about the future direction of Japan’s security policy and U.S. strategic intentions. Chinese People’s Liberation Army analysts, for example, are taking pains to underscore the advantage, or “edge,” that offensive ballistic missiles – meaning Chinese missiles – will hold over missile defenses, even as they seek to gauge the long-term implications of U.S.-Japan missile defense programs and recent deployments. [8] At the same time, Beijing is following the discussion, however speculative, by certain individuals in the Japanese political elite that Japan should consider acquiring an independent nuclear deterrent as a complement to its growing sophistication in the realm of missile defense. Indeed, Chinese analysts point out that Japan has the necessary nuclear technologies, large quantities of plutonium potentially usable in nuclear weapons, and computer simulation techniques to design such weapons, which together would allow Japan to manufacture them at short notice. For many Chinese observers, this is only a matter of time. Recent comments by former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that Japan needs to consider the nuclear option further reinforce Chinese beliefs. [9] <br />

The Japan Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) has four Kongo Class AEGIS destroyers operating with SM-2 missiles at sea; the 5th and 6th destroyers are under construction. Kongo Class ships with missile defense upgrades and SM-3 missiles will be combined with short-range land-based PAC-3 Patriot missiles to form the initial ballistic missile defense shield for mainland Japan. The key deals and principal contractors will be: Vertical Missile Launches DDG-64-68-80_CG-69 The basic concept (click to view full) A $458 million sale involving longer-range SM-3 missiles, which have performed relatively well in ABM tests over the past couple of years but require AEGIS combat system and radar upgrades to use properly. The Japanese are request 9 of the SM-3 Block IA Standard missiles with MK 21 Mod 2 canisters, plus ballistic missile defense upgrades to one AEGIS Weapon System, AEGIS BMD Vertical Launch System (VLS) alternations, containers, spare and repair parts, publications, documentation, supply support, U.S. Government and contractor technical assistance, and other related elements of logistics support. They will receive data sufficient to maintain and support the systems. See DSCA release. Based on other announcements that do confirm the exact ship, and assuming that the Japanese are upgrading their ship in order, the JMSDF destroyer JS Myoko [DDG-175] may be the target of this request. Key contractors for this deal are: * Lockheed-Martin Maritime System and Sensors in Moorestown, New Jersey (AEGIS system) * Raytheon Company Equipment Division in Andover, MA (SM-3 Missiles) * United Defense/ BAE Systems in Minneapolis, MN (Mk41 VLS) ORD_SM-2_and_SM-3.jpg SM-2 (top), SM-3 The second sale is for $70 million if all options are exercised, and involves the shorter-range SM-2 Block IIIB Standard Missiles that serve as the mainstays of the Kongo Class’ air defense, as well as associated equipment and services. This sale covers: * 20 SM-2 Block IIIB Tactical STANDARD missiles with MK 13 MOD 0 canisters * 24 SM-2 Block IIIB Telemetry STANDARD missiles with MK 13 MOD 0 canisters and AN/DKT-71A telemeters * Conversion kits and containers * Spare and repair parts, supply support, U.S. Government and contractor technical assistance and other related elements of logistics support. See DSCA release. The principal contractors for this deal will be: * Raytheon Missile Systems Company in Tucson, AZ (SM-2 missiles) * Raytheon Company of Camden, AK * BAE of Minneapolis, MN and * BAE subsidiary United Defense, Limited Partnership of Aberdeen, SD This proposed sales are consistent with these U.S. objectives and with the 1960 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security. Indeed, Japan is actively pursuing a joint missile defense program with the USA, and already has the upgraded AEGIS Weapon System, SM-2 Block IIIB, and longer-range SM-3 Block IA Standard missiles in its inventory. Japan already maintains two Intermediate-Level Maintenance Depots capable of maintaining and supporting the SM-2, and is upgrading these facilities to maintain and support the newest SM variants. They’ve even worked with the USA to test an improved SM-3 variant recently, and will have no difficulty absorbing the additional equipment. As such, the Japanese do not need any US representatives or contractors on site for support. <br />

The Japanese government, which has conducted technological research on missile defence with the US government but has taken a rather prudent attitude to its development and deployment, now seems increasingly interested in developing and acquiring its own systems. As the concern about a nuclear weapons programme in North Korea has mounted, the fear of its ballistic missile capability has been intensified recently in Japan. Under such circumstances, the Japanese government is considering the purchase of SM-3 and PAC-3 from the United States [6]. In the meantime, Tokyo is determined to continue the joint technological research with the US government on a sea-based missile defence system (formally known as Navy Theater Wide Missile Defence, but now renamed as Aegis Ballistic Missile Defence), which started in 1999 in the aftermath of the launching of a Taepo Dong-1 missile [7]. It is reported that the Japanese government is planning to conduct flight tests of interceptors with the US government in 2005 and 2006 for the first time after the beginning of the bilateral technological co-operation [8]. <br />

At the same time, it is also possible that various components of a BMD architecture, such as the PAC-3 system, additional AEGIS ships, and certain C3 and radar tracking infrastructure elements, might be acquired by Japan’s self-defense forces as necessary and planned “upgrades” of existing systems without any prior debate or decision on ballistic missile defense per se—particularly if they are seen as useful for non-BMD missions. In other words, while avoiding an explicit, formal decision to develop and deploy a BMD system, Japan could gradually acquire many of the elements of such a system.4 Moreover, financial considerations will probably not obstruct such selective acquisitions, given the likely ability of the Japanese government to imbed such relatively limited costs in existing program budgets or to utilize off-line or special allocations. <br />

Japan’s Defense Agency (JDA) has requested 219 billion yen ($1.87 billion) in funding for missile defenses for the 2007 fiscal year, an increase of more than 56 percent over the current spending, albeit in the context of an overall defense budget that is little changed. The money will be used for purchases and early deployment of both the land-based U.S. Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) anti-missile system and the sea-based U.S. Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptor. It will also be used for improvements in Japan’s early warning systems, such as electronic surveillance and the introduction of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The sale to Japan of SM-3s, worth $458 million, will be the first such U.S. sale to a foreign country. In June 2006, the Aegis-equipped cruiser U.S.S. Shiloh successfully intercepted a medium-range missile using a SM-3 during the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercises off Hawaii, in which Japan participated. [1] The United States reportedly will also provide 80 PAC-3 interceptors to Japan, although this has not been confirmed by JDA. [2] Chinese media note that JDA cites both the July North Korean missile tests and the Sino-Japanese territorial disputes as the impetus for the funding increase. [3] <br />

<br />
Japan is in a unique position for ballistic missile defense (BMD). The Cold War controversy that culminated in the 1972 anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty, which heavily restricted BMD capability, centered around the destabilizing effect an effective missile defense shield would have on the delicate balance of mutually assured destruction. Because Japan is wealthy, it can afford an investment few nations can. But because Japan is also not a nuclear power — in reality, because it is not the United States or Russia — its missile shield does not raise the same issues in terms of the world’s nuclear balance. China, however, will not be pleased. The JSDF hopes to spend nearly $120 million to purchase and field the U.S. Patriot PAC-3 system, which provides a terminal phase defense, although the maximum altitude for a Patriot PAC-3 intercept is less than 10 miles. In terms of BMD, the Patriot PAC-3 provides a solid final line of defense, but it is only one component of a larger, layered defense with several interceptors of different capabilities. Alone, the PAC-3 cannot provide a reliable and redundant layered defense. The next step is for the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force to equip its already-built Kongou-class guided missile destroyers, essentially a U.S. Arleigh Burke, with the U.S. RIM-156 Standard SM-3 interceptor and the appropriate software for the already standard SPY-1D radar and Aegis system. The sixth and final ship of the Kongou class, the Ashigara, was launched Aug. 30 and will spend the next year being made BMD-capable and conducting sea trials. The Ticonderoga-class USS Shiloh, a BMD-capable and Aegis-equipped guided missile cruiser armed with the SM-3, arrived Aug. 29 in Yokosuka, where it will be stationed, inaugurating what looks to be a more or less permanent BMD-capable presence for the foreseeable future. The SM-3 really is the near-term solution for Japan. It has been successful in six out of seven intercept tests and offers a great deal of flexibility. It can engage short-, medium-, intermediate- and intercontinental ballistic missiles both during the ascent and descent phases of midcourse flight. At shorter range, the SM-3 can reduce the burn of the third stage to a quick pulse to intercept lower-flying short-range ballistic missiles. The kinetic warhead itself contains no explosive but instead makes physical contact with the target, using its phenomenal (and highly classified) speed for destructive energy.<br />

<br />
<strong>China has conducted a successful &quot;defensive&quot; anti-missile test with the intent of sending the United States a stern message of disapproval over Washington's latest arms sales to Taiwan. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu described the January 11 event as a test of &quot;ground-based midcourse missile interception technology&quot; conducted &quot;within its territory&quot;. It was defensive in nature and targeted at no country, she said. The test &quot;is just a game about the US sales of weapons to Taiwan; about the non-proliferation of missiles; and about the prevention of an arms race in outer space between the US and China.&quot; according to Li Shouping, professor in international law at the School of Law of Beijing Institute of Technology and director of the Institute of Space Law. The test was a direct response to the US Department of Defense decision on January 6 to sell weapons, including the Patriot III anti-missile system, to Taiwan, Li said in a commentary at the Res Communis web site [1]. Since the sale would integrate Taiwan into the Theater Missile Defense System (TMD) of the US, the Chinese government thought it harmed the sovereignty of China and violated the principle in international law, he wrote. Li declined to respond to questions from Asia Times Online. Professor Tan Kaijia, of the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) National Defense University told Xinhua news agency &quot;If the ballistic missile is regarded as a spear, now we have succeeded in building a shield for self-defense.&quot; The test was conducted within China's territory, &quot;so the missile that intercepted the incoming target would not fly or [fall into] another country's territory, China had no obligation to declare the missile test, but doing so revealed that the military was becoming more transparent,&quot; Tan said. Many missile experts contend that what China really carried out was a test of anti-satellite capabilities without actually shooting down a satellite. &quot;We still do not know exactly what happened, but it the current hypothesis is that China tested the same system that it used to destroy a satellite in 2007, this time in an anti-ballistic missile mode. The technology is essentially the same,&quot; said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the Nuclear Strategy and Non-proliferation Initiative at the Washington DC-based New America Foundation. [2] Brian Weeden, technical advisor with the Colorado-based Secure World Foundation, says that while none of the objectives for the test are &quot;apparent due to the opaqueness of the PRC [People's Republic of China] decision-making process,&quot; the ultimate objective of the test was as a strategic communication to the US. &quot;First, the timing of the test - exactly three years after the successful 2007 Chinese ASAT [anti-satellite weapon] test - indicates that whatever motivated China to do the ASAT test has not gone away,&quot; said Weeden. &quot;Some have argued that the Chinese ASAT test was an attempt to push the US towards serious negotiations on a space weapons treaty in the Conference on Disarmament. Others have argued that it was a demonstration of Chinese capability to disrupt and degrade US space capabilities in the event of a Taiwan Strait conflict. Whatever the real reason or reasons were, it can be said that they still apply.&quot; China implemented a significant change in the way it communicated this most recent test to the public which indicates that they learned a great deal from the strategic communications failure that took place after the 2007 ASAT test, according to Weeden. &quot;It has gone way beyond the stoic silence displayed in 2007,&quot; he said. &quot;An objective [in 2010] for China was to see if it could carry out this sort of coordinated communications strategy and what sort of geopolitical response it would engender,&quot; said Weeden. &quot;A large part of this learning came from watching how the US did strategic communications for the 2008 destruction of USA 193. While the USA 193 destruction was in fact a test of an anti-satellite system, the US went to extraordinary lengths to communicate that it was no such thing and that it was all about public safety. The US was also ahead of the curve, bringing the issue to the public spotlight itself with a coordinated communications strategy.&quot; This test also enabled China to communicate that it too can develop an ASAT capability as a side effect of working on kinetic kill missile defense interceptors. &quot;This just further cements the fact that hit-to-kill technologies for both missile defense and ASAT are really the same capability. However, in the current geopolitical climate testing a hit-to-kill missile defense system is politically acceptable while testing a hit-to-kill ASAT system is not,&quot; said Weeden. It has long been US policy to continue to develop technology for anti-satellite weapons while not actually building an operational system. This &quot;hedging&quot; strategy was seen as a way for the US to publicly state it opposed weapons in space while still having an option to deploy them. &quot;This Chinese test and the recent Indian announcement both indicate the flaw in that strategy: it allows other states to use the same policy to develop weapon systems that pose a threat to US space capabilities,&quot; said Weeden. &quot;This flaw is not new, in fact it has been pointed out by arms control advocates for decades. But this flaw was derided by the missile defense and space weapons advocates in the US as overblown.&quot; While the US Department of Defense complained it was not notified, the US was well aware the test was about to take place. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted that the US had not been caught by surprise and dismissed the theory that China carried out the test in order to send the US a message over Taiwan. &quot;We have followed the Chinese development of aerospace capacity for quite some time, and this had been foreshadowed some weeks ago,&quot; said Clinton. Since the November PLA Air Force [PLAAF] anniversary celebration, officials have stated that missile defense is part of the PLAAF's new doctrine of &quot;integrated air-space offense and defense&quot;. &quot;It is possible that this service eventually will control not just a ground-based strategic anti-ballistic missle [ABM] force, but also laser-armed large aircraft capable of anti-satellite strikes, and a range of unmanned or manned space platforms to attack deeper space targets, like US DPS early warning satellites,&quot; said Richard Fisher, senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based International Assessment and Strategy Center. Fisher asserts that the Chinese Communist Party and PLA leadership purposefully engages in political intimidation and the not-so-subtle transmission of deterrent messages during all of its military activities, including this month's test. &quot;But what is important for Japan and other US allies is that China's combination of its building a larger and more capable nuclear delivery force with the fielding of an increasingly capable missile defense force, will more rapidly undermine the extended US nuclear deterrent that undergirds strategic stability in Asia,&quot; he said. &quot;Absent an overwhelming nuclear deterrent, US non-nuclear forces in Asia become as much liabilities as assets.&quot; Fisher sees broad and unwelcome implications in the test and warns about what is unfolding in the region as a whole. Should China elect to arm its new land and sea-based nuclear missiles with multiple warheads, it could easily achieve warhead numbers approaching the 500 to 1,000 that the Obama administration is reportedly considering as a second round of nuclear reductions with Russia. &quot;The likelihood that China could combine such a nuclear force with an ABM system means that Japan, South Korea, Australia and others are facing the surreal in 2010. If the Barack Obama administration remains committed to deep US warhead reductions then PLA missiles defenses will erase the viability of extended US nuclear deterrent commitments twice as fast,&quot; said Fisher. According to Gregory Kulacki, senior analyst and China project manager for the Global Security Program under the Union of Concerned Scientists, as US officials prepare the new US Space Posture Review to update US national security space policy and strategy, China's test this month will be closely scrutinized. &quot;[It] will drive home the importance of talking to China about missile defense and [anti-satellite] technologies before China completes the development of these interceptors and moves towards deployment,&quot; Kulacki told the Associated Press. Dean Cheng, research fellow at the Washington, DC-based Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, stated recently, &quot;It would seem that Chinese concerns about US missile defense developments are more a reflection of concerns about being outpaced by American technological capability than foregoing a capability. Moreover, like the ASAT test, the anti-missile test reflects a steady, ongoing program that has reached a development milestone suitable for testing systems.&quot; [3] Cheng considers the test &quot;a potential diplomatic opportunity for the US&quot; and recommends &quot;the US should make it clear that it will not object to the development and deployment of missile defense systems by China if China also adopts (a) broader defensive, non-threatening posture. It might signal this through, for example, a reduction in the number of missiles aimed at Taiwan as proposed by President Ma Ying-jeou.&quot; Cheng also sees danger in what lies ahead: &quot;On the other hand, Chinese interest in anti-missile systems should give pause to [US] efforts at eliminating global nuclear arms, because the Chinese continue to pursue a nuclear modernization program. If such a goal were to be seriously pursued, then at some point, the level of US nuclear forces would decline to such an extent that even a moderately effective anti-missile system could seriously affect deterrence and advance China's position to threaten others. Beijing, it would seem, is responding in deeds to the president's [Barack Obama's] words. While it has not yet been confirmed that China used a mobile launch system to conduct its test, should that prove the case, it represents a very significant dimension. &quot;If a mobile launcher was used, it is certainly important since pre-launch targeting would be nearly impossible if this technology was used for missile defense or anti-satellite purposes,&quot; said Eric Hagt, China program director at the Washington, DC-based World Security Institute. Among other things, this mobile defense capability would make US surveillance satellites increasingly vulnerable on flight paths over China. &quot;[It means that China's anti-missile systems are] not fixed targets that we could identify and either have our satellites avoid flying over or take measures before coming into the threat envelope,&quot; said Weeden of the Secure World Foundation. In terms of missile defense, &quot;If you are protecting against [inbound missiles] that are only covering several hundred kilometers, it is beneficial to be able to move your interceptors into the right position depending on which country you think the threat is coming from,&quot; said Weeden. &quot;From China's perspective, if it was building a system to potentially defend against an Indian or Russian short to medium range ballistic missile attack, mobile interceptors could be useful.&quot; If China's ICBMs and ABMs can be placed in concealed underground bases and rapidly deployed for attack and defense missions, it severely reduces the response time of the opposing national command authority, according to the International Assessment and Strategy Center's Fisher. &quot;China's development of a large number of 'HQ-19' ABMs may signal that China's heretofore 'defensive' and 'retaliatory' nuclear doctrine has evolved to include a range of offensive nuclear attack operations,&quot; said Fisher. &quot;The implication of such a PLA evolution is that in order to deter China and meet other security requirements, the US and Russia may require a much higher nuclear warhead inventory than the Obama administration may seeking as part of a second round of nuclear weapons reductions.&quot; Beyond that, Fisher sees a much grander strategy unfolding in outer space. &quot;It should also be expected that the PLA will soon build on China's early Chang'e unmanned moon missions by placing a range of unmanned sensors or even weapons on the moon to better enable attacks against US deep space assets,&quot; said Fisher. That may seem a bit far-fetched to many readers. However, China is not backing off, while the US is intent on maintaining the security of Taiwan. Tensions are not going to subside especially when China is so determined to build increasingly sophisticated weapons systems to counter the US in particular.</strong><br />

&quot;Pakistani sources already expect that China will sell a future anti-theater ballistic missile defense or (Area Theater Ballistic Missile Defense) ATBMD-capable version of the HQ-9 surface to air missile,&quot; said Fisher. &quot;India's development of missile defenses is likely to increase the People's Liberation Army's desire to break out of its now 'stealth' ABM program, likely being done in parallel with its anti-satellite program. China will likely deploy an anti-ICBM capable ABM system before India does so.&quot; China no doubt sees India's anti-missile defense effort as destabilizing. Among other things, as India moves to deploy its system, China fears that Pakistan might counter &quot;by changing its nuclear weapons deployment posture by moving them closer to Indian border for quicker reaction time and making them more difficult to defend against, or by putting them on higher alert status by mating warheads with delivery vehicles, etc. Whatever the reaction by Pakistan it will lead to greater destabilization&quot;, said Hagt. &quot;Some in China suspect that India ultimately has ambitions to become a dominant player in the Indian Ocean and even further afield in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, along which energy and other interests lie. As such, India's nuclear build-up and missile defense targets China's nuclear force,&quot; adds Hagt. &quot;The fact that India is working on a range of intermediate and longer range systems beyond the requirements of addressing Pakistan security concerns, appears to support this theory.&quot; In addition, any integration of India into the US global missile defense system, whether it involves interceptors, or the stationing of tracking infrastructure would profoundly affect China's own security. &quot;China sees this as part of US strategic encirclement of China. This is particularly sensitive for China since its northeast and northwest regions are currently blindspots for US radar systems,&quot; said Hagt. &quot;That will disappear with Indian-American missile defense integration. The region would be 'thoroughly exposed', thus vastly decreasing China's 'strategic depth' advantage in this region. This, in essence, would be another 'Poland of the East' in terms of having another overseas missile defense base, this time pointed at China's heart.&quot; <br />

<strong>Japan’s involvement in joint development of the SMD element of the U.S. missile defense program represents considerable progress by Japan towards greater alliance burden sharing, but its full implications remain to be seen. Neither Japan’s participation in joint research and development, nor a decision by Japan for or against acquisition or deployment of a BMD capability, are likely to have critical impact on the development of a U.S. missile defense capability or on the deployment of an American sea-based capability in Asia. Nonetheless, Japan’s participation in the research and development hase is viewed by U.S. officials as possibly contributing important technology, and a decision by Tokyo to acquire a BMD capability could have considerable foreign policy significance for the United States and important military implications. Given the prevailing uncertainties about Japanese policy and the implications of its future decisions, Congress may decide to consider carefully the assumptions of the Administration and the terms of any further steps in BMD cooperation with Japan. Part of such consideration could be obtaining additional information on the threat perceptions of the Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) and Self-Defense Forces (SDF), the possible implications of a change in the perceived threat from North Korea’s missiles, the attitude of Japanese political leaders and Ministry of Foreign Affairs policymakers towards China, Japan’s fiscal situation and defense budget trends, public and political attitudes towards U.S.-Japan security cooperation and U.S. bases in Japan, and the prospects for constitutional revision and the acquisition of emergency powers by the Japanese national command authorities.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Beijing’s anti-NMD positions have undergone a noticeable change since mid-2001. Its reaction to the U.S. announcement of withdrawal from the AEM Treaty was moderate. Chinese response to the December 17, 2002, missile defense deployment announcement was typical of the adjusted position: “The development of the missile defense system should not undermine global strategic stability, nor should it undermine international and regional security.” Indeed. Chinese officials now comment that international efforts must be expended to develop a new strategic framework and emphasize that China and the United States share important common interests in maintaining global peace. Instead of arguing how U.S. missile defense would lead to instability and even an arms race, the official Chinese statement on missile defense issues now reads: “Under [the] current situation, it is crucial and in the interests of all countries to maintain global strategic stability and preserve international regimes of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation. China is willing to engage in constructive dialogues with all parties concerned to maintain international peace and security through joint efforts.”113 What explains this dramatic shift in public positions? There are three important variables. The first is the Russian factor. Beijing realized that notwithstanding all the talk about a strategic partnership between China and Russia, important differences existed between the two countries in terms of near- term policy priorities and longer- term strategic interests. Given Russia’s relatively weak position, it was both unrealistic and unreasonable to expect that it could sustain a confrontation with the United States on strategic nuclear, ABM, and NMD issues.4 Indeed, since September 11, Russia’s positions on these issues have shown clear signs of softening and retreat. Obviously, China’s hope of sustaining a Sino Russian united front would also unravel because of China’s and Russia’s different priorities and fundamental interests.5 The Moscow Treaty and the new strategic partnership between Russia and the United States undercut Chinese hope for a united front against missile defense. Once the new strategic cooperation takes shape, Russia may act on the idea of developing joint missile defenses with the United States. Potential use of Russian technology is reportedly being studied. The second variable is Beijing’s careful consideration of missile defense issues and the broader Sino-US. bilateral relationship. In a way, Russia’s change of positions left China with no choice but to acquiesce in the development. The Chinese leadership came to a realistic assessment of the prospects of sustaining a prolonged fight against missile defenses and doing it alone without seriously and negatively affecting Sino-U.S. relations. Continued confrontation with the United States would not dissuade U.S. determination to discard the ABM Treaty and pursue missile defense. Instead, it would further strain a bilateral relationship that had just seen signs of improvement in the wake of the September Ii terrorist attacb.1 Certainly, Beijing considers other more important issues as critical, and a stable bilateral relationship is essential to their management. The realization of the futility of picking a fight with the United States on missile defense issues and the need to stand the moral high ground provide the rationale for China’s toned-down responses and comments. The emphasis is now on the need for international cooperation, including that between Beijing and Washington, to maintain global peace with continued efforts in nonproliferation—not on counterproductive efforts that would tarnish China’s image as a responsible great power. Indeed, Chinese policymakers actually decided to de-link missile defense and Taiwan issues from China’s own responsibilities and obligations in the international nonproliferation regime. As a consequence, the second half of 2002 saw the promulgation of a series of export control regulations. The Bush administration’s efforts to engage China on missile defense—albeit belatedly—constitute the third variable and, ironically, may explain China’s rather restrained responses to both the December 2001 announcement of the ABM withdrawal and the December 2002 decision on initial missile defense deployment. Great power consultation at least offers the opportunity to clarify strategic intent if not to change positions. During the Clinton administration, the need to secure Russian agreement on amendments to the AEM Treaty focused U.S. attention to bringing the Russians on board but largely ignored Chinese concerns. The fact that Washington’s verbal assurance about U.S. missile defenses could not convince Beijing of its true intentions, and the recognition that China would be less likely to cooperate on issues important to U.S. strategic interests, led to limited engagement late in the Clinton administration on some of the issues Beijing raised, in particular the TMD cover age of Taiwan. Although it is still far from receiving the needed reassurance from Washington, Beijing at least is content with the fact that it is now being consulted- That the United States did not sell Taiwan the few critical TMD systems, such as the Aegis system, that most concern China also is an important factor.</strong><br />

<strong>Also during this period, the informal Track Two dialogues involving Chinese and American experts and officials participating in their private capacities contained ever fewer of the harsh exchanges on BMD that had become frequent in the 1990s. The following Chinese commentary is illustrative of this shift in tone: “With the dawning of the 21st century, especially considering the 9/11 attack, the world entered a new post-post cold war age. International relations in this age will perhaps be featured by the mixture of cooperation and confrontation but with cooperation as the main theme. Although missile defense will affect the strategic balance among the big powers, they can try to find a way out and make various compromises and reach a new balance for they need cooperation more than they need confrontation. So the problems caused by missile defense can be solved more easily than at any other time under the new international circumstances….Another important factor is that there does exist the threat of missile proliferation and one cannot exclude the possibility of future nuclear weapon attack by terrorists. So the U.S. is justified in inventing and deploying limited missile defense. The world perhaps will come to the new terms and consensus with the U.S. on this over time.”128</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>War in Asia is thinkable but it is unlikely. The Asia-Pacific region can, paradoxically, be regarded as a zone both of relative insecurity and of relative strategic stability. On the one hand, the region contains some of the world’s most significant flashpoints – the Korean peninsula, the Taiwan Strait, the Siachen glacier – where tensions between nations could escalate to the point of resulting in a major war. The region is replete with border issues, the site of acts of terrorism (the Bali bombings, Manila superferry bombing, Kashmir, etc.), and it is an area of overlapping maritime claims (the Spratly Islands, Diaoyutai islands, etc). Finally, the Asia-Pacific is an area of strategic significance, sitting astride key sea lines of communication (SLOCS) and important chokepoints. Nevertheless, the Asia-Pacific region is more stable than one might believe. Separatism remains a challenge but the break-up of states is unlikely. Terrorism is a nuisance but its impact is contained. The North Korean nuclear issue, while not fully resolved, is at least moving toward a conclusion with the likely denuclearization of the peninsula. Tensions between China and Taiwan, while always just beneath the surface, seem unlikely to erupt in open conflict (especially after the KMT victories in Taiwan). The region also possesses significant multilateral structures such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the nascent Six Party Talks forum and, in particular, ASEAN, and institutions such as the EAs, ASEAN + 3, ARF which ASEAN has conceived. Although the United States has been the hegemon in the Asia-Pacific since the end of World War II, it will probably not remain the dominant presence in the region over the next 25 years. A rising China will pose the critical foreign policy challenge, probably more difficult than the challenge posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. This development will lead to the most profound change in the strategic environment of the Asia-Pacific. On the other hand, the rise of China does not automatically mean that conflict is more likely. First, the emergence of a more assertive China does not mean a more aggressive China. Beijing appears content to press its claims peacefully (if forcefully), through existing avenues and institutions of international relations. Second, when we look more closely at the Chinese military buildup, we find that there may be less than some might have us believe, and that the Chinese war machine is not quite as threatening – as some might argue. Instead of Washington perspectives shaping Asia-Pacific affairs, the rise of China is likely to see a new paradigm in international affairs – the “Beijing Consensus” – founded on the leadership role of the authoritarian party state, a technocratic approach to governance, the significance of social rights and obligations, a reassertion of the principles of national sovereignty and non-interference, coupled with support for freer markets and stronger regional and international institutions. The emphasis is on good governance. Japan fits easily in this paradigm. Just as Western dominance in the past century led to Western ideas shaping international institutions and global values, Asian leaders and Asian thinkers will increasingly participate in and shape the global discourse, whether it is on the role of international institutions, the rules governing international trade or the doctrines which under-gird responses to humanitarian crises. An emerging Beijing Consensus is not premised on the rise of the ‘East’ and decline of the ‘West’, as sometimes seemed to be the sub-text of the earlier Asian values debate. I do not share the triumphalism of my friends Kishore Mahbubani and Tommy Koh. However, like the Asian values debate, this new debate reflects alternative philosophical traditions. The issue is the appropriate balance between the rights of the individual and those of the state. This debate will highlight the shared identity and shared values between China and the states in the region. I do not agree with those in the US who argue that Sino-US competition will result in “intense security competition with considerable potential for war” in which most of China’s neighbours “will join with the United States to contain China’s power.”[1] These shared values are likely to reduce the risk of conflict and result in regional pressure for an accommodation with China and the adoption of policies of engagement with China, rather than confrontation with an emerging China. China is increasingly economically inter-dependent, part of a network of over-lapping cooperative regional institutions. In Asia, the focus is on economic growth and facilitating China’s integration into regional and global affairs. An interesting feature is that in China’s interactions with states in the region, China is beginning to be interested in issues of proper governance, the development of domestic institutions and the strengthening of regional institutional mechanisms. Chinese policy is not unchanging, even on the issue of sovereignty. For example, there has been an evolution in Chinese thinking on the question of freedom of passage through the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. While China supported the claims of the littoral states to sovereign control over the Straits when the Law of the Sea Convention was concluded in 1982, China’s increasing dependence on imported oil shipped through the Straits has led to a shift in favour of burden-sharing, the recognition of the rights of user states and the need for cooperation between littoral states and user states. Engagement as part of global and regional institutions has resulted in revisions to China’s earlier advocacy of strict non-intervention and non-interference. Recent Chinese support for global initiatives in peace-keeping, disaster relief, counter-terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation and anti-drug trafficking, its lack of resort to the use of its veto as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and its active role within the World Trade Organisation participation in global institutions can be influential in shaping perceptions of a rising China. Beijing has greatly lowered the tone and rhetoric of its strategic competition with the United States, actions which have gone a long way toward reassuring the countries of Southeast Asia of China’s sincerity in pursuing a non-confrontational foreign and security strategy. Beijing’s approach is significant as most Southeast Asian states prefer not to have to choose between alignment with the US and alignment with China and have adopted ‘hedging’ strategies in their relationships with the two powers. Beijing now adopts a more subtle approach towards the United States: not directly challenging US leadership in Asia, partnering with Washington where the two countries have shared interests, and, above all, promoting multilateral security processes that, in turn, constrain US power, influence and hegemony in the Asia-Pacific. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is certainly in the midst of perhaps the most ambitious upgrading of its combat capabilities since the early 1960s, and it is adding both quantitatively and qualitatively to its arsenal of military equipment. Its current national defence doctrine is centered on the ability to fight “Limited Local Wars”. PLA operations emphasize preemption, surprise, and shock value, given that the earliest stages of conflict may be crucial to the outcome of a war. The PLA has increasingly pursued the acquisition of weapons for asymmetric warfare. The PLA mimics the United States in terms of the ambition and scope of its transformational efforts – and therefore challenges the U.S. military at its own game. Nevertheless, we should note that China, despite a “deliberate and focused course of military modernization,” is still at least two decades behind the United States in terms of defence capabilities and technology. There is very little evidence that the Chinese military is engaged in an RMA-like overhaul of its organizational or institutional structures. While the Chinese military is certainly acquiring new and better equipment, its RMA-related activities are embryonic and equipment upgrades by themselves do not constitute an RMA. China’s current military buildup is still more indicative of a process of evolutionary, steady-state, and sustaining – rather than disruptive or revolutionary – innovation and change. In conclusion, war in the Asia-Pacific is unlikely but the emergence of East Asia, especially China, will require adjustments by the West, just as Asian societies have had to adjust to Western norms and values during the American century. The challenge for liberal democracies like the United States will be to embark on a course of self-restraint.</strong><br />

<strong>In South Asia, troubling developments are usually intermixed with hopeful signs. While there is considerable potential for China, India, and Pakistan to become enmeshed in an open-ended nuclear competition, there are also moderating factors within each country that could mitigate negative effects. To begin with, all three states have considerable financial constraints or opportunity costs associated with extensive nuclear modernization. Pakistan’s economic forecast is clouded by heavy military expenditures and foreign debt. If Pakistan’s military leaders seek to keep pace with India’s nuclear and missile programs, conventional military capabilities could suffer along with the national economy. While the Pakistani Army’s leadership strongly supports nuclear and missile programs, that support could wane in the future when such funding competes against the Army’s other institutional interests. Even India and China, which could support increased spending for conventional as well as nuclear programs, must seriously consider the opportunity costs of doing so. Although New Delhi’s military budgets spiked after the 1999 high-altitude war with Pakistan, sustained growth in Indian defense spending is a rare occurrence. Chinese defense spending also increased significantly in the 1990s, but a growing economy remains the top priority of Beijing’s leaders. Without it, they face domestic threats far greater than the external problems posed by US ballistic missile defenses. Much of the added defense spending in both China and India goes to improve the rewards of military service and to replace outmoded tanks, planes and ships. The expense of strategic modernization programs must be weighed against these priorities. The Soviet experience of overspending for national defense is clearly within the Chinese field of view. While the scope of China’s strategic modernization efforts would depend greatly on the ambitions US officials attach to missile defense programs, Beijing’s national security imperative would remain constant—to counter missile defenses and to maintain credible deterrence at least cost. As a leading Chinese arms control official has stated, “We will do whatever possible to ensure that our security will not be compromised, and we are confident that we can succeed without an arms race.” The cheapest counter to missile defenses, in this view, is to attack the system’s most vulnerable parts.50 Beijing has had the good sense to avoid nuclear arms racing in the past, and is not likely to alter this behavior in the future. A significant increase in nuclear capabilities would not only complicate China’s relations with India, but also with Japan, Russia, and elsewhere along its periphery. A major buildup in nuclear forces would also badly undercut Beijing’s diplomatic offensive against missile defenses, while empowering the missile defense lobby in the United States. Consequently, if future US administrations do not seek the negation of China’s strategic deterrent, cascade effects on the Subcontinent could be greatly reduced. The relaxed biorhythms of Indian nuclear modernization are also not easy to change, although external shocks, such as Pakistan’s surprise crossing of the Line of Control in 1999, have done so in the past. Nonetheless, a bureaucratic and political culture that prizes the avoidance of decisive decisions does not change overnight.51 In the past, powerful Indian civil servants and defense scientists have been loathe to share confidences with military leaders. This, too, has begun to change. Operational and command and control imperatives will require India to confront difficult issues of civil-military relations. Moreover, nuclear issues are politicized in India’s hyper-democracy, another constraint on pacing. The Vajpayee government did not take the Congress Party and other opposition groups into confidence before deciding to test nuclear weapons, and they in turn do not feel beholden to support all aspects of the Vajpayee government’s nuclear agenda. India’s relaxed biorhythms have already quickened somewhat, but the deliberative pace of consequential Indian decision-making remains an important moderating factor. The public declarations of national leaders also constrain pacing, at least in a notional fashion. China doesn’t deign to compete with India, and India doesn’t deign to compete with Pakistan, at least in official statements. Public pronouncements could well be proven false, but they at least provide an opportunity to realize stability through asymmetry in the difficult passage ahead. Moreover, India’s status-consciousness could work in positive as well as negative ways. New Delhi appears determined to demonstrate a far superior wisdom on nuclear matters than that evidenced during the Cold War. In particular, Indian strategists stress the importance of reassurance and affirmation of national pledges not to use nuclear weapons first against nuclear-armed opponents, and not to use them at all against nonnuclearweapon states. India certainly has the strategic depth to maintain its nuclear holdings in a relaxed status and to take other steps clarifying a non-threatening posture. New Delhi has already taken positive steps in this regard. Senior Indian officials have publicly rejected “nuclear war fighting” strategies and requirements. Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh explicitly undercut the draft Indian nuclear doctrine’s requirements for prompt retaliatory capabilities noting, “[W]e would like to convey a sense of assurance in our region, also beyond, so that our deployment posture is not perceived as destabilizing. We have rejected notions of ‘launch on warning postures’ that lead to maintaining hair trigger alerts, thus increasing the risks of an unauthorized launch.”52 Government officials in India have also repeatedly stated that they intend to demonstrate their commitment to a nofirstuse pledge through operational practices. In this regard, some short-range Prithvi missiles were moved from storage cites in central India to the border area near Pakistan in 1997, but were subsequently moved back.53 This singular step is unlikely to be comforting to Pakistan, given the relative ease with which short-range missiles could be shuttled back to strike locations, as was reported in the war scare following the December 2001 attack on India’s Parliament.54 While crisis stability remains problematic in South Asia, in peacetime, New Delhi could provide reassurance to Pakistan, moderating their strategic competition and providing a model for others to follow.</strong><br />

<strong>For this is not the first time we have faced widespread projections of a coming &quot;second nuclear age.&quot; The 1960s era US government and other estimates foresaw between fifteen and twenty-five nuclear weapons states by the end of the 1970s; 1970s era estimates foresaw as many as thirty-five nuclear weapons states by the end of the 1980s; the early 1990s betting line was that at least Germany and Japan and possibly many more states would soon join the nuclear weapons &quot;club.</strong>1 Such forecasts even supposedly optimistic ones have proved too pessimistic. In spite of the breathless reporting about new uranium enrichment or fuel reprocessing capacities, it must be emphasized that the basic pattern in the history of nuclear proliferation to this point is the small number of nuclear weapons states, as compared to the large number of states capable of building those weapons. The expansion of nuclear technological capacities that previous generations feared has indeed occurred, but the expected realization of their military potential has not followed. Today, although nuclear technology is decidedly old technology and ex-Soviet scientists and fissile material have been on the market for over a decade,'1 to the best of our knowledge fewer than ten states actually have the bomb. These are the United States (first nuclear weapons test 1945); Russia (1949); Great Britain (1952); France (1960); China (1964); India (&quot;peaceful nuclear explosion'1 1974; first official nuclear weapons test 1998); Pakistan (1998); plus almost certainly Israel (likely test 1979), and possibly North Korea (no test yet).5 Figure 1.1 offers a rough picture of the evolution in the numbers of actual and potential nuclear weapons states over time, adapted from work by Stephen Meyer and Richard Stoll on states* latent nuclear capabilities.u The figure reports their data at five-year intervals.' This yawning gap between technical potential and military reality should have led to widespread rethinking of the phenomenon of nuclear weapons proliferation. To a surprising extent it has not. Much of the proliferation literature continues to focus its attention primarily on the &quot;supply-side&quot; issue of the growth of technical capacities. Volumes with titles like How Nuclear Weapons Spread are devoted entirely to analyses of the technological similarities between civilian and military nuclear programs.8 Such a focus on technical capacity leads many proliferation specialists to persist in foretelling &quot;life in a nuclear-armed crowd&quot; a quarter-century after Albert Wohlstetter coined the phrase.&quot; Indeed, William Arkin has aptly labeled the study of proliferation &quot;the sky-is-still-falling profession.&quot;10 This is not to claim that all of the current literature is in denial about the gap between technical potential and military reality. Indeed, awareness of that gap has produced soaring evaluations of the past effectiveness of the &quot;non-proliferation regime&quot; and its centerpiece, the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The rising reputation of the regime over the past two decades has been especially noticeable in academic writing on international relations. Scholars working within all three major international relations paradigms - realists, institutionalists, and constructivists - have pointed to the regime as an essential dam holding back the tide of nuclear proliferation: • Realists stress that the regime provides a framework for joint great power application of export controls, technical safeguards agreements, and other supply-side means of blocking states from acquiring and applying nuclear know-how.11 • Neo-liberal institutionalists stress that the regime offers states a functional means to escape the presumed proliferation &quot;prisoner's dilemma&quot; by giving them the assurance that their rivals are also keeping their nuclear powder dry.12 • Finally, constructivists stress that the regime has contributed to a &quot;nuclear taboo,&quot; an international normative prohibition on the use of nuclear weapons, which has reduced their utility, tarnished their image, and thus diminished their attractiveness.13 The non-proliferation regime has made a difference. Careful case study research on various countries’ nuclear histories has detailed the regime’s role in easing many of them further down the nuclear weaponsfree path.14 Therefore, the mounting evidence that the regime today is encountering increasing political and technical difficulties is a matter of no little concern. But this begs the real question: has the regime caused states that otherwise would have decided to acquire nuclear weapons not to do so, or has it simply reinforced the non-proliferation commitments of already abstaining states? The chorus of praise for the regime implicitly suggests that without it the world would today be home to a “nuclear-armed crowd.” But in fact there is much reason to doubt this counterfactual about the regime’s impact. First of all, if the regime were indeed the key to containing proliferation, then proliferation should have been rampant before the regime became a real factor in states’ calculations, in the mid-1970s. Yet as Figure 1.1 shows, already then there was a wide gap between the numbers of nuclearcapable and nuclear weapons states. So, according to the very logic of those who take a “strong” view of the regime’s success, by the time the regime was finally built, it should have been too late to prevent widespread proliferation. Second, if the regime were so crucial, then recent proliferation should have been limited to “rogue states” that do not worry about their position in international society. Such states, not surprisingly, have been the focus of most policymakers’ proliferation worries.15 But, in fact, the list of nuclear weapons states is no rogues’ gallery, and two of the youngest nuclear powers, India and Pakistan, are widely internationally recognized states whose ultimate choices for the bomb were even made by democratically elected leaders. Third, for the regime to play the key role that has been ascribed to it, it would have to have created stable expectations among states that it would last. But, in fact, the regime’s survivability is regularly called into question, with the regime’s proponents often the loudest doubters of all. Not only have they viewed all sorts of actions around the world, such as India’s and Pakistan’s 1998 tests, as potential mortal blows to the cause of non-proliferation; they also see various types of inaction, such as the continuing maintenance of large arsenals by the nuclear powers, as equally dangerous to the regime.16 Given this generalized perception of the regime’s weakness in the policy world (which stands in stark contrast to its glimmering academic reputation), it is hard to buy into the notion that it provides states with the stable expectations they crave. Finally, if the regime is widely perceived as brittle, those who know it best equally perceive it as hollow. Close analysis of the regime’s actual operation finds a set of ambiguous and erratically enforced rules, myriad technical loopholes, and underfunded international agencies. For one thing, until recently international inspections were only carried out at declared nuclear facilities.17 The case of pre-1991 Iraq shows how easily a determined state could hide the true extent of its nuclear program.18 Since the possibilities for cheating have been so wide open, the existence of the regime could hardly have reassured any states that were prone to doubt the good faith of their peers. Thus, if this really were a prisoner’s dilemma type situation, they should have cheated and gone nuclear themselves. But instead, the vast majority of states have not “defected” from the regime. In short, for all its utility, the non-proliferation regime simply cannot support the explanatory weight that it has been asked to bear. What, then, accounts for the slow pace of proliferation? This book suggests that the answer lies less in external efforts to stop states from going nuclear, and more in the hearts of state leaders themselves. It argues that, in fact, contrary to the conventional wisdom, most state leaders are not sorely tempted by the prospect of “going nuclear.” Rather, state leaders tend to lack sufficient levels of motivation and/or certitude to catapult their states into a new and dangerous world of nuclear deterrence. In short, the non-proliferation regime has appeared to be a dramatic success because few state leaders have desired the things it prohibits.19 <br />

China's efforts to develop MRV and MIRV technology date back to the early 1980s. In September 1981, China successfully delivered three satellites with one launch vehicle: two satellites were delivered in the nose cone and one was delivered during stage separation. This event may have been China's first foray into the area of MRV/MIRV development. Since the mid-1980s, China has reportedly conducted missile flight tests involving MRVs. In addition, beginning in the early 1990s China initiated a nuclear test series which indicated that it is developing a number of new small warheads with higher yield-to-weight ratios possibly for use on multiple warhead land-based missiles. While China is primarily developing these newer, smaller warheads for deployment on its new generation of ballistic missiles, they are also probably part of an effort to provide the PLA with a MRV/MIRV capability. China's MIRV development is further supported by a classified 1996 Air Force National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC) report which states that China has designed an upper rocket stage called the &quot;Smart Dispenser&quot; (SD) for a new space launch vehicle &quot;for the purpose of accurate and simultaneous deployment in orbit of two US-made Iridium mobile telecommunications satellites.&quot; The report concluded that &quot;a minimally modified SD stage could be used to deploy multiple reentry vehicles (RVs)&quot; and that &quot;the SD stage can be considered a 'technology bridge' to a viable post- boost vehicle (PBV).&quot; The SD could be modified for use on DF-4 and DF-5. [Bill Gertz, Betrayal, Washington DC: Regnery Publishers, 1999, p.251-254.] China is also developing penetration aids in addition to MRV/MIRV technology. Another classified 1996 NAIC report states that the DF-31 will quite likely feature the use of penetration aids such as decoys or chaff and an improved solid propellant and that China has probably &quot;reemphasized accuracy and defense penetration as primary goals for its developmental ballistic missiles.&quot; This was evidenced by two probable tests of decoys on a CSS-5 Mod 2 on 10 November 1995 and a CSS-5 Mod 1 on 10 January 1996. This report was confirmed by the 2 August 1999 DF-31 launch. A classified NAIC report revealed that during the 1999 test an undetermined number of decoys decoupled from the primary warhead and &quot;spread out in different<br />

Since 11 September, the Bush administration has taken important steps to engage with China, with more regular consultations, including talks in Beijing on strategic security, multilateral arms control and non-proliferation. The administration has also resumed bilateral Defense Consultation Talks (DCT) high-level meetings that formalize a schedule of military-to-military exchanges. Although difficult issues remain, for instance, over trade relations and export control, Beijing has opted to try to stabilize bilateral ties rather than focusing on particular areas of dispute» For China, the key priority is domestic economic development, and so the country’s foreign policy has been geared towards fostering the stable relations conducive to further growth» Moreover, as one Chinese security expert has noted, ‘after 9/11, China realized that the US was too strong to oppose in all senses — politically, militarily, economically’.33 The primacy of stable Sino-American relations can also be attributed to a desire to be an effective mediator in the unfolding crisis on the Korean Peninsula, which touches very directly on China’s security interests. The collapse of the Kim Jong Il regime in North Korea could bring US troops based in South Korea right up to the China—Korea border; chaos stemming from massive economic dislocation could see a flood of North Korean refugees into China; and the political—military balance in northeast Asia could shift.” There are thus concerns in China that a North Korean collapse would be detrimental to the country’s security.43 As such, it seems that the Chinese have little choice but to take a low-key approach even on political issues where they may be at a disadvantage. Even on the issue of BMD, where Chinese suspicions are strong and alive, Beijing seems unwilling to alter the more cooperative posture it adopted vis-à-vis Washington after 11 September. <br />

Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo held an unofficial meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Saturday evening in Sanya, a city of southern China's island province of Hainan. The two sides exchanged views on Sino-U.S. relations and issues of common concern in a &quot;candid and friendly&quot; manner, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said after the meeting. According to the ministry, Dai and Clinton had positive evaluation of recent Sino-U.S. relations, and stressed the two sides would continue to seriously implement the consensus reached by the two state leaders. They pledged to enhance dialogue, mutual trust and cooperation, properly handle differences and sensitive issues on the basis of mutual respect, and make concerted efforts to contribute to a positive, cooperative and comprehensive China-U.S. relationship in the 21st Century. They also agreed that Chinese President Hu Jintao's scheduled visit to the United States early next year is of great significance to the development of bilateral ties, and the two sides would keep close contact and make preparations to create favorable atmosphere and ensure the success of the visit. <br />

At a time of tension in U.S.-China relations, a three-day visit by senior U.S. officials to Beijing began Monday with signs that Chinese leaders want to smooth over some key frictions. &quot;Sound&quot; and &quot;stable&quot; was how a top Communist Party official described the two countries' relationship while receiving the U.S. delegation, which included National Economic Council Director Lawrence H. Summers and deputy national security adviser Thomas Donilon. The meeting comes after the U.S.-China relationship has been battered on several fronts. The United States has fought with China during the past few months over China's trade surplus and currency valuation, with little to show for it. U.S.-South Korea military exercises near the Chinese coast have incensed Chinese officials, as did President Obama's meeting with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and a U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, both of which happened earlier this year. Rhetoric on both sides has ratcheted up in recent weeks on national security issues - with China's state-owned party papers denouncing U.S. interference in South China Sea issues, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton responding in July at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting that the area is part of her country's &quot;national interest,&quot; which set off more fuming in party papers. On Monday, both sides expressed hope that meetings between U.S. and Chinese officials scheduled in coming weeks may help thaw some of the recent difficulties. &quot;Although there were some disturbances in China-U.S. relations, in April and May after President Obama and President Hu Jintao had two meetings, our relations have gotten back on a sound track,&quot; Li Yuanchao, head of the section in the Chinese government that oversees senior party appointments, said before the closed-door talks began. Later Monday, according to the Associated Press, Summers told Vice Premier Wang Qishan that Obama &quot;has emphasized for us the importance he attaches to a very strong relationship between the United Sates and China.&quot; Among this visit's top issues, Summers added, is setting up a trip for Hu to Washington. Still to come in the next few months are Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's visit in a few weeks to the U.N. General Assembly in New York, a meeting of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade and the Group of 20 summit, where additional China-U.S. talks may occur. Hu is likely to visit the United States in January. Some of the most pressing issues in this week's meetings involve the Korean Peninsula, said Shi Yinhong, an international studies professor at Beijing's Renmin University. There have been icy feelings all around, he said, since the Cheonan, a warship belonging to U.S. ally South Korea, was sunk near the border of China's ally, North Korea. &quot;Neither China nor the U.S. wants to make a concession on this,&quot; Shi said, &quot;but the two countries also don't seem to want the relationship to deteriorate again.&quot;<br />

The impact of greater U.S. military vulnerability on U.S. and Chinese behavior may rest somewhat on the balance of vulnerability at the strategic, operational, and weapons system levels. At the strategic level, factors such as extensive economic interdependence, the importance of Sino-U.S. relations for regional and global stability, and the potential for nuclear escalation mean that a major U.S.-China military conflict would impose high absolute costs and risks on both countries, regardless of the eventual military outcome. The high absolute costs of a conflict to both sides will likely dwarf considerations about who would suffer more, making leaders in Washington and Beijing cautious and extremely reluctant to authorize the use of force in situations that might escalate into a broader war. These considerations do not make war impossible, but they are likely to produce more restrained behavior and may dampen competitive military dynamics to some degree. <br />

MODELING THE UNTHINKABLE To illustrate the growth in U.S. counterforce capabilities, we applied a set of simple formulas that analysts have used for decades to estimate the effectiveness of counterforce attacks. We modeled a U.S. strike on a small target set: 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in hardened silos, the approximate size of China's current long-range, silo-based missile force. The analysis compared the capabilities of a 1985 Minuteman ICBM to those of a modern Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile. [The technical details of the analysis presented in this essay are available online [2].] In 1985, a single U.S. ICBM warhead had less than a 60 percent chance of destroying a typical silo. Even if four or five additional warheads were used, the cumulative odds of destroying the silo would never exceed 90 percent because of the problem of &quot;fratricide,&quot; whereby incoming warheads destroy each other. Beyond five warheads, adding more does no good. A probability of 90 percent might sound high, but it falls far short if the goal is to completely disarm an enemy: with a 90 percent chance of destroying each target, the odds of destroying all 20 are roughly 12 percent. In 1985, then, a U.S. ICBM attack had little chance of destroying even a small enemy nuclear arsenal. Today, a multiple-warhead attack on a single silo using a Trident II missile would have a roughly 99 percent chance of destroying it, and the probability that a barrage would destroy all 20 targets is well above 95 percent. Given the accuracy of the U.S. military's current delivery systems, the only question is target identification: silos that can be found can be destroyed. During the Cold War, the United States worked hard to pinpoint Soviet nuclear forces, with great success. Locating potential adversaries' small nuclear arsenals is undoubtedly a top priority for U.S. intelligence today. The revolution in accuracy is producing an even more momentous change: it is becoming possible for the United States to conduct low-yield nuclear counterforce strikes that inflict relatively few casualties. A U.S. Department of Defense computer model, called the Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability (HPAC), estimates the dispersion of deadly radioactive fallout in a given region after a nuclear detonation. The software uses the warhead's explosive power, the height of the burst, and data about local weather and demographics to estimate how much fallout would be generated, where it would blow, and how many people it would injure or kill. HPAC results can be chilling. In 2006, a team of nuclear weapons analysts from the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) used HPAC to estimate the consequences of a U.S. nuclear attack using high-yield warheads against China's ICBM field. Even though China's silos are located in the countryside, the model predicted that the fallout would blow over a large area, killing 3-4 million people. U.S. counterforce capabilities were useless, the study implied, because even a limited strike would kill an unconscionable number of civilians. But the United States can already conduct nuclear counterforce strikes at a tiny fraction of the human devastation that the FAS/NRDC study predicted, and small additional improvements to the U.S. force could dramatically reduce the potential collateral damage even further. The United States' nuclear weapons are now so accurate that it can conduct successful counterforce attacks using the smallest-yield warheads in the arsenal, rather than the huge warheads that the FAS/NRDC simulation modeled. And to further reduce the fallout, the weapons can be set to detonate as airbursts, which would allow most of the radiation to dissipate in the upper atmosphere. We ran multiple HPAC scenarios against the identical target set used in the FAS/NRDC study but modeled low-yield airbursts rather than high-yield groundbursts. The fatality estimates plunged from 3-4 million to less than 700 -- a figure comparable to the number of civilians reportedly killed since 2006 in Pakistan by U.S. drone strikes. One should be skeptical about the results of any model that depends on unpredictable factors, such as wind speed and direction. But in the scenarios we modeled, the area of lethal fallout was so small that very few civilians would have become ill or died, regardless of which way the wind blew. Critics may cringe at this analysis. Many of them, understandably, say that nuclear weapons are -- and should remain -- unusable. But if the United States is to retain these weapons for the purpose of deterring nuclear attacks, it needs a force that gives U.S. leaders retaliatory options they might actually employ. If the only retaliatory option entails killing millions of civilians, then the U.S. deterrent will lack credibility. Giving U.S. leaders alternatives that do not target civilians is both wise and just. A counterforce attack -- whether using conventional munitions or low- or high-yield nuclear weapons -- would be fraught with peril. Even a small possibility of a single enemy warhead's surviving such a strike would undoubtedly give any U.S. leader great pause. But in the midst of a conventional war, if an enemy were using nuclear threats or limited nuclear attacks to try to coerce the United States or its allies, these would be the capabilities that would give a U.S. president real options.<br />

<br />
On 27 November 2006 when an exo-atmospheric hypersonic interceptor missile successfully destroyed an “enemy” Prithvi missile at an altitude of 40-50 km, India made a breakthrough in anti-ballistic missile technologies and it heralded the entry of the country into an elite club of countries possessing this capability. India has an ambitious plan to put in place a robust multi-layered ballistic missile defense system to intercept incoming ballistic missiles. Though the offensive missile program has suffered serious setbacks and inordinate delays, with the lessons learnt from them, India’s plan to field a credible ballistic missile defense are steadily taking shape and it has made significant strides in this direction with three consecutive successful interceptor tests. Background In the 90’s after Pakistan acquired missiles from China and North Korea, India procured some S-300 missile batteries from Russia to protect important cities. After the 1998 nuclear tests and Pakistan’s quid pro quo response, India felt the need for a more elaborate missile shield and initially evinced interest in acquiring Israel’s Arrow II BMD, but it required consent from the US which partly funded and co-developed it and Washington, not keen to be looked at as altering the balance of power in the region, blocked the transfer. Once again technology denial turned into a boon as it boosted indigenous development. The project to build a BMD is believed to have been initiated in 1999 after the Kargil conflict to counter Pakistan’s offensive missile overtures and its non adherence to no-first-use of nuclear weapons but was kept under wraps and acknowledged only in 2006 after the successful first test. With this success India became only the fourth country after the US, Russia and Israel to have built an effective anti-ballistic missile shield. Development Indian offensive missile program initiated under IGMDP (Integrated Guided missile Development Program) suffered serious setbacks with its Prithvi and Agni series of missiles in development, integration and launches and in fact is still grappling with launch failures with the overall success rate being less than 50 percent but which is not uncommon with such developments. The learning curve seems to be paying dividends now as is witnessed in the swift development of BMD. The entire system involves detection, tracking and interception of the incoming missile involving multiple platforms and requires a fair amount of precision and sophistication. India intends to deploy a two tier system consisting of Prithvi air defense missile (PAD) for high altitude interception and advanced air defense missile (AAD) for lower altitude interception which will be able to take out missiles with ranges upto 5000kms. The deployed system would consist of many launch vehicles, radars, Launch Control Centers (LCC) and the Mission Control Center (MCC). All these are geographically distributed and connected by a secure communication network. DRDO with Israeli cooperation developed Swordfish – a long range tracking radar (LRTR) specifically for the BMD based on Israel’s Green pine radar which incidentally is part of the Arrow-II system. It is the target acquisition and fire control radar for the BMD system. The LRTR has a radius of 800km and it’s been reported that it can track objects as small as a cricket ball. DRDO plans to enhance its range to 1500km by 2011, a requirement for Phase II system. PAD was tested in November 2006, followed by AAD in December 2007 and a third test in March 2009. The 2009 test is the third successful consecutive tests in recent years, and indicates a promising future for the indigenous BMD system. India’s first test demonstrated the system’s ability to intercept an incoming Prithvi-II missile at an altitude of 48 km with a two-stage PAD interceptor christened ‘Pradyumna’; the second test saw a successful intercept of a Prithvi-II at 15km by a single-stage interceptor; the third and most recent test demonstrated the capability of a new and more sophisticated Pradyumna to destroy its target at an altitude of 75 km. . These tests assume significance for the success rate, speed and technological sophistication (the US interceptor tests courted multiple failures). The PAD is a modified prithvi missile while the AAD is a completely new missile. The project is being taken up in two phases: Phase I to intercept missiles with a range of upto 2000kms to be operationalized and deployed by 2012 and Phase II to intercept IRBM/ICBM’s (intermediate range ballistic missiles/inter-continental ballistic missiles) to be developed after phase I is complete. The Prithvi Air Defense (PAD) is an anti-ballistic missile developed to intercept incoming ballistic missiles outside the atmosphere (exo-atmospheric). Based on the Prithvi missile, PAD christened Pradyumna is a two stage missile with a maximum interception altitude of 80 km. Advanced Air Defense (AAD) is an anti-ballistic missile designed to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in the endo-atmosphere at an altitude of 15-30 km. Buoyed by recent successes DRDO is accelerating the pace of development of the BMD. Finally, with all the previous failures acting as a stepping stone and learning valuables lessons from them, India’s technological prowess has come to the fore and this gives a new confidence and boost to other projects hanging in limbo and some of them can incorporate the technologies developed for this project. <br />

China won’t freak out in response to BMD <br />

<br />
Beijing’s anti-NMD positions have undergone a noticeable change since mid-2001. Its reaction to the U.S. announcement of withdrawal from the AEM Treaty was moderate. Chinese response to the December 17, 2002, missile defense deployment announcement was typical of the adjusted position: “The development of the missile defense system should not undermine global strategic stability, nor should it undermine international and regional security.” Indeed. Chinese officials now comment that international efforts must be expended to develop a new strategic framework and emphasize that China and the United States share important common interests in maintaining global peace. Instead of arguing how U.S. missile defense would lead to instability and even an arms race, the official Chinese statement on missile defense issues now reads: “Under [the] current situation, it is crucial and in the interests of all countries to maintain global strategic stability and preserve international regimes of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation. China is willing to engage in constructive dialogues with all parties concerned to maintain international peace and security through joint efforts.”113 What explains this dramatic shift in public positions? There are three important variables. The first is the Russian factor. Beijing realized that notwithstanding all the talk about a strategic partnership between China and Russia, important differences existed between the two countries in terms of near- term policy priorities and longer- term strategic interests. Given Russia’s relatively weak position, it was both unrealistic and unreasonable to expect that it could sustain a confrontation with the United States on strategic nuclear, ABM, and NMD issues.4 Indeed, since September 11, Russia’s positions on these issues have shown clear signs of softening and retreat. Obviously, China’s hope of sustaining a Sino Russian united front would also unravel because of China’s and Russia’s different priorities and fundamental interests.5 The Moscow Treaty and the new strategic partnership between Russia and the United States undercut Chinese hope for a united front against missile defense. Once the new strategic cooperation takes shape, Russia may act on the idea of developing joint missile defenses with the United States. Potential use of Russian technology is reportedly being studied. The second variable is Beijing’s careful consideration of missile defense issues and the broader Sino-US. bilateral relationship. In a way, Russia’s change of positions left China with no choice but to acquiesce in the development. The Chinese leadership came to a realistic assessment of the prospects of sustaining a prolonged fight against missile defenses and doing it alone without seriously and negatively affecting Sino-U.S. relations. Continued confrontation with the United States would not dissuade U.S. determination to discard the ABM Treaty and pursue missile defense. Instead, it would further strain a bilateral relationship that had just seen signs of improvement in the wake of the September Ii terrorist attacb.1 Certainly, Beijing considers other more important issues as critical, and a stable bilateral relationship is essential to their management. The realization of the futility of picking a fight with the United States on missile defense issues and the need to stand the moral high ground provide the rationale for China’s toned-down responses and comments. The emphasis is now on the need for international cooperation, including that between Beijing and Washington, to maintain global peace with continued efforts in nonproliferation—not on counterproductive efforts that would tarnish China’s image as a responsible great power. Indeed, Chinese policymakers actually decided to de-link missile defense and Taiwan issues from China’s own responsibilities and obligations in the international nonproliferation regime. As a consequence, the second half of 2002 saw the promulgation of a series of export control regulations. The Bush administration’s efforts to engage China on missile defense—albeit belatedly—constitute the third variable and, ironically, may explain China’s rather restrained responses to both the December 2001 announcement of the ABM withdrawal and the December 2002 decision on initial missile defense deployment. Great power consultation at least offers the opportunity to clarify strategic intent if not to change positions. During the Clinton administration, the need to secure Russian agreement on amendments to the AEM Treaty focused U.S. attention to bringing the Russians on board but largely ignored Chinese concerns. The fact that Washington’s verbal assurance about U.S. missile defenses could not convince Beijing of its true intentions, and the recognition that China would be less likely to cooperate on issues important to U.S. strategic interests, led to limited engagement late in the Clinton administration on some of the issues Beijing raised, in particular the TMD cover age of Taiwan. Although it is still far from receiving the needed reassurance from Washington, Beijing at least is content with the fact that it is now being consulted- That the United States did not sell Taiwan the few critical TMD systems, such as the Aegis system, that most concern China also is an important factor. <br />

<br />
As such, the surge of defense expenditures in East Asia does not add up to an arms race. No country in East Asia wants to see a new geopolitical divide and spiraling tensions in the region. The growing defense expenditures powerfully illuminate the deepening of a regional “security dilemma,” whereby the “defensive” actions taken by one country are perceived as “offensive” by another country, which in turn takes its own “defensive” actions that the first country deems “offensive.” As long as the region doesn’t split into rival blocs, however, an arms race will not ensue. What is happening in East Asia is the extension of what Robert Hartfiel and Brian Job call “competitive arms processes.” The history of the cold war is telling in this regard. Arm races occur between great-power rivals only if the rivalry is doomed to intensify. The perceived tensions in the region do not automatically translate into consistent and lasting increases in military spending. Even declared budget increases are reversible. Taiwan’s defense budget for fiscal year 2010, for instance, will fall 9 percent. This is a convincing case of how domestic constraints can reverse a government decision to increase the defense budget. Australia’s twenty-year plan to increase the defense budget could change with a domestic economic contraction or if a new party comes to power. China’s two-digit increase in its military budget might vanish one day if the type of regime changes or the high rate of economic growth slows. Without a geopolitical split or a significant great-power rivalry, military budget increases will not likely evolve into “arms races.” The security dilemma alone is not a leading variable in determining the curve of military expenditures. Nor will trends in weapon development and procurement inevitably induce “risk-taking” behavior. Given the stability of the regional security architecture—the combination of U.S.-centered alliance politics and regional, cooperation-based security networking—any power shift in East Asia will hardly upset the overall status quo. China’s military modernization, its determination to “prepare for the worst and hope for the best,” hasn’t yet led to a regional response in military budget increases. In contrast, countries in the region continue to emphasize political and economic engagement with China, though “balancing China” strategies can be found in almost every corner of the region as part of an overall balance-of-power logic. In the last few years, China has taken big strides toward building up asymmetric war capabilities against Taiwan. Beijing also holds to the formula of a peaceful solution of the Taiwan issue except in the case of the island’s de jure declaration of independence. Despite its nascent capability of power projection, China shows no sign that it would coerce Taiwan or become militarily assertive over contentious territorial claims ranging from the Senkaku Islands to the Spratly Islands to the India-China border dispute. <br />

Some people look to China for economic and strategic interests while others still stick to the US. Since, as a human nature, change is not widely acceptable due to the high level of uncertainty. It is therefore logical to say that most of the regional leaders prefer to see the status quo of security architecture in the Asia Pacific Region in which US is the hub of security provision. But it is impossible to preserve the status quo since China needs to strategically outreach to the wider region in order to get necessary resources especially energy and raw materials to maintain her economic growth in the home country. It is understandable that China needs to have stable high economic growth of about 8 percent GDP growth per year for her own economic and political survival. Widening development gap and employment are the two main issues facing China. Without China, the world will not enjoy peace, stability, and development. China is the locomotive of global and regional economic development and contributes to global and regional peace and stability. It is understandable that China is struggling to break the so-called containment strategy imposed by the US since the post Cold War. Whether this tendency can lead to the greater strategic division is still unknown. Nevertheless, many observers agree that whatever changes may take place, a multi-polar world and multilateralism prevail. The reasons or logics supporting multilateralism are mainly based on the fact that no one country can really address the security issues embedded with international dimension, no one country has the capacity to adapt and adopt to new changes alone, and it needs cooperation and coordination among the nation states and relevant stakeholders including the private sector and civil societies. Large scale interstate war or armed conflict is unthinkable in the region due to the high level of interdependency and democratization. It is believed that economic interdependency can reduce conflicts and prevent war. Democracy can lead to more transparency, accountability, and participation that can reduce collective fears and create more confidence and trust among the people in the region. In addition, globalism and regionalism are taking the center stage of national and foreign policy of many governments in the region except North Korea. The combination of those elements of peace is necessary for peace and stability in the region and those elements are present and being improved in this region. <br />

The puzzle addressed in this article and our explanations of it raise the obvious follow-on question: How will China’s nuclear strategy and forces evolve in the future? Will they continue on their current trajectories or assume new ones? And what are the factors that will influence either possibility? In general, the drivers of China’s future nuclear strategy have two main attributes: they are principally linked to advances in U.S. military capabilities (as opposed to those of other nations) and to U.S. strategic defenses and conventional strike capabilities in addition to the United States’ nuclear forces. More specifically, the PLA’s main concerns about maintaining a credible second-strike force are driven by the U.S. military’s development of a trifecta of non-nuclear strategic capabilities: (1) missile defenses, (2) long-range conventional strike, and (3) sophisticated command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) assets to locate and target China’s nuclear forces. The combination of these three capabilities, in the eyes of the Chinese, provides the United States with the ability to eliminate China’s deterrent in a crisis without crossing the nuclear threshold, reopening the door to U.S. coercion of China. The PLA fears that the United States could use its C4ISR assets to locate Chinese nuclear forces and destroy most of them with long-range conventional strikes. U.S. missile defenses would then allow the United States to “catch” China’s ragged retaliation.129 It is this scenario that motivated the debate about the viability of China’s no-first-use pledge, and it is now motivating multiple dimensions of nuclear and missile procurement addressed above. As China’s nuclear strategy and forces evolve, an important consideration is that the Second Artillery does not determine either one. Instead, it represents only one of a growing number of voices in internal discussions on nuclear issues. Moreover, the influence of the Second Artillery in these debates, including those related to the size of China’s nuclear forces, is unclear. For decades, nuclear strategy and doctrine in China has been the purview of the weapons scientists who developed China’s nuclear and missile capabilities by dint of their positions both within the PLA as well as within China’s military research [End Page 83] and development complex.130 Based on Mao’s and Deng’s views on the limited utility of nuclear weapons, these military scientists made recommendations about the capabilities China should pursue. In the last ten to fifteen years, this appears to have changed, a bit. The PLA has begun to play a larger role in internal discussions about China’s nuclear strategy by virtue of several factors: its accumulated expertise on military doctrine, its successful renovation of overall PLA doctrine, its greater role in defense procurement (following key reforms in the late 1990s), its greater professionalization, and a changed political environment that has allowed discussion of such sensitive topics. As a result, the PLA increasingly has a voice in such issues. The Second Artillery, however, is one voice within a broader collection of PLA strategists and operators, including those in the General Staff Department and in the General Armaments Department (responsible for procurement for the entire PLA). So, the Second Artillery likely may advance recommendations about changes in doctrine and capabilities (including changes in capabilities that have a direct impact on doctrine), but these issues are ultimately decided at the national level of the civilian leadership, in which actors outside of the PLA have a strong voice, including the scientific establishment, civilian experts, and the ministry of foreign affairs. Even though more debate is likely, the increased number of actors involved in decisions about China’s overall nuclear posture creates an additional barrier to building a consensus around a rapid and significant shift from its current strategy and force structure. Looking forward, this situation suggests that two aspects of modernization should be monitored, as they might signal a change in China’s nuclear posture. First, in response to missile defense programs in the United States and other countries, the Second Artillery is researching and developing a variety of technologies to defeat such systems, including maneuvering reentry vehicles (MaRVs), multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles (MIRVs), decoys, chaff, jamming, thermal shielding, and ASAT weapons.131 If deployed, MaRV and MIRV warheads could affect China’s strategic relationships with other nuclear powers by increasing the options available to China for using its nuclear weapons, including providing it with additional options against smaller nuclear powers such as India. This shift could undermine strategic stability in China’s relationships with India and Russia because MIRV’d missiles, in particular, have a first-strike potential. Arming the silo-based missiles such as the DF-5 with MIRV’d warheads might also further undermine crisis stability by [End Page 84] presenting a potentially vulnerable target for an opponent’s first strike against China.132<br />

China's efforts to develop MRV and MIRV technology date back to the early 1980s. In September 1981, China successfully delivered three satellites with one launch vehicle: two satellites were delivered in the nose cone and one was delivered during stage separation. This event may have been China's first foray into the area of MRV/MIRV development. Since the mid-1980s, China has reportedly conducted missile flight tests involving MRVs. In addition, beginning in the early 1990s China initiated a nuclear test series which indicated that it is developing a number of new small warheads with higher yield-to-weight ratios possibly for use on multiple warhead land-based missiles. While China is primarily developing these newer, smaller warheads for deployment on its new generation of ballistic missiles, they are also probably part of an effort to provide the PLA with a MRV/MIRV capability. China's MIRV development is further supported by a classified 1996 Air Force National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC) report which states that China has designed an upper rocket stage called the &quot;Smart Dispenser&quot; (SD) for a new space launch vehicle &quot;for the purpose of accurate and simultaneous deployment in orbit of two US-made Iridium mobile telecommunications satellites.&quot; The report concluded that &quot;a minimally modified SD stage could be used to deploy multiple reentry vehicles (RVs)&quot; and that &quot;the SD stage can be considered a 'technology bridge' to a viable post- boost vehicle (PBV).&quot; The SD could be modified for use on DF-4 and DF-5. [Bill Gertz, Betrayal, Washington DC: Regnery Publishers, 1999, p.251-254.] China is also developing penetration aids in addition to MRV/MIRV technology. Another classified 1996 NAIC report states that the DF-31 will quite likely feature the use of penetration aids such as decoys or chaff and an improved solid propellant and that China has probably &quot;reemphasized accuracy and defense penetration as primary goals for its developmental ballistic missiles.&quot; This was evidenced by two probable tests of decoys on a CSS-5 Mod 2 on 10 November 1995 and a CSS-5 Mod 1 on 10 January 1996. This report was confirmed by the 2 August 1999 DF-31 launch. A classified NAIC report revealed that during the 1999 test an undetermined number of decoys decoupled from the primary warhead and &quot;spread out in different<br />

So far Russia, apart from the United States, is the only other country in the world with a MIRV capability. And China, despite all its astonishing industrial and technological progress, is still believed to be decades away from developing a MIRV capability of its own. <br />

While maintaining that ties with China were on an even keel, India on Thursday was hopeful of amicably settling the border dispute through dialogue. “We have a long border with China and talks are being held between the Special Representatives. We are looking forward to an amicable settlement,” said External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna here on Thursday. The complicated issue was being handled by seasoned diplomats proficient in issues relating to national security, he said in response to a spate of media questions on alleged Chinese intrusions in the eastern and western sections of the Sino-India border. Dialogue with China had helped preserve peace and tranquillity on the border for over two decades and the confidence building measures intended to reduce or eliminate the perception of threat from each other had worked satisfactorily well. “Let me reiterate that India does not view China or its development as a threat. That said, however, we recognise that cooperation and competition can overlap, as it is not possible to have a perfect congruence of interests between two nations as vast and diverse as India and China. Such competition or lack of cooperation must not be misunderstood as antagonism. Our differences, when they exist, must be handled with dialogue and diplomacy,” he said. As the border is not marked, both sides go by perceptions. And there are differences in this, he said, while agreeing with a questioner on the lack of understanding in India about the contours of the relationship.<br />

The first factor that is deemed to heighten nuclear dangers in the case of the two dyads under study is geographical proximity and a history of conflict. Located next to one another and sharing disputed boundaries, it is feared that any major breakout of conventional hostilities between India-Pakistan or India-China could increase the pressures for a pre-emptive strike or a nuclear attack being launched without proper confirmation. Moreover, since the missile flight times would only be between 8-13 minutes for missile ranges of 600-2000 kms, it would not allow either side to even use the hotline (assuming these were functional) to confirm the veracity (deliberate or accidental) or nature (conventional or nuclear) of launch. Haunted by the thought that the country that waited to use its nuclear assets might end up losing them to a disarming first strike would cause near immediate nuclear retaliation engulfing the nations in a mindless nuclear exchange. This assumption, however, is open to question since physical proximity also compels uneasy neighbours to be extra cautious and restrained in their approach on issues as sensitive as the use of nuclear weapons. It may be recalled that the two ideologically divided, but geographically contiguous East and West Germany did live with mobilized militaries and tactical nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert during the long years of the Cold War. These too were uneasy neighbours separated by a bitter ideological divide and the danger of their slipping into a nuclear exchange inadvertently was ever existent. However, the fact that such an eventuality was avoided may be attributed as much to good fortune as to the effort made by both sides to consciously work at maintaining deterrence stability. Kenneth Waltz suggests that caution becomes the defining principle of nuclear-armed powers. 78 And this, in the case of the Cold War protagonists, is believed to have kept nuclear deterrence in place. The same caution was on display between India and Pakistan during the Kargil conflict and Operation Parakram, as explained in the second chapter of this monograph. However, there is a glaring difference in the Indo-Pak relationship that does seem to heighten the nuclear dangers. In fact, Waltz’s conclusion that nuclear powers tend to err on the side of caution, is exploited by Islamabad to foist a provocative sub-conventional conflict on India. It assumes that the presence of nuclear weapons and the associated risk of inadvertent escalation would impose caution on Indian actions, thereby providing it greater room for mischief-making at the lower levels of conflict. To some extent, Pakistan is right in assuming so, because India’s military options are constrained by the presence of nuclear weapons. Even though Kargil demonstrated the types of conventional responses that can still be crafted to foil Pakistan’s designs, the risk of escalation spinning out of control cannot be completely obviated. As it turns out, the India-Pakistan relationship has ended up in a state where the danger of escalation to the nuclear level is highly over-emphasized by Pakistan, even as it is casually dismissed by India. Both positions are compelled by their national interests. But, the truth actually lies somewhere in between and perhaps more likely than not, India and Pakistan do realize the dangers of inadvertent and unwanted nuclear escalation that underlie their behaviour. It is for this reason that Pakistan does not display a wanton abandon in its policy of nuclear brinkmanship. For instance, the total number of terrorists pumped into India at any one particular time has never exceeded 2,500-3000 so as not to breach India’s level of tolerance. 79 Also, Pakistan’s nuclear rhetoric on its low nuclear threshold has mostly been heard during the stages of build-up of a crisis or towards its end. During the period of actual danger of escalation in the midst of a crisis, there is far greater caution in tone and action. 80 Similarly, India’s exercise of caution in responding to Pakistan-fomented terrorism is illustrative of its desire to steer clear of any inadvertent escalation. Both realize the high costs that a nuclear exchange would impose on them. In fact, for all of Pakistan’s nuclear flamboyance and the low threshold bluster, Islamabad does realize that the impact of destruction would be far greater on the state and society of Pakistan, whose recoverability, in terms of dealing with the human and economic disaster of such a scale, would be less than that of India. This should be deterrent enough to force Pakistan to reconsider what possible tangible political gains might be achieved at the cost of risking a nuclear war. Would the loss of Lahore or Karachi be worth the acquisition of Kashmir? In fact, can there ever be any concievable political, military or strategic objective for which a country would resort to the nuclear use in the knowledge that it would be sure to lose some of its own cities? Therefore, as long as rational and reasonable leaderships are in charge of nations (though the measure of their rationality and reasonableness may not exactly match), physical proximity between nations, even when riddled with historical border/territorial conflicts, does not pose an additional danger of nuclear use. Rather, geographical closeness also imposes an additional limitation since a nuclear catastrophe inflicted by one on the other cannot be expected to remain confined in space to only the adversary’s side of the border. Of course, one could well argue that by the time the nations take the extreme decision to use the weapon, they would be well past the stage of being bothered by any effects of radioactive fallout, and more worried instead about the enemy’s nuclear strike. Nevertheless, while thinking about nuclear weapons during ‘crisis-free’ times, this certainly is a variable that weighs on the mind of geographically contiguous nations. Nature of Nuclear Command and Control The second factor that is deemed to increase the prospects of nuclear exchange in the region is the absence of sophisticated, elaborate and well-defined command and control structures of the kind that USA and USSR had established. This, it is feared, could lead to an unintentional nuclear exchange because of an unauthorized nuclear use or deterrence breakdown due to a miscalculation based on faulty or inadequate intelligence. None of the three countries has elaborate surveillance and early warning systems of the kind that the superpowers flaunted. China, of course, has had a nuclear command and control in place since the late 1960s, but India and Pakistan have relatively nascent command structures that are acquiring organizational clarity only now and other necessary infra structural paraphernalia such as hardened national command posts or secure and robust communication lines. However, it will be imprudent to presume greater dangers merely on the basis of a superficial comparison of the C2. Rather, it must be pointed out that the kinds of structures needed in this region need not be compared with the elaborate ones that have existed in the case of the Superpowers, since the requirements and status of nuclear weapons vary according to contexts. The command and control of USA and USSR were based on the need for a highspeed response to a nuclear attack, given the hair trigger alert (launch-on-warning and launchunder-attack levels of alert) at which the arsenals were maintained. In the case of the three countries of this region, the nuclear arsenals do not even exist in a ready-to-use state. Therefore, the question of launch on warning (LOW)/launch under attack (LUA) and the attendant processes do not apply. Consequently, the demands on the command and control structures are also proportionately reduced. Furthermore, pre-delegation of launch authority of the kind that was normal in the Superpowers is not known to have been undertaken in the three countries. In any case, none of them yet has an operational SSBN that presupposes a ready weapon and pre-delegated authority to launch. This certainly is a challenge that will emerge in the next decade and beyond. As China and India begin regular patrols with submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) on board, some changes in their national C2 will become necessary. For the time being though, the nuclear C2 structure in these nations can afford to be far more assertive than the Superpower models ever were. To that extent, the present state of the arsenal, existing in a disassembled form, lessens the dangers of inadvertent or accidental use of nuclear weapons. In fact, in the case of the nations in this region, deterrence stability is premised on the “technological backwardness of the nuclear weapons infrastructure on both sides.” 81 Factors such as lack of satellite monitoring capability, lack of knowledge of the opponent’s nuclear weapons, a recessed posture, lack of missiles of sufficient range and accuracy, so on and so forth reduce the chances of any nation being able to carry out a first strike on another. And this provides reassurance that enough retaliatory capability would be available for launching a punitive counter attack. Yet another factor that relieves pressure on nuclear C2 in these second tier states, especially in the case of India and China, is their declared no-first-use doctrine. The American nuclear strategy has been largely shaped by the Pearl Harbour experience and hence always geared to act in a bolt from the blue contingency. Consequently, acting first and maintaining surprise were critical imperatives. Not surprisingly, therefore, Washington subscribed to a LOW/LUA postures. This was done in the belief that unless the US was able to undertake a preemptive/surprise strike, it stood little chance of being able to destroy all Soviet targets as required by its war plan. And minimizing, if not completely eliminating, the enemy’s second strike capability was the primary task of the first strike, and hence the need for ever increasing numbers of warheads. NATO too adopted a first use doctrine to deter Soviet conventional might, a logic that Pakistan now uses in support of its nuclear doctrine of first use against India. The Soviet Union, similarly, relied on its capacity to mount pre-emptive attacks. And, to undertake pre-emption, both sides built up large, ready, counter-force capabilities supported by a huge infra structure in the form of C3I, early warning systems, so on and so forth. An NFU posture, on the other hand, removes the need for any of these. In fact, for deterrence to be credible with a no-first-use doctrine, it would only be necessary to have available all the relevant nuclear assets, though dispersed, as unassembled nuclear warheads under civilian control, and dedicated delivery systems kept either in storage or in readiness away from their operational areas—as long as they can be brought together as rapidly as required during a supreme emergency, to carry out assured retaliation. Therefore, by removing the need for retaining nuclear forces on hair trigger alert – a situation not at all conducive to strategic stability given the geographical realities of the neighbourhood – an NFU also reduces the possibility of an accidental nuclear war, based on a gross miscalculation. It also raises the threshold of nuclear war in a crisis situation. <br />

China and India engaged in a heated war of words in October and November, when India permitted the Dalai Lama to visit Tawang - territory in India's northeast over which China lays claim. A little over a month later, the two were coordinating their strategies at the Copenhagen climate summit, signaling there are areas where they can join together. Will conflict or cooperation define the Sino-Indian relationship in the coming decades? While obstacles strew the path to cooperation across the board, the fact that China and India are rising powers in an interdependent world rules out the possibility of all-out conflict. Relations in the past have been far from smooth. Frosty interactions resulting from the 1962 war over their disputed frontier only began to thaw in the 1980s. Delhi and Beijing have come a long way since. The two have signed agreements to maintain peace along their frontier and on guiding principles for current negotiations to settle the dispute. Their armies have even engaged in joint exercises on Chinese and Indian soil. Although tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) erupts from time to time, the chances of all-out war have receded.<br />

First, as useful as treaties are, it is a misconception to see them as a solution. They are effects of nonproliferation, not causes of it. The NPT and CTBT reflect the intent of their adherents to abjure nuclear weapons. To date, the countries considered problematic—those that might acquire nuclear weapons—simply did not join the NPT. (South Africa stayed out while it had a nuclear weapons program and joined when it decided to get rid of it.) Or else they joined and cheated (Iraq and North Korea). The inspection obligations of treaty membership did not reveal or reverse the weapons programs of Iraq and North Korea. Iraq passed International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections, and it was unilateral U.S. intelligence collection, not the IAEA, that detected the illegal North Korean activity. If the NPT or CTBT themselves prevent proliferation, one should be able to name at least one specific country that would have sought nuclear weapons or tested them, but refrained from doing so, or was stopped, because of either treaty. None comes to mind.<br />

<br />
However, this &quot;state of affairs&quot; is not as dangerous as it might seem. The nuclear arsenals of limited nuclear proliferators will be small and, consequently, the command and control organizations that manage those arsenals will be small as well. The small arsenals of limited nuclear proliferators will mitigate against many of the dangers of the highly delegative, 'non-centralized' launch procedures Third World states are likely to use. This will happen in two main ways. First, only a small number of people need be involved in Third World command and control. The superpowers had tens of thousands of nuclear warheads and thousands of nuclear weapons personnel in a variety of deployments organized around numerous nuclear delivery platforms. A state that has, say, fifty nuclear weapons needs at most fifty launch operators and only a handful of group commanders. This has both quantitative and qualitative repercussions. Quantitatively, the very small number of people 'in the loop' greatly diminishes the statistical probability that accidents or human error will result in inappropriate nuclear launches. All else being equal, the chances of finding some guard asleep at some post increases with the number of guards and posts one has to cover. Qualitatively, small numbers makes it possible to centrally train operators, to screen and choose them with exceeding care, 7 and to keep each of them in direct contact with central authorities in times of crises. With very small control communities, there is no need for intermediary commanders. Important information and instructions can get out quickly and directly. Quality control of launch operators and operations is easier. In some part, at least, Third World states can compensate for their lack of sophisticated use-control technology with a more controlled selection of, and more extensive communication with, human operators. Secondly, and relatedly, Third World proliferators will not need to rely on cumbersome standard operating procedures to manage and launch their nuclear weapons. This is because the number of weapons will be so small, and also because the arsenals will be very simple in composition. Third World stares simply will not have that many weapons to keep track of. Third World states will not have the great variety of delivery platforms that the superpowers had (various ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, long range bombers, fighter bombers, missile submarines, nuclear armed ships, nuclear mortars, etc., etc.), or the great number and variety of basing options, and they will not employ the complicated strategies of international basing that the superpowers used. The small and simple arsenals of Third World proliferators will not require highly complex systems to coordinate nuclear activities. This creates two specific organizational advantages. One, small organizations, even if they do rely to some extent of standard operating procedures, can be flexible in times of crisis. As we have discussed, the essential problem of standard operating procedures in nuclear launch processes is that the full range if possible strategic developments cannot be predicted and specified before the fact, and thus responses to them cannot be standardized fully. An unexpected event can lead to 'mismatched' and inappropriate organizational reactions. In complex and extensive command and control organizations, standard operating procedures coordinate great numbers of people at numerous levels of command structure in a great multiplicity of places. If an unexpected event triggers operating procedures leading to what would be an inappropriate nuclear launch, it would be very difficult for central commanders to “get the word out' to everyone involved. The coordination needed to stop launch activity would be at least as complicated as the coordination needed to initiate it, and, depending on the speed of launch processes, there may be less time to accomplish it. However, the small numbers of people involved in nuclear launches and the simplicity of arsenals will make it far easier for Third World leaders to 'get the word out' and reverse launch procedures if necessary. Again, so few will be the numbers of weapons that all launch operators could be contacted directly by central leaders. The programmed triggers of standard operating procedures can be passed over in favor of unscripted, flexible responses based on a limited number of human-to-human communications and confirmations. Two, the smallness and simplicity of Third World command and control organizations will make it easier for leaders to keep track of everything that is going on at any given moment. One of the great dangers of complex organizational procedures is that once one organizational event is triggered—once an alarm is sounded and a programmed response is made—other branches of the organization are likely to be affected as well. This is what Charles Perrow refers to as interactive complexity, 8 and it has been a mainstay in organizational critiques of nuclear command and control s ystems.9 The more complex the organization is, the more likely these secondary effects are, and the less likely they are to be foreseen, noticed, and well-managed. So, for instance, an American commander that gives the order to scramble nuclear bombers over the U.S. as a defensive measure may find that he has unwittingly given the order to scramble bombers in Europe as well. A recall order to the American bombers may overlook the European theater, and nuclear misuse could result. However, when numbers of nuclear weapons can be measured in the dozens rather than the hundreds or thousands, and when deployment of those weapons does not involve multiple theaters and forward based delivery vehicles of numerous types, tight coupling is unlikely to cause unforeseen and unnoticeable organizational events. Other things being equal, it is just a lot easier to know all of what is going on. In short, while Third World states may not have the electronic use-control devices that help ensure that peripheral commanders do nor 'get out of control,' they have other advantages that make the challenge of centralized control easier than it was for the superpowers. The small numbers of personnel and organizational simplicity of launch bureaucracies means that even if a few more people have their fingers on the button than in the case of the superpowers, there will be less of a chance that weapons will be launched without a definite, informed and unambiguous decision to press that button.<br />

<br />
At a time of tension in U.S.-China relations, a three-day visit by senior U.S. officials to Beijing began Monday with signs that Chinese leaders want to smooth over some key frictions. &quot;Sound&quot; and &quot;stable&quot; was how a top Communist Party official described the two countries' relationship while receiving the U.S. delegation, which included National Economic Council Director Lawrence H. Summers and deputy national security adviser Thomas Donilon. The meeting comes after the U.S.-China relationship has been battered on several fronts. The United States has fought with China during the past few months over China's trade surplus and currency valuation, with little to show for it. U.S.-South Korea military exercises near the Chinese coast have incensed Chinese officials, as did President Obama's meeting with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and a U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, both of which happened earlier this year. Rhetoric on both sides has ratcheted up in recent weeks on national security issues - with China's state-owned party papers denouncing U.S. interference in South China Sea issues, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton responding in July at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting that the area is part of her country's &quot;national interest,&quot; which set off more fuming in party papers. On Monday, both sides expressed hope that meetings between U.S. and Chinese officials scheduled in coming weeks may help thaw some of the recent difficulties. &quot;Although there were some disturbances in China-U.S. relations, in April and May after President Obama and President Hu Jintao had two meetings, our relations have gotten back on a sound track,&quot; Li Yuanchao, head of the section in the Chinese government that oversees senior party appointments, said before the closed-door talks began. Later Monday, according to the Associated Press, Summers told Vice Premier Wang Qishan that Obama &quot;has emphasized for us the importance he attaches to a very strong relationship between the United Sates and China.&quot; Among this visit's top issues, Summers added, is setting up a trip for Hu to Washington. Still to come in the next few months are Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's visit in a few weeks to the U.N. General Assembly in New York, a meeting of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade and the Group of 20 summit, where additional China-U.S. talks may occur. Hu is likely to visit the United States in January. Some of the most pressing issues in this week's meetings involve the Korean Peninsula, said Shi Yinhong, an international studies professor at Beijing's Renmin University. There have been icy feelings all around, he said, since the Cheonan, a warship belonging to U.S. ally South Korea, was sunk near the border of China's ally, North Korea. &quot;Neither China nor the U.S. wants to make a concession on this,&quot; Shi said, &quot;but the two countries also don't seem to want the relationship to deteriorate again.&quot;<br />

Recently, some Chinese scholars have expressed concerns that even if U.S. missile defense and conventional global strike systems have little or no real impact on China’s assured second strike capability, they may still give U.S. planners and decision-makers a false sense of superiority, potentially leading to U.S. attempts to coerce China with nuclear threats in a crisis. For example, according to Li Bin and Nie Hongyi, “even though the missile defense system cannot be relied upon in actual warfare it may lead American decision-makers to misjudge by causing them to imagine they already have a more powerful strategic advantage, thus leading them to blindly adopt a nuclear coercion policy” [7]. Similarly, they raise the possibility that even the illusion of “nuclear primacy” could lead to more aggressive behavior on the part of the United States: “some American scholars believe the United States can already rely on a preemptive nuclear strike to completely destroy China’s long-range nuclear weapons, and therefore they maintain that the United States already has the capital to carry out nuclear coercion against China” [8]. The 2010 NPR should help to alleviate some of these concerns.<br />

During his address, Premier Wen said, “The common interest between our two countries far outweighs our differences.” He added, “Our bilateral relationship not only involves the interests of our two people but has gone far beyond bilateral scope to impact whole world. Thus, we don’t have any reason to let our relationship backpedal. We have thousands and tens of thousands of reasons to move forward this relationship.” On the evening before a scheduled meeting with President Obama, Premier Wen addressed a crowd of Western policy and business leaders, delving into issues such as China’s commitment to openness and reform and China’s dedication to peaceful development. He also emphasized the strategic importance of mutual trust, stating, “trust is the very foundation of friendship and cooperation,” and even suggested cross-cultural exchange for young people between the countries. This was Premier Wen’s only speech on U.S.-China relations in his September visit to the U.S. “I was impressed by the comprehensiveness and warmth of Premier Wen’s talk,” said Steve Orlins, President of the The National Committee on U.S.-China Relations. “He spoke for the first ten minutes from the heart and it really was from the heart. And the remainder was a comprehensive overview of what the relationship is and should be.” <br />

The United States and China are to resume military contacts cut off since early 2010 with initial meetings planned for next month in Hawaii, a Pentagon official said Wednesday. Both sides had agreed in talks in Beijing that military maritime talks would be held from October 14-15 in Hawaii, followed by defense talks in Washington later in the year, spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan said. &quot;Both sides agreed that dialogue is essential to build mutual trust and reduce the chances of misunderstanding and miscalculation,&quot; he added in a statement. The announcement came after two days of talks in Beijing by Michael Schiffer, US deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, with Chinese military officials. The two sides agreed that military-to-military relations were &quot;essential to developing a broad, resilient bilateral relationship that is positive in tone, cooperative in nature and comprehensive in scope,&quot; Lapan said. &quot;They also agreed to invigorate discussion on a broad range of topics including ways to improve operational safety for sailors and airmen on both sides, and to expand the scope and deepen the cooperation of our mil-to-mil relationship.&quot;<br />

<br />
American and Chinese officials said all the right things during this summer's inaugural round of their Strategic and Economic Dialogue. President Barack Obama pledged to &quot;forge a path to the future that we seek for our children.&quot; Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo wondered aloud whether America and China can &quot;build better relations despite very different social systems, cultures and histories.&quot; He answered his own question, in English, with a &quot;Yes we can.&quot; They can, but they probably won't. Yes, Mr. Obama will visit China in November. But when it comes to international burden-sharing, Washington is focused on geopolitical headaches while China confines its heavy-lifting to geoeconomic challenges. The two sides have good reason to cooperate, but there's a growing gap between what Washington expects from Beijing and what the Chinese can deliver. Many of the issues that create conflict in U.S.-Chinese relations are well known: an enormous bilateral trade deficit, disputes over the value of China's currency, protections for U.S. intellectual property, the dollar's role as international reserve currency, conflicts over human rights, naval altercations, protectionist threats from both sides, and disagreements over how best to handle North Korea's Kim Jong Il. But there are other, less obvious obstacles to partnership. First, both governments remain largely focused on formidable domestic challenges. Mr. Obama knows his political fortunes depend largely on the resilience of the U.S. economy and its ability to generate jobs. He's occupied for the moment with a high-stakes poker game with lawmakers in his own party over ambitious health-care and energy-reform plans. China's leadership faces competing internal demands from those who want to stimulate the economy toward another round of export-driven growth and others who want to shift quickly toward greater dependence on domestic consumption. Given the trade deficit, Washington would like Beijing to focus on the latter, but China won't move as fast as the U.S. would like, in part because the leadership recognizes that the loss of millions of manufacturing and construction jobs in recent months could fuel further turmoil in a country that already sees tens of thousands of large-scale protests each year. Second, there's the bureaucratic problem. For the past several years, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson chaired a strategic dialogue with Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan. Washington and Beijing have now expanded the scope of talks to include the State Department and China's foreign ministry. Leaving aside the difficulties in building trust between U.S. and Chinese negotiators, State and Treasury don't coordinate well on strategy, and there's no guarantee that China's foreign and finance ministries will work seamlessly together either. The new formula for talks is bureaucratic infighting squared. The third reason the U.S. and China won't build a durable strategic partnership is that Beijing has little appetite for the larger geopolitical role Washington would like it to play. Why should Beijing accept the risks that come with direct involvement in conflicts involving Iran and Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Israelis and Palestinians, Somalia and Sudan, and other sources of potential turmoil? It has more immediate problems at home. On many issues where the U.S. wants China's support—on Iran's nuclear program, for example—Beijing's interests don't coincide with Washington's. Even in East Asia, China has good reason to avoid the heavy lifting on security, because the U.S. naval presence limits the risk that Japan, India, and other states will spend much more money on their militaries. It's not as though Beijing is enjoying a free ride. China's more than $2 trillion in foreign currency reserves gives its leadership enormous clout as international lender of last resort. Its considerable contribution to global stability is mainly in financing Washington's spiraling debt. By righting its own economy, China can be the primary engine of near-term global growth. Isn't that service enough, Chinese officials ask, at a time when economic crises aggravate so many international problems? The one tangible result of this summer's Strategic and Economic dialogue, a &quot;memorandum of understanding&quot; on climate change, reveals the larger problem. It's valuable to have an agreement in principle, but there were no hard choices on the primary bone of contention—carbon emissions. That's a problem that will generate friction in months to come. Whenever U.S. and Chinese officials get together these days, they trigger a new round of speculation that the world's most important bilateral relationship might soon become its most valuable strategic alliance. It's wrong to entirely dismiss the value of effective speeches and positive political symbolism. But as U.S. and Chinese negotiators move from words to work, they're going to be pulling in different directions.<br />

Washington The Air Force will expand the number of unmanned drone aircraft flying over the skies of Afghanistan and Iraq in the next three years, as a result of commanders' demand for digital images useful in hunting down enemy forces. By 2011, the Air Force will be flying as many as 50 drones, or combat air patrols in the war zones, and by 2013 that number will jump to 65, say Air Force officials. Currently there are 40.<br />

<span style="color: black;">The United States cannot always generate enough good intelligence to sustain Predator operations on its own, but, as The New York Times has reported, Pakistani intelligence has at times given Washington detailed information on the location of militant leaders. Such support is limited, however, because Islamabad is playing a precarious double game. U.S. strikes on Pakistani soil are deeply unpopular, so no political leader wants to line up publicly with Washington. In addition, the militants are tied to powerful Pakistani interest groups, and many in the security elite hope to continue exploiting Islamic militants to serve Pakistani interests in both Afghanistan and Kashmir. This often means that Pakistani officials condemn U.S. actions in public while assisting them in private -- risking blows to their already weak standing when their hypocrisy is revealed (as it was last month, when Senator Dianne Feinstein [D-Calif.] disclosed that Predator strikes were being launched from bases in Pakistan).  </span><br />

<strong>As the al-Yazid strike suggests, the Obama administration has picked up the pace of using drones in Pakistan. How did the United States manage to expand its unmanned drone program into a sovereign state that is not a declared warzone?</strong>  <br />
The decision was made after 9/11 by President Bush to authorize the CIA to capture or kill a small number of high-value al-Qaeda targets. This happens with CIA-controlled drones in November 2002 in Yemen, where a suspected mastermind of the <em>USS Cole</em> bombing is targeted and killed. And then in 2004 or 2005, the CIA also is put in command and control of drones only for Pakistan, as opposed to the Pentagon-controlled drones in Afghanistan. Today, some of the CIA-controlled drones are flown out of Pakistan and reportedly some others from Afghanistan. But these are somewhat compartmentalized from Department of Defense strikes, which happen in a declared warzone, which is in Afghanistan. Pakistan is not a declared warzone, but a sovereign country. So these can only happen with some level of cooperation with the Pakistani government. <br />
What kind of cooperation?  <br />
If you're taking off from Pakistani airfields, the Pakistani government knows this is going on. The Pakistani media has also shown photographs of drones [on the ground in Pakistan], and there's lots of reporting of U.S. contractors and U.S. officials at some of these airfields. Early on, the U.S. government received permission from Islamabad to go after a very small number of people, primarily Arabs or Uzbeks. Only non-Pakistanis were permitted to be targeted, and if you look at the people who were targeted through the first dozen drone strikes over the first three or four years, they're almost all non-Pakistani. There was some intelligence support provided by the Pakistani government reportedly at the time, but what happens is in the summer of 2008 the U.S. government starts pushing it and going after targets on their own. <br />
The Pakistani government can resist and say, &quot;This is our own sovereign territory.&quot; But if the United States launches strikes without the Pakistani government knowing, it looks bad. So there's a very careful dance where the United States then starts going after some targets which are a threat to the Pakistani regime in Islamabad. In the summer of 2008, the CIA becomes, in effect, the counterinsurgency air force of the government of Pakistan, going after individuals and organizations that are dedicated to the overthrow of the regime in Islamabad, more so than they are dedicated to attacking the United States or U.S. allies abroad. This is clear to the Pakistani government, and they begin to provide greater intelligence; they provide a little more cover for the United States to do more drone strikes. It's estimated that at the end of the Bush administration, there were only six or seven Predator drones in Pakistan. Reportedly, this has doubled in the last year or so of the Obama administration, all with the explicit authorization of the Pakistani government.<br />

The skillful use of earmarks reflects the success General Atomics has achieved maneuvering through Washington. &quot;For our size, we possess more significant political capital than you might think,&quot; Blue was quoted as saying in a 2005 Defense News article. The company has been traditionally generous in its campaign donations, and it far outspends larger defense contractors Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon when treating lawmakers and their staffs with trips to exotic locales. From 2000 to 2007, the company spent $683,734 on 100 trips for congressional members and staff, including jaunts to Sidney, Australia; Venice, Italy; and Ankara, Turkey, according to the online database Legistorm, which tracks congressional salaries and travel. All those skills came in handy after the end of the war in Bosnia, when the Pentagon gave control of the Predator program to the Air Force, which reluctantly accepted. &quot;The Air Force is made up of pilots. Why would you want a pilotless plane?&quot; said one defense lobbyist, explaining the hesitance. But General Atomics held sway with members of Congress. When they saw results from the Lewis-funded Pentagon program to make a research project into battle-ready technology, Cassidy said, &quot;they started 'plussing up' Predator buys&quot; - a defense insider's term for what's more widely known as an earmark. General Atomics - and the Predator - had another benefactor in then-Sen. John Warner (R-Va.), who helped direct policies for weaponizing UAVs and buying more robotics in the future. In 2000, Warner laid out his goals for the Pentagon: to make one-third of the aircraft unmanned by 2010 and to do the same with ground vehicles five years later. &quot;In my judgment, this country will never again permit the armed forces to be engaged in conflicts which inflict the level of casualties we have seen historically,&quot; he told the National Journal at the time. &quot;So what do you do? You move toward the unmanned type of military vehicle to carry out missions which are high risk in nature.&quot; Defense Secretary Robert Gates has embraced the use of UAVs, leaning heavily on the Air Force to increase their numbers to beef up intelligence-gathering efforts and aid the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Pentagon has been credited with culling information from UAVs to break up networks of bomb-layers during the war in Iraq - and Gates's challenge now is to adapt those tactics to the Afghan theater, where rippled terrain makes surveillance more difficult. That very likely means more good years for General Atomics. The Air Force has asked for 24 Reapers next year. Northrop Grumman, which makes the Global Hawk, a high-altitude UAV, also stands to gain in the future. Hard feelings linger in the fighter-jet community, and retired generals continue to point out that unmanned aerial vehicles don't stand a chance in war zones with better air defenses than the military has seen in Iraq or Afghanistan. And tensions between the Air Force and the Army over how to manage the growing variety of systems in the skies remain. But the Air Force leadership is committed to UAVs. Secretary Mike Donley is focused on training and preparing the teams of people who operate each combat air patrol flown in theater - that includes piloting the UAVs, operating the sensors and distilling and analyzing the data and intelligence delivered, he told POLITICO. <br />

<strong>The use of Drones is key to the global war on terror</strong> <br />
<strong>Rittgers 10</strong> – served in the United States Army as an Infantry and Special Forces officer (February 25, 2010, David Rittgers, Appeared in The Wall Street Journal – available online at CATO, “Both Left and Right Are Wrong about Drones,” <span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4873:http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=11257 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=11257" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=11257</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4873 --></span>, ngoetz) <br />
<br />
The Obama administration has significantly expanded the use of unmanned aerial drones to kill al Qaeda and Taliban operatives. This decision has been criticized from both the left and the right, but it fits neatly into a broader strategy of countering terrorists world-wide. <br />
Advances in unmanned aerial vehicle technology allow the United States to reach around the globe and target terrorists in areas where our troops cannot go for tactical or diplomatic reasons. Drone attacks have increased significantly in Afghanistan and Pakistan in the past six months while civilian casualties have decreased. <br />
Liberal critics should refrain from erroneously labeling drone strikes as &quot;nonjudicial killings.&quot; Even the most controversial drone strikes—those that kill American citizens who have joined al Qaeda affiliates overseas—are permissible under the laws of war. <br />
Neither Congress nor the courts should micromanage tactical decisions such as whether the president can order soldiers to seize a particular hill or employ a certain weapon. Referring to drone strikes as &quot;nonjudicial&quot; implies that the courts should be given the ability to rule out specific drone attacks. Vetting these targets for accuracy of intelligence and minimization of collateral damage is essential, and the record continues to improve on that front. <br />
Criticism from conservatives is largely based on the logic that a live and talking terrorist is worth more than a dead one. While this is true as a general matter, several factors make drone attacks a good alternative to capture. <br />
First, not all terrorists targeted in drone attacks can be feasibly taken alive. This is especially true of those who reside in the many areas dominated by local insurgent groups and therefore out of reach of national governments. <br />
For example, putting troops on the ground in the Pakistani tribal areas, where numerous drone attacks have been carried out, is both tactically and diplomatically problematic. Last May, CIA Director Leon Panetta called drones the &quot;only game in town&quot; when it comes to certain parts of Pakistan, and this will remain the case for the long term. <br />
Second, many terrorist leaders are captured and interrogated, but by their own governments rather than U.S. forces. Cooperation with the governments who capture these terrorists serves numerous purposes, and this should not be viewed as a loss. The recent interrogation of high-level Taliban official Mullah Baradar by Pakistani agents is an example how U.S. personnel need not be—indeed, are often unable to be—involved in every phase of these operations. <br />
Third, many conservatives lament that we no longer use coercive interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, on detainees. These techniques are not coming back. Contrary to public perception, the Bush administration dismantled the legal architecture that facilitated their use, and there are strong legal and policy arguments against reversing that judgment. The laws of armed conflict are quirky in this regard; soldiers can use all manner of force to kill their enemies, but once a person is in custody, the captor is responsible for their humane treatment. Coercive interrogation runs counter to the legal burden placed on our soldiers. <br />
The fight against al Qaeda is unlike any of our previous conflicts, but in broad strokes the Cold War is the best parallel we have. We face an ideologically motivated enemy that attempts to link localized grievances with global ones, and to destabilize governments in the Third World. The biggest difference is that our current enemy is significantly weaker than the Soviet Union. Al Qaeda has far fewer resources, limited military power, and it is losing credibility with the broader Muslim community because of its nihilist message. <br />
The U.S. will continue to engage in proxy fights against al Qaeda franchises in the Horn of Africa, Yemen and the Philippines for the foreseeable future. Large, long-term troop deployments such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan will be the exception, not the rule, in this fight. Engaging governments to defeat internal terrorist and insurgent groups is the most cost-effective way to fight this war, and supporting those governments with the surgical use of drones is an effective technique. <br />

<strong>Hafez, conflict studies prof, 4</strong>—Department of peace and conflict studies, Dhaka University (Khoda, Not An Absence Of War: Peace As Justice, 8 June 2004, <span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4874:http://dhaka.usembassy.gov/06.08.04_dhaka_university_peace_not_an_absence_of_war --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dhaka.usembassy.gov/06.08.04_dhaka_university_peace_not_an_absence_of_war" rel="nofollow">http://dhaka.usembassy.gov/06.08.04_dhaka_university_peace_not_an_absence_of_war</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4874 --></span>, AMiles) <br />

The war against terrorism is an effort to protect from attack both the hard and soft targets – in the United States, in the former Soviet Union, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Saudi Arabia, in Spain, in Bangladesh, and elsewhere. That is why it is seen as a global war. It is not a war we chose and the engagement is frequently not on our terms. But now that we are in it, we must remain engaged to its successful completion since this is not a war that we can afford to lose. As I mentioned before, like many of you, I am a parent. Like you, I want my daughter to grow up in a safer, saner world than the one we have at the moment. The global war in which we are engaged is not a war about religious or civilizational domination. But it is as real a war as the ones formerly fought on conventional battlefields between standing armies. In waging this war, terrorists consider it a triumph if they can produce major casualties such as occurred with the death of 3,000 people from more than 80 nationalities on September 11, 2001, including more than 20 Bangladeshis, or the attack on railway facilities in Madrid resulting in the loss of more than 180 lives on March 11 of this year. Those concerned with issues of war and peace -– and that is all of us -- cannot afford to sit on the sidelines while this war is being waged. We know from the lead-up to World War II that good people cannot sit by idly while evil is being planned and perpetrated. We cannot afford to be passive and we cannot afford to be merely reactive. Just as crime prevention is a means of protecting people from injury and loss of life, war prevention means taking the measures that protect societies from the dangers posed by global terrorists.  <br />

<strong>Extinction</strong>  <br />

The combination of horror and outrage that will surge upon the nation will demand that the president retaliate for the incomprehensible damage done by the attack. The problem will be that the president will not immediately know how to respond or against whom. The perpetrators will have been incinerated by the explosion that destroyed New York City. Unlike 9-11, there will have been no interval during the attack when those hijacked could make phone calls to loved ones telling them before they died that the hijackers were radical Islamic extremists. There will be no such phone calls when the attack will not have been anticipated until the instant the terrorists detonate their improvised nuclear device inside the truck parked on a curb at the Empire State Building. Nor will there be any possibility of finding any clues, which either were vaporized instantly or are now lying physically inaccessible under tons of radioactive rubble. Still, the president, members of Congress, the military, and the public at large will suspect another attack by our known enemy – Islamic terrorists. The first impulse will be to launch a nuclear strike on Mecca, to destroy the whole religion of Islam. Medina could possibly be added to the target list just to make the point with crystal clarity. Yet what would we gain? The moment Mecca and Medina were wiped off the map, the Islamic world – more than 1 billion human beings in countless different nations – would feel attacked. Nothing would emerge intact after a war between the United States and Islam. The apocalypse would be upon us. Then, too, we would face an immediate threat from our long-term enemy, the former Soviet Union. Many in the Kremlin would see this as an opportunity to grasp the victory that had been snatched from them by Ronald Reagan when the Berlin Wall came down. A missile strike by the Russians on a score of American cities could possibly be pre-emptive. Would the U.S. strategic defense system be so in shock that immediate retaliation would not be possible? Hardliners in Moscow might argue that there was never a better opportunity to destroy America. In China, our newer Communist enemies might not care if we could retaliate. With a population already over 1.3 billion people and with their population not concentrated in a few major cities, the Chinese might calculate to initiate a nuclear blow on the United States. Wh at if the United States retaliated with a nuclear counterattack upon China? The Chinese might be able to absorb the blow and recover. The North Koreans might calculate even more recklessly. Why not launch upon America the few missiles they have that could reach our soil? More confusion and chaos might only advance their position. If Russia, China, and the United States could be drawn into attacking one another, North Korea might emerge stronger just because it was overlooked while the great nations focus on attacking one another.  <br />

<strong>FATA residents support the drone program – they want the Taliban to die and they don’t fear becoming collateral damage.</strong>  <br />

<br />
But don't just believe the word of well-informed military officers overseeing the actual area of operations and other Pakistani officials, listen to the locals of the areas of themselves. <br />
While sitting in a meeting in a Peshawar sitting parlor with several Pakistanis from South Waziristan and other agencies in FATA, one of my hosts articulated what he called a &quot;criminal conspiracy&quot; among the politicians, the intelligence agencies, the media and even the military to sustain a public narrative undermining the drone program while benefiting from the same. <br />
These <strong>FATA residents are strong proponents of the drones</strong>. They report that the drones are so precise that the local non-militants do not fear them when they hear the drones above as they are confident that they will hit their target. Locals attribute this precision in part to the placement of &quot;targeting chips&quot; which direct the ordinance to the exact location of the militants in their redoubts. The accurate placement of these chips requires local cooperation to provide the whereabouts of these militants. This has driven an important wedge between the locals and militants with the former shunning the latter. <br />
Another interlocutor explained that when children hear the buzz of the drones, they go their roofs to watch the spectacle of precision rather than cowering in fear of random &quot;death from above.&quot; <br />
These observers are not alone. Professor Ijaz Khattak, in the Department of International Relations at University of Peshawar explained to a popular television host Skaukat Khattak, that &quot;The drone attacks have proved effective and have targeted the terrorists and there had been little collateral damage in the US drone attacks.&quot; <br />
<br />
<strong>The drones bad narrative is baseless, and Pakistani opinion is shifting to supporting the drones</strong> <br />

<br />
Amidst allegations that the army was indiscriminate in its use of force, some Pakistanis began arguing that Pakistan should have its own drones to allow Pakistani forces to have the same accuracy as US forces. Increasingly Pakistani officials are requesting that the United States provide drones or at least let them have a role in pulling the trigger. Advocates of Pakistani drones or increased command and control over U.S. drones note that armed drones have neither displaced millions of Pakistanis nor resulted in the destruction of homes on a large scale. <br />
The August 2009 killing of Baitullah Mehsud catalyzed another shift in the Pakistani discourse. This was the first drone strike that killed a Pakistani militant who was exclusively an enemy of Pakistan. As Baitullah Mehsud had no operational import for the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, Pakistan understood that the United States was finally employing its use of force to contend with Pakistan's own internal foes. <br />
This shift in the drone debate is an important shift that few American interlocutors appreciate <strong>as they sustain a baseless narrative that is deaf to the realities across Pakistan.</strong> Drones went from being universally dismissed among Pakistanis as a horrific menace to an instrument of significantly and comparatively humane lethality relative to other options.  <br />

<strong>Reports of civilian casualties are planted by militants themselves – they’ve never been verified</strong> <br />
<strong>Fair, 10</strong> - Assistant Professor, Georgetown University’s Security Studies Program (C. Christine, &quot; Drones Over Pakistan -- Menace or Best Viable Option? &quot;, Huffington Post, 8/2, <span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4878:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/c-christine-fair/drones-over-pakistan&amp;#45;&amp;#45;&amp;#45;-m_b_666721.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/c-christine-fair/drones-over-pakistan----m_b_666721.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/c-christine-fair/drones-over-pakistan----m_b_666721.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4878 --></span>) <br />
<br />
While many locals seem to appreciate the value of the armed drones and are ostensibly aware of who the militants are that are killed, the outrage of the Pakistani public intensifies as one moves farther away from the place where the missiles land. Within the main provinces of Pakistan, there is staunch popular outrage to the drones. <br />
This antipathy towards the program is due in large measure to the collaboration of Pakistan's media to sustain tenacious criticism of the program by spreading suspect civilian casualty reports planted by the militants themselves or various &quot;agencies.&quot; It makes no difference that <strong>none of these reports can be independently verified</strong> because FATA's legal status precludes independent media from traveling there. Nor does it matter that such high figures of civilian loss of life would certainly lead to funerals in large numbers which have not been reported. <br />

<strong>Terrorists think they have a religious duty to destroy us—force is the only option</strong>  <br />
<strong>Jones 8</strong>—religion, psychology and terrorism, Rutgers. Snr Research Fellow, Center on Terrorism, John Jay College. ThD, Uppasala U. Psy.D, dept of clinical psychology, Rutgers. PhD in religious studies, Brown. (James, Blood That Cries Out From the Earth, 42-3, AMiles) <br />
<br />
One of the most widespread beliefs of violent religious movements is their apocalyptic vision of a cosmic struggle of the forces of the all-good against the forces of the all-evil ( Juergensmeyer, 2000; Kimball, 2002; Wessinger, 2000). Osama bin Laden says it clearly: there are “two adversaries; the Islamic nation, on the one hand, and the United States and its allies on the other. It is either victory and glory or defeat and humiliation” (quoted in Moghadam, 2006: 717). Virtually all religious terrorists agree that they are locked in an apocalyptic battle with demonic forces, that is, usually with the forces of secularism. We have seen how Sayyid Qutb denoted secularism and the concomitant values of individual rights and the separation of religion and law as demonic and the source of most of the misery of the modern world and demanded a jihad against it (Berman, 2003). Continuing Qutb’s diatribe, the founder of Hamas told a reporter, “There’s a war going on” <strong>not just against Israeli occupation but against all secular governments</strong> including the Palestinian authority because there “is no such thing as a secular state in Islam” ( Juergensmeyer, 2000: 76). Hamas’s arch enemy, Rabbi Meir Kahane, whose Jewish Defense League was responsible for numerous attacks on Muslims in the United States and Israel, said bluntly “secular government is the enemy” ( Juergensmeyer, 2000: 55). Asahara, the founder of the Aum Shinrikyo, is reported to have shouted again and again at his followers, “Don’t you realize that this is war” (Lifton, 2000: 56) and to have insisted that his group existed “on a war footing” (Lifton, 2000: 60). The Reverend Paul Hill, who shot and killed a physician in front of a family planning clinic in the United States, wrote “The battle over abortion is primarily spiritual. The confl ict is between God’s will and kingdom and Satan’s opposing will and kingdom” (Hill, 2003: 8). Hill’s actions were justifi ed to an interviewer by his brother-in-arms, the Reverend Michael Bray, who wrote the bible of the violent anti-choice movement, entitled tellingly A Time to Kill, as the product of a Christian subculture in America that considers itself at war with the larger society, and to some extent victimized by it. . . . This subculture sees itself justifi ed in its violent responses to a vast and violent repression waged by secular . . . agents of a satanic force . . . a great defensive Christian struggle against the secular state, a contest between the forces of spiritual truth and heathen darkness, in which the moral character of America as a righteous nation hangs in the balance.( Juergensmeyer, 2000: 36) Juergensmeyer concludes in his investigation of religiously sponsored terrorism around the globe, Terror in the Mind of God, that “what is strikingly similar about the cultures of which they [religious terrorists] are a part is their view of the contemporary world at war” ( Juergensmeyer, 2000: 151). Qutb and the jihadists are not alone in declaring war on the secular state.  <br />

<strong>Drones are devastating Al Qaeda now</strong> <br />
<strong>Daily Telegraph 10</strong>—British Newspaper (10/13, “Al-Qaeda in crisis amid cash shortage”, <span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4879:http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6318787/Al-Qaeda-in-crisis-amid-cash-shortage.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6318787/Al-Qaeda-in-crisis-amid-cash-shortage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6318787/Al-Qaeda-in-crisis-amid-cash-shortage.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4879 --></span>, Aly M) <br />
<br />
In the first half of this year, al-Qaeda's core leadership was compelled to make four public appeals for cash, complaining in one case of a &quot;weakness in operations because of lack of money&quot;. Part of the reason for this is that some funding is believed to have gone to the Taliban instead. This financial squeeze has compounded the problems faced by &quot;core al-Qaeda&quot;. Highly effective attacks launched by American Predator drones have eliminated a raft of its most able leaders. Experts believe that Osama bin Laden's network is under immense pressure inside its last redoubts in the Tribal Areas lining Pakistan's north-west frontier. David Cohen, the assistant secretary at the US Treasury responsible for countering terrorist finance, said that al-Qaeda's recent appeal for funds showed its &quot;financial predicament&quot;. He added: &quot;We assess that al-Qaeda is in its weakest financial condition in several years, and that, as a result, its influence is waning. This success is important. It is a sign that we are moving in the right direction.&quot; America and its allies have taken increasingly sophisticated steps to choke the movement of funds to all terrorist groups, principally by freezing assets belonging to &quot;designated&quot; individuals, banks and companies. Traditionally, al-Qaeda's money has tended to come from the Gulf kingdoms, but there is evidence that this flow is being blocked. Carrying out terrorist attacks is relatively cheap - the bombing of the London Underground on 7 July 2005 probably cost only £8,000 - but al-Qaeda also needs cash to train new operatives and buy the safety of its leading figures in the Tribal Areas Without these funds, its ability to operate is severely constrained. Meanwhile, the drone strikes are taking a steady toll of &quot;core al-Qaeda&quot;. Pakistani authorities calculate that 14 al-Qaeda figures died in 60 American drone attacks in the Tribal Areas between January 2006 and April this year. Those who are left are forced to concentrate on securing their own safety and hunting down informers, rather than planning attacks. &quot;Operationally, it does look increasingly difficult for them to hold together as a coherent, disciplined terrorist group,&quot; said Paul Cornish, the head of international security at the Chatham House think tank. <br />

<strong>Drones have totally jacked al Qaeda – the plan causes a resurgence</strong>  <br />
<strong>Sageman, 9</strong> - adjunct Associate Professor at the School of International and Public Affairs and former case officer for the CIA (Marc, “Confronting al-Qaeda: Understanding the Threat in Afghanistan,” Perspectives on Terrorism, vol. 3 n.4, <span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4880:http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php?option=com_rokzine&amp;view=article&amp;id=92&amp;Itemid=54 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php?option=com_rokzine&amp;view=article&amp;id=92&amp;Itemid=54" rel="nofollow">http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php?option=com_rokzine&amp;view=article&amp;id=92&amp;Itemid=54</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4880 --></span>) <br />
<br />
5. Counter-terrorism is working. The escalation from a more limited and focused counter-terrorism strategy to a larger combined counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency strategy (in a country devoid of the al-Qaeda presence!) is predicated on the assumption that the terrorist threat is either stable or increasing – meaning that counter-terrorism has failed. The timeline graphs clearly show that the threat is fading, from its high water mark of 2004. There has been no global neo-jihadi terrorist casualty in the United States in the past eight years and none in the West in general in the past four years. Of course, al-Qaeda is not dead as long as its top leadership is still alive. This cannot be attributed to a loss of intent from al-Qaeda and its militant rivals. From all indications, including recent debriefs of terrorist wannabes captured in Pakistan and the West, the respective leaders of global neo-jihadi terrorism are still enthusiastically plotting to hit the West and do not hesitate to proclaim their desire on the Internet. Nor is this due to the counter-insurgency in Afghanistan because al-Qaeda and its allies all have their training facilities in Pakistan. It is due to effective counter-terrorism strategy, <strong>which is on the brink of completely eliminating al-Qaeda.</strong> A dead organization will not be able to return to Afghanistan. 6. The reasons for the effectiveness of the counter-terrorism strategy so far are multiple. First and foremost is al-Qaeda’s inability to grow. Unlike the pre-9/11/01 period, al-Qaeda leaders have generally not incorporated new recruits among its ranks. The leadership of al-Qaeda still harks back to the fight against the Soviets in the 1980s. Because he has been hiding full time, Osama bin Laden has not been able to appoint and train a new group of top leaders and there is no evidence that he trusts anyone whom he has not known from the anti-Soviet jihad. In the 1990s, al-Qaeda incorporated the brightest and most dedicated novices who came to train in its network of camps in Afghanistan. They became its cadres and trainers. In the past five years, al-Qaeda has not been able for the most part to incorporate new recruits among its ranks. Western novices traveling to Pakistan in the hope of making contact with al-Qaeda have been turned around and sent back to the West to carry out terrorist operations. Meanwhile, the success of the Predator drone strike campaign on the Pakistani border has dramatically thinned the ranks of both al-Qaeda leaders and cadres. Now it appears that these strikes are also targeting al-Qaeda allies with a transnational agenda.
