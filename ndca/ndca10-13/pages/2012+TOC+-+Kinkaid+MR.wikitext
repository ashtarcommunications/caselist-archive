My guess – and it is only a guess – is that after conferring with leading Democrats and Republicans, he recognized the overriding practical political advantages accruing from choosing an Hispanic woman, with left-leaning credentials. We cannot know if this would have been his ideal choice based on judicial philosophy alone, but presidents are never free to act on their ideal preferences. Politics is the art of the possible. Whether Sotomayer is his first choice or not, however, her nomination is a reminder that the power of the presidency often resides in the president’s ability to dictate the alternatives from which Congress (or in this case the Senate) must choose. Although Republicans will undoubtedly attack Sotomayor for her judicial “activism” (citing in particular her decisions regarding promotion and affirmative action), her comments regarding the importance of gender and ethnicity in influencing her decisions, and her views regarding whether appellate courts “make” policy, they run the risk of alienating Hispanic voters – an increasingly influential voting bloc (to the extent that one can view Hispanics as a voting bloc!) I find it very hard to believe she will not be easily confirmed. In structuring the alternative before the Senate in this manner, then, Obama reveals an important aspect of presidential power that cannot be measured through legislative boxscores.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">A shift in policy could … **__we think about outer space__**.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">The 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits sovereign nations from owning a celestial body -- such as a planet or asteroid -- and has been ratified by 100 countries, including the United States. But the treaty does not explicitly prohibit ownership of space resources by private enterprises. This is the loophole that Simberg's plan would seek to use, and he plans to shop it around on Capitol Hill, according to Popular Science.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">“It would have great potential to kick the development of extraterrestrial resources -- and perhaps even the human settlement of space -- into high gear,” Simberg wrote in the summary of the proposal.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">But</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> **__space attorney__** Michael **__Listner …__** of **__a nonstarter__**," </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Listner told Wired.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Simberg's plan comes at a time when the U.S. government has made dramatic cuts to its space program. The last space shuttle mission was completed in July 2011. Additionally, a future series of manned deep-space exploration missions, the Constellation program, was cancelled in June 2011.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">The basic idea is nothing new. In his book Unreal Estate: The Men Who Sold the Moon, Virgiliu Pop tracked hundreds of outer-space property rights claims over thousands of years, from individuals, kings, and countries, under various theories of law. All have failed the test of time.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">The negotiators of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty knew that such claims would never stop unless the countries agreed once and for all that: “Outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.”</span>

//<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The civilian scientists attempted to still their consciences in their deal ings with the defence scientists by suggesting that, with the end of the Cold War and the demise of SDI, the latter had lost their traditional role. This argument was naive at best. In fact, as we have seen, the US defence sci entists had taken an interest in the impact threat since the early 1980s, from the time that SDI had greatest political support during the defence build-up of the Reagan era. Even at the time of the fractious Interception Workshop, George H.W. Bush was maintaining SDI funding at the same level as it had been during the second Reagan administration. If outwardly the Clinton administration was less supportive when it took office in 1993 and declared that SDI was over, many of those involved in the programme felt that it would actually go on much as before (FitzGerald, 2000: 491). SDI was renamed, and to some extent reconceived, but funding continued and was soon increased when the Republicans gained a majority in Congress.33 After George W. Bush took office in 2001, spending on missile defence research was greatly increased, including programmes to follow on from Brilliant Pebbles (Wall, 2001a; 2001b). </span>//

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The civilian scientists attempted to still their consciences in their deal ings with the defence scientists by suggesting that, with the end of the Cold War and the demise of SDI, the latter had lost their traditional role. This argument was naive at best. In fact, as we have seen, the US defence sci entists had taken an interest in the impact threat since the early 1980s, from the time that SDI had greatest political support during the defence build-up of the Reagan era. Even at the time of the fractious Interception Workshop, George H.W. Bush was maintaining SDI funding at the same level as it had been during the second Reagan administration. If outwardly the Clinton administration was less supportive when it took office in 1993 and declared that SDI was over, many of those involved in the programme felt that it would actually go on much as before (FitzGerald, 2000: 491). SDI was renamed, and to some extent reconceived, but funding continued and was soon increased when the Republicans gained a majority in Congress.33 After George W. Bush took office in 2001, spending on missile defence research was greatly increased, including programmes to follow on from Brilliant Pebbles (Wall, 2001a; 2001b). </span>
