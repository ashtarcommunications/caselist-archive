=Introduction= 
The primary purpose of this wiki is to share tips and tricks about creating ideal coleslaw. As the curator of this wiki is not vegan, some tips and tricks will be specific to creating vegan coleslaw, but most will be universal.

A secondary purpose of this wiki is to share interesting citations.
This should be a space for cabbage and coleslaw enthusiasts who come from all walks of life.

**Tip #1: Use salt to prevent excess wetness.**
Remember to salt the coleslaw so that it doesn't get too wet
just remember the 4 S's
1) SALT the cabbage
2) STIR the salt into the cabbage
3) Let SIT for a few hours
4) SPIN to remove excess wetness

**Tip #2: Replace mayonnaise with aioli.**
My favorite aioli is this vegan Wildwood brand, which their copy describes rather accurately as “a refreshingly zesty spread with garlic and a hint of lemon juice.” It makes a great base for garlic-centered slaws, and it’s made of totally natural, simple ingredients.

**Tip #4: When it comes to coleslaw, everything is optional but the cabbage.**

**Tip #5: Actually, even the cabbage is optional.**
You heard me right.
Even the cabbage is optional.

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">**__Contention one is (in)security__**</span>
**Airport security is premised on the doctrine of control. In an effort to secure the most efficient system possible, duties are scaled into suffocating hierarchies. The fear of collapse leads to a fear of interdependence and complexity; modern aviation security procedures only perpetuate this frantic desire for absolute control of the absolutely uncontrollable**

**Airports are a liminal space, the zone between the origin and the destination, a rite of passage for all mobility. The identity profiling inherent in airport security represents the most blatant form of biopolitics. Categories are constructed for age, gender, race, ethnicity, behavior, and appearance, matched by machines to calculated risk levels and integrated into the subconscious of mindless operators. Through biometrics and profiling, our very mobility is channeled into the state apparatus, suppressing our freedom of transportation**

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">__**Contention two is debate**__</span>
**Resolutions change every year but discussions do not – in debate we find ourselves locked in the same zombified routines. Debate is obsessed with prolonging <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">//stasis//</span>, with extending the moment of the present into perpetuity. We crave this deadening torpor because, like in the airport, it gives us the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">//illusion//</span> that we can control the future. The discussions you will hear in most debates are decoupled from the resolution – focused on questions of nuclear violence and terrorism – these are <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">//recycled//</span> discussions – the resolution is no longer a topic but a stale conduit for security logic. When this model of debate is confronted with difference it attempts, by any means necessary, to preempt and exterminate that difference – framework arguments replicate the violence technologies of airport security – the obsession with “predictability” mirrors the airport’s addiction to transparency and absolute visibility. The constant attempts to exclude discussions based on what they <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">might</span> justify is an extension of the airport’s logic of preemption.Securitization denies the resolution its __immanent potential__. At its core the resolution is a discussion of transport, of mobility, of change – this is in stark contrast to the way most debaters approach the resolution – as a means of __freezing__ the present – “we must __sustain__ American hegemony,” “we must __prevent__ potential abuse.”**

**The airport’s endlessly predictable models of security are born of a state that covets control of the unknown – just as the state channels unpredictability into forms it can manage, traditional frameworks of policy debate replace creative, diverse ways of thinking with fascist, recycled, security-obsessed knowledge production. The modulation of power has resulted in its widespread diffusion – fascism threatens all domains of life, debate included**

In addition to this novel way of thinking rhizomatically, the philosophers make further distinctions

**Our model endorses accounting for a range of circumstances instead of just one contrived outcome. We endorse creativity and risk-taking – lacking total control is inevitable – no matter how much we map and diagram and question, there will always lie the unknown. Resigning ourselves to this vast and turbulent uncertainty, __Sarah and I affirm an understanding of the topic that understands the call to increase investment in transportation infrastructure as a call to create more fluid space for mobility and experience__.**

**Our criticism represents an epistemic break from the striated space of fascist knowledge production. Traditional policy affirmatives outline concrete plans of action, tracing wildly improbable internal link chains in a race to the most explosive impact, then asserting that the hypothetical enactment of their plan will solve multiple extinctions. We refuse complicity with this ordinance – we are cartographers, explorers, nomads – our affirmative is the map that plots the path for potentiality.

**Airport security is just one way the state exerts its iron grip over the ways we know. The role of the ballot is to create more free and fluid spaces for discussion. Join us in refusing the ways in which this community banally regurgitates the knowledge produced by the military industrial complex, and to refuse the way we discipline and punish the fleeting emergence of difference. Vote affirmative not only because of our tactic for resistance, but also for the method by which our tactic turns the corner to become a strategy. Vote affirmative because our refusal makes the space we are in right now a more free and fluid forum for discussion.**

A flexible, creative, and rapidly responsive biomanufacturing infrastructure is an essential part of
AND
, and vaccines each have unique requirements for their production at useful scales.

**B. Pharmaceuticals**

New manufacturing thrives on and drives innovation. Manufacturing is a core component of the
AND

**The aff’s technocratic attempt to manage the environment sells nature out to power-knowledge regimes seeking to manage the health and longevity of the population. Environmentalizing biopolitics risks extinction.**

The ideas advanced by … human ecosystem’s carrying capacity.

**Our alternative is to reject the aff. Domination is perpetuated by the ability of those in power to define the discursive framing of the field of contestation. Neither corporate managerialism nor traditional environmental activism has any hope of securing lasting change in contemporary environmental debates – literally the ONLY hope for change is a representational strategy like ours.**
