==Contention 3 is Deployment== 
====Commercial port infrastructure’s key for surge deployments – congestion reduces rapid response==== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">MARAD, 05 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration, June 2005, “Report to congress on the performance of ports and the intermodal system,” http://www.marad.dot.gov/documents/Rpt_to_Congress-Perf_Ports_Intermodal_Sys-June2005.pdf)</span>

The addition of military mobilization to normal commercial operations dramatically stresses the freight transportation system
AND
recognize this problem and are embarking on locally and Federally funded improvement programs.

====And the plan is necessary to deter aggression---that’s especially true in the context of Taiwan and China and on the Korean Peninsula==== 
**<span style="background-color: white;">Gerson, 09 </span>**<span style="background-color: white;">– </span><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 8pt;">Research Analyst, Center for Naval Analyses (Michael S., Fall 2009, “Conventional Deterrence in the Second Nuclear Age,” Parameters, US Army War College Quarterly, http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/Articles/09autumn/gerson.pdf)</span>

This article seeks to expand the current debate about the role and utility of conventional
AND
regimes from believing that nuclear possession provides opportunities for conventional aggression and coercion.

====Scenario 1 is a China-Taiwan War==== 
====War over Taiwan is the most likely scenario for war==== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Tucker 05</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Nancy professor at Georgetown University “Dangerous strait: the U.S.--Taiwan--China crisis”, p. google books]</span>

At the beginning of this new century, nowhere is the danger for Americans as
AND
the problem that will meet with the assent of the people of Taiwan.
====Even limited China exchange causes extinction==== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Takai, Staff College Researcher, ’09</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [Mitsuo, Ret. Colonel and Researcher at the Staff College for Japan’s Ground Self-Defense Force, “U.S.-China Nuclear Strikes Would Spell Doomsday”, October 7, http://www.upiasia.com/Security/2009/10/07/us-china_nuclear_strikes_would_spell_doomsday/7213/]</span>

What would happen if China launched its 20 Dongfeng-5 (ICBMs) intercontinental
AND
with China. Such advice is worth heeding by nuclear hard-liners.

====Scenario 2 is a Great Power War==== 
====Only the plan prevents naval power collapse==== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">MARAD, 05</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration, June 2005, “Report to congress on the performance of ports and the intermodal system,” http://www.marad.dot.gov/documents/Rpt_to_Congress-Perf_Ports_Intermodal_Sys-June2005.pdf)</span>

Lack of attention to port maintenance and improvement dredging is starting to restrict trade and
AND
attention to the areas that may soon restrict military or significant commercial cargo.

====The impact is great power war==== 
**Conway et al, 07** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(James T., Former General, U.S. Marine Corps, *AND Gary Roughead, Former Admiral, U.S. Navy, *AND Thad W. Allen, Former Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, October 2007, “A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower,” http://www.navy.mil/maritime/MaritimeStrategy.pdf)</span>

Deter major power war. No other disruption is as potentially disastrous to global stability
AND
and sustain forces, sea control and power projection enable extended campaigns ashore.
====Scenario 3 is PACOM==== 
====The plan is the critical internal link into sealift effectiveness---boosts military readiness==== 
**AAPA, 03** (<span style="font-size: 8pt;">American Association of Port Authorities, Fall 2003, “The Impact of War & Terrorism,” Seaports Magazine, http://www.aapaseaports.com/pdf_issues/AAPASeaports_Fall2003.pdf)</span>

Vital national efforts such as military cargo moves for Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring
AND
with much greater efficiency than those associated with Operation Desert Storm in 1991.

====Sealift is also is the __foundation__ of USPACOM effectiveness==== 
**Gulledge and Keating 10** [Jay Gulledge, Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, served on the faculties of Tulane University and the University of Louisville, Timothy J. Keating, retired United States Navy admiral of PACOM, 2010 “Future Naval Operations in Asia and the Pacific” in “Climate and Energy Proceedings 2010”, Johns Hopkins University, page 344-345, [[http://www.jhuapl.edu/ClimateAndEnergy/Book/Chapter/Chapter7.pdf]], DMintz]
The instrument of foreign policy that works best in that part of the world is
AND
, I am convinced, provide the basis for success in the region.

====That solves __multiple__ crises and scenarios for global war – only sea-based __power projection__ sends a __credible__ signal==== 
**Willard 11** [Robert F. Willard, //US navy commander, USPACOM,// April 12, 2011, “STATEMENT OF ADMIRAL ROBERT F. WILLARD, U.S. NAVY COMMANDER, U.S. PACIFIC COMMAND BEFORE THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE ON U.S. PACIFIC COMMAND POSTURE, [[http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/2011/04%20April/Willard%2004-12-11.pdf]], DMintz]
The USPACOM Area of Responsibility (AOR) is vital to U.S.
AND
continued forward presence of substantial U.S. forces in the region.

====And we control conflict escalation====

Global engagement is critical to the U.S. economy, world trade and

security and dissuade transnational aggression in the future must be a national imperative.
