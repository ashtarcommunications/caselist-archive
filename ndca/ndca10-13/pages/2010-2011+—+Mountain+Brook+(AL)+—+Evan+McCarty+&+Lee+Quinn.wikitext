==Afghanistan Security Aff (Read by MtnBrook MS at Capitol)== 

====1AC==== 

**Contention I: The Evangelism of Fear**

**Politics and debate are obsessed with security. Discourses of danger constantly press upon us, telling us to act in order to avert some catastrophe in the near future. Knowledge is constantly produced in ways that presume the world as dangerous and in need of quick-fix policy solutions. Because of this, identities are constructed internationally in ways that mandate global violence.**
**Dillon 96** [Michael, professor Politics and International Relations at the University of Lancaster, The Politics of Security, pp. 14-15]

A logical way of pursuing this … thrown-up by their equally manifold discourses of danger.

**Dominant discourse surrounding US policy in Afghanistan is based on disconnected narratives and factoids that come to construct not only the identity of Afghanistan, but also that of the US. Through so-called objective reasoning, military presence is demanded and sustained all in the name of peace. This creates a vicious cycle of failed policymaking, resulting in an ever-expanding imperialism that goes far beyond the Afghan borders.**
**Crowe 7** (Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science @ York University, “The “Fuzzy Dream”: Discourse, Historical myths, and Militarized (in)Security - Interrogating dangerous myths of Afghanistan and the ‘West,” archive.sgir.eu/uploads/Crowe-loricrowe.pdf)

The historical production of particular myths … discourse/myth and the ‘militarization’ discourse/myth.

**The project of securing Afghanistan from the ‘backward,’ ‘evil’ Taliban relies on an evangelism of fear – the myth of salvation from danger through constant militarism and war. ‘Security’ is never achievable – it’s always just one more war away, just one more class of shadowy ‘enemies’ to be annihilated**
**Crowe 7** (Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science @ York University, “The “Fuzzy Dream”: Discourse, Historical myths, and Militarized (in)Security - Interrogating dangerous myths of Afghanistan and the ‘West,” archive.sgir.eu/uploads/Crowe-loricrowe.pdf)

Several problematic elements … as the leitmotiv for universal safety.81

**This evangelism of fear is produces its own danger. Militarization sustains a vicious cycle of violence in the name of securing oneself against death.**
**Campbell 98** (David- PHD, Prof of cultural & poli geog @ U of Durham, Writing Security, p.54-55)

It requires an emphasis on the … the logic of Christendom's evangelism of fear.

**The identification of the evil terrorists and insurgents in Afghanistan works to create a false sense of security that denies the contingency of life and inevitability of death. It is easier to fight a war against difference rather than affirm life in all its danger. As a result, life itself becomes a meaningless, a hollow shell that is constantly evading death.**
**Der Derian 98** [James, “The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard,” in On Security
ed. Ronnie Lipschutz. http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html]

Nietzsche transvalues both Hobbes's and Marx's … new advantages and new strength. 42

**Securitized representations are the root cause of violence and make war inevitable**
**Der Derian 2** (James, Professor of Political Science at Brown University, “Theory & Event The War of Networks)

Without falling into the trap of 'moral equivalency', one can discern … in medical science, practice semiology.

**Finally, realism is a social construct - claims of war and conflict create a false dichotomy between the evil “them” and the good “us” ignoring our role in provoking the aggression. Through interrogation of discourses we can change the way the US functions and ultimately bring about a more peaceful world**
**Grondin 4** (David, Masters in PoliSci and PhD Candidate @ University of Ottawa, “(Re)Writing the National Security State,” Center for United States Studies, p. 12-17)

Approaches that deconstruct theoretical practices … adds that it is by constantly articulating

**Thus, we advocate the following:**

**The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence in Afghanistan.**

**Contention II: Interrogating Discourse**

**Our interrogation of how we come to understand and represent Afghanistan is crucial to undermining cycles of violent and failed intervention. Imperial warfare is carried out through the way we produce knowledge about Afghanistan.**
**Crowe 7** (Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science @ York University, “The “Fuzzy Dream”: Discourse, Historical myths, and Militarized (in)Security - Interrogating dangerous myths of Afghanistan and the ‘West,” archive.sgir.eu/uploads/Crowe-loricrowe.pdf)

In an article entitled “Modern Hate”, authors Suzanne and Lloyd … and understand what is at stake in failing to do so.

**Policymaking is not a value-neutral endeavor. The discourse and representations we use construct the reality that we work with.**
**Crowe 7** (Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science @ York University, “The “Fuzzy Dream”: Discourse, Historical myths, and Militarized (in)Security - Interrogating dangerous myths of Afghanistan and the ‘West,” archive.sgir.eu/uploads/Crowe-loricrowe.pdf)

We need to navigate critically and cautiously through … who is benefiting and who is being disappeared?

**Foregrounding epistemological questions is the best, most politically productive way to debate – policymaking that excludes epistemological reflection is ethically bankrupt and prone to failure. This also devastates their roleplaying args – producing policy knowledge without epistemological reflection makes us slaves of the state and ensures our scholarship only bottlenecks into tried-and-failed policy models.**
**Smith 97** (Steve Smith, Professor and Pro-Vice Chancellor in the Department of International Studies at the University of Wales- Aberystwyth, 1997, Review of International Studies, Vol. 23, p. 514-516)

In my view, Wallace misrepresents the relationship… society in which we work and to which we are responsible.

**Here’s comparative evidence – determining the best epistemology and discourses to describe the world must come before determination of the best policies**
**Cheeseman and Bruce 96** (Graeme, Senior Lecturer @ New South Wales, Robert, Associate Professor in Social Sciences @ Curtin University, “Discourses of Danger and Dread Frontiers,” p.5)

This goal is pursued in ways which are still unconventional … resistant to them, or choose not to understand them, and why?

==Kritiks== 

====Kappeler K==== 

**The affirmative’s conception of the war in Afghanistan as something external from their own lives allows individuals to abdicate their accountability and responsibility for the war and for expressions of violence throughout the world. Posing questions about what the government should do erases questions about what we should do as individuals to fight personal militarism that’s the root cause of their 1AC impacts**
**Kappeler ‘95** [Susanne, Associate Professor at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to
Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior, pg. 10-11]
'We are the war' does not mean … the values of war and violence.

**Our alternative is to vote negative – this debate should be over methodologies. We should begin our search for an end to this war with examining our own will to violence and intervention. Only by politicizing the way we think about violence can we open up space to truly solve the 1AC harms**
**Kappeler ‘95** [Susanne, Associate Professor at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to
Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior, pg. 4-5]’
If we nevertheless continue to … for a non-violent society.

======2NC Framework Cards====== 

**The illusion of fiat lulls us into eternal reliance on the government – killing individual agency**
**Sartre 57** (Jean paul, Existentialism and Human Emotions, 29-32, gender edited)

As for despair, the term has a very … else than one’s life.”

**This loss of agency is the root cause of all war and kills value to life – makes death meaningless**
**DeBeauvoir 47**, gendered language said in context (Simone, French philosopher, “Personal Freedom and Others” The Ethics of Ambiguity)

Yet, he exists. By the fact of transcending … of ends which one claims are absolute.

======2NC AT: Cede the Political====== 

**No link – we are the opposite of ceding the political**
**Kappeler, 1995** [Susanne, Associate Professor at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to
Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior, pg. 18-20]

The question which poses … political decision.

======2NC Alt Solvency====== 

**The alt is comparatively better than demanding state action**
**Kappeler, 1995** [Susanne, Associate Professor at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to
Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior, pg. 6-7]

The feminist critique of … critique of ideology itself.

======2NC AT: Action Good====== 

**Our criticism is a precursor to effective activism – The decision to take action without evaluating our relationship to violence ensures the creation of an “action vacuum” that ensures nothing gets done**
**Kappeler, 1995** [Susanne, Associate Professor at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior, pg. 11-12]

So if we move beyond the … eternal present in which we inhabit states of being, our identity.


======2NC AT: Perm====== 

**More evidence - focusing on the actions of others is mutually exclusive to focusing on the individual and prevents truly liberatory action.**
**Nayar 99** (Jayan, Transnational Law & Contemporary Problems, Transitional Law and contemp Problems, L/N)

We are today bombarded by … locations and experiences revealed through and in human relationships.

====Futurism K==== 


**The affirmative’s apocalyptic narratives deflect anxiety from the death drive outwards onto the “Queer”, making violence the norm**
Giffney 8 (Noreen, Professor of Queer Theory at University College of Dublin, “Queering the Non/Human,” p. 65-7, Sydnor)

For Edelman, reproductive … mechanisms in motion’ (69).

**This death drive necessitates the destruction of life in order to secure the fantasy of immortality**
Edelman 4 (Lee, Prof @ Tuffman University, “No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive,” P. 47-9, Sydnor)

The death drive as which the.queer figures, then, refuses … force if needed, must give way?

Our alternative is to vote negative.

**Vote for death, destruction, and no tomorrow. We must accept our status as villains of society to disrupt the social order in a way that reclaims life from slavery.**
Edelman 4 (Lee, Prof @ Tuffman University, “No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive,” P. 29-31, Sydnor)

We might like to believe that with … intransitively—to insist that the future stop here.



====Whiteness K==== 


**The affirmative reifies whiteness- focusing the debate on whiteness makes into a monolith, sustaining the narcissism that elevates whiteness to a spectacle- this fixation makes “whiteness” more powerful**
**Ahmed**, University of London Race and Cultural studies reader, **2004**
[Sara, "Declarations of Whiteness: The Non-Performativity of Anti-Racism," Borderlands, Vol 3 No 2,
http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol3no2_2004/ahmed_declarations.htm, accessed 2-18-10, mss]

3. Whiteness studies is after all deeply … own whiteness, by transforming it into an object that could be loved.

**Vote negative as a rejection of the methodological grounding of the 1AC.** **While we agree with the goals of their project, they must be separated from the flawed epistemology in which they are couched. Only a negative ballot is able to make possible the type of progressive politics upon which their solvency is predicated.**
**Moore**, Homertown College senior lecturer in education, and Muller, University of Capetown education professor, **1999**
[Rob and Johan, "The discourse of 'voice' and the problem of knowledge and identity in the sociology of education," British Journal of
Sociology of Education, Vol 20, Iss 2, June 1999, proquest, accessed 2-17-10, mss]

Our purpose in this paper is to raise some … from untenable, allegedly related, epistemological ones' (ibid., p.34).

====Anti-Politics K (It's more of a DA)==== 

**They embrace anti-politics—this dooms their project and creates a vacuum filled by the right which causes extinction**
**Boggs ’97** (Carl Boggs, 1997 (National University, Los Angeles, The Great Retreat: Decline of the Public Sphere in Late Twentieth-Century America, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/international.olde/mias/readings07/10.pdf]]</span>.)

The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing … universal, collec-tive interests that had vanished from civil society.75

**Privileging representations and the micro-political encourages anti-politics—this is especially true in the manner in which they’ve deployed it:**
Carl **Boggs, 1997** (National University, Los Angeles, The Great Retreat: Decline of the Public Sphere in Late Twentieth-Century America, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/international.olde/mias/readings07/10.pdf]]</span>.)

Postmodernism and its offshoots … logic of a profoundly depoliticized culture.

**Moving away from anti-politics is vital to check extinction:**
Jonathan **Small &** Meg **Buckley, 2006** (former Americorps VISTA for the Human Services Coalition, “Moving Forward,” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/other/engagement/Journal/Issue7/Small.pdf]]</span>)

What will be the challenges of the new millennium? And how … look at the beginning stages of a project that seeks to do just that.

====Hillman K==== 

**War is foremost a psychological task – it structures the way we think about everything. The affirmative reduces war to an object of rational and empirical analysis. This is a repression of the sublimity of battle for objective military policymaking, continuously trying to create peace in a violent existence. Repression ensures that war will continue and makes extinction inevitable.**

**Our alternative is to vote negative to sympathetically imagine the wars the affirmative attempts to solve. Imagination allows us to enter war not in the name of peace but rather for war’s own sake.**
**Hillman 04** (James, Psychologist and Taught at Yale and Syracuse, A Terrible Love of War, p. 1-11, Sydnor)

ONE SENTENCE in one scene from one film, Patton, sums up … only to the edge of understanding. At that point a leap of imagination is called for, a leap into myth.

======2NC Stuff====== 


**This precedes other impacts – loss of Soul robs us of the connections to ourselves and others, making life and death meaningless.**
Hillman 89 (James, Psychologist and Taught at Yale and Syracuse, A Blue Fire, p. 17-8, Sydnor)


Anthropologists describe a condition ... us is "modern man in search of a soul."


**Their misunderstanding of war sustains wars to end conflict and make peace.**
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hillman 04</span></span> (James, Psychologist and Taught at Yale and Syracuse, __A Terrible Love of War__, p. 84, Sydnor)


So, to think in the pagan ...<span class="underline"> go abroad "waging peace</span>."


====Neohumanism K==== 

**A) The paradigm of the affirmative is flawed; their promotion of a biased and sentimental utilitarianism is the foundation for racial and social prejudice and it has led to the destruction of our environment. By always looking to ourselves or our personal “class” we merely perpetuate this false system of logic that will lead to extinction.**
Dada **Vedaprajinananda**, Writer for Amanda Marga, 8-22-**2008**, Global spiritual and social service organization, “Expanding Neohumanism”
http://www.anandamarga.org/articles/neohumanism.htm

==Specific Case Things== 

====Calhoun (DUBs)==== 

======Tungsten CP====== 

**Text: The United States federal government should remove all depleted uranium from weapons and equipment in Iraq and replace the depleted uranium in these weapons with tungsten alloy.**

**First, the counterplan is competitive – the plan explicitly removes all these weapons, but the counterplan keeps the weapons in Afghanistan and Iraq and fills them with a different substance. Any perm severs the removal of the weapons which is a voting issue because it makes them a moving target and kills neg counterplan and kritik ground. It also competes based on the net benefit – the counterplan wouldn’t link to the disad because it keeps the missiles there.**

**Second, the counterplan solves – we can keep the weapons and fill them with tungsten alloy which solves all the negative effects of depleted uranium**

**Vote negative as a rejection of the methodological grounding of the 1AC**

**While we agree with the goals of their project, they must be separated from the flawed epistemology in which they are couched. Only a negative ballot is able to make possible the type of progressive politics upon which their solvency is predicated.**

======**Whiteness CP**====== 



**Counterplan: Reredefine whiteness as anti-racist. Whiteness cannot be eliminated so people should work to transform whiteness into anti-racism to solve- Their notion of whiteness reifies white dominance- we must turn whiteness into something anti-racist to be able to effectively challenge racial domination**
Sullivan ‘8 (Shannon Sullivan.Penn State University Charles S. Peirce Society. Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society. Buffalo: 2008. Vol. 44, Iss. 2; pg. 236, 27 pgs)

Issac ‘2—Professor of Political Science at Indiana-Bloomington, Director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Public Life, PhD from Yale (Jeffery C., Dissent Magazine, Vol. 49, Iss. 2, “Ends, Means, and Politics,” p. Proquest)

As a result, the most important political questions … political effectiveness.

Utilitarianism inevitable even in deontological frameworks
Green, 02 – Assistant Professor Department of Psychology Harvard University (Joshua, November 2002 "The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Truth About Morality And What To Do About It", 314)

Some people who talk of balancing … sort of way or covertly consequentialist.

Utilitarianism is the only moral framework and alternatives are inevitability self-contradictory
Nye, 86 (Joseph S. 1986; Phd Political Science Harvard. University; Served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs; “Nuclear Ethics” pg. 18-19)

The significance and the limits of the two broad … of proof in the nuclear age than ever before.

We don’t link to their util bad claims- soft util checks- their cards assume a totalizing political stance that ignores suffering, however our single disad is an instance in which a government should not kill. We do not preclude their ethic but turn it- we are a pre-requisite- they cause total paralysis – we solve quality of life
Nye ‘86 (Joseph S. 1986; Phd Political Science Harvard. University; Served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs; “Nuclear Ethics” pg. 45-46)

======Consequentialism Good====== 

Only consequentialism can resolve conflicting moral values and promote healthy society

A consequentialist moral theory ... or to ignore them as if we lived in an ideal world.

In a nuclear world you have to weigh consequences
Bok ’88 (Sissela Bok, Professor of Philosophy @ Brandeis University, 1988, Applied Ethical Theory, ed. Rosenthal and Shehadi, pg. 203)

The same argument can be made for Kant’s ... because of the consequences.

The role of the judge is to evaluate terminal consequences of plan action. Any other framework condemns innocents to suffering.

Turn--elevating other values over life makes extinction certain. Life is both the means to an end and the end

Value to life is shaped subjectively not objectively- life is a pre-requisite to value to life- they justify mass slaughter and kill value to life- independently this thinking causes slavery and environmental destruction- empirically proven
Graham ’99 (Philip Graham School of Communication Queensland University of Technology, Heidegger’s Hippies Sep 15 1999 http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palms/8314/index.html)

There’s always value to life
Frankl (Holocaust Survivor) ’46 (Victor Frankl, Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at the University of Vienna, Man’s Search for Meaning, 1946, p. 104)

But I did not only talk of the future and … to find us suffering proudly—not miserably—knowing how to die.

Any single value is enough to make life worth living
Frankl (Holocaust Survivor) ’46 (Victor Frankl, Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at the University of Vienna, Man’s Search for Meaning, 1946, p. 104)

These efforts were usually concerned … will be able to bear almost any “how.”
