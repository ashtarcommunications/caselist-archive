==<span style="text-align: center;"><span style="display: block; line-height: 36px; text-align: center;">**__Crash 1AC__**</span></span>== 

I am beginning to be convinced that the maps we’ve been shown since grade school – of a vast United States and diverse world, with 5 oceans and 7 continents – is a lie, much like the cake. Instead, the world is confined to an area the size of the //supposed// Illinois, or Wisconsin. The world is only series of hotels, high schools, and airports, surrounded by water. We take off from Milwaukee Mitchell airport and circle in a plane for an hour before landing 50 miles away in Chicago. As proof of this I offer debate tournaments. Every tournament I go to sleep in sheboygan, only to find myself waking up in Chicago, East Lansing, Omaha … the location doesn’t matter, everything remains the same.
Even every city has become the same. It’s strange, you would think that you travel halfway across the world, and suddenly you’d think that everything would change. You’d think the atmosphere is different, the way people act, the road signs. Yet, if there’s anything I’ve learned from going to debate tournament after debate tournament, it’s that every city is the same. Every place has it’s bad part of town, every city has a main street, a first street, a second, third etc. There’s always a McDonalds in the business part of town. The roads we take to get there seem just one more endless, on going path towards its own sad end.
There is no new place anymore, no small diner to eat at that we’re never heard of, no new beautiful scenery that makes you stop the car, run outside and enjoy the world. No. No, now there is just the road to the tournament, to the hotel, to home and repeat. Capitalism has taken complete control of our life, it’s created the endless cycle of our existence, in which just one more car on the road. Life is all but precious. It’s like the world is now just a series of hotel suits. We leave the Milwaukee breakfast buffet, we enter into the Winnetka room, move down the hall to get food in Glenview, then we move a floor down and we’re in the Boston suit. How convenient it is that hotels have begun to name their conference rooms accordingly because even they realize that trulyis the condition of our world. The cycle has been entrenched in every part of life. Kevin Kuswa describes the current state of transportation, but also life:<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">[[file:///C:/Users/CHRIS/Dropbox/Marquette%20Debate/Files/2012-2013%20Transportation%20Infrastructure/Kritikal%20Affirmatives/Crash/New%20Trier%201AC.docx#_ftn1|**[1]**]]</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif; font-size: 13pt;">Beginning with...</span><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif; font-size: 8pt;">(Flink, 1988, pvii).</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">Not only has life lost its beauty, but we’ve begun to desire such loss. We’ve been within this cyclical route of transportation, of capital and logic for so long that we’ve begun to desire that repression. This is what Deleuze and Guattari call “micro-fascism,” the point at which we internalize such straititation, such repetitive monotonous life of capitalism and control. We can see this in the way we speak in debate, the inevitable nuclear war of every journey, the spread, moving from debate tournament to debate tournament, from road to road. All life has begun to resemble this process, from the construction of roads for the flow of capital, to the naming of hotel suits, all in line with the same common theme: Everywhere is the same, every day is the same, everything is just another flow of capital. My partner and I believe this is the worst possible world, the worst of all impacts. Not only is our value of life negated by the system we live within, pushing on another inevitable journey with the same stops along the way, but more so, we ourselves have begun to desire this repression. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">Yet, there is an alternative to this world, one in which we can break the holds of power, break this repetitive cycle: We can veer away from this road, from moving to place to place to place to place, and we can crash. We can break away from the world as it is, create a crack, a line of flight, which we may embrace to remove us from this system.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">But the current system of both life and transportation try to negate these crashes, these inevitable cracks in our “perfect” system. With every increase of the system there is always an increase of these crashes. Think about it very literally. With every new road there is always another risk of a crash. The point is not to negate these crashes but to embrace them as a moment of transfiguration. These accidents give us a moment of flight.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">Thus, in affirming this topic requires more than just affirming the increase of transportation infrastructure investment, but it also requires us to affirm what the entails: The accident. Therefore, Chris and I are resolved, that we should increase our transportation infrastructure investment in the United States, by affirming the accident that is the inevitable result of what this topic entails. </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">This embrace of the accident forces people to rethink their lives, to question what they want – It creates a moment of sheer consciousness. This creates a line of flight, a single brief moment of escape from the world. J. G. Ballard embraces these accidents quite literally in his book //Crash//. He begins by analyzing the monotonous existence we face, compared to the moments of sheer ecstasy and clarity that persists within the accident. Jay McRoy analyzes this work and its potential to shake the reader away from such a monotonous life:[[file:///C:/Users/CHRIS/Dropbox/Marquette%20Debate/Files/2012-2013%20Transportation%20Infrastructure/Kritikal%20Affirmatives/Crash/New%20Trier%201AC.docx#_ftn2|**[2]**]]</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif; font-size: 8pt;">For the characters [...] through transformation.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua',serif;">We will now provide an accident within this debate round, both as a crash away from traditional debate styles, but also a literal accident via a reading of //Crash//. Be warned, the accident is both beautiful and disturbing. Yet, it is this juxtaposition of beauty and pain that provides us with such a crash that breaks us away from everyday life. It requires bravery to embrace the chaos that is the basis of all existence. We ask you to embrace this accident within the debate round as a sight of your own crash, a crash of the cycle of though, of debate and of life.

__First__, Their conception of the highway machine as the ultimate solution for the US means that the Oedipal becomes a normalized part of everyday life, codifying our desires to produce carbon copies of individuals. Society constructs and embraces it. The transportation machine allows Capitalism to combine its life with our life unnoticed, destroying the beauty in human life

When confronted with the accident, we are faced with two choices. Instead of running back to the arms of the state and capitalism, demanding more safety, these deaths ought to remind us of the lack of control we have over our life. These accidents are lines of flight that allow us to fight back against the Oedipal and disillusion others, opening ourselves up to the chaos that is the basis of life
