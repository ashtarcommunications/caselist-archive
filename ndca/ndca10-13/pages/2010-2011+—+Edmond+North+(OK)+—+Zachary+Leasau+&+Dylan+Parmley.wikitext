=Affirmative= 

Observation 1: Our nationalizing fear of violence has sparked form the collapse of the world trade towers gave way to an irrational fear of 'unknown terrorists' Our ongoing attempts at eliminating the threat of the 'unknown other' has shaped international policy and has produced on going violence in the name of eliminating terrorists. This culminated fear has driven a damaged democracy, and resulted of fears of the replication of the cold war and nuclear winter.

**__We were promised that invating..... life on earth and elsewhere.__**
The Incirlik airbase is the northern base that feeds troops to fight terrorists. Without its existence, the 'War on Terror" Likely would have never materialized and would not continue
Ashgar 07 (The US and the West has no Moral Authority to Lecture the People of Turkey on Genocide)
**__Turkye's threat to limit..... in the kurdish regions of Turkey directly.__**
Thus the plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its military presence at Incirlik.

Observation 2: The 'War on terror has spread across boundries, allies now take up arms and use 'terrorist' as an all encompasing label to quash insurgencies against the government. US presence has allowed the Turkish government to label kurds as terrorists
Fatah 06 ("The accepted Genocide of Kurds in Turkey")
**__Since the American genocide.... Kurds in turkey today__**
This specific form of violence marginalized all of the east as middle eastern, foreign, and threatning. These labels are what rationalize violence and naturalize hegemony.

**__Edward Said shatters... within the United States and 'elsewhere'__**
Our plan affirms a unique value to all lives our death is inevitable, but begging for us to fear it crushes the value life has before death
Polakova 04 (The struggle for human dignity in extreme situations)
**__An animal which finds itself.... value orientation and attachment__**
Observation 3: We cut off our nose to spite our face, current U.S. policy continues to take an autoimmune response where the body fights itself. This auto-immune response replicates itself, creating cycles of violence that can only be stopped through the evaluation of American hegemony
Derrida 01 (As interviewed by Giovanna Borradori "9/11 and Global Terroism A Dialogue with Jacques Derrida)
**__Those called 'terrorists' are.... incomplete enlightenment I was talking about.__**
The label for the War on Terror is what mobilized the world to shirk international policy in the first place, to view all violent actions as necessary, quick, and morally righteous. While international cooperation may be key to a new form of rights, the current system lacks authority and purpose to act in a way that reconceptualizes eurocentric thought
Derrida 01 (As interviewed by Giovanna Borradori "9/11 and Global Terroism A Dialogue with Jacques Derrida)
**__I was in Shanghai...is also working to destablize them... [paragraph ends, no breaks in text]__**
A Derridean acceptance of the other allows us to be open to non-violent solutions in order to stop violence rather than suspending ourselves to the status quo mindset. Our affirmative serves as the blanket that obscures origin in order to embrace and re-interpret a genology of morals
Grosz 03 ("The time of Violence," Violence and the body: race, gender, and the state)
**__If derrida refuses... repeat the genealogy of morals__**

Observation four: Negotiating the non-negotiable, A deconstruction of current democracy is key to the plan for three reasons
1. It dis-associates from our current democratic interpretations
2. It exposes teh use of anti-democratic measures in order to preserve democracy
3. It promotes an ontological understanding of the 'other'
Ferguson 07 (Sovereignty, Democracy, Autoimmunity)
**__What derrida does do.... requires undemocratic exclusions__**
The deconstruction of Democracy is what solves for the auto-immunitary response that is a root cause of violence in foreign policy and international relations
Mansfield 08 (Sovereighnty as its Own Question: Derrida's Rouges" Contemporary Political Theory Journal)
**__The logic of sovereignty... politics, but at issue.__**
Our combination of Derridean ethics and policy are key to deconstruction terrorism. We must negotiate the non negotiable to solve
Reynolds 06 (Theory and Event Journal "Negotiating the Non Negotiable")
**__In relation to this... of politics and ethics__**
Public debate is a crucial forum to contest racist political discourse, failure to do so shapes public opinion in a way that authorizes xenophobic violence and paralyzes rights movements
Head 05 
**__to combat racism... these contexts include public debate...__**
The only chance at change occurs when the political can speak to and be heard by the abstract. Generic Criticisms of the status quo in hopes of new ideaology creates the exact conditions that allow politicians the ability to ignore our calls to action rendering all discussion normative and meaningless. It is only through setting specific end points to our idealism that we can truly achieve change
Lutz 2k (Political Theory and Partisan Politics P 39-40)
**__In order to understand... a continuum stretching from left to right__**
We feel that there is more than one way to affirm the topic. Instead of constantly focusing on possible outcomes, we ask you to evaluate the method by which we affirm. When you vote for our method you are voting that we must interrogate current conceptions of identity in order to break away from facism. You vote to reject these notions at all costs because these identities are what strap us into our current us/them dichotomy.
Foucault 72 (Anti-Oedipus)
**__the major enemy is facism... how does on keep from being facist...__**
