Advantage 2 is Prompt Global Strike --
A transition to conventional PGS inevitable

Development of responsive space<span class="underline0"> … small spacecraft </span>will transform the way we perform<span class="underline0"> traditional space </span>missions<span class="underline0">.</span>

**Scenario 1 is deterrence:**
PGS locks in conventional superiority that’s key to overall deterrence – nukes are not enough
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kerber & Stein 09</span> – Co-Chairs of the Defense Science Board [Dr. Ronald Kerber (Visiting Professor at Darden Business School at the University of Virginia and Masters and Doctorate degrees in engineering science from California Institute of Technology) & Dr. Robert Stein (Raytheon's Director of Advanced Programs), “Time Critical Conventional Strike from Strategic Standoff,” Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, March 2009]

An integrated Command, Control, and Communication (C3) is a second key enabler that is critical to effectively providing national leadership with a prompt global strike option. </span>

Conventional PGS solves without nuke use --- penetrates enemy defenses

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the current international security environment, </span>conventional deterrence<span class="underline0"> can be </span>useful <span class="underline0">…</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> our analysis is centered on </span><span class="underline0">conventional deterrence </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">before conflict begins, we will briefly examine the role of deterrence and other forms of military coercion at the outset of conflict to demonstrate how threats of force - including the limited use of force - </span><span class="underline0">can help deter escalation and terminate conflicts.</span>


Failure to upgrade conventionals is the worse-case scenario for global security.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The argument for CBMs in the expanded mission is twofold. One rationale is …</span>(ICBMs) are based at fixed sites, and U.S. CBMs could<span class="underline0"> be used to</span>undertake a preventive or preemptive strike against their silos<span class="underline0"> or soft-site launch pads, or to functionally defeat their exit from secure storage sites.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24 </span>

US-China war causes extinction

<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">THE high-intensity scenario postulates </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US ….</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;"> of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">we would see the destruction of civilization.</span>



**Scenario 3 is terrorism**

PGS is key to handling time-critical high-value targets --- solves terrorism and rogue nuclear attacks

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the rationale for deploying thousands …</span><span class="underline0"> nuclear strike missions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In theory, this could clear the way for further cuts in deployed nuclear forces. </span>


<span style="font-size: 12pt;">That escalates to full-scale nuclear war </span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Accordingly, </span>there is a significant and ever-present risk that terrorists <span class="underline0">…</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> widespread proliferation of nuclear weapons. n51 This proliferation will increase the risk of nuclear attacks against the United States [*1440] or its allies by hostile states, n52 as well as increase the likelihood that regional conflicts will draw in the United States and escalate to the use of nuclear weapons.</span>
