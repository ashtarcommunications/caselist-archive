Most adaptation strategies aim to make infrastructure more
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">AND </span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">into existing agency and business structures and practices.</span>

While <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">many adaptations will occur at the state </span>
AND
and long time horizon of many climate impacts.
====Even if we don’t win solvency other countries will follow us – that means we spill over globally==== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Wirth et al 3</span> (Timothy E, President of the UN Foundation – along with C. Boyden Gray and John D. Podesta – also of the UN Foundation, “The Future of Energy Policies,” Foreign Affairs, July/August, p. 132, lexis).

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Energy is a common thread weaving through the </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">beyond its borders and far into the future.</span>
====Improving public transit is an issue of social justice---it affects health, crime rates, safety, sexism, racism, and multiple other forms of suffering and exploitation====

Access to transportation has important implications for
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">AND </span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">buses, new routes, and night owls.</span>


===Contention 6: Natives=== 
====Deficient tribal infrastructure impedes public safety intervention====

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">Surface transportation in Indian Country involves thousands of </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">AND </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">will create jobs and make Native economies stronger.</span>

I don't need to reiterate the importance of
AND
of the very people that we are representing.

Environmental racism is a form of institutionalized discrimination
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">AND </span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in constant fear of plant explosions and accidents.</span>

====The federal government has the moral and legal right to carry out the plan --- states also fail because of encroachment on Native territory====
