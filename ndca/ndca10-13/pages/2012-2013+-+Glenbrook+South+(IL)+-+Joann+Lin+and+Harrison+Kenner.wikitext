Instead, what we are now seeing is a whole cluster of oil-related clashes stretching across the globe, involving a dozen or so countries, with more popping up all the time. Consider these flash-points as signals that we are entering an era of intensified conflict over energy. From the Atlantic to the Pacific, Argentina to the Philippines, here are the six areas of conflict — all tied to energy supplies — that have made news in just the first few months of 2012: * A brewing war between Sudan and South Sudan: On April 10th, forces from the newly independent state of South Sudan occupied the oil center of Heglig, a town granted to Sudan as part of a peace settlement that allowed the southerners to secede in 2011. The northerners, based in Khartoum, then mobilized their own forces and drove the South Sudanese out of Heglig. Fighting has since erupted all along the contested border between the two countries, accompanied by air strikes on towns in South Sudan. Although the fighting has not yet reached the level of a full-scale war, international efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and a peaceful resolution to the dispute have yet to meet with success. This conflict is being fueled by many factors, including economic disparities between the two Sudans and an abiding animosity between the southerners (who are mostly black Africans and Christians or animists) and the northerners (mostly Arabs and Muslims). But oil — and the revenues produced by oil — remains at the heart of the matter. When Sudan was divided in 2011, the most prolific oil fields wound up in the south, while the only pipeline capable of transporting the south’s oil to international markets (and thus generating revenue) remained in the hands of the northerners. They have been demanding exceptionally high “transit fees” — $32-$36 per barrel compared to the common rate of $1 per barrel — for the privilege of bringing the South’s oil to market. When the southerners refused to accept such rates, the northerners confiscated money they had already collected from the south’s oil exports, its only significant source of funds. In response, the southerners stopped producing oil altogether and, it appears, launched their military action against the north. The situation remains explosive. * Naval clash in the South China Sea: On April 7th, a Philippine naval warship, the 378-foot Gregorio del Pilar, arrived at Scarborough Shoal, a small island in the South China Sea, and detained eight Chinese fishing boats anchored there, accusing them of illegal fishing activities in Filipino sovereign waters. China promptly sent two naval vessels of its own to the area, claiming that the Gregorio del Pilar was harassing Chinese ships in Chinese, not Filipino waters. The fishing boats were eventually allowed to depart without further incident and tensions have eased somewhat. However, neither side has displayed any inclination to surrender its claim to the island, and both sides continue to deploy warships in the contested area. As in Sudan, multiple factors are driving this clash, but energy is the dominant motive. The South China Sea is thought to harbor large deposits of oil and natural gas, and all the countries that encircle it, including China and the Philippines, want to exploit these reserves. Manila claims a 200-nautical mile “exclusive economic zone” stretching into the South China Sea from its western shores, an area it calls the West Philippine Sea; Filipino companies say they have found large natural gas reserves in this area and have announced plans to begin exploiting them. Claiming the many small islands that dot the South China Sea (including Scarborough Shoal) as its own, Beijing has asserted sovereignty over the entire region, including the waters claimed by Manila; it, too, has announced plans to drill in the area. Despite years of talks, no solution has yet been found to the dispute and ffurther clashes are likely. * Egypt cuts off the natural gas flow to Israel: On April 22nd, the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation and Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Companyinformed Israeli energy officials that they were “terminating the gas and purchase agreement” under which Egypt had been supplying gas to Israel. This followed months of demonstrations in Cairo by the youthful protestors who succeeded in deposing autocrat Hosni Mubarak and are now seeking a more independent Egyptian foreign policy — one less beholden to the United States and Israel. It also followed scores of attacks on the pipelines carrying the gas across the Negev Desert to Israel, which the Egyptian military has seemed powerless to prevent. Ostensibly, the decision was taken in response to a dispute over Israeli payments for Egyptian gas, but all parties involved have interpreted it as part of a drive by Egypt’s new government to demonstrate greater distance from the ousted Mubarak regime and his (U.S.-encouraged) policy of cooperation with Israel. The Egyptian-Israeli gas link was one of the most significant outcomes of the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries, and its annulment clearly signals a period of greater discord; it may also cause energy shortages in Israel, especially during peak summer demand periods. On a larger scale, the cutoff suggests a new inclination to use energy (or its denial) as a form of political warfare and coercion. * Argentina seizes YPF: On April 16th, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, announced that her government would seize a majority stake in YPF, the nation’s largest oil company. Under President Kirchner’s plans, which she detailed on national television, the government would take a 51% controlling stake in YPF, which is now majority-owned by Spain’s largest corporation, the energy firm Repsol YPF. The seizure of its Argentinean subsidiary is seen in Madrid (and other European capitals) as a major threat that must now be combated. Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel García Margallo, said that Kirchner’s move “broke the climate of cordiality and friendship that presided over relations between Spain and Argentina.” Several days later, in what is reported to be only the first of several retaliatory steps, Spain announced that it would stop importing biofuels from Argentina, its principal supplier — a trade worth nearly $1 billion a year to the Argentineans. As in the other conflicts, this clash is driven by many urges, including a powerful strain of nationalism stretching back to the Peronist era, along with Kirchner’s apparent desire to boost her standing in the polls. Just as important, however, is Argentina’s urge to derive greater economic and political benefit from its energy reserves, which include the world’s third-largest deposits of shale gas. While long-term rival Brazil is gaining immense power and prestige from the development of its offshore “pre-salt”petroleum reserves, Argentina has seen its energy production languish. Repsol may not be to blame for this, but many Argentineans evidently believe that, with YPF under government control, it will now be possible to accelerate development of</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">the country’s energy endowment, possibly in collaboration with a more aggressive foreign partner like BP or ExxonMobil. * Argentina re-ignites the Falklands crisis: At an April 15th-16th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia — the one at which U.S. Secret Service agents were caught fraternizing with prostitutes — Argentina sought fresh hemispheric condemnation of Britain’s continued occupation of the Falkland Islands (called Las Malvinas by the Argentineans). It won strong support from every country present save (predictably) Canada and the United States. Argentina, which says the islands are part of its sovereign territory, has been raising this issue ever since it lost a war over the Falklands in 1982, but has recently stepped up its campaign on several fronts — denouncing London in numerous international venues and preventing British cruise ships that visit the Falklands from docking in Argentinean harbors. The British have responded by beefing up their military forces in the region and warning the Argentineans to avoid any rash moves. When Argentina and the U.K. fought their war over the Falklands, little was at stake save national pride, the stature of the country’s respective leaders (Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher vs. an unpopular military junta), and a few sparsely populated islands. Since then, the stakes have risen immeasurably as a result of recent seismic surveys of the waters surrounding the islands that indicated the existence of massive deposits of oil and natural gas. Several UK-based energy firms, including Desire Petroleum and Rockhopper Exploration, have begun off-shore drilling in the area and have reported promising discoveries. Desperate to duplicate Brazil’s success in the development of offshore oil and gas, Argentina claims the discoveries lie in its sovereign territory and that the drilling there is illegal; the British, of course, insist that it’s their territory. No one knows how this simmering potential crisis will unfold, but a replay of the 1982 war — this time over energy — is hardly out of the question. * U.S. forces mobilize for war with Iran: Throughout the winter and early spring, it appeared that an armed clash of some sort pitting Iran against Israel and/or the United States was almost inevitable. Neither side seemed prepared to back down on key demands, especially on Iran’s nuclear program, and any talk of a compromise solution was deemed unrealistic. Today, however, the risk of war has diminished somewhat – at least through this election year in the U.S. — as talks have finally gotten under way between the major powers and Iran, and as both have adopted (slightly) more accommodating stances. In addition, U.S. officials have been tamping down war talk and figures in the Israeli military and intelligence communities have spoken out against rash military actions. However, the Iranians continue to enrich uranium, and leaders on all sides say they are fully prepared to employ force if the peace talks fail. For the Iranians, this means blocking the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow channel through which one-third of the world’s tradable oil passes every day. The U.S., for its part, has insisted that it will keep the Strait open and, if necessary, eliminate Iranian nuclear capabilities. Whether to intimidate Iran, prepare for the real thing, or possibly both, the U.S. has been building up its military capabilities in the Persian Gulf area, deploying two aircraft carrier battle groupsin the neighborhood along with an assortment of air and amphibious-assault capabilities. One can debate the extent to which Washington’s long-running feud with Iran is driven by oil, but there is no question that the current crisis bears heavily on global oil supply prospects, both through Iran’s threats to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation for forthcoming sanctions on Iranian oil exports, and the likelihood that any air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities will lead to the same thing. Either way, the U.S. military would undoubtedly assume the lead role in destroying Iranian military capabilities and restoring oil traffic through the Strait of Hormuz. This is the energy-driven crisis that just won’t go away. How Energy Drives the World All of these disputes have one thing in common: the conviction of ruling elites around the world that the possession of energy assets — especially oil and gas deposits — is essential to prop up national wealth, power, and prestige. This is hardly a new phenomenon. Early in the last century, Winston Churchill was perhaps the first prominent leader to appreciate the strategic importance of oil. As First Lord of the Admiralty, he converted British warships from coal to oil and then persuaded the cabinet to nationalize the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the forerunner of British Petroleum (now BP). The pursuit of energy supplies for both industry and war-fighting played a major role in the diplomacy of the period between the World Wars, as well as in the strategic planning of the Axis powers during World War II. It also explains America’s long-term drive to remain the dominant power in the Persian Gulf that culminated in the first Gulf War of 1990-91 and its inevitable sequel, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The years since World War II have seen a variety of changes in the energy industry, including a shift in many areas from private to state ownership of oil and natural gas reserves. By and large, however, the industry has been able to deliver ever-increasing quantities of fuel to satisfy the ever-growing needs of a globalizing economy and an expanding, rapidly urbanizing world population. So long as supplies were abundant and prices remained relatively affordable, energy consumers around the world, including most governments, were largely content with the existing system of collaboration among private and state-owned energy leviathans. But that energy equation is changing ominously as the challenge of fueling the planet grows more difficult. Many of the giant oil and gas fields that quenched the world’s energy thirst in years past are being depleted at a rapid pace. The new fields being brought on line to take their place are, on average, smaller and harder to exploit. Many of the most promising new sources of energy — like Brazil’s “pre-salt” petroleum reserves deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean, Canadian tar sands, and American shale gas – require the utilization of sophisticated and costly technologies. Though global energy supplies are continuing to grow, they are doing so at a slower pace than in the past and are continually falling short of demand. All this adds to the upward pressure on prices, causing anxiety among countries lacking adequate domestic reserves (and joy among those with an abundance). The world has long been bifurcated between energy-surplus and energy-deficit states, with the former deriving enormous political and economic advantages from their privileged condition and the latter struggling mightily to escape their subordinate position. Now, that bifurcation is looking more like a chasm. In such a global environment, friction and conflict over oil and gas reserves — leading to energy conflicts of all sorts — is only likely to increase. Looking, again, at April’s six energy disputes, one can see clear evidence of these underlying forces in every case. South Sudan is desperate to sell its oil in order to acquire the income needed to kick-start its economy; Sudan, on the other hand, resents the loss of oil revenues it controlled when the nation was still united, and appears no less determined to keep as much of the South’s oil money as it can for itself. China and the Philippines both want the right to develop oil and gas reserves in the South China Sea, and even if the deposits around Scarborough Shoal prove meager, China is unwilling to back down in any localized dispute that might undermine its claim to sovereignty over the entire region. Egypt, although not a major energy producer, clearly seeks to employ its oil and gas supplies for maximum political and economic advantage — an approach sure to be copied by other small and mid-sized suppliers. Israel, heavily dependent on imports for its energy, must now turn elsewhere for vital supplies or accelerate the development of disputed, newly discovered offshore gas fields, a move that could provoke fresh conflict with Lebanon, which says they lie in its own territorial waters. And Argentina, jealous of Brazil’s growing clout, appears determined to extract greater advantage from its own energy resources, even if this means inflaming tensions with Spain and Great Britain. And these are just some of the countries involved in significant disputes over energy. Any clash with Iran — whatever the motivation — is bound to jeopardize the petroleum supply of every oil-importing country, sparking a major international crisis with unforeseeable consequences. China’s determination to control its offshore hydrocarbon reserves has pushed it into conflict with other countries with offshore claims in the South China Sea, and into a similar dispute with Japan in the East China Sea. Energy-related disputes of this sort can also be found in the Caspian Sea and in globally warming, increasingly ice-free Arctic regions. The seeds of energy conflicts and war sprouting in so many places simultaneously suggest that we are entering a new period in which key state actors will be more inclined to employ force — or the threat of force — to gain control over valuable deposits of oil and natural gas. In other words, we’re now on a planet heading into energy overdrive.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Now is key – conflict over the Spratly Islands is going to escalate</span>**
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">**O’Reilly 12** [Brendan O'Reilly, Asia Times “China walks tightrope over troubled waters”[[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/NG06Ad01.html]], June 2012]</span>//<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">BM</span>//

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Geopolitical shifts are upsetting the waters of the South China Sea, as both China and Vietnam take a three-pronged approach to strengthen their claims over the Spratly Islands. Military posturing, legal maneuvers, and economic strategies are being used by both sides to shore up their respective assertions of sovereignty over the contested islands. The intensification of the struggle for the Spratly Islands comes at a politically crucial time for the region. This quarrel over minor islands could have major global ramifications. The recent escalation of the long-standing dispute began on June 15, when the Vietnamese air force conducted a patrol over the Spratly Islands (called the "Truong Sa" by Vietnam and the "Nansha" by China). Senior Vietnamese lieutenant colonel Ngo Vinh Phuc claimed that such patrols would become a routine occurrence, saying: "The regiment decided that after the first flight to Truong Sa, it will be our regular duty, and we are always ready for it once we receive orders…With the flight, we want to reiterate once again that we will be always ready to protect the country's sacred sovereignty over seas and islands." [1] China (along with Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines) disputes Vietnam's claims of sovereignty over the Spratlys. In response to the perceived Vietnamese provocation, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng announced the deployment of armed Chinese patrols in the disputed maritime region: "In order to protect national sovereignty and our security and development interests, the Chinese military has already set up a normal, combat-ready patrol system in seas under our control…"[2] Vietnam and China are inching closer to a possible armed confrontation, with neither side willing to back down. Both governments are utilizing political tactics to complement their military maneuvers. On June 21, the Vietnamese National Assembly passed the long-considered "Vietnamese Law of the Sea". This decree stipulates that the entirety of both the Spratly and the Paracel Islands are integral territories of Vietnam. After the passage of this law, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced, "China strongly protests and firmly opposes such a move by Vietnam." China's Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun further condemned the Vietnamese move as "illegal, invalid and detrimental to peace and stability in the South China Sea."[3] Within hours of the passage of the "Vietnamese Law of the Sea", China's State Council approved plans for the establishment of a new prefecture-level city, Sansha, with jurisdiction over the contested area. The Spratly Islands, the Paracel Islands, and Macclesfield Bank now constitute "Sansha" (literally "Thee Sands"), officially the largest and southernmost city in the People's Republic of China, although it has no permanent residents. The establishment of Sansha is a significant legal tactic to solidify China's claims over the islands. The move was described by a Ministry of Civil Affairs spokesman as an important step to "further strengthen China's administration and development" of the disputed region. [4] The Chinese government is discussing the possibility of setting up a permanent military presence in order to protect its newest "city". There is also a strong economic component to the current standoff. The state-run China National Offshore Oil Cooperation (CNOOC) recently offered tenders to foreign companies to jointly develop extraction capabilities in the contested region. Vietnam claims that some of these zones lie in the undisputed continental shelf of Vietnam. The Vietnamese government has already has been jointly exploring some of these areas with Exxon Mobil, as well as Russia's Gazprom and Indian ONGC Videh. Passions are running high in Vietnam, as authorities allowed a rare unofficial protest in central Hanoi. Hundreds of demonstrators marched through the rain to the Chinese embassy on Sunday. Many were chanting "Down with China" as local police blocked traffic and cordoned off the embassy. [5] The Strategic background The timing of the ongoing military, economic, and political posturing of China and Vietnam is significant for several reasons. First, the escalation of tensions between China and Vietnam comes at the same time as an easing of frictions between China and the Philippines. The Chinese and Filipino governments have reached a verbal agreement for both nations to pull back their naval forces from within the lagoon of the disputed Scarborough Shoal. Filipino Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario has confirmed that Chinese warships have withdrawn from the area. On the Chinese side, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei confirmed that the trend in the disputed region is "is overall toward peace."[6] That tensions between Vietnam and China are heating up while the rift between the Philippines and China seems to be cooling off is noteworthy. China has been accused by some observers of attempting "divide and rule" tactics towards its neighbors in the South China Sea. Regardless of semantics, it seems prudent for Beijing to focus on one disputant at a time. Taken individually, rival claimants in the South China Sea cannot hope to come close to countering Beijing's political, economic, and military prowess. Furthermore, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN) Foreign Minister Meeting is scheduled to being July 9 in Cambodia. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is expected to attend the meeting. Disputes over the South China Sea are sure to dominate the discussion. The upcoming ASEAN meeting provides added motivation for both China and Vietnam to solidify their legal claims over the Spratly Islands. Both sides are jockeying for position in order to strengthen their case before the ASEAN conference takes place. China has specifically claimed that the Vietnamese moves are "illegal" in the context of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. This Declaration, agreed upon by ASEAN members and China, explicitly states "The Parties concerned undertake to resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means, without resorting to the threat or use of force…" China considers the Vietnamese air force flights and unilateral claims of sovereignty as a violation of this agreement. Thirdly, India, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ROK) held their first trilateral "dialogue" in New Delhi on June 29. Although disputes in the South China Sea were not specifically mentioned,</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Indian External Affairs Secretary Sanjay Singh stressed: "There is common commitment to maintaining freedom of the seas, combating terrorism and promoting inclusive economic growth. India, Japan and ROK depend heavily on the Sea Lanes of Communications (SLOCs) for their energy security."[7] Clearly the reference to "maintaining freedom of the seas" is a reference to concerns over conflicting claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea. That India, Japan, and South Korea have jointly reaffirmed their commitment to the free flow of maritime traffic as tensions mount between China and Vietnam is extremely relevant. China increasingly views India as a strategic factor in the South China Sea. Furthermore, South Korea and Japan (as well as China itself) are both enormously reliant on the imported energy that goes through the disputed maritime region. Clearly, India, Japan, and the ROK have an interest in keeping the South China Sea from becoming a Chinese lake, while at the same time avoiding open conflict. Finally, the ratcheting up of tensions between China and Vietnam is taking place at the same time as the annual Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) naval exercises off the coast of Hawaii. Twenty-two nations are participating in this year's RIMPAC, including regional US allies such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea. Even Russia is sending a vessel to join in the massive coordinated training mission. China is notably absent, while Vietnam is conspicuously present as an observer of the exercises. The 2012 RIMPAC exercises brought together a host of Pacific powers, which are to various degrees wary of a rising China. The United States and its allies are keeping a close eye on the potential flashpoint of the South China Sea. For years the US has been trying to "internationalize" the South China Sea dispute by offering to help negotiations. In 2010, Clinton announced in Vietnam "The United States has a national interest in freedom of navigation, open access to Asia's maritime commons and respect for international law in the South China Sea."[8] One can expect further expressions of concern over the issue from Clinton at the upcoming ASEAN meeting. Cold War in warm waters? Despite the ongoing tensions, it is in both China and Vietnam's interest to avoid open conflict over the Spratly Islands. China has little to gain from starting a military struggle that could threaten its spectacular economic rise, and Vietnam can't rely on external intervention to sufficiently balance China's military edge. Neither country wants a repeat of their bloody 1979 border war. Although tough talk on both sides has international implications, such rhetoric is meant primarily for domestic consumption. It should be noted that military forces from the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Taiwan-based Republic of China (ROC), Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia have been stationed in the Spratly Islands for some years, without a single combat-related casualty. There does remain the possibility of a miscalculation or a miscommunication leading to a major military clash. In this eventuality, the geopolitical ramifications could be enormous. Washington views the South China Sea impasse as an important lever from which to extract geopolitical leverage from Beijing. The US government is examining all contingencies for how to handle or possibly thwart the rising clout of China. The United States has strong military, economic, and political ties with the Philippines, and is keen on developing closer relations with Vietnam. For their part, the Philippines and Vietnam see American power as a possible counterbalance to China's regional superiority. The United States is seeking to win international sympathy and prestige by portraying itself as an honest broker seeking to establish a "rule-based mechanism" for dealing with the South China Sea disputes. The American government is also trying to shore up alliances with regional countries uneasy of China's profound and continuing rise. Furthermore, a cornerstone of the much-discussed US "pivot" towards Asia is a plan to base 60% of the US navy in the Pacific. Meanwhile, the Chinese government is engaged in a difficult balancing act. On the one hand, the People's Republic of China must play a strong hand in order to solidify its claims over the resource-rich South China Sea. Domestic politics are important - the Communist Party of China cannot appear weak, especially regarding perceived provocations from smaller nations. It should be noted that the governments of both the People's Republic of China and the Taiwan-based Republic of China have long asserted total Chinese sovereignty over the disputed area. On the other hand, it is in China's long-term interests to avoid a military clash for two important reasons. First, China's economic rise could be threatened by the unpredictable effects of open military conflict, especially in the vicinity of vital shipping lanes. Second, China does not want to frighten its neighbors into the open arms of the United States. It should be noted that China did not initiate the latest round of tensions with Vietnam. Rather, China retaliated for each Vietnamese move, both militarily and politically. This policy of retaliation, rather than instigation, is indicative of the Chinese balancing act in the region. Chinese state media often complains of a "Cold War mentality" polluting the political landscape in the United States. Indeed, despite claims to the contrary, the US strategic pivot towards Asia is almost certainly aimed primarily at containing China. Sixty percent of the US fleet is rather overkill for containing the regional ambitions of a half-starving North Korea. The problem with a "Cold War mentality" is that such thinking is profoundly outdated. The United States may be the longstanding strategic ally of Japan and South Korea, but China is their largest trading partner. Even India, the much-touted "lynchpin" of the United States' Asia-Pacific strategy, does more trade with the People's Republic than it does with Uncle Sam. America's Asian allies are increasingly moving into China's ever-growing economic orbit. Furthermore, the United States and China are so economically mutually dependent as to render open conflict profoundly unwise. The Chinese government is unlikely to risk their long-term strategic interests with overly aggressive military adventurism. China will retaliate in kind for any military, political, or economic moves by other disputant states in the South China Sea. However, China will not initiate an unpredictable conflict that could threaten the Middle Kingdom's ongoing economic rise and encourage her trading partners to seek a greater American presence in the region. China knows that, in the long term, economic development and trade will have greater geopolitical weight in the region than 60% of the American fleet.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Spratly Island conflict goes nuclear</span>**
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">**Doble 11** </span>//<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">[John, has an M.A. in International Affairs from American University and a B.A. in Political Science and History from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “Maritime Disputes a Likely Source of Future Conflict” [[http://www.policymic.com/articles/2279/maritime-disputes-a-likely-source-of-future-conflict]] December]</span>//<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">BM</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Yesterday, the U.S. and China were involved in a nuclear exchange. The cause of this conflict was a war brought about between China and the Philippines after the Philippines seized several of the Spratly Islands to secure natural resources and the sea lanes traversing the South China seas, both of which it would use to advance itself in the global economy. China refused to accept this action and attacked, and the U.S. was dragged in after the president was pressured by Congress and American allies to honor America’s mutual-defense agreement with the Philippines. The result was disastrous. While this is a hypothetical example, similar scenarios are becoming increasingly probable. Due to increasing economic competition and climate change, a source of future conflict will be the contest for control over the seas. The U.S. must adequately plan for future contingencies to avoid any surprises and to discern what it needs to do to prevent the worst-case scenario from occurring. Economic competition on the seas can be seen most clearly in terms of port construction. As it stands, over [[@http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/websites/nduedu/www.ndu.edu/inss/books/Books_2002/Globalization_and_Maritime_Power_Dec_02/01e_intro.htm|90% of all goods]]measured by weight or volume are transported by cargo ship, and port construction greatly increase a nation’s access to foreign markets and appeal as a manufacturing center. Conversely, a nation’s investment in ports reduces the amount of goods traveling to other nations, thus damaging their economies. Unlike other forms of infrastructure investment, maritime infrastructure implicitly affects international security. This competition has already created conflict in the Middle East. Bilateral efforts to improve relations between Iraq and Kuwait were scuttled earlier this year after Kuwait announced it was investing heavily in building a new port (the Mubarak Kabeer) only 20 kilometers away from a port Iraq was building (the Grand al-Faw). Rapprochement swiftly ended over Iraqi fears of economic strangulation and calls for eternal brotherhood were replaced by curses. Nowadays, rumors abound that Iraqi and Kuwaiti forces are infiltrating the border areas and Iraqi militants have already launched rockets from Iraq into Kuwait and threatened to kidnap the contractors building the Mubarak Kabeer port. While threatening, this conflict is unlikely to explode as Iraq is in no shape to wage war and labors under a history of belligerence it is trying to expunge. But what if a similar sequence of events occurred in Southeast/East Asia, where GDP is growing an average of [[@http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTPOVERTY/Resources/336991-1318940394432/Job-Trends-October-2011.htm|6%-7% a year]](with China at [[@http://www.cnbc.com/id/44937991/China_Third_Quarter_Growth_at_2_Year_Low_But_No_Rate_Cut_Seen|9.1%]]) and states can operate more freely? The U.S. is investing more resources in the region at the exact moment when growing economic competition make conflict more likely. Secondly, climate change will soon have a massive impact on the world’s coastal areas. Global sea levels are likely to [[@http://www.stimson.org/spotlight/the-deep-blue-sea-coastal-zones-and-climate-change/|rise between 80 to 200cm at the end of the century]] and would submerge large tracts of land, displacing millions of people and wiping out urban and agricultural areas. Since they are built on the coast, this would also [[@http://www.stimson.org/books-reports/maritime-security/|damage or destroy many ports worldwide]] and jeopardize international commerce as we know it. These losses would be difficult to replace given the increased environmental pressures Southeast/East Asian states would face as well as the spillover problems that would arise as low-lying countries sink into the sea and collapse. Competition over the ports that survive will be fierce as whoever possesses them would likely dominate the sea lanes and international commerce for some time, leading to regional dominance. Similarly, economic competition and climate change are going to going to cause havoc on the military industrial base supporting naval power in the region. It is expensive to build a competitive navy, and many states will be unable to afford it if they need to constantly adapt to economic and environmental pressure. China and India are already building up their naval forces and will likely be naval powers into the foreseeable future, but the U.S. will gain a lot of allies in the future struggling to get the U.S. involved in every security dispute they have. Like WWI, someone may gamble incorrectly, and a conflict that starts as a minor incident may explode into something much greater. The U.S. consequently needs to utilize all facets of American power, from military to diplomatic to foreign aid, to confront these complex challenges and prevent them from escalating out of control. We need to promote broader acceptance of free trade on the open seas as well as democratic governance to limit the appeal of coercive power and the ability to use that power arbitrarily. We need a way to maintain the strength of our alliances without getting sucked into conflicts we don’t want, besides selling more weapons that only make war increasingly likely. Regardless of the exact policies, policymakers need to start thinking ahead on how it will deal with the implications economic competition and climate change are going to have on maritime power. Intelligent observers of the Middle East knew for years that the authoritarian status quo was unsustainable, yet no plans were made to respond to the collapse of those regimes and our response could have been better. Current trends indicate that the current status quo in Southeast/East Asia is equally untenable. Do we have a plan in place?</span>

That’s about $12 per million British thermal units, or five times more expensive than benchmark U.S. futures in New York.¶ China plans to extend the pricing nationwide in two to three years, according to the official Xinhua News Agency, potentially boosting imports from North America, where Henry Hub futures contracts fell to a 10-year low in April. While China seeks to boost the use of cleaner fuels such as gas, retail price caps are discouraging energy companies from increasing supplies because they have to pay international rates and sell at a loss on the domestic market.¶ “The price reform helps to create an environment that supports a high cost of gas,” Gavin Thompson, a manager at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Beijing, said in a telephone interview May 30. “U.S. pricing will be attractive to the Chinese buyers. Looking at our view of delivered cost into east coast China and Henry Hub gas prices, U.S. Gulf Coast exports look competitive.”¶ Executives from the world’s biggest gas companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO Gazprom and PetroChina Co. are likely to discuss the prospect of rising North American exports to Asia when they meet in Kuala Lumpur this week for the World Gas Conference. Shell Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser last month called gas “the fuel of the future.”¶ U.S. LNG¶ The U.S. may export about 40 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas a year by 2022 as low-cost supplies from shale deposits encourage shipments to Asia, Jen Snyder, a Boston-based analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said May 22. LNG is natural gas chilled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 162 degrees Celsius), liquefying it for shipment by tanker.¶ U.S. exports will cost Asia buyers $9.35 per million Btu, based on a Henry Hub price of $3 and after accounting for freight rates, according to a May 29 presentation byCheniere Energy Inc. ([[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=LNG:US|LNG]]), the Houston-based company that’s developing the nation’s largest LNG export terminal in Louisiana. That compares to $11.08 per million Btu that China paid on average in April, according to customs data.¶ Price Slump¶ Gas futures slumped to $1.91 per million Btu on the New York Mercantile Exchange on April 19, the lowest price since September 2001. The contract for July delivery was at $2.348 per million Btu today in New York.¶ “China will be seriously importing gas from North America as it offers potentially lower prices compared to other sources,” Neil Beveridge, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a telephone interview May 30. “There is a lot of interest from Asian buyers, but the question is very much a political one in terms of how much the U.S. will allow to export.”¶ If China’s gas pricing reform is rolled out nationwide, retail gas prices could double to as much as 5 yuan per cubic meter, from 2.5 yuan currently, Beveridge said in a May 9 report. Wellhead prices would be three times those implied by U.S. forward price curves, according to Beveridge.¶ Import Surge¶ China may purchase an additional 10 million tons of LNG a year by 2030 from overseas markets, including North America, South America and Africa, on top of a further 10 million tons from traditional sources in Asia and the Middle East, Fereidun Fesharaki, the Singapore-based chairman of Facts Global Energy, said in a report last month.¶ China, which aims to double gas use in five years by 2015, increased overseas purchases of LNG by 31 percent to a record 12.2 million tons last year, according to Chinese customs. Purchases may more than double to 30 million tons by 2015 and rise fourfold to 50 million tons by 2020, according to Bernstein.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Washington is grudgingly coming to terms with a more sophisticated and confident Beijing, one that is more willing to put out and fight for its own interests. For those in DC who thought that China's evolution towards the poorly defined "responsible stakeholder" would mean the country would ultimately come to step in line with Western policies, China's pursuit of natural resources with little consideration of who they are doing business with has been disconcerting. ¶ American and European policy makers certainly wish that Beijing would be more selective in who it chooses to do business with; however, as Mikkal Herberg, the Research Director for the Asian Energy Security Program at the National Bureau of Asia Research shared last week, "Energy security has become a critical political and economic concern for Beijing's leadership." ¶ Herberg pointed out, "China's leaders fear that energy shortages and rising energy costs could undermine the country's social instability." As long-time China watchers know, these fears are central to understanding China's policies. Herberg made this point in his testimony when he stated, "For a regime that increasingly stakes its political right to rule on economic performance and living standard, the threat of economic stagnation could threaten the continued political monopoly of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)." ¶ Herberg's USCC testimony pointed out what he calls China's "energy nationalism"; namely, as he describes it, "an energy version of economic nationalism and mercantilism prevalent in Asia". He believes that China's fears - one he suggests are shared by other regional players who have similar concerns about access to oil and natural gas - are critical to understand why China acts as it does in pursuit of natural resources internationally. ¶ Beyond how China's rapid modernization impacts the world's supply of natural resources, Beijing's efforts to not only secure supply but ensure safety during transportation into the country are making waves in the South China Sea. Herberg pointed out that "China's growing dependence on oil and liquid natural gas (LNG) flowing through the Indian Ocean, Malacca Straits and [the] South China Sea is also a key driver of its naval modernization and move towards 'Blue Water' power projection capabilities by the PLA Navy." ¶ Experts like Herberg understand and fear that these moves by the PLA Navy are "setting off alarm bells across the region and contributing to a regional naval arms race." ¶ While much of last Thursday's testimony focused on China's pursuit of oil and natural gas, Dr Elizabeth Economy, a Starr Senior Fellow and Director of Asia Studies at the Council of Foreign Relations, pointed towards China's pursuit of water as equally important. According to Dr Economy, "More than 40 mid- to large-sized cities in Northern China, such as Beijing and Tianjin, boast crisis-level water shortages." ¶ Water shortages due to depletion are not the only problem. As she shared last week, "over 90% of groundwater [in China] is polluted by urban sewage, refuse and industrial waste." This means that, according to research by Jon Bowermaster that Dr Economy referenced, "estimates are that 400,000 people are driven from their homes annually as a result of lack of water". As with many challenges the Chinese government must face, this is another that poses a threat to the country's social stability. ¶ In many ways, China's pursuit of each of these natural resources is understandable and should be seen as an inevitable outgrowth of the massive economic gains experienced across the country over the last several decades. The US Congress has at least three fears, as evidenced by last week's hearing. ¶ First, whether China can be convinced to join the developed West in ostracizing countries like Iran specifically, or whether China's pursuit of natural resources will take precedent. ¶ Second, Washington fears that China's model for obtaining natural resources through its national oil companies (NOC) and their "go-out" strategy may be locking up resources to which Western countries will also need access. Because the NOC approach is built on a state-to-state relationship, in many cases it prevents private operators in the West from competing. ¶ China can, and has, brought to bear more than a simple commercial transaction for oil; rather, the NOC can weave together government-sponsored loans, infrastructure projects and other amenities to convince a foreign government to work with China. Washington thus far does not have a good answer to this. ¶ Third, and perhaps most pernicious, is Washington's fear that China's pursuit of natural resources will destabilize the region, whether intentionally or accidentally. This fear might be made real by a military confrontation in the crowded South China Sea, where multiple borders and territorial disputes still exist, or this fear could be realized if China's modernization causes it to damn waterways that nourish the many river deltas throughout Southeast Asia.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Expanding US LNG exports solves – meets Asian energy demands</span>**
**Levi 12** **-** the David M. Rubenstein senior fellow for energy and environment at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan foreign-policy think tank and membership organization(Michael, “A strategy for U.S. Natural Gas Exports”, The Hamilton Project, June 2012,[[http://www.hamiltonproject.org/files/downloads_and_links/06_exports_levi.pdf]])

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Asia has not been so fortunate, and the reasons for this are not entirely clear. Asian natural gas prices are still tied closely to crude oil prices, normally through politically involved negotiations. Asian buyers still have fewer options for large-scale imports than European buyers do—key buyers, including Japan and Korea, do not have access to pipeline imports—which reduces their relative power. In addition, at the same time that European customers were gaining new leverage in 2011, Japan, the largest LNG importer in Asia, was paralyzed by the disaster at its Fukushima nuclear power plant. As that accident led to widespread nuclear shutdowns, Japan massively increased its demand for LNG to meet critical electricity needs. Japan, desperate to avoid further economic harm, was not in a position to negotiate aggressively with natural gas suppliers.¶ Many analysts in both the United States and Asia have speculated that U.S. entry into the Asian LNG market as a major supplier (along with others) could help create the conditions for a move toward market pricing of natural gas, or at least to a lessening of individual producers’ market power and, hence, political influence. Predicting political influence is a near-impossible business, but to examine whether U.S. exports might help encourage such a transformation, it is useful to compare the potential magnitude of U.S. LNG deliveries to other important scales in the natural gas market. As of 2010, the world’s top five LNG exporters were Qatar (8.2 bcf/d), Indonesia (3.3 bcf/d), Malaysia (3.3 bcf/d), Australia (2.7 bcf/d), and Nigeria (2.6 bcf/d) (IGU 2010). The top supplier to Japan was Indonesia (2.0 bcf/d), and the top supplier to Korea was Qatar (1.1 bcf/d). The spot market accounted for slightly more than a fifth of traded LNG, totaling slightly less than seven billion cubic feet a day.¶ All of these figures will increase in the future. EIA projections are far from definitive, but they are instructive. World natural gas production is projected to increase by 26 percent over the next decade (EIA 2011). Korean imports are expected to rise from to 4.1 billion cubic feet a day, while Japanese imports are expected to hold fairly steady at their present level. Chinese imports, including pipeline gas, are expected to rise from a negligible amount to over nine billion cubic feet each day by the end of the decade, while daily Indian imports are expected to reach three billion cubic feet per day. ¶ These figures suggest that U.S. LNG exports could become influential if they increased to toward the higher end of the range discussed thus far in this paper, and if exports were priced off the U.S. benchmark. The United States could potentially assume a large market share in several pivotal markets, and perhaps be dominant in one or more. This would give consumers greater leverage in their negotiations with other suppliers. At a minimum, by diversifying the pricing of their imports, it would partly insulate LNG importers from oil market fluctuations.</span>

**Levi, 2012**** David M. Rubenstein Senior Fellow for Energy and the Environment Director of the Program on Energy Security and Climate Change Council on Foreign Relations (Michael, “A Strategy for U.S. Natural Gas Exports,” June 2012,[[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/6/13%20exports%20levi/06_exports_levi.pdf]])

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The prospect of further exports beyond those initially approved to non-FTA countries will be attractive to many potential importers, including Korea, Japan, India, and China. This will be the case even if the United States approves enough capacity to theoretically cover plausible export demands, since many firms that have received approval to export LNG may not actually succeed in building export facilities. ¶ U.S. trade negotiators should use the prospect of preferential access to future exports in trade negotiations with those countries, which could create an opportunity to further increase the economic benefits to the United States of natural gas exports. In particular, the United States should make access to U.S. LNG a part of ongoing TPP negotiations with Japan, something Japan has signaled that it desires. The specific “asks” in return for preferential access should be determined by broader U.S. priorities in these negotiations. State Department diplomats should also emphasize the value of FTA access to U.S. LNG exports in their engagement with those Korean policy-makers who are skeptical of the U.S.Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS).¶ The prospect of a more diverse LNG market—which U.S. entry as an exporter would contribute to—carries with it the prospect of introducing more transparent market-based pricing to gas trade, particularly in Asia. That would help disentangle natural gas trade from political relationships, particularly between Asian consumers and Middle Eastern suppliers, to the broader benefit of the United States. The U.S. government has limited influence over the geopolitical impact of LNG exports, but it can take several steps to improve the odds of success.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Europe already buys about a quarter of its natural gas from Russia with Germany relying on the country for 35 percent of its needs. This makes Germany vulnerable.¶ So far, Moscow has consistently proven to be a reliable supplier. Officials at Gazprom say that a pipeline "is a delivery promise cast in steel," and they insist that no company is going to invest billions in a pipeline and then choose not to use it.¶ But with each additional cubic meter of gas, the concerns are growing that the Russians will use their natural resources as a means of applying pressure, and that natural gas will become a political weapon. "There is no national security without energy security," says European Energy Commissioner and Nabucco advocate Günther Oettinger. And Gazprom has wielded its immense power in the past -- by, for example, shutting off Ukraine's gas supply for several days in January 2006, cutting supplies to Europe in the process.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Increasing US LNG exports breaks European dependence on Russia</span>**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The 27 member-state European Union (EU) has been a growing natural gas consumer and importer for decades. However, as Europe’s natural gas production has declined in recent years, its dependence on imported natural gas has increased. This has left it more dependent as a whole on its primary supplier, Russia, which has shown some inclination to use its resources for political ends. Natural gas, unlike oil which is a global commodity, is a regional commodity with regional buyers and sellers exerting more influence. ¶ Over the past decade, some European officials have become increasingly concerned about the potential for cutoffs or curtailments of Russian natural gas supplies to Europe. Most Russian natural gas exports to Europe flow through Ukraine and Belarus. Fragile and sometimes hostile relations between Kyiv, Minsk, and Moscow have in the past resulted in interruptions in the flow of natural gas to parts of Europe, as happened in 2006 and 2009. Some countries in Eastern Europe, which are in some cases almost exclusively reliant on Russian gas imports, have been particularly susceptible to these fluctuations. ¶ Despite its growing dependence on Russian natural gas, Europe is well positioned geographically to benefit from recent changes in global natural gas development. Since the advent of shale gas in the United States, the world appears to be potentially awash in natural gas. A 2011 study commissioned by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed that technically recoverable shale gas resources worldwide may exceed current global natural gas reserves.1Other key developments and possible alternatives to Russian natural gas are outlined below: ¶ Taken as a whole, North Africa could pose a credible alternative to Russian natural gas supplies. The change of regimes in Libya, in particular, and in Egypt as a result of the wave of regional unrest known as the “Arab Spring,” poses a potential opportunity to increase natural gas production and exports from these countries. Both Libya and Egypt have large natural gas reserves, but production and exports have been hampered by domestic policies. Algeria, the largest exporter of natural gas in North Africa and the third largest supplier to Europe behind Russia and Norway, may also hold large volumes of shale gas yet to be developed in addition to their substantial conventional reserves. ¶ Central Asia may hold the greatest potential for new natural gas supplies for Europe, but currently those supplies would have to transit Russia to arrive in the European market. The delays in developing a southern corridor natural gas pipeline route to Europe have forced Central Asian countries to look east instead of west to bypass Russia and open new markets.2¶ Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports pose an additional alternative to Russian natural gas. In 2010, LNG comprised almost 20% of the EU’s natural gas imports and over 15% of its consumption. The EU has LNG import capacity to meet its peak winter demand for natural gas, but during most of the year the facilities are underutilized. Nevertheless, some countries are considering building additional LNG import terminals to diversify their sources of natural gas. In addition to LNG import terminals, the EU could benefit from increased natural gas storage facilities in order to manage their import capacity during non-peak periods, as well as more pipeline interconnections to move natural gas where it is needed. EU officials have identified both improvements as priorities and they are being pursued, but not without some difficulty.¶ The prospect of significant U.S. LNG exports may pose an opportunity for the United States to play a bigger role in European energy security and global natural gas markets. 3 Most of the proposed U.S. LNG export projects are located on the Gulf coast or east coast of the United States, making shipments, at least initially, more likely to go to Europe than Asia. Additionally, the U.S. natural gas market is one of the only markets in the world where natural gas is not priced against oil, giving it a cost advantage in most of Europe. Should future U.S. LNG contracts not include an oil-indexed formula, pressure would be added for other countries, including Russia, to follow suit. Russian companies, including state-controlled natural gas giant Gazprom, have adamantly defended oil-indexed natural gas prices.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Russia’s monopoly on natural gas threatens Eurasian security and pro-democracy efforts</span>**
**Baran, 7** - senior fellow and director of the Center for Eurasian Policy at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C. (Zenyo, “ EU Energy Security: Time to End Russian Leverage,” THE WASHINGTON QUARTERLY AUTUMN 2007,[[http://ao.hudson.org/files/publications/07autumn_baran.pdf]])

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The lack of reliable and sustainable European access to energy represents a clear threat to the continent’s security. Under the leadership of Putin, the Kremlin has pursued a strategy whereby Europe’s substantial dependence on Russian energy is leveraged to obtain economic and political gains. If this situation continues, the EU will find itself in further danger, as its dependence leaves it beholden to Russian interests. There simply is no readily available alternative to the supplies the EU receives from Russia, particularly natural gas. Unlike oil, gas is extremely difficult and costly to ship via tankers; pipelines are the preferred method of transportation. Thus, if a supplier refuses to provide gas or charges an unreasonable price, the consumer cannot quickly or easily turn to another source. The consumer state would have no choice but to accept the supplier’s conditions or go without natural gas, an option that is all but unacceptable for most.¶ The unjust manipulation or interruption of energy supplies is as much a security threat as military action is, especially since the EU relies on Russia for more than 30 percent of its oil imports and 50 percent of its natural gas imports. 1 This dependence is not distributed evenly. As one heads eastward, Russia’s share of the energy supply grows ever larger. No fewer than seven eastern European countries receive at least 90 percent of their crude oil imports from Russia, and six EU nations are entirely dependent on Russia for their natural gas imports.¶ The Ukrainian gas crisis in January 2006 catapulted energy security to the forefront of the EU agenda. On the very day it took over the presidency of the Group of Eight (G-8)—a presidency that had announced energy security as its key theme—Russia halted natural gas deliveries to Ukraine. Because the gas pipelines crossing Ukraine carry supplies destined for EU markets, this shutdown resulted in significant supply disruptions for several member states, raising awareness that dependence on Russia has increased Europe’s geopolitical vulnerability.¶ Several EU states have experienced the misfortune of Russian supply cuts directly. Disputes between Russia and the Baltic states have led to the halt of pipeline deliveries of oil multiple times. In January 2003, Russia ceased supplying oil via pipeline to Latvia’s Ventspils Nafta export facility. This embargo, which followed Riga’s unwillingness to sell the facility to a Russian energy company, continues to this day. In July 2006, Moscow shut down a pipeline supplying Lithuania’s Mazeikiu Nafta refinery, which is the largest company in Lithuania and one of the biggest oil refineries in central and eastern Europe. As with Ventspils Nafta, this shutdown came after a Russian company failed to obtain the energy infrastructure it coveted.¶ Moscow has further sought to increase Europe’s dependence on Russian energy supplies by acquiring significant stakes in the energy distribution companies and infrastructure of EU member states, typically through its proxy, Gazprom. This massive energy company—the world’s largest—has control over the Russian gas pipeline network and consequently handles all Russian and Central Asian exports, either directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries. Such a preponderance of power would be troubling enough if the company were transparent, privately owned, and played by the rules of the free market, but Gazprom is none of those things. It is majority state owned and has deep ties to the Russian government. Many of the company’s executive management and board members also occupy or previously occupied key positions within the Kremlin.¶ For many years, Gazprom has owned significant portions of energy companies throughout the former Soviet Union. It is the largest or second-largest shareholder in the gas utilities of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Recently, Gazprom has been expanding its influence even further into the domestic gas distribution networks of western Europe. In the past two years, Gazprom has signed deals with Eni (Italy), Gasunie (the Netherlands), BASF (Germany), E.ON Ruhrgas (Germany), and Gaz de France. Desperate for access to energy and the profits it brings, European companies are played against each other by the Kremlin in order to secure more advantageous conditions for Russia. If one company does not want to agree to Moscow’s terms, a competitor will gladly accept them, leaving the first company with nothing.¶ In addition to the economic disadvantages of such dependence, the broader foreign policy goals of EU states also suffer. Specifically, EU members limit their criticisms of Moscow, lest they be given a raw deal at the negotiating table. Russia’s increasingly tainted record on transparency, responsible governance, and human rights is thus allowed to stand unchallenged and unquestioned. Dependency also erodes EU support for key allies in Europe and Asia. Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine—all crucial energy producers or transit countries—have each been subject to intimidation by Moscow. Instead of standing up to this harassment, Europe’s dependence compels its leaders to look the other way.¶ Most disturbing of all is that this dependence even leads the EU to turn a blind eye when Moscow utilizes these tactics against fellow EU members. The July 2006 shutdown of the Lithuanian pipeline, for example, drew little protest outside of Poland and the Baltic states. Russia claimed that this cutoff was the result of technical difficulties yet refused all offers</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">from third parties to examine the damaged pipe or assist repairs in any way. Although this incident is suspicious enough on its own, it becomes a clear case of political manipulation given Russia’s status as a repeat offender.¶ Many times over the past decade, Moscow has utilized near-identical tactics in countries it considers to be its near abroad. It has repeatedly cut off energy supplies during a political dispute, smugly blamed technical difficulties for the problem, and eventually shifted supplies to another destination unless the victim acceded to the Kremlin’s demands. ¶ Despite this history and repeated pleas from President Valdas Adamkus, the response from most western European countries was rather muted during the Lithuanian shutdown. The countries of the West have never experienced these strong-arm tactics firsthand and fail to view it as anything more than an economic dispute. Moreover, they were too concerned that standing up for Lithuania would ruin their chances to get preferential access to Russian oil and gas resources. By design, the Russian strategy is driving a wedge between eastern and western Europe, exacerbating the challenges the EU faces in devising a common energy policy, as was seen during the dispute between Poland and Germany ahead of the June EU summit. This diplomatic row was ostensibly over Russia’s failure to remove its embargo on Polish meat products but more broadly involved the perceived reluctance of Berlin to stand up to Moscow on a whole host of issues, not the least of which was energy.¶ The EU’s inability to take Russia to task for its illiberal market actions threatens European energy security in another way. It decreases efficiency in an already inefficient Russian energy industry, raising costs for consumers. Russia’s increasingly state-owned energy industry is largely unregulated. Without competitive market forces, companies such as Gazprom have no reason to behave like commercially minded entities. The absence of market stimuli is having detrimental effects on Russian productivity. Between 1998 and 2005, output in Russia’s then-mostly privately owned oil sector rose by 50 percent. 2 During that same period, production in the gas sector (Gazprom) barely grew at all. Since 2004, when the Kremlin began its consolidation over the oil sector in earnest, Russian oil production has leveled off as well.¶ The lack of reliable and sustainable access to energy is a clear threat to European security. Due to the extremely close relationship between the energy industry and the Kremlin, Russia’s oil and gas companies can pursue strategies that make little economic sense but that serve the long-term interests of the Russian state, namely, ensuring European dependence on Russian energy supplies. For example, Russia’s undersea Nord Stream pipeline will cost at least three times more than a proposed overland route through Lithuania and Poland would have. Given the environmental sensitivity of the Baltic Sea, some industry insiders are predicting costs as high as $10 billion or even $15 billion.¶ By divorcing western Europe’s gas supply from eastern Europe’s, however, the undersea route grants Moscow the ability to manipulate the European energy market more effectively. Needless to say, the unnecessarily high cost of the pipeline’s construction will be passed on to European consumers. Many industry experts have expressed concern that corruption and inefficiency, coupled with Moscow’s refusal to allow significant foreign investment in the energy sector, will soon lead the Russian oil and gas industry to burn out.¶ Instead of developing new oil and gas fields or investing in its energy infrastructure, Russia has utilized windfall profits to pursue the aggressive policy of expansion and acquisition described above. Unless Moscow is able to secure additional gas supplies from fields in Central Asia, it may struggle to meet its commitments to Europe, which is why maintaining full control over Central Asia’s export routes is so critical for the Kremlin.¶ Engaging the Caspian Enshrined as the second of the three pillars of the EU, the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) states that the EU should seek to promote democracy, rule of law, and respect for human rights within its borders and abroad. Yet, dependence on Russian energy supplies undermines Europe’s efforts to foster the ideals of good governance, market transparency, and democracy both in Russia and in Russia’s neighbors. Although the establishment of these principles in energy suppliers is a worthy goal in its own right, doing so will also create a more stable environment for energy sector development, thereby improving European security. Diversifying oil and gas supplies by constructing pipelines directly from the Caucasus and Central Asia to Europe would not only decrease Russia’s influence on EU countries but would also loosen Moscow’s grip on Europe’s neighbors.¶ If the EU wishes to foster true reform within former Soviet states, it must offer them a non-Russian perspective, which can best be done through cooperation on joint energy projects. In the Caspian region, this strategy has been pursued with success by the United States. In the late 1990s, the United States pushed hard for the construction of several oil and gas pipelines that would carry Caspian energy westward without transiting Russia. It did so to break Russia’s monopoly on the region’s energy transportation system, thereby giving the Caspian countries greater economic and political independence from Moscow. Naturally, this proposal prompted strong objections and high pressure tactics by the Russian government. Determined support from the United States and from NATO ally Turkey was eventually successful in countering this Russian pressure. Two pipelines for oil and natural gas were eventually completed from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku across Georgia to Turkey. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline stretches from Baku all the way to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. ¶ The South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) follows the same route as BTC but terminates in the central Turkish city of Erzurum.¶ The United States devoted a great deal of time and energy to make these routes a reality. The time has now come for the EU to take the lead in bringing neighboring states closer to the West through a concerted engagement effort. The BTC and</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">SCP pipelines are positive precedents. The construction of these pipelines has substantially decreased Moscow’s leverage over Azerbaijan and Georgia, allowing them to resist political and economic pressure from Russia. When Gazprom demanded a higher price for the gas it provided to Azerbaijan, Baku decided not to import any Russian gas. Later, when Transneft (Russia’s state-owned oil pipeline monopoly) refused to offer a market price for Azerbaijani oil, Baku decided not to export oil via Russian pipelines. Azerbaijan did not have these options prior to the construction of the two East-West pipelines.¶ The construction of these projects has also led to significant reforms in both countries. The international consortium behind these pipelines did not agree to the construction of either project until contracts assured the needed legal protection. Ongoing involvement with Western companies and gentle prodding from Western governments have prompted further political and market reform. Azerbaijan’s most recent parliamentary elections in November 2005, while far from perfect, were the country’s freest and fairest since independence. Georgia has been free to continue down the reform path it started during the Rose Revolution in 2003 and is expected to join NATO by the end of the decade. Years of positive interaction with the West have allowed Azerbaijan and Georgia to reorient themselves toward a future in European and Euro-Atlantic institutions.¶ Yet, this westward orientation is not guaranteed. In Azerbaijan, as in many states on the cusp of reform, there are a number of hard-liners within the government who are fiercely resisting these changes and would rather reach energy deals with Russia in order to obtain Moscow’s support to maintain the status quo. Moreover, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are still l 137 almost completely dependent on Russian-controlled export pipelines, leaving them vulnerable not only to political manipulation but also to economic extortion. Until late 2006, Russia purchased natural gas from the Central Asian republics at a rate of about $45 to $65 per thousand cubic meters (tcm). It then sold that gas (and/or Russian-produced gas) to western European countries for around $230 per tcm. Even the tremendous distances that must be traveled cannot account for the increase. Per kilometer, this markup is far higher than that which occurs between Canadian supply hubs and distant American consumers. ¶ To be fair, part of this disparity arises because of the horrific inefficiency of Gazprom. The rest is simply a rent that Moscow is able to extract because of its near-monopoly power. This becomes blatantly obvious when one considers that Russia currently sells gas to Georgia for $230 per tcm, despite paying only $100 per tcm for gas purchased from nearby Turkmenistan. It is Tbilisi’s commitment to the West, not the market, that is determining the price of gas in Georgia.¶ Despite the danger of inaction, many in the EU are hesitant to engage in energy deals with countries such as Kazakhstan or Turkmenistan because of their rather poor record on human rights or rule of law. Although the EU’s intention is good, the strategy is not. Without incorporating the energy sector into its engagement strategy, the EU simply lacks the proper leverage to encourage these states to change. The EU is often perceived as admonishing its neighbors, calling for too much political and social reform too fast, and offering too little in return. If political reform were undertaken without the necessary improvements in economic, political, and physical infrastructure, governments would lose control of their states; and the dangers of terrorism, extremism, and drug trafﬁcking in Central Asia and the Caucasus would increase.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">IN THE early 1990S, after the Iron Curtain lifted, Western leaders seized a historic opportunity to open the doors of NATO and the EuropeanUnion (EU)to post communist central and eastern Europe. By consolidating democracy and ensuring stability from the Baltics to the Black Sea, they redrew the map of Europe. As a result, the continent today is more peaceful, democratic, and free. This accomplishment was the result of a common U.S.-European grand strategy that was controversial and fiercely debated at the time. The goal was to build a post-Cold War Europe "whole, free, and at peace"; to renew the transatlantic alliance; and to reposition the United States and Europe to address new global challenges. But as successful as the strategy of enlargement has been, the world has changed dramatically since it was forged. The United States and Europe face new risks and opportunities on Europe's periphery and need to recast their strategic thinking accordingly for a new era. Current policy toward Europe's periphery is increasingly out of date, for three reasons. First, the West has changed. The 9/11 attacks pulled U.S. attention and resources away from Europe and toward the Middle East. The reservoir of transatlantic goodwill and political capital accumulated during the 1990S has evaporated in the sands of RONALD D. As MU s is Executive Director of the Transatlantic Center at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, in Brussels. From 1997 to 2000, he served as U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs. [95] ¶ Ronald D. Asmus Iraq. In Europe, enlargement fatigue has set in thanks to stumbling institutional reforms and the mounting expense of integrating new EU members. It was widely assumed that the western Balkan states (Albania and the former Yugoslav republics) would all eventuallyj oin the EU and NATO, but even that can no longer be taken for granted. Turkey's chances of gaining EU membership are fading. Indeed, the window of opportunity to expand the democratic world that opened with the end of the Cold War is now at risk of closing. Second, the East has changed. The challenge of the 1990S was to consolidate democracy in central and eastern Europe along a north south axis from the Baltics to the Black Sea. Today's even more difficult challenge is to stabilize the countries of Eurasia, the region where Europe and Asia meet, along a new axis extending eastward from the Balkans across the Black Sea region. The Wests policy to the southern Caucasus and including Turkey, toward Europe, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan toward Europe's Sandwiched between an unstable Middle periphery cannot East to the south and a hostile Russia to the north, these countries are the new flank of remain on cruise the Euro-Atlantic community. Old may still work in the Balkans, but countries have changed such as Georgia and Ukraine-let alone Moldova and Belarus, if and when the latter opens up to the outside world-are weaker, poorer, and more politically problematic than the central and eastern European countries NATO and the EU sought to integrate earlier. Their claim to be part of Europe is more tenuous, and the perceived Western imperative to help is less obvious. The policy tools developed for central and eastern Europe a decade ago are, accordingly, no longer as effective. Finally, Russia has changed. In the 1990S, it was a weak, quasi democratic state that wanted to become part of the West. Now, a more powerful, nationalist, and less democratic Russia is challenging the West. Moscow sees itself as an independent Eurasian power, offering its own authoritarian capitalist model of development as an alternative to democratic liberalism. It practices a form of mercantilist geo political hardball that many in Europe thought was gone for good. Nowhere is this more clear than in its policies toward Europe's [96] ¶ Europes Eastern Promise periphery, where it is seeking to halt or roll back democratic breakthroughs in places such as Georgia and Ukraine. Moscow's willingness to use its energy resources as a political weapon has made European countries reluctant to confront Russia over its antidemocratic behavior. Until the EU can liberalize its energy markets and diversify its supplies, Moscow will have the upper hand. In this new strategic environment, Western policy toward the nations on Europe's periphery cannot remain on cruise control as if nothing has changed. NATO and the EU need to articulate a new strategic rationale for expanding the democratic West and devise a new approach to dealing with Russia. There is another opportunity today to advance Western values and security and redraw the map of Europe and Eurasia once more. But new ideas will be necessary to seize it-and to reinvent the transatlantic alliance in the process. OUT WITH THE OLD THE GRAND strategy of democratic enlargement that lay behind the opening up of NATO and the EU early in the 1990S grew out of the twin imperatives of reuniting Europe following communism's collapse and reinventing the</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">transatlantic alliance for the post-Cold War era. The goal was to consolidate democracy across the eastern half of the continent by anchoring central and eastern European countries to the West. It reflected the vision of a peaceful Europe expanding its foreign policy horizons and sharing global leadership and responsibility with the United States. At the time, Washington concluded that the EU alone was too weak to lead the enlargement process. Thus NATO took the lead in bringing central and eastern Europe into the fold. NATO'S membership could more easily be expanded, and extending NATO'S security umbrella to countries in those regions was critical to the consolidation of democracy. NATO also contributed to reform by raising its requirements for new members, a "tough love" policy designed to reinforce positive transformation. As NATO played a key role in taking the security issue off the table and opening its doors to the East, the EU assumed most of the burden of transforming post-communist societies into liberal democratic ones. E.U. enlargement policy was an asymmetric negotiation. ¶ Candidate countries simply had to accede to the EU'S existing acquiscommunautaire the full range of its laws, regulations, and institutions. The newcomers had little say in anything but the timeline under which the EU'S requirements would be implemented. Nevertheless, it was this transformation that fundamentally tied these countries to the West and thus created enduring security on the continent. Great care was taken to ensure that countries not included in the initial round of enlargement would not be destabilized. The West did not want to repeat the mistake that U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson made in 1950, when he appeared Expanding the reach to sketch a new Western security perimeter and thereby invited the conclusion that of NATO and the EU countries on the other side of the line were once again does not of no interest to the West. Therefore, NATO and EU Policy sought to blur the lines between mean starting a new members, potential future members, and Cold War partners. In practice, this meant finding new ways to embrace and deepen cooperation with countries that did not seek membership or were not yet realistic candidates for it. NATO explicitly left open the possibility of further expansion down the road. The EU was more circumspect, but it, too, expanded its outreach to countries on Europe's periphery whose future stability and orientation it wanted to shape. The West's desire to mitigate any negative fallout was perhaps most visible in its handling of Russia. In different yet reinforcing ways, the Americans and the Europeans signaled their strategic desire to pull Russia toward the West in the hope that Moscow would eventually evolve into a partner and perhaps even a de facto ally. NATO and EU enlargement were accompanied by an unparalleled effort to engage Moscow and work for Russia's own democratic trans formation, while still taking what were seen as its legitimate interests into account. This strategy was not a new effort to contain Russia but an attempt to integrate it-albeit in a looser form and on a different timeline than that of its smaller western neighbors. And it was not merely rhetoric. NATO rethought its military strategy and force posture in order to underscore that it had no offensive intentions. Moreover, it offered to expand political and military cooperation and plan for future joint military operations with Russia. The EU set out its own far-reaching plans to deepen cooperation. The West took such steps despite uncertainty over where Russia was headed and despite the fear that Moscow would take advantage of these openings to paralyze Western institutions rather than cooperate with them. Looking back, Western policy achieved two of its goals-anchoring much of central and eastern Europe and preventing instability in those countries remaining outside NATO and the E u-and was partially successful in dealing with Russia. These successes were not inevitable, and their importance should not be underestimated. Had NATO and the EU not acted, Europe today would be a messier, less stable, and more inward-looking place. And Washington would have even fewer allies in dealing with crises beyond Europe, such as Afghanistan and Iraq. Today, it is only too easy to forget that a decade ago there were concerns that enlargement would create new and sharper divisions between those countries joining NATO and the EU and those remaining on the outside. It has done the opposite. The success of NATO and EU enlargement, and the inclusion of countries such as the Baltic states, set a positive precedent for the former Soviet republics. Following the Rose and Orange Revolutions, democratic leaders in Georgia and Ukraine became more serious about seeking to tie their countries to the West. After all, if the Baltic states could do it, why should they not dare to do the same? The results in Russia were mixed, however. On the one hand, the train wreck that was so frequently predicted by enlargement critics never happened. New arrangements for cooperation with NATO and the EU were set up, and a breakdown of relations with Moscow was avoided. But the West's broader hopes of establishing deeper relations with a more democratic Russia never materialized. Instead of becoming more democratic and cooperative, Moscow has become more authoritarian and adversarial. Hopes that the West and Russia could find common strategic ground after 9/11 have largely gone unfulfilled, and the two are even further apart now on issues such as Afghanistan, Iran, and Kosovo. The Orange and Rose Revolutions were interpreted in Moscow not as democratic breakthroughs but as threatening developments that needed to be challenged and reversed. Who or what is responsible for these trends is, of course, an issue of considerable dispute. Was it a lack of U.S. and European imagination and will that allowed Russia to drift in this anti-Western direction? Or was it the result of internal Russian dynamics over which the West had little, if any, influence? Did NATO and EU enlargement push Russia in the wrong direction, or was the West fortunate to act when it did given what has</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">followed? Enlargement has created more democratic stability on Russia's western border than at any time since Napoleon. Yet</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">today, the Kremlin's spin doctors are creating a new stab-in-the-back legend of how the West betrayed Moscow during the 1990s. The gap in historical narratives mirrors the increasingly tense relationship between the West and Russia. ALL QUIET ON THE EASTERN FRONT? IN LIGHT of these new circumstances in Russia, enlargement needs to be rethought from the ground up, starting with its strategic rationale. [1oo] FOREIGN AFFAIRS Volume87No.i ¶ Europe’s Eastern Promise After the accession of a band of countries from the Baltic states in the north to Bulgaria and Romania in the south, many in the West assumed that the enlargement project was almost complete, with the western Balkans constituting the last piece of unfinished business. They were surprised to suddenly find new countries from Eurasia, and specifically the wider Black Sea region, starting to knock on the doors of NATO and the EU-and unsure how to respond. In dealing with these new candidate countries, the West must stick to the values and diplomatic principles it laid down in the l990s, including the notion that countries are free to choose their alliances. But that alone is unlikely to be enough, because although these countries clearly consider themselves European, many Europeans do not feel the same historical or moral commitment to them or see a compelling strategic need to integrate them. Thus, in addition to moral and political arguments, the United States and Europe need to articulate a strong strategic rationale for anchoring them to the West. That argument is straight forward. The challenge of securing Europe's eastern border from the Baltics to the Black Sea has been replaced by the need to extend peace and stability along the southern rim of the Euro Atlantic community-from the Balkans across the Black Sea and further into Eurasia, Russia needs friends region that connects Europe, Russia, and the Middle East and involves core security and allies and the interests, including a critical energy corridor. United States and Working to consolidate democratic change and build stability in this area is as important Europe can and for Western security today as consolidating should be among them. ¶ Democracy in central and eastern Europe was in the 1990s. It is not only critical to expanding the democratic peace in Europe but also vital to repositioning the West vis-a-vis both Central Asia and the Middle East. This strategy presents an opportunity to redraw the strategic map of Europe and Eurasia in a way that enhances the security of countries on Europe's periphery as well as that of the United States and Europe. The United States and Europe also need to rethink what anchoring means in practice. In the 1990s, it meant pursuing membership in NATO and the EU roughly in parallel. Now the West needs to be more flexible and take a long-term view. The goal is to tie these countries as closely to the West as politics and interests on both sides allow. For some countries, this may mean eventual membership in both NATO and the EU; for others, it may mean membership only in NATO; and for the rest, it may mean membership in neither but simply much closer relations. Policy will have to be much more "ala carte than prix fixe. The link between NATO membership and EU membership should be relaxed, if not dropped. The EU has enough on its plate sustaining its commitments to the western Balkans and Turkey; anything beyond that is probably a nonstarter for the time being. NATO will once again have to take the lead in anchoring countries such as Georgia and others in the wider Black Sea region. The West must also rethink how it should engage and reach out to these countries. If membership is less plausible as a short-term option, then the quality of ties short of membership must be improved to compensate. Outreach must grow in importance and may increasingly become the centerpiece of U.S. and European strategy. At the moment, the fear of future enlargement is one factor actually holding allies back, with institutions afraid of taking even small steps down what some fear could be a slippery slope. Yet precisely because the countries in question are weaker and more endangered, NATO and the EU should actually be reaching out and engaging them earlier. They need the security umbrella and engagement of the West as much, if not more, than the countries of central and eastern Europe did. The way out of this dilemma is to consider membership a long-term goal and focus in the meantime on strengthening Western outreach and engagement. This means recasting policy tools to address the different needs of the countries that are less developed politically and economically. Tools such as NATO's" membership action plan" should be extended earlier and tied less closely to actual membership commitments, thus allowing these countries to benefit from guidance and engagement while downplaying the question of the end goal. At the same time, the EU needs to enhance its own tools, such as the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the European Neighborhood Policy, as well as reach out to these countries more directly by offering them political and economic support. When communism collapsed, NATO and the EU had little idea how to reach out to post-communist countries [102] ¶ Europe’s Eastern Promise and anchor them to the West. Bureaucrats in both institutions said it could not be done. But political will and strategic imagination prevailed, and fresh approaches were developed. Political will can do the same today. As for Russia, neither Washington nor Brussels wants a confrontation with Moscow at a time when they face daunting challenges beyond Europe. But this does not mean the West should abandon its belief that the spread of democracy along Russia's borders contributes to peace and stability just because the current authoritarian rulers in Moscow disagree. Nor should the West abandon its principles and succumb to the sphere-of-influence thinking currently emanating from Moscow. If the United States and Europe still hope that democracy will eventually take root in Russia, they must recognize that consolidating a pro-Western, democratic Ukraine would indirectly encourage democratization in Russia. Of course, antidemocratic forces in Russia will oppose such a move. After all, Moscow only acquiesced in previous rounds of NATO and EU enlargement because it concluded that the United States and Europe were determined to carry them out and that its efforts to oppose the West would be futile. Western unity on issues such as the future of Ukraine is therefore of the utmost importance. Still, holding true to NATO'S and the EU'S core principles and expanding these organizations' reach does not mean starting a new Cold War. The West and Moscow should look for other areas in which their interests are more aligned, such as expanding trade and investment or controlling nuclear proliferation and building a new arms control regime. The key question is whether Russia--when faced with a unified West-will start to look for common ground. As strong as Russia may appear at the moment, it remains a country with real long-terms structural weaknesses and problems. It, too, needs friends and allies, and the United States and Europe should be among them. UNCERTAIN FUTURES THREE VERY different scenarios for the future of Western policy toward Europe's periphery reveal just how high the stakes are in this region. In the best-case scenario, the United States and Europe would regroup under the next U.S. president and launch a new era of transatlantic operation by overcoming differences on Iraq, avoiding disagreements over Iran, and stabilizing Afghanistan. This renaissance would include a new and ambitious democratic-enlargement strategy, and the results would be significant. Securing independence for Kosovo without turning Serbia against the West would facilitate the successful integration of the western Balkans into NATO and the EU. In Turkey, the AKP-led government would continue democratic reforms, bringing the country closer to EU accession. Georgia and Ukraine would continue to move closer to the West as well. That prospect would help create positive pressure for democratic change in Azerbaijan and encourage Armenia's reorientation toward the West. By 2012, a reunified West would have begun to build an arc of democratic stability eastward into Eurasia and especially the wider Black Sea region. Realizing that its real adversaries lie elsewhere, Russia would eventually have no choice but to reassess its policy and seek a new rapprochement with the West. A less optimistic scenario is stagnation. In this case, the United States and Europe would regain some political momentum after 2008 but fail to achieve any significant democratic breakthroughs. A new U.S. administration would manage to stabilize and then extricate itself from Iraq, but transatlantic tensions over Iran and other Middle Eastern issues would persist. Kosovo would achieve independence, but in a manner that leaves Serbia alienated and unable to find its way back onto the path toward EU accession. In the western Balkans, only Croatia would remain on track for both EU and NATO membership. Turkey's prospects for joining the EU would fade, and reforms in Georgia and Ukraine would stall. Azerbaijan would remain an autocratic pro-Western ally increasingly vulnerable to growing radicalization from within. By 2012, the West would have patched up relations across the Atlantic but without breakthroughs in the Balkans or Turkey-let alone in Ukraine or the wider Black Sea region. All of this would lead to a more competitive relationship with Russia, resulting in stalemate and a new chill in relations with Moscow. In the worst-case scenario, rather than the West consolidating new democratic breakthroughs, Russia would succeed in a strategy [104] ¶ Europe' Eastern Promise of rollback. The United States and Europe would not achieve a meaningful rapprochement, and they would fail to consolidate democracy in the western Balkans. Kosovo would become independent, but without agreement from all sides. This would launch Serbia on a new nationalist trajectory, bringing further instability to the region. U.S. failure in Iraq would lead to partition, estranging Turkey and prompting Ankara to invade northern Iraq and further loosen its ties to the West. This, in turn, would badly damage Turkey's already strained relations with both Washington and Brussels. Ukraine would drift back to autocracy, and Georgia, the one liberal democratic experiment in the Black Sea region, would lose reform momentum and teeter toward failure. Last November's declaration of a state of emergency in Tbilisi was a reminder of how fragile and vulnerable this experiment is. Using its energy supplies and influence, Russia would emerge as an authoritarian capitalist alternative to the West, attracting autocratic leaders throughout Europe and Eurasia. Rather than a renaissance of the transatlantic alliance, the result would be a retreat of democracy and a further splintering of the democratic West. As these scenarios make clear, the western Balkans, Georgia, Ukraine, and the wider Black Sea region are less stable and more at risk today than central and eastern Europe were a decade ago. And the stakes are high. A world in which Ukraine has successfully anchored itself to the West would be very different from one in which it has failed to do so. A world in which Georgia's success has sparked democratic progress in the region and helped stabilize the southern flank of the Euro-Atlantic community would be a much safer one than a world in which Georgia has become an authoritarian state in Russia's sphere of influence. And a world in which the democratic West is ascendant would be very different from one in which an autocratic, nationalist Russia is on the rise.</span>

McDermott is on the editorial board of Central Asia and the Caucasus and the scientific board of the Journal of Power Institutions in Post-Soviet Societies. He recently wrote The Reform of Russia’s Conventional Armed Forces: Problems, Challenges and Policy Implications (Roger, “General Makarov Highlights the “Risk” of Nuclear Conflict”, 12/6/11, The Jamestown Foundation, [[http://www.jamestown.org/details/?tx_bzdstaffdirectory_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=140&tx_bzdstaffdirectory_pi1%5BbackPid%5D=60&no_cache=1]])

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In the current election season the Russian media has speculated that the Defense Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov may be replaced, possibly by Dmitry Rogozin, Russia’s Ambassador to NATO, which masks deeper anxiety about the future direction of the Armed Forces. The latest rumors also partly reflect uncertainty surrounding how the switch in the ruling tandem may reshuffle the pack in the various ministries, as well as concern about managing complex processes in Russian defense planning. On November 17, Russia’s Chief of the General Staff, Army-General Nikolai Makarov, offered widely reported comments on the potential for nuclear conflict erupting close to the country’s borders. His key observation was controversial, based on estimating that the potential for armed conflict along the entire Russian periphery had grown dramatically over the past twenty years (Profil, December 1; Moskovskiy Komsomolets, November 28; Interfax, November 17). During his speech to the Defense Ministry’s Public Council on the progress and challenges facing the effort to reform and modernize Russia’s conventional Armed Forces, Makarov linked the potential for local or regional conflict to escalate into large-scale warfare “possibly even with nuclear weapons.” Many Russian commentators were bewildered by this seemingly “alarmist” perspective. However, they appear to have misconstrued the general’s intention, since he was actually discussing conflict escalation (Interfax, ITAR-TASS, November 17; Moskovskiy Komsomolets, Krasnaya Zvezda, November 18). Makarov’s remarks, particularly in relation to the possible use of nuclear weapons in war, were quickly misinterpreted. Three specific aspects of the context in which Russia’s most senior military officer addressed the issue of a potential risk of nuclear conflict may serve to necessitate wider dialogue about the dangers of escalation. There is little in his actual assertion about the role of nuclear weapons in Russian security policy that would suggest Moscow has revised this; in fact, Makarov stated that this policy is outlined in the 2010 Military Doctrine, though he understandably made no mention of its classified addendum on nuclear issues (Kommersant, November 18). Russian media coverage was largely dismissive of Makarov’s observations, focusing on the idea that he may have represented the country as being surrounded by enemies. According to Kommersant, claiming to have seen the materials used during his presentation, armed confrontation with the West could occur partly based on the “anti-Russian policy” pursued by the Baltic States and Georgia, which may equally undermine Moscow’s future relations with NATO. Military conflict may erupt in Central Asia, caused by instability in Afghanistan or Pakistan; or western intervention against a nuclear Iran or North Korea; energy competition in the Arctic or foreign inspired “color revolutions” similar to the Arab Spring and the creation of a European Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system that could undermine Russia’s strategic nuclear deterrence also featured in this assessment of the strategic environment (Kommersant, November 18). Since the reform of Russia’s conventional Armed Forces began in late 2008, Makarov has consistently promoted adopting network-centric capabilities to facilitate the transformation of the military and develop modern approaches to warfare. Keen to displace traditional Russian approaches to warfare, and harness military assets in a fully integrated network, Makarov possibly more than any senior Russian officer appreciates that the means and methods of modern warfare have changed and are continuing to change (Zavtra, November 23; Interfax, November 17). The contours of this evolving and unpredictable strategic environment, with the distinctions between war and peace often blurred, interface precisely in the general’s expression of concern about nuclear conflict: highlighting the risk of escalation. However, such potential escalation is linked to the reduced time involved in other actors deciding to intervene in a local crisis as well as the presence of network-centric approaches among western militaries and being developed by China and Russia. From Moscow’s perspective, NATO “out of area operations” from Kosovo to Libya blur the traditional red lines in escalation; further complicated if any power wishes to pursue intervention in complex cases such as Syria. Potential escalation resulting from local conflict, following a series of unpredictable second and third order consequences, makes Makarov’s comments seem more understandable; it is not so much a portrayal of</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Russia surrounded by “enemies,” as a recognition that, with weak conventional Armed Forces, in certain crises Moscow may have few options at its disposal (Interfax, November 17). There is also the added complication of a possibly messy aftermath of the US and NATO drawdown from Afghanistan and signs that the Russian General Staff takes Central Asian security much more seriously in this regard. The General Staff cannot know whether the threat environment in the region may suddenly change. Makarov knows the rather limited conventional military power Russia currently possesses, which may compel early nuclear first use likely involving sub-strategic weapons, in an effort to “de-escalate” an escalating conflict close to Russia’s borders. Moscow no longer primarily fears a theoretical threat of facing large armies on its western or eastern strategic axes; instead the information-era reality is that smaller-scale intervention in areas vital to its strategic interests may bring the country face-to-face with a network-centric adversary capable of rapidly exploiting its conventional weaknesses. As Russia plays catch-up in this technological and revolutionary shift in modern warfare capabilities, the age-old problem confronts the General Staff: the fastest to act is the victor (See EDM, December 1). Consequently, Makarov once again criticized the domestic defense industry for offering the military inferior quality weapons systems. Yet, as speed and harnessing C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) become increasingly decisive factors in modern warfare, the risks for conflict escalation demand careful attention – especially when the disparate actors possess varied capabilities. Unlike other nuclear powers, Russia has to consider the proximity of several nuclear actors close to its borders. In the coming decade and beyond, Moscow may pursue dialogue with other nuclear actors on the nature of conflict escalation and de-escalation. However, with a multitude of variables at play ranging from BMD, US Global Strike capabilities, uncertainty surrounding the “reset” and the emergence of an expanded nuclear club, and several potential sources of instability and conflict, any dialogue must consider escalation in its widest possible context. Makarov’s message during his presentation, as far as the nuclear issue is concerned, was therefore a much tougher bone than the old dogs of the Cold War would wish to chew on.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Independently, Central Asian War goes nuclear</span>**
**Starr, 1** [S. Frederick, Chairman of Central Asia-Caucasus Institute @ Nitze School of Advanced Int’l. Studies @ Johns Hopkins U., Federal Document Clearing House Congressional Testimony, “CENTRAL ASIAN NATIONS AND THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST TERRORISM”, 12-13, L/N]

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">There exists a fundamental misunderstanding about the relationship of Central Asian states (and Russia, for that matter) to the war on terrorism. We hear about their "cooperation with the US," as if they are doing us a favor that should be rewarded. Nothing could be further from the truth. For a decade, the Central Asian states have faced the threat of Islamic radicalism, terrorism, and drug trafficking, with which the first two are closely linked. All of the Central Asian states have identified these issues as their main security threat, and Afghanistan as the locus of that threat. So has Russia, which has used the issue to justify the stationing of troops in four of the five countries of the region. To address this threat, Central Asian governments have arrested countless suspects, abrogating the civil rights of many who are doubtless innocent. All of the countries have resorted to the same primitive policies, the differences among them being only of degree, not of kind. Some commentators have argued that these measures are largely responsible for the growth of terrorism in the first place. There is some truth in this, but we must be careful in levying this charge. When we demand that Messers, Musharraf, Arafat, or Mubarrak crack down hard on jihhadist groups, Palestinian terrorists, or Muslim brotherhoods, are we not asking them to do exactly what we criticize Central Asian governments for doing? Americans bridle when our critics abroad blame September 11 on the US' actions, yet we come close to doing the same thing with respect to the Central Asians. Both the Central Asians and the Russians, who have claimed a special role in the region, have been notably unsuccessful in their campaigns against terrorism. But now the situation is changing, thanks to the United States. We are risking American soldiers' lives and expending billions of our citizens' resources to address a threat that hangs over their countries as much as ours. The fact that we have our own interests at heart in no way qualifies this truth. Early signs of progress in the war on terrorism already exceed what has been accomplished locally in a decade. And so let us cease all talk of some payment owed Central Asians (or Russians) for their cooperation. If anything, it is they who should thank us. However, this does not mean that US actions are without risk to the Central Asian states. Quite the contrary. For a decade they have faced not only the dangers arising from Afghanistan but also the constant threat posed by certain groups in Russia, notably the military and security forces, who are not yet reconciled to the loss of empire. This "imperial hangover" is not unique to Russia. France exhibited the same tendencies in Algeria, the Spanish in Cuba and Chile, and the British when they burned the White House in 1812. This imperial hangover will eventually pass, but for the time being it remains a threat. It means that the Central Asians, after cooperating with the US, will inevitably face redoubled pressure from Russia if we leave abruptly and without attending to the long-term security needs of the region. That we have looked kindly into Mr. Putin's soul does not change this reality. The Central Asians face a similar danger with respect to our efforts in Afghanistan. Some Americans hold that we should destroy Bin Laden, Al Queda, and the Taliban and then leave the post-war stabilization and reconstruction to others. Such a course runs the danger of condemning all Central Asia to further waves of instability from the South. But in the next round it will not only be Russia that is tempted to throw its weight around in the region but possibly China, or even Iran or India. All have as much right to claim Central Asia as their "backyard" as Russia has had until now. Central Asia may be a distant region but when these nuclear powers begin bumping heads there it will create terrifying threats to world peace that the U.S. cannot ignore.</span>

Europe is maneuvering to satisfy its energy needs while it cuts greenhouse gas emissions. China and India need the region's reserves to quench their booming economies' thirst for fuel. Meanwhile, the U.S. is challenging Russia's traditional control of the region's gas reserves - which are large - but not large enough for everyone.¶ Tense jockeying is underway - complete with corporate intrigue, diplomacy, and guns - as the United States, the European Union, Russia, China and India all vie for the right to build huge pipelines to get the oil and massive natural gas reserves out of the remote nations of Central Asia.¶ The latest twist in this power play came earlier this year, when Russia secured a long-term contract to buy a big chunk of natural gas from Tajikistan, which has one of the largest reserves in the world. But undaunted, other nations' plans for more pipelines - and military bases - proceed. "The increasing Asian interest suggests the region is open for other deals," said Katherine Hardin, senior director of Russian and Caspian energy at Cambridge Energy Research Associates.¶ Quenching a growing thirst for energy¶ The amount of natural gas at stake is enormous. If Russian and Iranian reserves are taken into account, the region holds around half of the world's gas, according to Melanie Kenderdine, an associate director at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Energy Initiative and a former aide in the administration of President Clinton.¶ The gas is going to thirsty but gas-starved regions. Europe and Asia hold just 11% of the worldwide reserves, said Kenderdine.¶ For the Europeans, the gas is essential if the continent is to meet its obligations to cut greenhouse gasses under the Kyoto treaty.¶ Europe will likely get the gas either way, but what it wants to avoid is too much dependence on Russia, which currently controls the only gas pipeline out of Central Asia. Russia has been known to cut off gas supplies when confronted with a political fight.¶ To bypass Russia, the Europeans are pushing for a a pipeline running west out out the region - under the Caspian Sea, across Turkey, and into Europe via the Black Sea. The Americans support this plan, largely as a means of reducing Russian influence over its allies in Europe.¶ Russia, meanwhile, needs the Central Asian gas to satisfy the contracts it has with Europe without having to develop its own remote gas fields, which would cost a lot more money. Russia wants the current lone gas line in the region, which runs north from Turkemenistan through Kazakhstan and into Russia, to remain the only option.¶ "Their goal is to buy everybody's else's gas cheap, sell it, and take the money," said Amy Myers Jaffe, a fellow in energy studies at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.¶ Russia has lots of gas - the most in the world - but most is in Arctic or sub- Arctic areas that are expensive to drill, said Christopher Ruppel, an energy analyst at Execution, LLC, a broker and research firm for institutional investors like hedge and mutual funds.¶ It's so cold, Ruppel said special metals are needed to withstand the Arctic winters, while summertime turns the entire area into a giant bog. He said one town in a gas-rich northern region even had a Russian name that translated loosely as "The Godforsaken Place Where You Don't Ever Want To Go."¶ So Russia will likely remain fixated on Central Asia's energy for the foreseeable future.¶ The relatively new players in the energy game - China and India - want to get in on the action to help fuel their fast growing economies. While being cut off from Central Asia's energy would hardly be a death blow for either country, the opportunity in the region presents a chance to get cleaner burning natural gas and flex some of their newfound geopolitical muscle.¶ China wants at least one pipeline to run east out of the region through Kazakhstan, while India is considering bringing in gas via pipelines from Iran or Pakistan.¶ The U.S. is in a diplomatic bind, eager to isolate Iran and Russia but wary of upsetting its European allies.¶ "Maybe it's better for these countries to sell their gas to China," said Jaffe. "But the problem is, you upset some guy in the State Department whose job it is to get the gas to Europe. I'm not even sure the U.S. understands why we're there."¶ A risky neighborhood¶ Although that may be the case, the U.S. is definitely there. Including Iraq and Turkey, the country has at least 11 military bases in the region, far more than anyone else, according to MIT's Kenderdine. In Central Asia itself, the U.S. has one base in Kyrgyzstan, while NATO maintains at least three others in the region.¶ While conspiracy theories abound, analysts say those bases are there mainly to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - pipeline protection is a distant secondary goal.¶ But with the new U.S. bases, other countries are getting in on the act. Russia, a long time presence in the neighborhood, is proposing a new base in Tajikistan, while China is considering one in Uzbekistan and is rumored to want one in Iran, said Kenderdine.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">**Maykuth 9/29** (ANDREW MAYKUTH / THE PHILADELPHIA Insider, “With success, natural gas industry eyes exports,” 9/29/12,[[http://businessmirror.com.ph/home/global-eye/33430-with-success-natural-gas-industry-eyes-exports]]) GANGEEZY</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">PHILADELPHIA—The natural-gas industry is drowning in its own success.¶ Drilling companies are extracting so much natural gas from formations like Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale that they want to export the fuel overseas, provoking opposition from some who say that American gas should stay at home.¶ At the Shale Gas Insight conference in Philadelphia last week, Jack Williams, president of XTO Energy, used the podium to promote the idea of exporting liquefied natural-gas ships.¶ “Just as we do with exports of grain, cars and other American products, by exporting LNG, we can create economic value that would not have existed otherwise,” Williams told the audience.¶ XTO has a lot to gain from exports. It is a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corp., the nation’s largest producer of natural gas, whose price has plummeted in the last few years because the shale-gas revolution is producing more gas than US markets can absorb.¶ Exxon Mobil in August submitted an application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to export liquefied natural gas, or LNG, from a terminal it co-owns in Sabine Pass, Texas. It’s one of seven facilities nationwide seeking federal approval to export.¶ Producers embrace the idea of exporting natural gas, which would increase demand, boost prices and spur more production. Exports would mean more American jobs producing gas. The income would also improve America’s balance of trade.¶ But proposals to build more LNG export terminals are controversial.¶ Some American chemical producers fear that shipping LNG to foreign consumers would make gas scarce here, just as the industry is undergoing a revival, thanks to abundant supplies of natural gas, a principal raw material.¶ American Public Gas Association, the trade group for utilities like Philadelphia Gas Works, has said that exports would produce “predictable and disastrous” results for household consumers.¶ Environmental groups like the Sierra Club have opposed new export terminals because they would induce more drilling, causing more environmental impact.¶ Others appeal to patriotic sentiments to block exports. T. Boone Pickens, who wants to replace imports of crude oil from unfriendly nations, thinks it would be folly to export natural gas.¶ The Energy Department is studying the economic effects of expanding LNG exports, but Reuters reported last week that the Obama administration delayed the release of the report until after the election.¶ In an interview last week, Williams said there was plenty of natural-gas supply to meet domestic demand and to export.¶ “The question is, do we want those additional jobs?” said Williams, a career employee with Exxon Mobil, a company famous for its long-term vision and executives who don’t make rash statements.¶ “The important thing is, we can do it all,” he said. “It’s not an either-or. We can support plenty of gas for American consumers in terms of electricity generation or heating our homes or our manufacturing sector, for niche applications in the transportation sector, and for export. We can do all that.”¶ Williams’s belief is based on confidence that the nation’s oil and gas reserves have grown dramatically because of the shale revolution. The combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has opened up huge reserves in “unconventional” formations previously thought unproductive.¶ “We have a hundred years of natural-gas supply in this country, and that’s a snapshot today,” said Williams, who took over XTO after Exxon bought the shale producer in 2009 in what amounted to a $31-billion endorsement of unconventional drilling.¶ But Williams says the current reserve estimates just may prove to be low. He has an enduring faith in the industry’s ability to devise new solutions.¶ “This whole phenomenon has been unlocked by technology, creativity and innovation,” he said. “And who’s to say that’s going to stop?”¶ “Those estimates of oil and gas, they’ve moved all over the place over the years. As technology develops, there’s no telling how high those numbers will go.”</span>
