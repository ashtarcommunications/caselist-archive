Contents [hide] 1 Background 2 Law Enforcement 3 Law Practice 3.1 Holocaust Denial Case 3.2 Forensic Practice 3.3 Publication of the Suppressed Dead Sea Scrolls 3.4 State Bar Prosecutor 4 Political Activism 5 Books 6 External links 7 References [edit]Background The eighth and last child of an American pioneer family, William John Cox was born on a cotton farm near Lubbock, Texas to Samuel Hubert and Minnie Irene (Oswalt) Cox.[1] Orphaned at age 10, he was raised by siblings until he attended New Mexico Military Institute, from which he graduated in 1958. After a four-year enlistment, Cox was honorably discharged as an United States Navy Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class in 1962. [edit]Law Enforcement Joining the “New Breed” movement to professionalize the American police service in the early Sixties, Cox served as president of the San Diego County Chapter of the Peace Officers Research Association of California (PORAC),[2] which was instrumental in establishing the first Peace Officers Standards and Training (POST) Commission and drafting the national Law Enforcement Code of Ethics.[3] Graduating with top honors from the San Diego Police Department[4] and Los Angeles Police Department Academies, Cox received an associate degree in Police Administration from Rio Hondo College in 1969. Promoted to Investigator and Sergeant, Cox authored the LAPD Policy Manual[5] and the introductory chapters of the Police Task Force report of President Nixon’s National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, which defined the role of the police in America.[6] In 1973 and 1974, Cox was the special assistant of the director of the Office of National Priority Programs in the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, which implemented national criminal justice standards and goals. [edit]Law Practice Cox was awarded a Juris Doctor degree cum laude by Southwestern Law School in 1973 and was administered his attorney’s oath by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Tom C. Clark.[7] Appointed a Deputy Los Angeles County District Attorney in 1974, Cox prosecuted a wide range of criminal cases in the Municipal and Superior Courts for the next three years. In 1977, Cox opened a public interest law practice in Long Beach, California in the historic Skinny House (Long Beach).[8] He primarily represented indigent juveniles accused of serious crimes and received court appointments in death penalty and major felony matters.[9] [edit]Holocaust Denial Case Among the cases Cox handled was a pro bono publico matter in which he represented Mel Mermelstein, a Jewish survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp. He investigated and sued a group of radical organizations, including the Liberty Lobby and Institute for Historical Review, that engaged in Holocaust denial and which had offered a reward for proof of Nazi gas chambers.[10] The primary legal issue in the case was resolved in October 1981, when the presiding judge took judicial notice of the fact that Jews were gassed to death at Auschwitz in the summer of 1944.[11] The “Holocaust Case” was the subject of the TNT motion picture, Never Forget, in April 1991 starring Leonard Nimoy and Dabney Coleman.[12] [edit]Forensic Practice Between 1984 and 1988, Cox served as general counsel and operations officer of a private security consulting and investigation firm, whose clients included a number of Fortune 500 companies and nuclear weapons sites operated by the United States Department of Energy. Cox recommenced a restricted practice of law in Long Beach, California and primarily provided investigative forensic services to other law firms for the next ten years. One of the leading cases he worked on was the successful litigation involving the heirs of The Three Stooges in support of attorney Bela G. Lugosi.[13] [edit]Publication of the Suppressed Dead Sea Scrolls In 1991, Cox secretly represented an “undisclosed client,” pro bono, and contracted with the Biblical Archaeology Society to print almost 1,800 photographs of the Dead Sea Scrolls that had been suppressed for more than 40 years.[14] A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls was published in November 1991.[15] On behalf of Professors Robert Eisenman and James M. Robinson, who had written an introduction and prepared an index for the book, Cox testified at a trial held in Jerusalem in January and February 1993, during which he refused to identify his client.[16] [edit]State Bar Prosecutor Between 1999 and 2007, Cox served as a supervising trial counsel for the State Bar of California, where he led a team of attorneys and investigators that targeted the prosecution of attorneys accused of serious crimes and misconduct and criminal gangs engaged in the unlawful practice of law.[17] [edit]Political Activism Alleging that control of the United States government had been seized by corporations and special interest groups, Cox filed a class action lawsuit in 1979 on behalf of every American citizen.[18] As a remedy, Cox petitioned the Supreme Court to order the President and Congress to conduct a National Policy Referendum to restore political power to the voters.[19] In 2004, Cox’s book, You’re Not Stupid! Get the Truth: A Brief on the Bush Presidency, was published by the Progressive Press.[20] Since retiring in 2007, Cox has dedicated himself to the promotion of a peaceful political evolution.[21] The political movement focuses on: holding a National Policy Referendum every four years coincident with the presidential election; using a national paper ballot to allow voters to personally answer the 12 most critical policy questions; and encouraging voters to write in the name of the candidate they most trust to effectuate their policy.[22] [edit]Books (1978), Hello: We Speak the Truth, (As Thomas Donn) CLS Publishing Company (2004), You’re Not Stupid!

Moreover, more aggressive U.S. antidumping efforts directly undercut President Obama’s trade agenda in at least five ways. First, antidumping duties are often placed on imported intermediate inputs. For example, higher costs of imported steel through a “strengthened” antidumping system cannot help U.S. auto exporters in their efforts to 4 increase exports to South Korea. More expensive inputs cannot help medium-sized U.S. firms break into the global market place. And reduced access to globally-sourced inputs will not encourage firms to establish new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Second, U.S. antidumping actions are often taken against developing countries (not including China), with average additional tariffs of 40 percent. Even higher duties on imports from poor nations through DOC’s proposed changes certainly would not help them achieve the Millennium Development Goals so important to the President. Third, history shows that changes in U.S. unfair trade policies usually become adopted by other countries. In the mid-1970s at the behest of the U.S. steel industry the U.S. broadened the definition of “unfair pricing” to include the constructed cost method. Within five years this new procedure was adopted throughout the world. In the mid-1980s, once again at the urging of the U.S. steel industry, the U.S. added the cumulation provision which sharply increased the likelihood that countries with small market shares (i.e., often developing countries) would be found to have injured the U.S. industry and caught in the unfair trade system (<span style="color: #0000ff;">Hansen and Prusa, 1996</span>). Within a few years all major countries using antidumping had added their own cumulation provision, with deleterious consequences for U.S. exporters. President Obama’s signature trade policy initiative, announced in his 2010 State of the Union Address, is to double U.S. exports. He also sounded a clear clarion call for increased access for developing country exports to help meet UN Millennium Development Goals intended to reduce grinding poverty in the poor nations. Last month the Department of Commerce (DOC) announced a series of proposals to strengthen the enforcement of U.S. trade laws.The incongruence of the DOC announcement with the other elements of the President’s trade agenda is striking. DOC’s actions would directly undercut the President’s two most prominent trade goals by potentially imposing new barriers to imported goods, including critical inputs for U.S. firms operating in a global economy as well as exports from developing countries. DOC may strike a pose that promises to promote trade in rhetoric; but in reality, the substance of the U.S. proposals will make countries less open to fair trade. The proposals do nothing to enhance exports and only serve to increase import protection. While inside the Beltway “spinning” of policy proposals is common, the DOC’s attempt to market proposals that make already highly restrictive policies even more protective as something that will enhance U.S. exports is astounding. These new proposals are especially troubling in light of the precarious state of the worldwide recovery; the set of proposals come at a particularly 2 inopportune time for both the U.S. and for the rest of the world. They also fly in the face of President Obama’s explicit agreement in the post-crisis G-20 summit to avoid actions that increase protectionism. The Department of Commerce may try to argue that increased “enforcement” of trade remedies such as antidumping and countervailing duties is not protectionism, but the reality is that such moves involved government imposed barriers to imports, which is by definition protectionism. The proposed set of policy changes not only fails to enhance U.S. export competitiveness but in fact will reduce the ability of U.S. firms to compete in the global marketplace. To begin with, they will discourage the importation of intermediate inputs, something vital to the competitiveness of high valueadded U.S. manufacturing exporters. More troubling, the proposals will likely exacerbate the increasingly onerous burden of trade remedies levied on U.S. exporters. This is not some imaginary risk – today only Chinese and Korean exporters are subject to more unfair trade investigation than U.S. exporters are. As has repeatedly happened, other countries follow the U.S. lead in designing their unfair trade statutes. The U.S. moves toward protectionism today become our trading partners moves (including moves against U.S. exporters) tomorrow. If the President’s export initiative has any chance of being realized, the DOC must temper these policy proposals and instead develop policies that truly enhance the trade environment. To this end, we note that the WTO Appellate Body has repeatedly found existing U.S. unfair trade laws are inconsistent with the WTO agreement. In fact, there are more findings against the U.S. than against any other WTO member. None of the current proposals address the known inconsistencies of U.S. laws and the new proposals may even spur new dispute settlement cases against the U.S. Instead of plans for new ways to restrict imports, proposals that bring the U.S. trade remedy laws into WTO compliance would reestablish the President’s commitment to the rule of law and multilateral solutions to problems. Moreover, U.S. adherence to WTO commitments as interpreted by the Dispute Settlement Body would provide incentives for other countries to live up to their own responsibilities vis-à-vis U.S. exporters. Reforming our own antidumping laws to make the U.S. more open therefore truly would promote President Obama’s export initiative

Introduced at the start of the Great Depression, </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">it triggered a series of tit-for-tat economic responses, which</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> many commentators believe </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">helped turn a serious economic downturn into a prolonged and devastating global disaster</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, But </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">if history is any guide, those lessons will have been long forgotten during the next collapse</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Eventually, fed by a mood of desperation and growing public anger, restrictions on trade, finance, investment, and immigration will almost certainly intensify. Authorities and ordinary citizens will likely scrutinize the cross-border movement of Americans and outsiders alike, and lawmakers may even call for a general crackdown on nonessential travel. Meanwhile, many nations will make transporting or sending funds to other countries exceedingly difficult. As desperate officials try to limit the fallout from decades of ill-conceived, corrupt, and reckless policies, they will introduce controls on foreign exchange, foreign individuals and companies seeking to acquire certain American infrastructure assets, or trying to buy property and other assets on the (heap thanks to a rapidly depreciating dollar, will be stymied by limits on investment by noncitizens. Those efforts will cause spasms to ripple across economies and markets, disrupting global payment, settlement, and clearing mechanisms. All of this will, of course, continue to undermine business confidence and consumer spending. In a world of lockouts and lockdowns, any link that transmits systemic financial pressures across markets through arbitrage or portfolio-based risk management, or that allows diseases to be easily spread from one country to the next by tourists and wildlife, or that otherwise facilitates unwelcome exchanges of any kind will be viewed with suspicion and dealt with accordingly. </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">The rise in isolationism and protectionism will bring about ever more heated arguments and dangerous confrontations over shared sources of oil, gas, and other key commodities</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> as well as factors of production that must, out of necessity, be acquired from less-than-friendly nations. Whether involving raw materials used in strategic industries or basic necessities such as food, water, and energy, efforts to secure adequate supplies will take increasing precedence in a world where demand seems constantly out of kilter with supply. </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">Disputes over the misuse, overuse, and pollution of the environment and natural resources will become more commonplace. Around the world, such tensions will give rise to full-scale military encounters, often with minimal provocation. </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">In some instances, </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">economic conditions will serve as a convenient pretext for conflicts that stem from cultural and religious differences. Alternatively, nations may look to divert attention away from domestic problems by channeling frustration and populist sentiment toward other countries</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and cultures. </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">Enabled by cheap technology and the waning threat of American retribution, terrorist groups will likely boost the frequency and scale of their horrifying attacks</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, bringing the threat of random violence to a whole new level. </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">Turbulent conditions will encourage aggressive saber rattling</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and interdictions by rogue nations running amok. Age-old clashes will also take on a new, more healed sense of urgency. </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">China will likely assume an increasingly belligerent posture toward Taiwan, while Iran may embark on overt colonization of its neighbors </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">in the Mideast. </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">Israel,</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> for its part, </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">may look to draw</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> a dwindling list of allies from around </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">the world into</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> a growing number of </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">conflicts</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Some observers, like John Mearsheimer, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, have even speculated that an "intense confrontation" between the United States and China is "inevitable" at some point. More than a few disputes will turn out to be almost wholly ideological. Growing cultural and religious differences will be transformed from wars of words to battles soaked in blood. </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">Long-simmering resentments could also degenerate quickly, spurring the basest of human instincts and triggering genocidal acts. Terrorists employing biological or nuclear weapons will vie with conventional forces using jets, cruise missiles, and bunker-busting bombs to cause widespread destruction. Many will interpret stepped-up conflicts between Muslims and Western societies as the beginnings of a new world war.</span>
