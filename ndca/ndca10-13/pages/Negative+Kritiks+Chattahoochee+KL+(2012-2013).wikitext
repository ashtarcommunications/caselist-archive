environmental problems ... with manageable and entertaining pseudo-environmentalism. (ibid.)


**Given our positions as debaters and academics our alternative is less utopian and more pragmatic---as critical theorists our role is to ask questions to open heuristic spaces for reflection---obviously we don’t change politics, but it’s better than pretending to reform a fantasmic system from a cloistered college campus---this is also a DA to the perm**

Academic and activist opinion nonetheless frequently argues that Utopian endeavour is necessary for radical environmentalism

that human affairs might feasibly be much improved is an eminently realistic proposition.

**Third – fixidity – We cannot begin our engagement with politics via a pre-determined plan of action. This guts solvency and leaves us powerless to adapt to specific situations, turns the case**
**Gilbert Et Al 2008** (Jeremy Gilbert, Éric Alliez, Claire Colebrook, Peter Hallward, Nicholas Thoburn - all have PhDs and whatever; "Deleuzian Politics? A Roundtable Discussion"; New Formations)

Claire: If you think about contemporary politics: all we have to do is AND to work is if it has a notion of redefinition that is inbuilt.

**Fourth -- visibility – once the state knows your plan of attack cooption is inevitable. The only successful attacks against the state require invisible and unknowable challenges to state hegemony. Even if their politics could create change it would be rubber-stamped by the state and rendered always-already an empty signifier creating only enough change to be completely worthless. The visibility of the plan negates revolutionary potential.**
**The Invisible Committee 2009** (an anonymous group of French intellectuals. The coming insurrection.)

In a demonstration, a union member tears the mask off of an anonymous person AND some of this society’s somebodies illustrates why there’s such joy in being nobody.

**Solvency – The logic of speed corrupts local politics – leads to serial policy failure**
**Kellner, ‘99** – Douglas, Ph.D Philosophy from Columbia, George F. Kneller Philosophy of Education Chair, ‘Virilio, War, and Technology Some Critical Reflection’, Ebsco // JK

Politics too succumbs to the logic of speed and potential holocaust as increased speed in AND politics further diminishes the space and role of democratic political participation and interaction.

==Security Kritik== 
===1NC Doubles Glenbrooks=== 

**Their security reps are inaccurate and cause action-reaction cycles. Such cycles are the root of violence and make extinction inevitable. Even if they win that their impacts are true, or that primacy is good for “humanitarian aid” they must first prove their apocalypticism is a good method to approach crises stability.**
**Calkivik 10** (Emine, A DISSERTATION SUBMITTED TO THE FACULTY OF THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, “DISMANTLING SECURITY”, October 2010, [[http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/99479/1/Calkivik_umn_0130E_11576.pdf]])

Poultry and peasants may seem unlikely subjects to begin narrating international relations. Yet AND How could they help us envision a new ethics, a new politics?

**Vote Neg to reject the dominant framing of security. A renewed focus on the epistemological and representational security lens is a prerequisite to effective policy solutions**
**Bruce ‘96** (Robert, Associate Professor in Social Science – Curtin University and Graeme Cheeseman, Senior Lecturer – University of New South Wales, Discourses of Danger and Dread Frontiers, p. 5-9)

This goal is pursued in ways which are still unconventional in the intellectual milieu of AND resistant to them, or choose not to understand them, and why?

===1NC (TI Security)=== 

**The creatin of enemies is purely psychological – that creates a self fulfilling prophecy**

We not only need enemies (Volkan, "Need," "Blood Lines"), AND The psychoanalytic work of comprehending September 11, 2001 is scarcely begun.

**Framing governmental support for infrastructure in terms of security authorizes violent mechanisms of disciplinary control, framing humanity in terms of logistical life while destroying the quality of life and instantiating the wholesale destruction of entire populations. The alt is to reject the aff’s securitized framing – only reversal can solve**
**Reid 8** (Julian – lecturer in International Relations at King’s College, visiting professor in International Relations at the University of Lapland, “Conclusion: The Biopolitics of Critical Infrastructure Protection,” Securing ‘the Homeland:’ Critical Infrastructure, Risk and (In)Security, Ed. Myriam Dunn Cavelty and Kristian Soby Kristensen, p. 178-179)

Therefore, the contemporary reification of critical infrastructure as an object for protection owes a AND creates important openings for the further exploration of such a line of questioning.

===1NC (Generic)=== 

**Their security reps are inaccurate and cause action-reaction cycles. Such cycles are the root of violence and make extinction inevitable.**
**Der Derian 98** (James, Professor of Political Science – University of Massachusetts, On Security, Ed. Lipschutz, p. 24-25)

No other concept in international relations packs the metaphysical punch, nor commands the disciplinary AND on the otherness of death, and identities calcifying into a fearful sameness.

**Vote Neg to reject the dominant framing of security. A renewed focus on the epistemological and representational security lens is a prerequisite to effective policy solutions**
**Bruce ‘96** (Robert, Associate Professor in Social Science – Curtin University and Graeme Cheeseman, Senior Lecturer – University of New South Wales, Discourses of Danger and Dread Frontiers, p. 5-9)

This goal is pursued in ways which are still unconventional in the intellectual milieu of AND resistant to them, or choose not to understand them, and why?

===2NC Impact Overview=== 

**Fear of death is bad**
**Park 06** (James, Philosophy Professor at the University of Minnesota, “Our Existential Predicament: Loneliness Depression Anxiety and Death”)

Our fundamental absurdity is disclosed when the mad rush called “life” stops, AND , and security, and floating serenely on a surprising hope and joy.

**The impact is extinction**
**Coviello 2000** (Peter, Assist. Prof. of English @ Bowdoin College, Queer Frontiers: Millennial Geographies, Genders, and Generations, "Apocalypse from Now On")

Apocalypse, as I began by saying, changed – it did not go away AND or otherwise, seems a civic initiative that can scarcely be done without.

===2NC Positivism DA=== 

**Discount affirmative knowledge claims – they are products of a flawed positivist epistemology**
**Smith, 97** [Steve Smith, Professor at Aberystwyth, becoming Head of the Department of International Politics at the University of Wales BSc in Politics and International Studies in 1973, an MSc degree in International Studies in 1974 and a PhD degree in International Relations in 1978, all from the University of Southampton. Power and truth: a reply to William Wallace Review of International Studies, 1997, 23]

Therefore, Wallace would see detachment where I see engagement; hiding behind the walls AND either natural or a matter of common sense. (508-9)

===2NC Epistemology DA=== 

**Distrust their evidence - their authors have political motives to fearmonger**
**Zenko & Cohen 12** (Micah Zenko, fellow at the Center for Preventative Action at the Council on Foreign Relations AND Michael Cohen, Fellow at the Century Foundation, March/April 2012, "Clear and Present Safety: The United States Is More Secure Than Washington Thinks," Foreign Affairs, Vol. 91(2))

The disparity between foreign threats and domestic threatmongering results from a confluence of factors. AND defense contractors, lobbying groups, think tanks, and academic departments.

===2NC Framework=== 

**Framing Comes First**

David and Grondin p. 182-3 2006)

Relations between states are, at least in part, constructed upon representations. Representations AND course of action one will adopt in order to deal with this 'other'.

**Role playing is bad – kills agency**
**Kappeler, 95** (Susanne is an associate professor at al-akhawayn university, “the will to violence: the politics of personal behavior”, pg. 10-11)

Which is why many of those not yet entirely disillusioned with politics tend to engage AND our values’ according to the structures and the values of war and violence.

===AT: Realism=== 

**We address the root cause of the realist institution - The alternative is extinction**
John E. **Mack 86** is a Doctor of Psychiatry and a professor at Harvard University “Epilogue: Aggression and Its Alternatives in the Conduct of International Relations” http://www.johnemackinstitute.org/ejournal/article.asp?id=282

The self-glorification of nations lies at the root of war, the conviction AND soul will, before long, lead to the extinction of life altogether.

===AT: Perm=== 

**Footnoting DA—including the aff makes the K an afterthought**
**Der Derian 95** (James, Professor of Political Science – University of Massachusetts, International Theory: Critical Investigations, p. 374)

But what happens - as seems to be the case to this observer AND we might call this the 'Spiro-ette effect' in International Relations.

===AT: Alt Fails=== 

**Vote negative to interrogate cycles of enemy creation and accept that he US cannot master the universe —this can create a fissure in dominant narratives that make war inevitable**
**Byles 3**—English, U Cyprus (Joanna, Psychoanalysis and War: The Superego and Projective Identification, http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/journal/articles/art_byles01.shtml)

It is here of course that language plays an important role in imagining the other AND a state of mind and, most importantly, a way of thinking.

===Link -- Airpower=== 

**US bombing campaigns transform innocent civilians into disposable bodies as the propagandist logic of military necessity justifies ongoing slaughter**

Implicit in competitive and deterrent strategies are perceptions of the enemy as incorrigible regarding one's AND strategies, and will in any case add a sharp edge to them.

**Deterrence strategies make us invincible – creates a prerequisite to nuclear war**
**Chernus 91** - , Professor of Religious Studies at UC Boulder, Ira, Nuclear Madness: on Religion and Psychology in the Nuclear Age, p19-20

Yet another of PNAC’s co-founders chose to remain on the ‘outside’, AND the only state with the ‘knowledge’ but also the capability to intervene.

For all these reasons, many observers have concluded that world politics is experiencing not AND and prosperity that it has provided since the middle of the twentieth century.

**No transition wars- rising states will integrate into international institutions- no incentives for aggression**
Ikenberry, ‘11** (G. John, Albert G. Milbank Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University, The Future of the Liberal World Order Subtitle: Internationalism After America, Foreign Affairs, May/June, lexis)

**Chernus 6** (Ira, Professor of Religious Studies and Co-director of the Peace and Conflict Studies Program – University of Colorado-Boulder, Monsters to Destroy: The Neoconservative War on Terror and Sin, p. 53-54)

Yet another tried and true geopolitical metaphor is the concept of the "power vacuum AND " because it is not in fact a "vacuum" at all.

For all these reasons,many observers have concluded that world politics is experiencing not AND and prosperity that it has provided since the middle of the twentieth century.
