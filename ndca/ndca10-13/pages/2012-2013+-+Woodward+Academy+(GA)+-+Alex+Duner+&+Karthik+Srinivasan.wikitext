==1AC—UGA== 
===Note=== 
At this tournament, Karthik Srinivasan debated with Sahil Patel.

===Plan=== 
The Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve should substantially invest in transportation infrastructure in the United States.

===Economic Growth=== 

**First, the Fed’s bond-buying has pumped 3 trillion into the economy and will continue indefinitely — no disad to Fed action or stimulus is unique.**
**Reuters 1/30** — Reuters, 2013 (“Fed keeps stimulus in place as U.S. economy "paused",” Byline Alister Bull and Pedro da Costa, January 30th, Available Online at [[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-30/business/sns-rt-us-usa-fedbre90t0tf-20130130_1_dual-mandate-policy-accommodation-monetary-policy]], Accessed 02-04-2013)
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left in place its monthly $85 billion bond-buying stimulus plan, arguing the support was needed to lower unemployment even as it indicated a recent stall in U.S. economic growth was likely temporary. <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">AND Most analysts do not expect the outlook for the labor market to show the substantial improvement the Fed wants to see this year, keeping it on track for further bond buying.</span>

**Second, the economy is not recovering — millions are unemployed and growth has stalled.**
**Zuckerman 2/1** — Mortimer Zuckerman, Editor of U.S. News & World Report, Publisher of the New York Daily News, 2013 (“How We Can End Our Modern-Day Depression,” U.S. News & World Report, February 2nd, Available Online at http://www.usnews.com/opinion/mzuckerman/articles/2013/02/01/mort-zuckerman-how-we-can-end-our-modern-day-depression, Accessed 02-05-2013)
If you went out this morning and saw hundreds of people lining up at soup kitchens, you'd think you were in a time machine, transported back to the Great Depression of the '30s, or the victim of a hallucination incubated by powerful images of those times. AND When economic activity picks up, employers will undoubtedly first choose to increase hours for existing workers.

**Fortunately, the plan boosts growth — we’ll isolate three internal links.**

**First, jobs — current bond-buying won’t stimulate the real economy — the plan is crucial to increase aggregate demand, GDP, and employment in every state.**
**Lau 12** — Lawrence J. Lau, Kwoh-Ting Li Professor of Economic Development in the Department of Economics at Stanford University, Ralph and Claire Landau Professor of Economics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, former vice-chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, holds a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California-Berkeley, 2012 (“What should the Fed do to jump-start US economy?,” China Daily, August 17th, Available Online at [[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2012-08/17/content_15682382.htm]], Accessed 10-17-2012)
The world economy has already experienced both "Quantitative Easing I (QE-I)" and "Quantitative Easing II (QE-II)" operations by the US Federal Reserve Board (Fed). AND (In fact, a similar plan can be used for Greece, so that while Greece needs to reduce its recurrent government expenditures, it can still undertake some capital projects so as to maintain some economic growth and prevent unemployment from becoming too high.)

**Second, investment — the plan spurs private investment in infrastructure — it’s crucial to get conservative investors off the sidelines.**
**Greider 11/7** — William Greider, National Affairs Correspondent for The Nation, former reporter and editor at the Washington Post, holds a degree from Princeton University, 2012 (“Can the Federal Reserve Help Prevent a Second Recession?,” The Nation, November 7th, Available Online at [[http://www.thenation.com/article/171126/can-federal-reserve-help-prevent-second-recession|http://www.thenation.com/article/171126/can-federal-reserve-help-prevent-second-recession#]], Accessed 01-23-2013)
Stephen Sleigh, a labor economist and director of the national pension fund for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, has similar ideas about how the Fed can persuade private capital investment to finance major infrastructure projects. AND If that occurs, these and other proposals for action will become highly relevant.

**That’s crucial to economic recovery — traditional stimulus fails.**
**Carew 12** — Diana G. Carew, Economist at the Progressive Policy Institute, formerly served as policy analyst at the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. and as an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, holds an M.A. in Applied Economics from Johns Hopkins University, 2012 (“Move Over Demand, Make Room for Investment,” The Progressive Fix, August 3rd, Available Online at [[http://www.progressivepolicy.org/2012/08/move-over-demand-make-room-for-investment/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=move-over-demand-make-room-for-investment|http://www.progressivepolicy.org/2012/08/move-over-demand-make-room-for-investment/]], Accessed 08-24-2012)
It’s become conventional wisdom: when the economy falters, it’s because people aren’t spending. AND But until they realize that aim misses the mark we will continue to take the slow, winding road forward.

**Third, infrastructure — the plan is crucial to revitalize transportation infrastructure — its deterioration crushes the economy.**
**Reuters 1/15** — Reuters, 2013 (“Report: 3.5M jobs ride on infrastructure funding,” January 15th, Available Online at [[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-15/business/chi-report-35m-jobs-ride-on-infrastructure-funding-20130115_1_janet-kavinoky-infrastructure-projects-highway-projects]], Accessed 02-04-2013)
Imagine a future of broken bridges, roads, sewer systems, power grids, airports and not enough money to fix them or to build new ones to serve an expanding population. AND <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">The study projected the funding gap for infrastructure projects to swell to $4.7 trillion by 2040, resulting in nearly 7 million lost jobs.</span>

**Only the plan solves — no disad is unique.**
**Peterson 13** — Eric C. Peterson, Transportation Policy Consultant at the Eno Center for Transportation—a neutral, non-partisan think-tank that promotes policy innovation, former Staff Member for U.S. Senator John Warner (R-Va), former Deputy Administrator for the U. S. Department of Transportation’s Research and Innovative Technology Administration, 2013 (“Is Quantitative Easing an Option for Infrastructure Financing?,” Eno Brief Newsletter—a publication of the Eno Center for Transportation, January, Available Online at [[http://www.enotrans.org/eno-brief/is-quantitative-easing-an-option-for-infrastructure-financing]], Accessed 02-20-2013)
Over the past four years, in an effort to stimulate employment and stabilize the national economy, the Federal Reserve has carried out three exercises it referred to as “Quantitative Easing.” AND In both the long-term and the short-term such a move could be highly beneficial and transformative.

**And, growth is the controlling internal-link—even small growth-rate differentials produce large fiscal impacts**
**Swanson 11** — Bret Swanson, President of Entropy Economics—a research firm focused on technology and the global economy, President of Entropy Capital—a venture firm that invests in early-stage technology companies, Visiting Fellow at Digital Society, Fellow at the National Chamber Foundation, former Senior Fellow and Director of the Center for Global Innovation at The Progress & Freedom Foundation, 2011 (“The Growth Imperative,” Forbes, May 27th, Available Online at http://www.forbes.com/sites/bretswanson/2011/05/27/the-growth-imperative/, Accessed 08-29-2012)
The central factor in America’s fiscal future is hardly being discussed. AND Economic growth helps federal, state, and local budgets, sure, but more importantly creates opportunity for generations of Americans, particularly those whose outlook today seems bleakest.

**The impact is large: economic growth is crucial to address all global challenges.**
**Silk 93** — Leonard Silk, Distinguished Professor of Economics at Pace University, Senior Research Fellow at the Ralph Bunche Institute on the United Nations at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and former Economics Columnist with the New York Times, 1993 (“Dangers of Slow Growth,” Foreign Affairs, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
Like the Great Depression, the current economic slump has fanned the firs of nationalist, ethnic and religious hatred around the world. AND But economic growth – and growth alone – creates the additional resources that make it possible to achieve such fundamental goals as higher living standards, national and collective security, a healthier environment, and more liberal and open economies and societies.

**Finally, economic decline increases the risk of war—strong statistical support.**
**Royal 10** — Jedidiah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, M.Phil. Candidate at the University of New South Wales, 2010 (“Economic Integration, Economic Signalling and the Problem of Economic Crises,” Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, Edited by Ben Goldsmith and Jurgen Brauer, Published by Emerald Group Publishing, ISBN 0857240048, p. 213-215)
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict. AND Those studies tend to focus on dyadic interdependence instead of global interdependence and do not specifically consider the occurrence of and conditions created by economic crises. As such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.

===Chinese Foreign Direct Investment=== 

**First, Chinese direct investment in the United States is on the brink — failure to improve access will force China to invest elsewhere.**
**Hanemann 12/28** — Thilo Hanemann, Research Director at the Rhodium Group where he specializes in Chinese Foreign Direct Investment, 2012 (“Chinese FDI in the U.S. in 2012: A Record Year Amid A Gloomy FDI Environment,” China Economic Watch—a publication of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, December 28th, Available Online at http://www.piie.com/blogs/china/?p=2147, Accessed 01-29-2013)
Developments in 2012 also underscored the political hurdles in the process of China becoming a major source of FDI for the US. AND It is too early to declare Europe the winner in the race for Chinese investment, but it is time for Washington to move past politics, emphasize openness and tackle structural reforms to ensure the United States remains a top destination for FDI from China and elsewhere.

**Second, infrastructure investment is vital — the status quo is insufficient.**
**Caijing 12/18** — Caijing—an independent Beijing-based magazine about finance and economics, 2012 (“Chinese Investment to the U.S. Speeds Up,” Byline Jin Yan and Wang Yanchun, December 18th, Available Online at [[http://english.caijing.com.cn/2012-12-18/112372718.html]], Accessed 01-29-2013)
With accelerating investment in the United States already a consensus among the Chinese business community, attention has now turned to specific areas for investment. AND <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Those issues aside, the consensus between the two sides is that if the misunderstandings and current obstacles cannot be overcome, a major opportunity for both sides will be squandered.</span>

**Third, the plan solves — it spurs Chinese direct investment in U.S. infrastructure.**
**Greider 11/7** — William Greider, National Affairs Correspondent for The Nation, former reporter and editor at the Washington Post, holds a degree from Princeton University, 2012 (“Can the Federal Reserve Help Prevent a Second Recession?,” The Nation, November 7th, Available Online at [[http://www.thenation.com/article/171126/can-federal-reserve-help-prevent-second-recession|http://www.thenation.com/article/171126/can-federal-reserve-help-prevent-second-recession#]], Accessed 01-23-2013)
A solution Sleigh envisions would involve bond borrowing for public-private infrastructure projects that would be “labor-intensive and great for long-term economic growth and would absolutely help us meet our obligations, because these bonds are going to yield 6 to 8 percent on our investments.” AND If that occurs, these and other proposals for action will become highly relevant.

**Fourth, that cements U.S.-China economic cooperation — it boosts relations and economic growth.**
**Backaler 10/3** — Joel Backaler, Director at Frontier Strategy Group—an emerging markets-focused business advisory firm, author of TheChinaObserver.com—an award-winning China business blog, 2012 (“Why the U.S. Needs Chinese Investment,” Business Week, October 3rd, Available Online at [[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-10-03/why-the-u-dot-s-dot-needs-chinese-investment]], Accessed 01-29-2013)
China’s own economic slowdown is affecting the latest earnings reports of U.S. companies, including Nike (NKE) and McDonald’s (MCD), which depend on China’s growing economy to fuel their rapid international expansion. AND As Chinese investments continue to increase, whoever assumes office in 2013 should make the promotion of Chinese investment in the United States a priority—both to improve bilateral relations with China and to fuel the U.S. economic recoveryy.

**Fifth, this improves overall U.S.-China relations and fosters greater cooperation — foreign direct investment is crucial.**
**Hills 12/19** — Carla A. Hills, Co-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, Chair of the National Committee on United States-China Relations, served as United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President and as a U.S. Trade Representative under President Bush, 2012 (“China's investment in the US benefits both,” China Daily, December 19th, Available Online at http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2012-12/19/content_16030764.htm, Accessed 01-29-2013)
Leaders of the United States and China have repeatedly stated that the bilateral relationship between the world's two largest economies will shape the 21st century. AND <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">In short, Chinese investment in the US is a win-win proposition for America and for China and should be encouraged by both sides.</span>

**Sixth, strong U.S.-China cooperation is crucial to address all global challenges.**
**Cohen et al. 9** — William S. Cohen, Chairman and CEO of The Cohen Group—a strategic business consulting firm, served as Secretary of Defense from 1997 until 2001, served in the U.S. Senate from 1979 to 1997 and in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1975 to 1979, et al., 2009 (“Smart Power in U.S.-China Relations,” Smart Power in U.S.-China Relations: A Report of the CSIS Commission on China, March, Available Online at http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090304_mcgiffert_uschinasmartpower_web.pdf, Accessed 08-13-2012, p. 1)
The evolution of Sino-U.S. relations over the next months, years, and decades has the potential to have a greater impact on global security and prosperity than any other bilateral or multilateral arrangement. AND Virtually no major global challenge can be met without U.S.-China cooperation.

**Finally, that prevents nuclear war and extinction.**
**Wittner 11** — Lawrence S. Wittner, Emeritus Professor of History at the State University of New York at Albany, holds a Ph.D. in History from Columbia University, 2011 (“Is a Nuclear War with China Possible?,” Huntington News, November 28th, Available Online at http://www.huntingtonnews.net/14446, Accessed 02-07-2013)
While nuclear weapons exist, there remains a danger that they will be used. AND If the American and Chinese people are interested in ensuring their survival and that of the world, they should be working to encourage these policies.

===USFG=== 

**The Fed is executive AND legislative — we meet.**
**Strong 1** — Michael Wade Strong, holds a J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School, served as a Research Assistant for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, 2001 (“Rethinking the Federal Reserve System: A Monetarist Plan for a More Constitutional System of Central Banking,” Indiana Law Review (34 Ind. L. Rev. 371), Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
The President has two checks on the authority of executive departments and agencies: (1) the power of appointment, and (2) the power of removal. AND But historically, the President has maintained unlimited authority to remove the leaders of purely executive agencies. n147

**Counter-interpretation: the federal government includes independent agencies — this includes the Fed.**
**NALP 12** — NALP—The Association for Legal Career Professionals—a nonprofit educational association established to meet the needs of all participants in the legal employment process, 2012 (“2011-2012 Federal Legal Employment Opportunities Guide,” Available Online at [[http://www.law.asu.edu/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=bfNbH9KWjsY%3D&tabid=1136]], Accessed 11-08-2012)
All three branches of the federal government employ attorneys: the executive (the President and his or her administration), the legislative (the Senate and the House of Representatives), and the judicial. AND In contrast, the number of attorney jobs in the legislature is smaller, as is the number of jobs with the judiciary. (For more information about working for Congress, see Yale Law School’s Guide, “Working on Capitol Hill” at [[http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/CDO_Public/2010_PUBLIC_CAPITOL_HILL_%20GUIDE_FINAL.pdf|http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/CDO_Public/2010_PUBLIC_CAPITOL_HILL_ GUIDE_FINAL.pdf]].)

**Prefer our interpretation: official government definition.**
**FederalReserve.gov 12** — FederalReserve.gov—the official website of the Federal Reserve, last updated in 2012 (“What is the difference between monetary policy and fiscal policy, and how are they related?,” Last Updated on March 30th, Available Online at http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/money_12855.htm, Accessed 10-30-2012)
Monetary policy is a term used to refer to the actions of central banks to achieve macroeconomic policy objectives such as price stability, full employment, and stable economic growth. AND Fiscal policy decisions are determined by the Congress and the Administration; the Federal Reserve plays no role in determining fiscal policy.

**Civic Engagement DA—**
**A. The Fed is part of the USFG—their interpretation insulates it from public scrutiny.**
**Luck 11** — Zachary J. Luck, J.D. Candidate at the Northwestern University School of Law, writer for the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy’s Harvard Law & Policy Review blog, 2011 (“The Administrative State is Still The State,” Harvard Law & Policy Review blog, February 3rd, Available Online at [[http://hlpronline.com/2011/02/the-administrative-state-is-still-the-state/]], Accessed 10-30-2012)
In the Invention of Money, a Planet Money feature on This American Life last month, the reporters peel back the layers on the terrifyingly crazy fiction called money. AND But at the same time, as citizens we have to remember that the Fed is, and can only be, as “independent” as our elected representatives allow.

**B. Civic engagement with the Fed is key to avert Depression—the case is a DA to their interpretation.**
**Greider 11/7** — William Greider, National Affairs Correspondent for The Nation, former reporter and editor at the Washington Post, holds a degree from Princeton University, 2012 (“Can the Federal Reserve Help Prevent a Second Recession?,” The Nation, November 7th, Available Online at [[http://www.thenation.com/article/171126/can-federal-reserve-help-prevent-second-recession|http://www.thenation.com/article/171126/can-federal-reserve-help-prevent-second-recession#]], Accessed 11-08-2012)
Bernanke’s term as chairman expires in January 2014. If the economy subsequently spins out of control, he will be the scapegoat. AND It cannot begin until the people find their voice and we, as citizens, reclaim our right to be heard.

In his recent book The Social Conquest of Earth, Edward O. Wilson lifts a corner of human history and reveals what appears to be a hidden mechanism of its intricately complex guidance system. …But Edward O. Wilson seems to be saying to us that the corruption—no matter how insidious or painful it may be—will, in the larger scheme of things, be merely an incidental cost of great social achievement. It is better to undertake great projects, even though they my be milked by cheats and villains, than to undertake no projects at all.

**Transportation infrastructure is an example of a public priority that has been ignored—it is crumbling, and continued shortfalls will decimate the economy.**
**EDR Group 11** — Economic Development Research Group, Inc.—a consulting firm focusing specifically on applying state-of-the-art tools and techniques for evaluating economic development performance, impacts, and opportunities, comprised of economists and planners who are specialists in evaluating the impacts of transportation infrastructure, services, and technology on economic development opportunities, 2011 (“Executive Summary,” Failure to Act: The Economic Impact of Current Investment Trends in Surface Transportation Infrastructure, Report Prepared for the American Society of Civil Engineers by the Economic Development Research Group, Inc., Available Online at http://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/Infrastructure/Report_Card/ASCE-FailureToActFinal.pdf, Accessed 08-31-2012, p. 3-6)
The nation’s surface transportation infrastructure includes the critical highways, bridges, railroads, and transit systems that enable people and goods to access the markets, services, and inputs of production essential to America’s economic vitality…These exports are lost due to lost productivity and the higher costs of American goods and services, relative to competing product prices from around the globe.

The White House released the following statement regarding its new recovery plan: “The President today laid out a bold vision for renewing and expanding our transportation infrastructure – in a plan that combines a long-term vision for the future with new investments. A significant portion of the new investments would be front-loaded in the first year.”…Besides current infrastructures, we need to start to use our underused resources (especially labor) to address the future needs of our aging population and our environmental problems: education, infrastructure, social networks, technology, energy, food production, and many others sectors need help.

**Independently, the plan would guarantee a job to everyone who wants one.**

So, the importance of continuing to counter austerian propaganda coming out of the Peterson Foundation and the organizations it allies with, and funds, remains…I think that my debate question is clearly prior to the austerians’ because it doesn’t assume what it should prove, namely that there is a problem and that focusing on it isn’t a distraction.

If this is true—and I, for one, believe it has been shown to be irrefutable by a growing list of economists—what becomes of the conservative’s bedrock premise, and the conclusions and narrative that so logically follow it?...Why not summon a trumpeting fanfare: Common Sense has a NEW sense, and it tells us we actually do have the dollars necessary to make the world we live in a whole lot better for everyone.

Schools should be viewed as crucial to any viable notion of democracy, while the pedagogical practices they employ should be consistent with the ideal of the good society…Schooling is an eminently political and moral practice, because it is both directive and actively legitimates what counts as knowledge, sanctions particular values and constructs particular forms of agency.

Plan: <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">The United States federal government should substantially increase its surface transportation infrastructure investment in the United States.</span>

===Steady State Scenario=== 

**Independently, embracing Modern Money Theory is key to facilitating the transition to a steady state economy**
**Farley et. al 12**—Joshua Farley is an ecological economist and Associate Professor in Community Development & Applied Economics and Public Administration at the University of Vermont. Matt Burke is a Master of Public Administration Student at the University of Vermont. Gary Flomenhoft is a Research Associate Professor at the The Gund Institute for Ecological Economics at the University of Vermont. D. Forrest Murray, Steve Posner, Matthew Putnam, Adam Scanlan and Aaron Witham are all students at UVT. (“Monetary and Fiscal Policies for a Finite Planet,” Published in May 2012 for the Degrowth in the Americas Conference, Available Online at [[http://montreal.degrowth.org/downloads/papers/R108_Farley_et_al.pdf]])
Modern monetary theorists (e.g. Warren Mosler, Bill Mitchell, James Galbraith, L. Randall Wray, Rodger Mitchell), who publish much of their work on the topic in onEline blogs, make a convincing case that in fiat monetary systems, there are two main sources of money. AND Concern for future generations and nonhuman life and inequities in current wealth distribution provide the moral hammer” (Daly and Townsend 1993, pp. 22E23).

**Solves the environment—we can have qualitative development without quantitative growth.**
**Daly 8** (“Towards A Steady-State Economy,” Published on May 5, 2008 by The Oil Drum, Adapted from a report written in April 2008 by Herman Daly for the Sustainable Development Commission, a body set up to advise the UK Government on sustainable development, Accessed on 2013-02-12, Available Online at http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3941)
A failed growth economy and a steady-state economy are not the same thing; they are the very different alternatives we face. AND If economists really believe that the consumer is sovereign then she should be obeyed rather than manipulated, cajoled, badgered, and lied to.

**Continued growth is unsustainable and will collapse the biosphere**
**Daly 8** [Herman Daly is one of the founders of the field of ecological economics, which argues that the scale of the economy must be kept within sustainable limits. He was senior economist in the World Bank's environment department from 1988 to 1994, and is now professor of ecological economics at the University of Maryland. “The world bank's blind spot,” October 18, 2008, New Scientist, pg. 46-7, Lexis]
That was when I realised that economists have not grasped a simple fact that to scientists is obvious: the size of the Earth as a whole is fixed. AND As the oceans are emptied of fish, forests shrink from logging and levels of pollutants and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere rise, the environmental and social costs of further growth are likely to intensify until we reach a point at which the price we pay for each unit of extra growth becomes greater than the benefits we gain.

**This means we control terminal impact uniqueness—environmental collapse makes extinction inevitable—try or die aff**
**Taylor 8** [Graeme Taylor is a social activist committed to constructive global transformation and the coordinator of BEST Futures, a project supporting sustainable solutions through researching how societies change and evolve, Evolution's Edge: The Coming Collapse and Transformation of Our World, Pomegranate Press, 2008, ISBN: 9781550923810, EBrary, pg. 117-8]
The real bottom line is not financial profits but survival, and our survival is utterly dependent on our environments. AND When they can’t meet their essential needs, they weaken and become increasingly dysfunctional and incapable of managing stress.

**EDR Group 11** — Economic Development Research Group, Inc.—a consulting firm focusing specifically on applying state-of-the-art tools and techniques for evaluating economic development performance, impacts, and opportunities, comprised of economists and planners who are specialists in evaluating the impacts of transportation infrastructure, services, and technology on economic development opportunities, 2011 (“Executive Summary,” Failure to Act: The Economic Impact of Current Investment Trends in Surface Transportation Infrastructure, Report Prepared for the American Society of Civil Engineers by the Economic Development Research Group, Inc., Available Online at http://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/Infrastructure/Report_Card/ASCE-FailureToActFinal.pdf, Accessed 08-31-2012, p. 3-6)
The nation’s surface transportation infrastructure includes the critical highways, bridges, railroads, and transit systems that enable people and goods to access the markets, services, and inputs of production essential to America’s economic vitality…These exports are lost due to lost productivity and the higher costs of American goods and services, relative to competing product prices from around the globe.

**This is totally unnecessary—the federal government can immediately spend trillions to remedy these shortcomings.**

The White House released the following statement regarding its new recovery plan: “The President today laid out a bold vision for renewing and expanding our transportation infrastructure – in a plan that combines a long-term vision for the future with new investments. A significant portion of the new investments would be front-loaded in the first year.”…Besides current infrastructures, we need to start to use our underused resources (especially labor) to address the future needs of our aging population and our environmental problems: education, infrastructure, social networks, technology, energy, food production, and many others sectors need help.

**Independently, the plan would guarantee a job to everyone who wants one.**

The other approach, and the only one that is feasible, is a jobs guarantee program…And it can to this efficiently (though efficiency in the cost-minimizing or revenue-enhancing sense should not be the objective).

**Unemployment causes widespread suffering and death—the plan resolves this systemic impact.**
**Baker and Hassett 12** — Dean Baker, Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, and Kevin Hassett, Senior Fellow and Director of Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, former served as a senior economist at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and an associate professor of economics and finance at the Graduate School of Business of Columbia University, holds a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania, 2012 (“The Human Disaster of Unemployment,” New York Times, May 12th, Available Online at http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-&-columns/op-eds-&-columns/the-human-disaster-of-unemployment, Accessed 06-12-2012)
Long-term unemployment is experienced disproportionately by the young, the old, the less educated, and African-American and Latino workers…Few events rival the emotional strain of job loss.

Romney’s “morality” argument about deficits is doubly wrong…Austerity is vicious to the poor and it is wasteful, which makes it doubly immoral.

The criminal class in Washington is bipartisan. Together they planned force-fed pain. They met secretly…. Do it because austerity is poison. Do it because no one will do it for you.

===Framework=== 

**Vote affirmative to challenge austerity propaganda. Whether the debt “problem” is real is a prior question—our approach injects democratic accountability into the debate.**
**Firestone 10/30** — Joseph M. Firestone, Managing Director and CEO of the Knowledge Management Consortium International, Senior Fellow at Correntewire.com, holds an M.A. <span class="GRcorrect">and</span> Ph.D. in Comparative Politics and International Relations from Michigan State University, 2012 (“A Counter Narrative to Peterson’s,” New Economic Perspectives, October 30th, Available Online at http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/10/a-counter-narrative-to-petersons.html, Accessed 11-12-2012)
So, the importance of continuing to counter austerian propaganda coming out of the Peterson Foundation and the organizations it allies with, and funds, remains…I think that my debate question is clearly prior to the austerians’ because it doesn’t assume what it should prove, namely that there is a problem and that focusing on it isn’t a distraction.

**Economic methodology is a framing issue—before choosing what policies to enact, we must first choose which way to do economics.**
**Dow 9/13** — Sheila Dow, Emeritus Professor of Economics at the University of Stirling (Scotland), Convener of the Scottish Centre for Economic Methodology, interviewed by Philip Pilkington, 2012 (“On Economic Methodology: An Interview with Sheila Dow,” Naked Capitalism, September 13th, Available Online at <span style="color: windowtext;">[[http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/09/on-economic-methodology-an-interview-with-sheila-dow.html]]</span>, Accessed 09-13-2012)
Philip Pilkington: Your book is all about the importance of methodology in economics…The first step for many economists therefore is to accept that there is more than one way of doing economics; this itself requires some methodological awareness.

**Specifically, re-framing the debate to acknowledge the reality of the modern monetary system is a prerequisite to effective policy.**
**Alt 9/7** — J.D. Alt, Architect and Urban Planner who writes about Modern Monetary Theory, 2012 (“New Sense—Common Sense,” New Economic Perspectives, September 7th, Available Online at http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/09/new-sense-common-sense.html, Accessed 10-20-2012)
If this is true—and I, for one, believe it has been shown to be irrefutable by a growing list of economists—what becomes of the conservative’s bedrock premise, and the conclusions and narrative that so logically follow it?...Why not summon a trumpeting fanfare: Common Sense has a NEW sense, and it tells us we actually do have the dollars necessary to make the world we live in a whole lot better for everyone.

**This re-framing connects debate pedagogy to political struggles against economic orthodoxy—the ballot serves to legitimize certain knowledge, sanction certain values, and construct particular forms of agency.**
**Giroux 10/16** — Henry A. Giroux, Global TV Network Chair Professorship in the Department of English and Cultural Studies at McMaster University, 2012 (“Can Democratic Education Survive in a Neoliberal Society?,” truthout, October 16th, Available Online at <span style="color: windowtext;">[[http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/12126-can-democratic-education-survive-in-a-neoliberal-society]]</span>, Accessed 11-13-2012)
Schools should be viewed as crucial to any viable notion of democracy, while the pedagogical practices they employ should be consistent with the ideal of the good society…Schooling is an eminently political and moral practice, because it is both directive and actively legitimates what counts as knowledge, sanctions particular values and constructs particular forms of agency.

**Debate should facilitate Political Education, not Politicizing Education—the role of student-debaters is to move beyond the constraints of the political world we have inherited. Vote aff to challenge politics-as-usual.**
**Giroux 10/16** — Henry A. Giroux, Global TV Network Chair Professorship in the Department of English and Cultural Studies at McMaster University, 2012 (“Can Democratic Education Survive in a Neoliberal Society?,” truthout, October 16th, Available Online at <span style="color: windowtext;">[[http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/12126-can-democratic-education-survive-in-a-neoliberal-society]]</span>, Accessed 11-13-2012)
One useful approach to embracing the classroom as a political site, but at the same time eschewing any form of indoctrination… Politicizing education is more religious than secular and more about training than educating; it harbors a great dislike for complicating issues, promoting critical dialogue and generating a culture of questioning.

==Case== 
===2AC—Credit Downgrade Turn=== 

**No impact—ratings don’t affect interest rates—fiat money means the government will never default**
**Firestone 9/14** — Joseph M. Firestone, Managing Director and CEO of the Knowledge Management Consortium International, Senior Fellow at Correntewire.com, holds an M.A. <span class="GRcorrect">and</span> Ph.D. in Comparative Politics and International Relations from Michigan State University, 2012 (“Alan Grayson’s Right; But He Misses the Larger Point,” New Economic Perspectives, September 14th, Available Online at [[http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/09/alan-graysons-right-but-he-misses-the-larger-point.html]], Accessed 09-20-2012)
Grayson was right to call attention to this seeming contradiction and the possibility that Moody’s is just pressuring Congress to do more for rich people; AND Whatever additional risk exists from a failure to avoid the fiscal cliff, or a negotiated deal that provides for deficit reduction, or doesn’t provide for it, is purely political.

===2AC—Cost Overrun Turn=== 

**No impact to cost overruns—stimulates the economy even more.**
**Black 9/25** — Duncan Black, holds a Ph.D. in Economics, Fellow at Media Matters for America, writes the blog Eschaton, 2012 (“Cost Overruns: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Hate Bent Flyvbjerg,” USA Today, September 25th, Available Online at http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2012/09/25/bernanke-inflation-money-quantitative-easing/1592297/, Accessed 10-19-2012)
The Federal Reserve should give people free money. AND Remarkably, there's a simple way to help people and improve the economy. Even more remarkably, we aren't doing it.

===2AC—Crowd Out Turn=== 

**No link & turn—the plan is funded through fiat money—that increases private sector capital**
**Alt 12** — J.D. Alt, Architect and Urban Planner who writes about Modern Monetary Theory, 2012 (“New Sense—Common Sense,” New Economic Perspectives, September 7th, Available Online at http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/09/new-sense-common-sense.html, Accessed 10-20-2012)
To see this, let’s return to the Common Sense logic we began with: People earn money. AND Taxes and bonds are tools for managing the monetary system; they have nothing to do with “financing” federal spending.

**“Crowd out” doesn’t apply to infrastructure investment—assumes full productive capacity**
**Han 12** — Xue Han, Luxembourg Garden Visiting Scholar at Global Infrastructure Asset Management, LLC, holds a B.A. in Mathematics and Economics from Beloit College, 2012 (“Why Invest In Infrastructure? Necessities and Benefits of Infrastructure Investments,” Report for Global Infrastructure Asset Management, LLC, February, Available Online at http://www.globalinfrastructurellc.com/pdfs/Why_Invest_in_Infrastructure-Necessities_and_Benefits_of_Infrastructure_Investments.pdf, Accessed 06-09-2012, p. 15-16)
The one most important reason for the tremendous benefits that infrastructure investment would bring along is its effects on expanding the economy‘s long-term productive capacity. AND This reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and thus the environmental barriers to economic growth.

===2AC—Inflation Turn=== 

**The Fed will intervene to prevent hyperinflation—no risk.**
**Baker 10** — Dean Baker, Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, 2010 (“Why printing money makes sense,” Guardian, October 12th, Available Online at http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/11/useconomy-usemployment, Accessed 09-08-2011)
As is the case with the counterfeiter's illicit stash, the stimulus spending need not even create any long-term debt burden. AND When the economy returns to more normal levels of employment, the Fed would raise interest rates, as it always does, to prevent inflation from posing a serious risk.

**Conditions are different than they were in the 1970s.**
**Bartlett 12** — Bruce Bartlett, held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul, holds an M.A. in History from Georgetown University, 2012 (“The Fed’s Dilemma: Low Inflation Means Low Growth,” The Fiscal Times, August 3rd, Available Online at http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2012/08/03/The-Feds-Dilemma-Low-Inflation-Means-Low-Growth.aspx?p=1, Accessed 08-08-2012)
It is also worth remembering that many of the conditions that made inflation such a problem in the 1970s no longer exist. AND The capital gains rate is only 15 percent and labor unions no longer have the power to extract wage gains in excess of productivity growth.

**Inflation spurs growth—solves risk aversion and stimulates the economy.**
**Mirhaydari 10** — Anthony Mirhaydari, investment columnist at MSN Money, former senior research analyst at Markman Capital Insight—an investment advisory and money management firm, 2010 (“No Inflation Means No Recovery,” MSN Money, September 8th, Available Online at http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/Extra/mirhaydari-no-inflation-means-no-recovery.aspx?page=all, Accessed 09-08-2011)
The problem is extreme risk aversion. And it's being enabled by low inflation.AND Moreover, inflation is the lesser evil at this point, with moderate inflation being less painful than a Japanese-style deflationary spiral.

===AT: Keynesianism Bad=== 

**There is no link to their “Keynesianism Bad” arguments—MMT is a critique of Keynesianism, too!**
**Mitchell 11** — Bill Mitchell, Research Professor in Economics and Director of the Centre of Full Employment and Equity at the University of Newcastle (Australia), holds a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Newcastle, 2011 (“Debt, Deficits, and Modern Monetary Theory,” Harvard International Review, October 16th, Available Online at http://hir.harvard.edu/debt-deficits-and-modern-monetary-theory, Accessed 11-16-2012)
How does this differ from the dominant New Keynesian paradigm? AND This is the complete opposite of what orthodox economists claim is the case, and it’s confirmed by the present combination of record low interest rates and very large budget defecits.

==Topicality== 
===2AC—Framework=== 

**We meet—we defend the resolution—the USFG should increase transportation infrastructure investment. Our aff is the strongest possible affirmation of the topic—it challenges the underlying narrative that impedes federal investment. This is most predictable—it’s what was voted on to select the topic—no limits explosion and doesn’t set a bad precedent.**
**NFHS 11** — National Federation of High Schools, 2011 (“Civil Rights, Infrastructure, Immigration, Entitlement Reform and Higher Education are five suggested debate topics for 2012-2013,” Ballot for Debate Topic Voting, Available Online at [[http://www.nfhs.org/print.aspx?id=6520]], Accessed 11-15-2012)
PROBLEM AREA II: INFRASTRUCTURE
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States. AND Negative positions could focus on the economic consequences of additional spending, the effectiveness of various transportation solutions, the political implications of infrastructure investment and critiques of economic development.

**Turn: Agenda Setting—Their framework relies on a restricted notion of politics that takes dominant assumptions for granted—interrogating how and why issues like the debt have been made intelligible as political problems is vital to meaningful engagement with public policy.**
**Smith 97** — Steve Smith, Professor of International Relations at the University of East Anglia, 1997 (“Power and truth; a reply to William Wallace,” Review of International Studies, Volume 23, Issue 04, October, p. 508-509)
My central claim is that Wallace has a very restricted notion of politics, such that it seems obvious to him just who are those who ‘have to struggle with the dilemmas of power’. AND In essence, how we know things determines what we see, and the public realm of politics is itself the result of a prior series of (political) epistemological moves which result in the political being seen as either natural or a matter of common sense.

===2AC—Investment [Generic]=== 

**Counter-interpretation—“Infrastructure investment” requires spending**
**CBO 8** (Congressional Budget Office, “Issues and Options in Infrastructure Investment”, http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/91xx/doc9135/05-16-infrastructure.pdf)
Current Spending on Infrastructure
Under any definition, “infrastructure investment” encompasses spending on a variety of projects. AND Those categories form the basis for supporting intellectual and human capital, respectively, and can provide benefits that are similar to those generated by infrastructure spending.)

**Contextual evidence disproves their argument—the plan is investment**
**Treasury 10** — United States Department of the Treasury and Council of Economic Advisers, 2010 (“An Economic Analysis of Infrastructure Investment,” Report Prepared by the Department of the Treasury with the Council of Economic Advisers, October 11th, Available Online at http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/economic-policy/Documents/infrastructure_investment_report.pdf, Accessed 08-31-2012, p. 12)
The business and labor communities have also expressed a desire for more transportation infrastructure investment. AND There can be no more business as usual.”35

===2AC—Substantial [% Increase]=== 

**We meet—Plan costs 2-3 trillion—status quo spending is 124 billion—that’s a 24-thousand percent increase**
**OMB 2011** (“Department of Transportation: Budget for the Fiscal Year of 2013,” Office of Management and Budget, Accessed online at [[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/transportation.pdf]], Accessed on 10/4/12)
A well-functioning transportation system is critical to America’s economic future. AND Recognizing the fiscal realities, the Budget again proposes significant reforms to surface transportation programs, including a consolidation of over 55 duplicative, often earmarked highway programs into five streamlined ones.

**Counter-interpretation—A “substantial investment” is over 20%**
**Traficant et. al 89** – former member of US House of Representatives(James, written with other Congressmembers, Bill Summary & Status 101st Congress (1989 - 1990) H.R.2489, 5/24/89, http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d101:h.r.02489:)//EM
(C) SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT DEFINED- The term `substantial investment' means any amount which—AND `(ii) caused the sum of all amounts added to such account during such period to exceed 20 percent of the total value of such facility (determined in the manner provided in subparagraph (B)(ii)) on the first day of such period.

The dramatic fall of the price of steel in the third quarter this year has raised concerns about the Chinese steel industry and the economic health of the nation. AND Wu Xichun, with the China Iron and Steel Association, said the steel industry is in a quagmire because of the four trillion yuan investment plan launched by the government in 2008, in an attempt to stave off the global financial crisis. That flood of money resulted in overproduction of steel, leading to a glut.

**And, a strong steel industry is the lynchpin of U.S. global leadership.**

Throughout history, relations between dominant and rising states have been uneasy—and often violent. AND This is why periods of transition, when a new, ascending power begins to overtake the previously dominant state, have so often been marked by war.

**Stability during Egypt uprising proves resiliancy**
Frank **Ching**, Journalist and analyst of Chinese affairs based in Hong Kong for the Japan Times, 2/16/**11** (“China to keep iron grip after Egypt,” available online at http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/frank-ching/2011/02/16/291295/p1/China-to.htm, accessed 2/16/11)
China, which has been obsessed with political stability ever since it called out its army to crush a massive albeit peaceful protest in Beijing 22 years ago, is likely to step up repressive tactics against its population in the wake of the toppling of Egypt's president Hosni Mubarak after 18 days of demonstrations. AND And Xinhua, in its dispatches, emphasized not the democratic aspirations of the protesters but rather warned against the country falling into chaos.

===2AC—Politics=== 

**Critical pedagogy internal-link turns their “politics good” offence**
**Gorham 3** – Professor of Political Science, Loyola University (Eric, “A Political Argument for Service-Learning in Higher Education,” November 2003) KS
We need to accommodate these aspects of political thinking if service-learning is to play an effective part in training the new citizen. AND Service-learning as educational method or pedagogical adjunct to the teaching of political science, then, actually frustrates learning politics.

**Budget battles thump the DA—no Obama PC**
**Reuters 1/6**—John Whitesides is a staff writer for Reuters (“Budget battles threaten to limit Obama’s second-term agenda,” Published by Reuters on January 6, 2013, Available Online at http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/04/usa-obama-agenda-idUSL1E9C3EF320130104?feedType=RSS&feedName=everything&virtualBrandChannel=11563)
WASHINGTON: After a brutal “fiscal cliff” battle, President Barack Obama’s looming budget confrontation with Congress threatens to sharply curtail his second-term agenda and limit his ambitions on priorities such as immigration reform and gun control.AND “The question now is, do they even know how to make deals with each other?” he said.

===2AC—Warming=== 

**Growth creates new technologies that solve energy use**
**Ben-Ami 11** — Daniel Ben-Ami, journalist and author, regular contributor to spiked, has been published in the American, the Australian, Economist.com, Financial Times, the Guardian, the Independent, Novo (Germany), Ode (American and Dutch editions), Prospect, Shanghai Daily, the Sunday Telegraph, the Sunday Times, and Voltaire (Sweden), 2011 (“Growth is good,” Ode, June, Available Online at http://www.odemagazine.com/doc/print/75/growth-is-good, Accessed 08-16-2011)
There are many reasons why the notion of scarce resources is mistaken. AND It is not a question of needing, say, three planets to sustain humanity, but of making this planet more productive.

**Not existential—warming is net good for the environment**
**Lomborg 8**—Director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center and adjunct professor at the Copenhagen Business School [Bjorn, “Warming warnings get overheated”, The Guardian, August 15, 2008, http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/15/carbonemissions.climatechange]
These alarmist predictions are becoming quite bizarre, and could be dismissed as sociological oddities, if it weren't for the fact that they get such big play in the media. AND Further, the IPCC expects the average person on earth to be 1,700% richer by the end of this century.

==Counterplans== 
===2AC—Agent=== 

**Action by one branch of the USFG is action by the USFG.**
**Words & Phrases 4** — Words and Phrases, 2004 (Cumulative Supplementary Pamphlet, v. 16A, p. 42)
N.D.Ga. 1986. Action against the Postal Service, although an independent establishment of the executive branch of the federal government, is an action against the "Federal Government" for purposes of rule that plaintiff in action against government has right to jury trial only where right is one of terms of government's consent to be sued; declining to follow Algernon Blair Industrial Contractors, Inc. v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 552 F.Supp. 872 (M.D.Ala.). 39 U.S.C.A. 201; U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 7.--Griffin v. U.S. Postal Service, 635 F.Supp. 190.--Jury 12(1.2).

**Turn: Disposability—the introduction of a counterplan embraces the false ideology of policy competition—this logic mirrors economic Darwinism—results in the disposal of entire populations**
**Giroux 10/2** — Henry A. Giroux, Global TV Network Chair Professorship in the Department of English and Cultural Studies at McMaster University, 2012 (“Why Don't Americans Care About Democracy at Home?,” truthout, October 2nd, Available Online at http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/11872-henry-a-giroux-why-dont-americans-care-about-democracy-at-home, Accessed 11-16-2012)
The not-so-hidden order of politics underlying the second Gilded Age and its heartless version of economic Darwinism is that some populations, primarily the elderly, young people, the unemployed, immigrants and poor whites and minorities of color, now constitute a form of human waste or excess. AND All evidence suggests a new reality is unfolding, one that is characterized by a deeply rooted crisis of education, agency and social responsibility.

**Turn: Interpassivity—**
**Focusing on the process of policy formulation breeds interpassivity—this trades off with the aims and goals of politics and causes alienation.**
Gijs **Van Oenen**, Professor of Philosophy at the Erasmus University Rotterdam (Netherlands), **2006** (“A Machine That Would Go of Itself: Interpassivity and Its Impact on Political Life,” Theory & Event, Volume 9, Issue 2, June, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Project MUSE)
Although interpassivity was first situated in the domain of the arts, the concept also seems well suited to describe and evaluate phenomena and developments outside the domain of aesthetics. AND The VCR, as it were, watches TV on our behalf.

**This process-oriented strategy undermines the product of policy formulation—individuals become vested in the means of policymaking at the expense of the ends.**
Gijs **Van Oenen**, Professor of Philosophy at the Erasmus University Rotterdam (Netherlands), **2006** (“A Machine That Would Go of Itself: Interpassivity and Its Impact on Political Life,” Theory & Event, Volume 9, Issue 2, June, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Project MUSE)
But more importantly, the official view or 'ideology' underwriting interactivity denies that a shift in political interest is taking place. AND In other words, what the process now mainly realizes, its main 'product', is involvement with itself.

===2AC—China Fund the Plan=== 

**Their net-benefit is a link to our critique of orthodox economics—MMT disproves their “China debt” arguments.**
**Mosler 11** — Warren Mosler, Co-founder of the Center for Full Employment and Price Stability at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, 2011 (“Modern Monetary Theory: The Last Progressive Left Standing,” Huffington Post, June 13th, Available Online at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/warren-mosler/modern-monetary-theory-th_b_872449.html, Accessed 11-18-2012)
And as for the U.S. national debt and all the talk about borrowing from China, MMT recognizes that U.S. Treasury securities are, functionally, nothing more than savings accounts at the Fed, which the Fed in fact happens to call securities accounts.

The not-so-hidden order of politics underlying the second Gilded Age and its heartless version of economic Darwinism is that some populations, primarily the elderly, young people, the unemployed, immigrants and poor whites and minorities of color, now constitute a form of human waste or excess. AND All evidence suggests a new reality is unfolding, one that is characterized by a deeply rooted crisis of education, agency and social responsibility.

**Turn: Interpassivity—**
**Focusing on the process of policy formulation breeds interpassivity—this trades off with the aims and goals of politics and causes alienation.**
Gijs **Van Oenen**, Professor of Philosophy at the Erasmus University Rotterdam (Netherlands), **2006** (“A Machine That Would Go of Itself: Interpassivity and Its Impact on Political Life,” Theory & Event, Volume 9, Issue 2, June, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Project MUSE)
Although interpassivity was first situated in the domain of the arts, the concept also seems well suited to describe and evaluate phenomena and developments outside the domain of aesthetics. AND The VCR, as it were, watches TV on our behalf.

**This process-oriented strategy undermines the product of policy formulation—individuals become vested in the means of policymaking at the expense of the ends.**

But more importantly, the official view or 'ideology' underwriting interactivity denies that a shift in political interest is taking place. AND In other words, what the process now mainly realizes, its main 'product', is involvement with itself.

**Doesn’t solve ANY of the case—the states are not sovereign currency holders and can’t act to remedy capital shortages by creating new dollars. Centering our political vision on federal action is vital to challenge the foundation of austerity. The whole case is a DA to the counterplan.**

The United States is in danger of becoming the next Greece or Ireland AND That is, we’re making ourselves a stagnant economy by imposing fiscal austerity, rather than creating/spending the money we need to solve our increasingly serious national problems.

Rather than invest in electoral politics, it would be more worthwhile for progressives to develop formative conditions that make a real democracy possibleAND Developing a broad-based social movement means finding a common ground upon which challenging diverse forms of oppression, exploitation, and exclusion can become part of a wider effort to create a radical democracy.

The attempt to provide a genuinely non-anthropocentric set of values, or preferences seems to be a hopeless quest. AND Our sort of world, with our sort of fellow occupants is an interesting and engaging place.

Currently, on the world political stage, there is little discussion of an alternative progressive framework for economics that would significantly counteract the push towards fiscal austerity. AND A reversal and re-ordering of policy prescriptions would be in order if progressive activists and pundits adopt some or all of what MMT has to offer.

**Turn: Reductionism—the case solves the impact by exploding dominant assumptions about capital scarcity and fostering altruistic politics. This is a unique DA to the alt—totalizing rejection of capitalism prevents this transformational change.**

Actually existing capitalism can be cruel, ruthless, and destructive, deriving in part from negative emotions such as envy, hate, and indifference to others; but it also can be benevolent, deriving in part from positive emotions such as compassion, empathy, and love. AND The view here denies neither the destructive elements of capitalist life nor the problems of power held by a few over the majority (Foucault, 1980c); rather, it highlights the problematizing potential of practices that diverge from societal discourse towards possibilities for transformational change (Foucault, 2007).

Returning to the premise that the social, economic, cultural, and political are mutually embedded, ‘the economy’ is therefore sensible as a part of life that is connected inextricably with thoughts and feelings, power relations, and histories of experience. AND How, then, has a mode of accounting for behavior based on the logic of a singular discourse developed?

**Totalizing rejection is the worst option — aff or perm best.**

What requires problematization in accounts of behavior that focus on generalities is the notion of ‘dominance,’ which refers not to ‘majority’ in the numerical sense, but rather to those who hold power over others. AND Alternatively, and as argued, we might recognize “the diversity of actually existing markets”, and crucially, their significance as a political resource (Smith, 2005).

A friend--may he forgive me for quoting him--thinks my dismissal of my previous rationalizations as elaborate nonsense seems too pat.

In _Speed and Politics_ (1986 [1977]), Virilio undertakes his first sustained attempt to delineate the importance of accelerated speed, of the impact of technologies of motion, of types of mobility and their effects in the contemporary era. AND In a sense, this is true and justifies Virilio's predominantly technophobic discourse, but raises questions concerning the adequacy of Virilio's perspectives on technology as a whole and the extent to which his work is of use in theorizing the new technologies with their momentous and dramatic transformation of every aspect of our social and everyday life.

===**Plan**=== 

The United States federal government should increase its surface transportation infrastructure investment sufficient to achieve “minimum tolerable conditions” for roads and bridges and “state of good repair” for transit.

//Last week's disappointing jobs report for June showed that a strong labor market recovery remains elusive…Policymakers can eliminate the future costs if they pair short-term stimulus with policies that reduce the deficit in the future when the economy is stronger.//

==1AC—Greenhill== 
===**Summary of Changes**=== 

**New Plan Text (added the words “in the United States”)**
The United States federal government should increase its surface transportation infrastructure investment **in the United States** sufficient to achieve “minimum tolerable conditions” for roads and bridges and “state of good repair” for transit.

**We took out the //Klein// card and the //Quinnel// card from the old 1AC and we added the first two cards on the stimulus advantage.**

===**Advantage One—Economic Stimulus**=== 

**First, the Fed just implemented a new round of Quantitative Easing—this non-uniques their “stimulus bad,” “inflation,” and “downgrade” arguments.**
**__Demint 9/20__** — Jim Demint, United States Senator (R-SC), 2012 (“Fed Stimulus Goes From 'Shot In The Arm' To 'QE4-Ever',” Investor’s Business Daily, September 20th, Available Online at http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-viewpoint/092012-626455-fed-stimulus-program-shows-no-end.htm, Accessed 09-21-2012)
//We really ought to quit calling the Federal Reserve's latest round of quantitative easing "QE3."…Remember, America's credit rating was downgraded for the first time in 2011 and the Egan-Jones Ratings Co. downgraded the U.S.' credit again last week over concerns that QE3 does little to raise GDP, further reduces the value of the dollar and raises the price of commodities.//

**Unfortunately, monetary policy alone is insufficient—a substantial increase in transportation infrastructure investment is crucial to reduce unemployment and stimulate demand—now is the key time.**
**__Reich 9/17__** — Robert Reich, Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California-Berkeley, former Professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, former Professor of Social and Economic Policy at Brandeis University, served as Secretary of Labor in the Clinton Administration, 2012 (“The Fed can't create jobs all by itself,” Christian Science Monitor, September 17th, Available Online at http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Robert-Reich/2012/0917/The-Fed-can-t-create-jobs-all-by-itself, Accessed 09-20-2012)
//With deficit hawks circling overhead, the responsibility for creating jobs has fallen by default to Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve…But it can’t succeed on its own. Global lenders are giving us a way out. Let’s take advantage of the opportunity.//

**Third, stimulus is key to growth in the short-term—no recovery without more government spending.**
**__Stone 12__** — Chad Stone, Chief Economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, holds a Ph.D. in Economics from Yale University, 2012 (“Misguided Deficit and Inflation Fears Impede Economic Recovery,” Economic Intelligence—a U.S. News & World Report blog, July 12th, Available Online at http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2012/07/12/misguided-deficit-and-inflation-fears-impede-economic-recovery, Accessed 07-20-2012)
//Last week's disappointing jobs report for June showed that a strong labor market recovery remains elusive…Policymakers can eliminate the future costs if they pair short-term stimulus with policies that reduce the deficit in the future when the economy is stronger.//

**Fourth, the plan solves—a substantial investment in infrastructure stimulus would create jobs and boost aggregate demand.**
__**Blodget 12**__ — Henry Blodget, co-founder, CEO, and Editor-In Chief of Business Insider, former top-ranked Wall Street analyst, frequent contributor to the magazines Slate, Newsweek, and New York, 2012 (“Yes, It's Time For A Massive Infrastructure Spending Program,” Business Insider, June 19th, Available Online at http://www.businessinsider.com/infrastructure-spending-program-2012-6?op=1, Accessed 09-03-2012)
//I recently laid out the fundamental problem with the US economy…And this, in turn, suggests that ruling out future stimulus in the form of infrastructure investment as a way to help the economy is a major mistake, especially with US infrastructure in such lousy shape and so many US workers idled by the construction industry slowdown.//

**Fifth, infrastructure investment is uniquely effective at stimulating the economy—studies prove.**
__**Boushey 11**__ — Heather Boushey, Senior Economist at the Center for American Progress, previously held economist positions with the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress, the Center for Economic and Policy Research, and the Economic Policy Institute, holds a Ph.D. in economics from the New School for Social Research, 2011 (“Now Is the Time to Fix Our Broken Infrastructure,” Center for American Progress, September 22nd, Available Online at http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/09/aja_infrastructure.html, Accessed 06-09-2012)
//The value of infrastructure spending…This number include jobs directly created by hiring for the specific project, jobs indirectly created by supplier firms, and jobs induced when workers go out and spend their paychecks and boost their local economy.[8]//

**Sixth, government stimulus is empirically effective—history is on our side.**
__**Boushey and Ettlinger 11**__ — Heather Boushey, Senior Economist at the Center for American Progress, previously held economist positions with the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress, the Center for Economic and Policy Research, and the Economic Policy Institute, holds a Ph.D. in economics from the New School for Social Research, and Michael Ettlinger, Vice President for Economic Policy at the Center for American Progress, previously served as Director of Economic Analysis and Research at the Economic Policy Institute, holds a J.D. from American University, 2011 (“Government Spending Can Create Jobs—and It Has,” Center for American Progress, September, Available Online at http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/09/pdf/yes_we_can.pdf, Accessed 08-06-2012, p. 1)
//President Barack Obama swept into office on a mantra of “Yes, we can.”…Economies around the world reflecting a wide range of economic ideologies understand the importance of government action in the face of economic crises.//

**Seventh, states can’t stimulate the economy—federal action is key.**

//Q: What with the much benighted Washington debate, what can the states do to improve the economy – or more specifically, fight unemployment?...As the stimulus has faded, layoffs have accelerated.//

**And, growth is the controlling impact—more important than deficits and taxes.**

//The central factor in America’s fiscal future is hardly being discussed…Economic growth helps federal, state, and local budgets, sure, but more importantly creates opportunity for generations of Americans, particularly those whose outlook today seems bleakest.//

**And, this accesses every major impact—economic growth is vital to generate the resources needed to meet emerging challenges.**
__**Silk 93**__ — Leonard Silk, Distinguished Professor of Economics at Pace University, Senior Research Fellow at the Ralph Bunche Institute on the United Nations at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and former Economics Columnist with the New York Times, 1993 (“Dangers of Slow Growth,” Foreign Affairs, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
//Like the Great Depression, the current economic slump has fanned the firs of nationalist, ethnic and religious hatred around the world…But economic growth – and growth alone – creates the additional resources that make it possible to achieve such fundamental goals as higher living standards, national and collective security, a healthier environment, and more liberal and open economies and societies.//

**And, economic decline increases the risk of war—strong statistical support.**
__**Royal 10**__ — Jedidiah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, M.Phil. Candidate at the University of New South Wales, 2010 (“Economic Integration, Economic Signalling and the Problem of Economic Crises,” Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, Edited by Ben Goldsmith and Jurgen Brauer, Published by Emerald Group Publishing, ISBN 0857240048, p. 213-215)
//Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict…As such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.//

**Finally, alternatives to growth kill hundreds of millions and cause global conflict—we can’t “turn off” the economy.**
__**Barnhizer 6**__ — David R. Barnhizer, Emeritus Professor at Cleveland State University’s Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, 2006 (“Waking from Sustainability's "Impossible Dream": The Decisionmaking Realities of Business and Government,” Georgetown International Environmental Law Review (18 Geo. Int'l Envtl. L. Rev. 595), Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
The scale of social needs, including the need for expanded productive activity, has grown so large that it cannot be shut off at all, and certainly not abruptly…The question is not how to achieve a static state but how to achieve what is needed to advance social justice while avoiding and mitigating the most destructive consequences of our behavior.

===Advantage Two—U.S. Competitiveness=== 

**First, U.S. surface transportation infrastructure is crumbling—continued shortfalls will decimate the economy and American competitiveness.**
__**EDR Group 11**__ — Economic Development Research Group, Inc.—a consulting firm focusing specifically on applying state-of-the-art tools and techniques for evaluating economic development performance, impacts, and opportunities, comprised of economists and planners who are specialists in evaluating the impacts of transportation infrastructure, services, and technology on economic development opportunities, 2011 (“Executive Summary,” Failure to Act: The Economic Impact of Current Investment Trends in Surface Transportation Infrastructure, Report Prepared for the American Society of Civil Engineers by the Economic Development Research Group, Inc., Available Online at http://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/Infrastructure/Report_Card/ASCE-FailureToActFinal.pdf, Accessed 08-31-2012, p. 3-6)
//The nation’s surface transportation infrastructure includes the critical highways, bridges, railroads, and transit systems that enable people and goods to access the markets, services, and inputs of production essential to America’s economic vitality…These exports are lost due to lost productivity and the higher costs of American goods and services, relative to competing product prices from around the globe.//

**Fortunately, the plan solves—investments to achieve minimally tolerable conditions are needed.**
__**EDR Group 11**__ — Economic Development Research Group, Inc.—a consulting firm focusing specifically on applying state-of-the-art tools and techniques for evaluating economic development performance, impacts, and opportunities, comprised of economists and planners who are specialists in evaluating the impacts of transportation infrastructure, services, and technology on economic development opportunities, 2011 (“Wages, Value-Added, Industrial Output, and Jobs,” Failure to Act: The Economic Impact of Current Investment Trends in Surface Transportation Infrastructure, Report Prepared for the American Society of Civil Engineers by the Economic Development Research Group, Inc., Available Online at http://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/Infrastructure/Report_Card/ASCE-FailureToActFinal.pdf, Accessed 08-31-2012, p. 19-20)
//This report contrasts a transportation system funded at levels comparable to today’s levels with a fully funded system to assess the degree to which U.S. economic conditions are affected by current and projected infrastructure deficiencies…However, if transportation investment levels rise in areas that support building and maintaining minimum tolerable conditions across the system, national jobs, income, and GDP can rise to the levels we have found and quantified in this study.//

**And, this prevents global conflict—perception of U.S. economic weakness sparks war.**
__**Lieberthal and O’Hanlon 12**__ — Kenneth G. Lieberthal, Director of the John L.

===**Summary of Changes**=== 
**Added these cards—**

**And, We control uniqueness: a recession is already underway.**
**Time Business 10/1** — Time Business, 2012 (“Are We Already in A Recession?,” Byline Christopher Matthews, October 1st, Available Online at [[http://business.time.com/2012/10/01/are-we-already-in-a-recession/]], Accessed 10-18-2012)
What’s in a name? Would a recession by any other name be as painful? AND In other words, nine months ago we knew that, sitting here today, most people probably would not realize that we are in recession – and we do believe we are in recession.”


**There’s no impact even if it happens—other investors will fill-in.**
**__Baker 10__** — Dean Baker, Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, 2010 (“The Budget Deficit Scare Story and the Great Recession,” Center for Economic and Policy Research, February, Available Online at http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/deficit-2010-02.pdf, Accessed 04-26-2010, p. 12)
//Many of the papers that discuss the problem of the deficit and debt highlight the fact that a large and growing portion of the debt is held by foreigners, especially the government of China…In that case, interest rates would likely rise, regardless of who owned the debt.//

**Hegemony creates structural disincentives for war—theoretical and empirical evidence**
**Wohlforth 9** — William C. Wohlforth, Daniel Webster Professor of Government at Dartmouth College, holds an M.Phil. <span class="GRcorrect">and</span> Ph.D. in Political Science from Yale University, 2009 (“Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War,” World Politics, Volume 61, Number 1, January, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Project MUSE, p. 29-31)
The upshot is a near scholarly consensus that unpolarity’s consequences for great power conflict are indeterminate and that a power shift resulting in a return to bipolarity or multipolarity will not raise the specter of great power war. AND by showing that observable evidence concerning the major powers’ identity politics and grand strategies under unipolarity are consistent with the theory’s expectations.

**Hegemony is sustainable—declinists have empirically been wrong and all measures indicate America is still powerful.**
**Nye 12**—Joseph S. Nye is professor of public policy at Harvard University and author, most recently, of The Future of Power. (“Who Won the Recession? Declinist Pundits,” Published in Foreign Policy (November 2012), Accessed on October 8, 2012, Available Online at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/10/08/declinist_pundits?page=full)
There is a simple three-step secret to success in political punditry: Identify a trend that is already happening, predict it will continue, and then, as the trend progresses, proclaim success. AND despite the American mistakes that contributed to the Great Recession, I would certainly not use the cyclical events of the last decade to set the odds.

**Even if hegemony is ineffective, it upholds an international order that prevents conflict**
**Kagan 12** — Robert W. Kagan, Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, Adjunct Professor of History at Georgetown University, former senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, contributing editor to The Weekly Standard, holds a Master of Public Policy degree from the John F.

But international order is not an evolution; it is an imposition. AND which is what the world looked like right before the American order came into being.

==<span style="font-family: sans-serif; text-align: start;">Case</span>== 
===2AC—Inflation Turn=== 

**Inflation would quickly reduce unemployment—key to spur growth.**

//A team of economists at Barclays Capital led by Christian Broda recently explored this subject in a research note to clients…Still, eventually workers would rebel and demand concessions. That's why this would be only a short-term fix.//

**Fear of hyperinflation is irrational—history proves.**

//Of course, all this talk of central bankers tinkering with the money supply is precisely what critics of the fiat money system dread, because they believe it will inevitably lead to runaway inflation…In that sense, we’re just like Marco Polo—still a bit amazed by the thought that you can base an entire economy on little pieces of paper.//

**Inflation spurs growth—solves risk aversion and stimulates the economy.**
**__Mirhaydari 10__** — Anthony Mirhaydari, investment columnist at MSN Money, former senior research analyst at Markman Capital Insight—an investment advisory and money management firm, 2010 (“No Inflation Means No Recovery,” //MSN Money//, September 8th, Available Online at http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/Extra/mirhaydari-no-inflation-means-no-recovery.aspx?page=all, Accessed 09-08-2011)
//The problem is extreme risk aversion. And it's being enabled by low inflation…Moreover, inflation is the lesser evil at this point, with moderate inflation being less painful than a Japanese-style deflationary spiral.//

**Higher inflation is needed to drive down unemployment.**

Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul, holds an M.A. in History from Georgetown University, 2012 (“The Fed’s Dilemma: Low Inflation Means Low Growth,” //The Fiscal Times//, August 3rd, Available Online at http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2012/08/03/The-Feds-Dilemma-Low-Inflation-Means-Low-Growth.aspx?p=1, Accessed 08-08-2012)
//First, the Fed acts as if its sole purpose is to get inflation down to zero regardless of the consequences…They believe that a modest increase in the inflation rate would substantially reduce unemployment.//

//Many of the papers that discuss the problem of the deficit and debt highlight the fact that a large and growing portion of the debt is held by foreigners, especially the government of China…In that case, interest rates would likely rise, regardless of who owned the debt.//

**No “crowd out”—doesn’t apply to the current economy.**

//The one most important reason for the tremendous benefits that infrastructure investment would bring along is its effects on expanding the economy‘s long-term productive capacity…This reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and thus the environmental barriers to economic growth.//

===2AC—China Dollar Dump=== 

**Zero risk of a dollar dump.**
**__Baker 10__** — Dean Baker, Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, 2010 (“The Budget Deficit Scare Story and the Great Recession,” Center for Economic and Policy Research, February, Available Online at http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/deficit-2010-02.pdf, Accessed 04-26-2010, p. 8-9)
//As a practical matter, it is also not even clear what a crisis in confidence could look like…However, the scenario of a full-fledged collapse of the dollar, in a world where the U.S. economy is otherwise healthy, is absurd on its face.//

**Fears of a Chinese dollar dump are facially absurd.**
**__Baker 10__** — Dean Baker, Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, 2010 (“The Deficit and Our Children: Just the Facts,” //truthout//, April 26th, Available Online at http://www.truthout.org/the-deficit-and-our-children-just-facts58864, Accessed 04-26-2010)
//Finally, the scare story, that China might one day dump its bonds and send the dollar tumbling, is absurd on its face…In other words, the deficit hawks want us to be worried that the Chinese government will one day do exactly what we have been asking them to do for years: stop buying up dollars to depress the value of the yuan against the dollar.//

==Topicality==

**__Strauss 12__** — Rebecca Strauss, Associate Director of Renewing America Publications at the Council on Foreign Relations, 2012 (“Road To Nowhere: Federal Transportation Infrastructure Policy,” Renewing America Report of the Council on Foreign Relations, June, Available Online at http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/Infrastructure_Progress_Report.pdf, Accessed 08-31-2012, p. 1)
//Transportation infrastructure includes everything from roads and airports to ports and water navigation systems. “Surface” transportation—or roads, bridges, highways, transit, and rail is by far the largest component of federal capital infrastructure spending, at 77 percent, and is also the locus of the major transportation policy debates.3//

**The neg distinction is arbitrary—maintenance is capital spending**
**__CBO 7__**– Congressional Budget Office (“Issues and Options in Infrastructure Investment”, May, http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/91xx/doc9135/05-16-infrastructure.pdf)
//1. The data in Table 1 include capital spending on infrastructure but exclude spending to maintain that infrastructure. The distinction can be somewhat arbitrary—some forms of maintenance extend the useful life of an asset and thus can have long-term benefits in much the same way new infrastructure can—and can vary from category to category. That variation affects the comparability of the rows in the table.//

==Disadvantages== 
===2AC—Buy America Bonds=== 

**The steel industry is key to the economy and hegemony.**
__**AISI 12**__— American Iron and Steel Institute—an association of North American steel producers, 2012 (“AISI Public Policy Priorities – Promoting a Pro-Manufacturing Agenda,” February 2nd, Available Online at http://www.steel.org/~/media/Files/AISI/Public%20Policy/Agenda/AISI2012PublicPolicyAgenda%20_%20Final%20020212.ashx, Accessed 09-01-2012, p. 11)
//Steel and other manufacturing industries are the backbone of our economy…In addition, the U.S. military and our civilian national security agencies would lose their principal source of strategic materials and our nation would become dangerously dependent upon foreign sources of supply.//

**No risk of trade wars—history proves.**
__**Fletcher 10—**__Ian <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Fletcher</span>, Adjunct Fellow at the San Francisco office of the U.S. Business and Industry Council—a Washington think tank, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">2010</span> (“The Mythical Concept of Trade War,” //truthout//, April 9th, Available Online at http://www.truthout.org/the-mythical-concept-trade-war58440, Accessed 04-27-2010)
//As Americans ponder how to get the US out of its current trade mess, we are constantly warned to do nothing - like impose a tariff to neutralize Chinese currency manipulation - that would trigger a "trade war."…After all, the world trading system has survived their trade barriers long enough without collapsing//

===2AC—Coercion=== 

**Freedom is not a d-rule.**
**__Locke 5__** — Robert Locke, Columnist for //FrontPage Magazine//, 2005 (“Marxism of the Right,” //The American Conservative//, March 14th, Available Online at http://www.theamericanconservative.com/article/2005/mar/14/00017/, Accessed 10-01-2011)
//The most fundamental problem with libertarianism is very simple: freedom, though a good thing, is simply not the only good thing in life…Taken to its logical conclusion, the reduction of the good to the freely chosen means there are no inherently good or bad choices at all, but that a man who chose to spend his life playing tiddlywinks has lived as worthy a life as a Washington or a Churchill.//

**Big government is good—it’s the best mechanism to referee social conflicts.**
__**<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Kamiya 97</span>**__ — Gary Kamiya, co-founder of //Salon.//com, former writer for the //San Francisco Chronicle//, holds an M.A. from the University of California-Berkeley, 1997 (“Smashing the state: The strange rise of libertarianism,” //Slate//, January 20th, Available Online at http://news.salon.com/1997/01/20/state970120/, Accessed 10-01-2011)
//Perhaps the most depressing thing about libertarianism is its almost unconscious aversion to the notion that in a representative democracy, we are the government…We have big government in large part because we live in an enormously complex society — because we have big problems.//

==Counterplans== 
===2AC—States=== 

**Devolution balkanizes surface transportation—the case is a DA to the counterplan.**
**__Schenendorf 12__** — Jack Schenendorf, Counsel at Covington & Burling LL concentrating on transportation and government affairs with a particular focus on legislative strategy, legislative procedure, and the federal budget process, served as Vice-Chairman of the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission, served for 25 years on the staff of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the U.S. House of Representatives, 2012 (“Putting the National Interest First,” //National Journal’s Transportation Experts Blog//, February 22nd, Available Online at http://transportation.nationaljournal.com/2012/02/infrastructure-becomes-campaig.php, Accessed 09-04-2012)
//Partisan politics are not the only challenge...This is just what Presidents Washington and Lincoln feared.//

===2AC—Private Sector=== 

**Turn — Privatization decimates road maintenance—the whole case is a DA to the counterplan.**
**__Baxandall et al. 9__** — Phineas Baxandall, Senior Policy Analyst for Tax and Budget issues for U.S. PIRG, former Assistant Director of the Taubman Center for State and Local Government and the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, et al., with Kari Wohlschlegel, Policy Associate at the Frontier Group, and Tony Dutzik, Senior Policy Analyst with Frontier Group specializing in energy, transportation, and climate policy, holds an M.A. in print journalism from Boston University and a B.S. in public service from Penn State University, 2009 (“The Pitfalls of Road Privatization,” //Private Roads, Public Costs: The Facts About Toll Road Privatization and How to Protect the Public//, Published by the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, Spring, Available Online at http://cdn.publicinterestnetwork.org/assets/H5Ql0NcoPVeVJwymwlURRw/Private-Roads-Public-Costs.pdf, Accessed 09-04-2012, p. 20-21)
//The public may want major traffic arteries to have cutting-edge safety technologies and traffic management…These kinds of measures can – and should – be included with any contract; but they represent yet another area that government lawyers and accountants will need to monitor.//

**Turn — The counterplan undermines public control of transportation policy—the impact is fragmentation and inefficiency, turning the net-benefit.**
**__Baxandall et al. 9__** — Phineas Baxandall, Senior Policy Analyst for Tax and Budget issues for U.S. PIRG, former Assistant Director of the Taubman Center for State and Local Government and the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston at the John F.

//Transportation policy has tremendous impacts on quality of life, health, and the cost of living…Examples from recent road privatization projects illustrate these potential dangers.//

**Turn — The counterplan increases congestion—the case is a DA.**
**__Baxandall et al. 9__** — Phineas Baxandall, Senior Policy Analyst for Tax and Budget issues for U.S. PIRG, former Assistant Director of the Taubman Center for State and Local Government and the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston at the John F.

//The goal of private toll operators is to find the right balance of toll rates and traffic to produce the maximum amount of revenue…The study also found large economic losses to nearby communities associated with diversion of truck traffic. 53//

**Turn — the counterplan destroys democracy.**
**__Dannin 11__** — Ellen Dannin, Fannie Weiss Distinguished Faculty Scholar and Professor of Law at Penn State Dickinson School of Law, 2011 (“The Toll Road to Serfdom,” //ACS Blog//—the blog of the American Constitution Society, March 15th, Available Online at http://www.acslaw.org/acsblog/node/18553, Accessed 09-04-2012)
//If you want to experience a real disconnect, find out how highway privatization actually works and then read the glowing raves by infrastructure privatization boosters…The real cost - and it is a heavy one - is the creation of 21st century serfdom and the loss of democratic control that lets us chart our future as a people.//

**Even with maximum levels of available capital the private sector only has 200 billion dollars—the plan costs three trillion.**
**__Gilroy and Kenny 12-__** Gilroy is the director of government reform and Harris Kenny is a policy analyst at Reason Foundation (Leonard and Harris, “States and Cities Going Private With Infrastructure Investment”, Reason Foundation, 5/17, http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2012/05/17/states_and_cities_going_private_with_infrastructure_investment_99671.html)
//Enter the private sector, where investors are demonstrating a willingness and capability to partner with governments to modernize and expand infrastructure, according to Reason Foundation's recent Annual Privatization Report 2011…In fact, eight major privately financed transportation projects were under construction in the U.S. in 2011 totaling over $13 billion.//

===2AC—Certainty Key=== 

**Certainty is necessary—the counterplan doesn’t solve the case.**
**__Moran 11__** — Jerry Moran, U.S. Senator (R-KS), holds a B.S. in Economics and a J.D. from the University of Kansas, 2011 (Letter to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, October 5th, Available Online at http://moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=5616a9be-ff7a-4ecb-ae52-3acf03b26cec, Accessed 09-01-2012)
//I support your efforts to pass a long-term authorization of the Surface Transportation Act that is fiscally responsible, prioritizes programs that effectively serve Americans, and demonstrates sufficient return on the investment of taxpayer dollars…I look forward to working you to ensure Congress provides states and the construction industry the certainty it needs by passing a long-term authorization of the Surface Transportation Act.//

==Critiques== 
===2AC—Virillio=== 

**Virilio’s basic assumption is flawed. Speed of tech doesn’t ruin the political—the opposite is true**
**__Grove ‘8__** Jairus Victor Grove is a Ph.D. candidate at Johns Hopkins University in International Relations and Political Theory. His research focuses on the new materialities of politics and warfare. He studies the effects of new forms of warfare on soldiers and civilian populations in urban settings. Chapter 1: A Schmittian Century?: From Nuclear Leviathan to Nuclear-Sovereign-Assemblage – March 17, 2008 – http://becomingwar.blogspot.com/2008/03/chapter-1-schmittian-century-from.html
//Initially nuclear weapons seemed to solidify even complete the decisionistic model of sovereignty once and for all…I do not want to make this sound ‘easy’ or ‘painless’ however as this ‘dispersed’ or redundant network system has become ‘everyday’ increasingly the President has been unaware of exactly who is in control or even at how many levels the Nuclear-sovereign-assemblage can be engaged or reterritorialized.//

**Speed K doesn’t apply to transportation – overstretches a military thesis.**
**__Kellner ’99__** (Douglas, George F. Kneller Chair in the Philosophy of Education, UCLA – “Virilio, War, and Technology: Some Critical Reflections," Theory, Culture and Society, Vol. 16(5-6), 1999: 103-125, http://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/Illumina%20Folder/kell29.htm)
//In _Speed and Politics_ (1986 [1977]), Virilio undertakes his first sustained attempt to delineate the importance of accelerated speed, of the impact of technologies of motion, of types of mobility and their effects in the contemporary era…In a sense, this is true and justifies Virilio's predominantly technophobic discourse, but raises questions concerning the adequacy of Virilio's perspectives on technology as a whole and the extent to which his work is of use in theorizing the new technologies with their momentous and dramatic transformation of every aspect of our social and everyday life.//

**Permute: do both. The alt causes fascism—the permutation doesn’t.**
**__Connolly 2k__** — William E. Connolly, Professor and Chair of Political Science at Johns Hopkins University, 2000 (“Speed, Concentric Cultures, and Cosmopolitanism,” //Political Theory//, Volume 28, Number 5, October, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via JSTOR, p. 598)
//Speed can be dangerous…As this contest proceeds, it also becomes clear why democratic pluralists must embrace the positive potentialities of speed while working to attenuate its most dangerous effects.//

2NR—Federal Reserve CP, Fiscal Discipline DA, NIB Fails Turns

==Topicality== 
===Capital=== 

**“Investment” requires capital expenditure**
**Anderson 6** (Edward, Lecturer in Development Studies – University of East Anglia, et al., “The Role of Public Investment in Poverty Reduction: Theories, Evidence and Methods”, Overseas Development Institute Working Paper 263, March, http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/docs/1786.pdf)
1.3 Definitions
We define (net) public investment as public expenditure that adds to the public physical capital stock. AND Methods for assessing the poverty impact of public expenditure on social sectors such as health and education have been well covered elsewhere in recent years (see for example, van de Walle and Nead, 1995; Sahn and Younger, 2000; and World Bank, 2002).

**Violation—the aff is “operation and maintenance” which is distinct from capital expenditure**
**Musick 7** - CBO’s Microeconomic Studies Division (Nathan, “Trends in Public Spending on Transportation and Water Infrastructure, 1956 to 2004,” August, [[http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/85xx/doc8517/08-08-infrastructure.pdf)/DH|http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/85xx/doc8517/08-08-infrastructure.pdf)//DH]]
The paper reports public spending both for capital and for operation and maintenance. AND(In some cases—as with air traffic control services, for instance—the costs can be sizable.) 3

===Communications=== 

**ITS is communications infrastructure**
Dong Won **Kim** is a Doctor of Philosophy from Virginia Polytechnic Institute, June **2001**, “Intelligent Transportation Systems: A Multilevel Policy Network”, Proquest, JJ
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), formerly called Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (IVHS), are “groups of technologies that use sensors, computers, and related information/communications systems to improve the management and control of roadways, vehicles, and driving capabilities” (Rothberg, Ducca and Trullinger, 1997: 1). AND All over the world, it has been increasingly expected to hold the answer to traffic congestion, travel safety, economic development, and air pollution.

===Federal Government=== 
====1NC Shell==== 

**Interpretation and violation—The Fed is not part of the “federal government”**
**Zarlenga 8** — Stephen Zarlenga, Director and Co-founder of the American Monetary Institute, 2008 (“Is the Federal Reserve System a Governmental or a Privately controlled organization?,” American Monetary Institute, February 11th, Available Online at [[http://www.monetary.org/is-the-federal-reserve-system-a-governmental-or-a-privately-controlled-organization/2008/02]], Accessed 10-17-2012)
Students of our monetary system quickly encounter this important question, normally phrased as whether the Federal Reserve System is part of the U.S. Government or is a private organization. AND Therefore despite the ambiguity – and confusion – the Fed is more accurately seen as a private, not a governmental institution, though with substantial governmental ties.

====2NC Violation==== 

**Just because it is the FEDERAL Reserve doesn't mean it is part of the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.**
**Tax Freedom 97** — Tax Freedom, 1997 (“The Truth About The Federal Reserve Bank,” Available Online at [[http://www.tax-freedom.com/ta24000.htm]], Accessed 10-17-2012)
Also, the Federal Reserve Bank is NOT EVEN actually part of the Federal government. AND Today the cost is apparently still about the same.

**The Fed is not part of the federal government.**
**Zarlenga 8** — Stephen Zarlenga, Director and Co-founder of the American Monetary Institute, 2008 (“Is the Federal Reserve System a Governmental or a Privately controlled organization?,” American Monetary Institute, February 11th, Available Online at [[http://www.monetary.org/is-the-federal-reserve-system-a-governmental-or-a-privately-controlled-organization/2008/02]], Accessed 10-17-2012)
Private ownership does not guarantee private control – they can be two different things. AND * Federal Reserve Banks are not listed as government organizations by the telephone companies, a small but telling fact.

===In the United States=== 

**“In” means within—core meaning**
**Encarta 7** [Encarta World English Dictionary, 7 (“In (1)”, 2007, [[http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861620513]]]
in [ [[http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/Pronounce.aspx?search=in|in]] ] CORE MEANING: a grammatical word indicating that something or somebody is within or inside something. AND 12. adjective holding power or office: indicates that a party or group has achieved or will achieve power or authority voted in overwhelmingly.

**United States is only the 50 States and DC**
**Words and Phrases, 6** (Words and Phrases Permanent Edition, “United States,” Volume 43A, p. 265-267 December 2006, Thomson West)Fla.App. 3 Dist. 1976.
Term “United States,” as used in statute providing for exclusion of income and losses derived from sources outside of United States means only the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

**“Infrastructure investment” is spending in the sector**
**Jimenez 95** (Immanuel, Appointed Director of Public Sector Evaluations – Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank Group, “Human and Physical Infrastructure: Public Investment and Pricing Policies in Developing Countries”, Handbook of Development Economics, Vol. III, Ed. Behrman and Srinivasan, p. 2774)
1. Introduction and overview Almost by definition, infrastructure is the basis for development. 1 AND This is to ensure that the economic issues regarding recurrent as well as capital spending are covered, since both have been the focus of the recent iiterature. Moreover, the chapter will emphasize recent policy debates, but will not present in detail the basic theoretical concepts underlying them.

===Loan Guarantees=== 

**“Infrastructure investment” requires spending**
**CBO 8** (Congressional Budget Office, “Issues and Options in Infrastructure Investment”, http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/91xx/doc9135/05-16-infrastructure.pdf)
Current Spending on Infrastructure Under any definition, “infrastructure investment” encompasses spending on a variety of projects. AND Those categories form the basis for supporting intellectual and human capital, respectively, and can provide benefits that are similar to those generated by infrastructure spending.)

===Pipelines=== 

**Interpretation - Transportation infrastructure refers to specific subsectors of transportation – distinct from water and energy**
**American Jobs Act, 11** (112 H. Doc. 53, legislation submitted to the House by Obama, 9/13, lexis)//DH
(9) Infrastructure project.--
(A) In general.--The term ``eligible infrastructure project'' means any non-Federal transportation, water, or energy infrastructure project, or an aggregation of such infrastructure projects, as provided in this Act. AND (iv) Energy efficiency enhancements for buildings, including public and commercial buildings.

**Violation—Pipelines are not “transportation infrastructure”**
**US Chamber of Commerce 10** (United States Chamber of Commerce, “Transportation Performance Index – Summary Report”, 9-23, [[http://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/lra/files/LRA_TPI%20_Summary_Report%20Final%20092110]]. pdf)
Step 1 – Definition: Transportation Infrastructure It is important to establish a definition of transportation infrastructure in order to establish the scope of the index. AND For purposes of the Infrastructure Performance Index it is considered an element of energy infrastructure.

**Pipelines aren’t topical—case list—intent to define**
**Babson ‘11** [Adam – Senior Analyst at Russell Research. “Structuring a Listed Infrastructure Portfolio” May 2011, http://www.openworldinvesting.com/files/ow_listed_infra_article.pdf]
While the global infrastructure universe can be analyzed in a variety of ways, the space can be disaggregated into the following categories: transportation infrastructure, utilities, pipelines and communications infrastructure. AND Some subsectors—such as power generation—may be ignored altogether by “orthodox” investors looking to minimize volatility and correlations to global equities, while other sectors that are only indirectly related to infrastructure—such as mobile telecom companies—may be attractive to “thematic” managers looking for enhanced returns (managers willing to invest in higher-beta, competitively exposed companies).

===Public=== 

**“Transportation infrastructure” is strictly defined as facilities of transport --- this excludes security, law enforcement, and military support**
**Musick 10** (Nathan, Microeconomic and Financial Studies Division – United States Congressional Budget Office, Public Spending on Transportation and Water Infrastructure, p. 2)
Although different definitions of "infrastructure" exist, this report focuses on two types AND those conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers following Hurricane Katrina in 2005).

**“Infrastructure” must be available for public use --- military equipment is excluded**
**Fourie 6** (Johan, Chief Operating Officer – ArcelorMittal South Africa, “Economic Infrastructure: A Review of Definitions, Theory, and Empirics”, South African Journal of Economics, 74(3), September, Wiley Online Library)
One way to define infrastructure is to describe it in terms of its characteristics. AND, while urban planners might refer to them as transportation modalities and utilities.”

===Transportation Infrastructure=== 

**The American Jobs Act defines transportation infrastructure as the following categories**
**American Jobs Act, 11** (112 H. Doc. 53, legislation submitted to the House by Obama, 9/13, lexis)//DH
(9) Infrastructure project.--
(A) In general.--The term ``eligible infrastructure project'' means any non-Federal transportation, water, or energy infrastructure project, or an aggregation of such infrastructure projects, as provided in this Act. AND (iv) Energy efficiency enhancements for buildings, including public and commercial buildings.

===Vehicles=== 
====1NC Shell==== 

**Transportation infrastructure and vehicles are distinct categories**
**GC 12** (Global Cargo & Commodities Limited, “Haulage & Transport”, http://www.globalcargogh.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=44&Itemid=132)
The field of transport has several aspects; loosely they can be divided into a kind of infrastructure, vehicles, and operations. AND The operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated on the network and the procedures set for this purpose including the legal environment (Laws, Codes, Regulations, etc) Policies, such as how to finance the system (for e.g. the use of tolls or gasoline taxes) may be considered part of the operations.

====2NC Case List==== 

**Distinct categories—case list**
**Amosweb 12** (“Taking A Ride On TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE” A pedestrian’s guide to the economy, [[http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=pdg&c=dsp&k=47]])
We usually think about transportation in terms of vehicles -- like cars, trucks, trains, airplanes, and boats. Vehicles, however, are only part of any transportation system. You usually need depots, roadbeds, and other such capital goods that we refer to as infrastructure. Cars need streets and highways, trains need tracks, airplanes need airports, and boats need docks and ports.

====JARC Violation==== 

**The plan is not topical — funds are used for vehicles, not infrastructure.**
**GAO 11** — Government Accountability Office, 2011 (“Job Access and Reverse Commute Program: Progress Made in Using Funds and Stakeholder Views on Proposed Program Changes,” May, Available Online at http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11518.pdf, Accessed 10-19-2012)
Recipients have used JARC funds for a wide variety of projects to help low-income workers get to jobs and related activities. AND 8 See appendix II for more information on types of projects supported by JARC funds.

**Eligible JARC activities include ridesharing, carpooling, and car loan programs**
**Oklahoma Department of Transportation No Date**, (“Public Transportation: Job Access and Reverse Commute Section 5316,” http://www.okladot.state.ok.us/transit/s5316.htm)
Job Access and Reverse Commute (Section 5316)
Federal transit law, as amended by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), requires that projects selected for funding under the Job Access and Reverse Commute (Section 5316) program be "derived from a locally developed, coordinated public transit-human services transportation plan" and that the plan be "developed through a process that includes representatives of public, private, and non-profit transportation and human services providers and participation by members of the public."AND Supporting new mobility management and coordination programs among public transportation providers and other human service agencies providing transportation.

**JARC funds vehicles and access to mass transit, not mass transit itself**
**USDOT Federal Highway Administration No Date** (“Case Studies
Regional Job Access and Reverse Commute Planning: North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority and New Jersey Workfirst Program, Office of Planning, Environment and Realty, http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/environmental_justice/case_studies/case2.cfm)
The Job Access and Reverse Commute Program provides grants to help States and localities develop a coordinated regional approach to new or expanded transportation services that connect welfare recipients and other low-income persons to jobs and other employment-related services. AND Beginning in FY 1999, annual authorized funding for Job Access and Reverse Commute Program grants is $150 million. A 50/50 Federal/local match is required. Other Federal funds can be used as part of the local match. In FY 2000, the Congress appropriated $75 million for the program and more than $600 million is likely to be expended over 5 years.

===Fiscal Discipline DA—NDCA=== 
====1NC—Fiscal Discipline DA==== 
[[file:1NC—Fiscal Discipline DA.docx]]

===Fiscal Cliff=== 

**Obama has the political capital he needs to push through a compromise on the fiscal cliff.**
**KALB 11 – 8 – 12** Shorenstein Center's Founding Director, Edward R. Murrow Professor of Press and Public Policy, (both of Harvard) Guest Scholar in Foreign Policy – Brookings [Marvin Kalb, An Overture to Romney, http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2012/11/08-romney-kalb]
Conservative critics, gloomy after their candidate’s defeat, argue that President Obama, despite his impressive win in a struggling economy, has no mandate. AND But, if words still have meaning, and if the president remains fixed on striking a major deal before dreaded sequestration sinks its claws into the American economy, Obama is now in a position to make a bold move. The stage, in fact, is set.

**[Plan Costs Political Capital]**

**Passing new programs during the lame duck independently triggers the link.**
**Miniter 12** Investigative Journalist and Author of Three New York Times Best-Selling Books Richard Miniter, Investigative journalist, Author of three NYT Best-selling Books. “Leading from Behind: The Reluctant President and the Advisors Who Decide for Him,” Google Books
After the historic defeat, Axelrod went on to teach a course called Campaign Strategy at Northwestern University in the Chicago suburbs. AND Obama's proposals were dutifully sent to Capitol 1 lill. but most were essentially dead on arrival. Congress was exhausted and didn't want to take any more political risks.

**Fiscal cliff kills the economy and heg—turns the case**
**Hutchison 12**—US Senator from Texas. [Kay Bailey Hutchison, 9-21-12, “A Looming Threat to National Security," States News Service, Lexis]
Despite warnings of the dire consequences, America is teetering at the edge of a fiscal cliff, with January 1st, 2013 as the tipping point AND But that will require leadership from the President that has thus far been missing. Congress and the White House must reach a long-term agreement to reduce $1 trillion annual budget deficits, without the harsh tax increases that could stall economic growth and punish working families.

**Sequestration destroys US global military power—collapses deterrence and triggers multiple scenarios for nuclear war**
**Hunter 9/30** Duncan HunterU.S. Representative from the great state of Alaska, 9/30/12 (“Sequestration Sends Wrong Message To U.S. Friends And Foes Alike,” UT San Diego News, Accessed online at http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/sep/30/tp-sequestration-sends-wrong-message-to-us/?page=1#article, Accessed on 11/12/12)
Over the next 10 years, because of sequestration, the Pentagon will be forced to absorb $500 billion in budget cuts that will strike at the heart of America’s military. AND He also said sequestration is the equivalent of “shooting ourselves in the head.” Tough words, but Secretary Panetta is right.


===Navy Budget=== 

**FY 2013 Navy modernization budget stable**
**AIAA 6/11/12** (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, “Deconstructing the defense budget”, [[http://www.militaryaerospace.com/news/2012/06/11/deconstructing-the-defense-budget.html]], Hemanth)
Early this year, the Obama administration issued guidelines for a new national defense strategy AND .1 billion for 12 Boeing EA-18 Growler electronic warfare aircraft.

**Plan trades off with Naval modernization—turns case**
**Peterson 2009** (Gordon, Capt. Gordon I. Peterson, U.S. Navy (Ret.) has served as the military legislative assistant for Senator Jim Webb of Virginia since January 2007. He is responsible for liaison to the Senate Armed Services Committee and oversight of military issues relating to all branches of the U.S. armed forces, the senior editor of Sea Power magazine since 1998, “The U.S. Navy’s Proposed Homeporting of Additional Surface Ships at Naval Station Mayport, Florida: A Critical Assessment”, [[http://webb.senate.gov/issuesandlegislation/upload/CriticalAssessmentMayportHomeporting.pdf]], Hemanth)
Given this extraordinary financial crisis, the need to reduce non-critical federal spending AND only be funded at the expense of existing military construction and modernization projects.

===Romney Good DA=== 
====1NC Shell==== 

**Romney will win, but perception of the economy is the key issue. Ignore current polling — our model is comprehensive and peer-reviewed**
**Nesbit 8-28** — Jeff Nesbit, former the director of public affairs for two prominent federal science agencies; a senior communications official at the White House; a national journalist with Knight-Ridder Newspapers and others; and a strategic communications adviser to science, public health, technology, and environmental non-profits and campaigns 2012 (“Economic Model Looks at History, Sees Victory Ahead for Romney,” US News and World Report Blogs: At the Edge, 8/28/2012, Available Online: http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/at-the-edge/2012/08/28/economic-model-looks-at-history-sees-victory-ahead-for-romney, Accessed 08/29/2012)
Never mind the media's current focus on campaign trail gaffes, tax returns, abortion, Medicare budget cuts, Obamacare, and the Republican Party's disdain for science in the 2012 presidential campaign, Mitt Romney will win because of underlying economic conditions in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, two University of Colorado political scientists predict…For if the Bickers-Berry economic and political forecasting model is correct, money talks. End of discussion.

**Investing in manufacturing is hugely popular — especially in swing states like Ohio.**
**DDN 12** — Dayton Daily News, 2012 (“Manufacturing seen key to saving economy,” Byline Steve Bennish, July 19th, Available Online at http://d2pnews.com/index.php/2012/07/19/manufacturing-high-on-voters-minds/, Accessed 09-06-2012)
A new national public opinion poll puts the presidential election fight in Ohio in perspective with results showing that voters see creating jobs in manufacturing as critical to rebuild the economy…By a sizable margin, the 1,200 likely general election voters polled rate manufacturing as the industry “most important to the overall strength of the American economy” and support a national strategy to restore America’s global leadership.

**Ohio is key—outweighs other states.**
**Silver 8/30** — Nate Silver, political analyst/blogger for the New York Times, 2012 (“Aug. 29: So Much Depends Upon Ohio,” FiveThirtyEight—a New York Times blog, August 30th, Available Online at http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/aug-29-so-much-depends-upon-ohio/, Accessed 09-06-2012)
The broader point is simply that Ohio is so important to the electoral calculus that it’s good news for a candidate when a polling firm shows him doing relatively well there compared with the other states that it polls…That means he could win any one of Colorado, Virginia, Iowa, Wisconsin, Florida or North Carolina to put him over the top.

**Romney victory guarantees Obamacare repeal — Obama win makes the law permanent**
**Yglesias 12** — Matthew Yglesias, Slate magazine’s business and economics correspondent, former writer for ThinkProgress, the Atlantic, TPM Media, and the American Prospect, 2012 (“What Would President Romney Do? Romney’s promised to scrap Obamacare—and if he wins he can do it,” 6/28/2012, Available Online at: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/06/obamacare_repeal_romney_can_do_it_.html, Accessed: 08/31/2012)
The Supreme Court’s decision to let the core elements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act stand kicks the fate of the Obama administration’s signature initiative where it properly belongs—into the domain of politics—where a Romney administration would still have ample opportunity to dismantle the main elements of the law…By declining to do Republican politicians’ work for them, in other words, John Roberts just made 2012 a very consequential election.

**Obamacare hurts the economy — consumer confidence, job cuts, health care costs**
**Samuelson 12** — Robert J. Samuelson, Economics Opinion writer for the Washington Post, 2012 (“The folly of Obamacare,” Washington Post Opinions, 6/17/2012, Available Online: http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-the-folly-of-obamacare/2012/06/17/gJQAf5o1jV_print.html, Accessed: 08/31/2012)
We pay our presidents for judgment, and President Obama committed a colossal error of judgment in making health-care “reform” a centerpiece of his first term…But this restrained approach would have disappointed many liberals and denied Obama the presumed historical glory of achieving near-universal coverage.

====1NC Military Power Impact==== 

**Romney would __rebuild__ American military power—Obama will continue __weakening it__.**
**Eaglen 9/19**—Mackenzie Eaglen, Resident Fellow at the Marilyn Ware Center for Security Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, previously worked on defense issues in Congress and the Pentagon and served on the staff of the Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel, 2012 (“Sequestration, the election hangover,” //Politico//, September 19th, Available Online at http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=990D3828-4963-43F1-A3D0-DCAEF4D524A8, Accessed 10-18-2012)

====2NC Pharmaceutical Industry Impact==== 

**Obamacare devastates the pharmaceutical industry — prevents research and drugs**
**Smith 11** — William S. Smith, former vice president for U.S. public affairs and policy at Pfizer, Inc., currently managing director at NSI, a D.C.-based consulting firm, 2011 (“Obamacare vs. Drug Innovation,” National Review Online, 2/16/2011, Available Online: http://www.nationalreview.com/blogs/print/259846, Accessed: 09/04/2012)
With the release of the president’s budget, it is now beyond dispute — Beltway spin notwithstanding — that the decision by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) to support the health-care bill was one of the worst self-inflicted wounds in the history of lobbying. AND The pharmaceutical industry will never be popular, but if Beltway dealmaking replaces innovation, it will simultaneously court public opprobrium and commercial disaster.

**Pharmaceutical innovation is critical to stop the next global epidemic — kills 40-50 million**
**Bandow 5** — Doug Bandow, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, 2005
(“A strong pharmaceutical industry is the best defense against pandemics,” The San Diego Union-Tribune, 3/27/05, Available Online: http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050327/news_lz1e27bandow.html, Accessed 09/04/2012)
For a time SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, seemed to threaten a deadly new global epidemic. But, thankfully, SARS faded away after killing fewer than 800 people.ANDAlthough governments have an important role to play in fighting any disease pandemic, necessary for developing any effective treatment and putting into mass production any vaccine or other medicine is private industry.

====2NC Religious Freedom Impact==== 

**Anti-Conscience mandate violates religious freedom — must protect at all costs**
**Torre 12** —Sarah Torre, Heritage’s DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society, 2012 (“Calls for Renewed Commitment to Religious Liberty after Obamacare Mandate Implementation,” The Foundry, 8/1/2012, Available Online: http://blog.heritage.org/2012/08/01/calls-for-renewed-commitment-to-religious-liberty-after-obamacare-mandate-implementation/, Accessed: 08/31/2012)
Today marks the beginning of implementation of the anti-conscience mandate, and with it come calls for continued vigilance to demand greater protection of religious liberty. AND We can reform America’s health care to decrease costs, increase access, and put personal health care decisions where they belong: in the hands of the American people.

==Counterplans== 
===Alaska=== 

**Text—**
**The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority should authorize the funding for icebreaker capacity for the United States Coast Guard on the condition that the U.S. Coast Guard create shipping lanes through its icebound territorial waters off the coast of Alaska.**

**The CP solves—can finance.**
**DeMarban 12**, 4/13/2012 (Alex – staff writer for the Alaska Dispatch, Parnell: AIDEA could help finance icebreaker if Feds drop ball, Alaska Dispatch, p. http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/parnell-aidea-could-help-finance-icebreaker-if-feds-drop-ball)
Earlier this week, Alaska Dispatch published a story shining light on an exchange of letters between Gov. Sean Parnell and Rep. Don Young about how the state can help the US government beef up its Arctic icebreaking capacity. Icebreaker fans know the federal government is hobbled in the Arctic as other countries boost their presence in the resource rich -- and increasingly accessible -- Far North. AND What exactly such an arrangement could look like would be up to the AIDEA board."

===Congress=== 
====1NC Shell==== 

**Text—**
**The United States Congress should substantially increase its Brazilian transportation infrastructure investment. The Fed should discontinue quantitative easing.**

**Solvency advocate**
**Blodget 12** — Henry Blodget, co-founder, CEO, and Editor-In Chief of Business Insider, former top-ranked Wall Street analyst, frequent contributor to the magazines Slate, Newsweek, and New York, 2012 (“Yes, It's Time For A Massive Infrastructure Spending Program,” Business Insider, June 19th, Available Online at http://www.businessinsider.com/infrastructure-spending-program-2012-6?op=1, Accessed 09-03-2012)
I recently laid out the fundamental problem with the US economy: Massive consumer debts and high unemployment are crippling consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of our economy. AND And this, in turn, suggests that ruling out future stimulus in the form of infrastructure investment as a way to help the economy is a major mistake, especially with US infrastructure in such lousy shape and so many US workers idled by the construction industry slowdown.

====2NC Shamanistic Economics Turn==== 

**Turn — Shamanistic Economics:**
**First, the plan and permutation buy into shamanistic economics—the aff gives control of monetary policy to unelected elites, entrenching top-down anti-democratic governance—this crushes democracy.**
**Kervick 9/13** — Dan Kervick, holds a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Massachusetts, active independent scholar specializing in the philosophy of David Hume, researches decision theory and analytic metaphysics, 2012 (“Shamanistic Economics,” New Economic Perspectives, September 13th, Available Online at http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/09/shamanistic-economics.html, Accessed 10-20-2012)
Shamanistic economics, when it becomes a routine way of life, debases and undermines our democracy. AND They don’t seem to like democracy very much – and the fact that the shamanistic system keeps politicians and citizens out of the picture, and concentrates power in the central bank and the major financial institutions it coordinates and conspires with, is appealing to them.

**The plan buys into Shamanistic Economics.**
**Kervick 9/13** — Dan Kervick, holds a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Massachusetts, active independent scholar specializing in the philosophy of David Hume, researches decision theory and analytic metaphysics, 2012 (“Shamanistic Economics,” New Economic Perspectives, September 13th, Available Online at http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/09/shamanistic-economics.html, Accessed 10-20-2012)
Yet when one reads accounts of how these asset purchases are supposed to accomplish their aim of generating a stronger recovery, one gets a lot of conflicting theories. AND All that matters is that apart from whatever actual causal connections exist between X and Y that operate independently of expectations, there are also a lot of popular beliefs about the connection between X and Y that cause people to act with the expectation that Y will cause X.

**Second, this takes out and turns the case — magical Fed action fails. Even if it succeeds, the plan and permutation crush democracy and cement elitism and inequality.**
**Kervick 9/13** — Dan Kervick, holds a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Massachusetts, active independent scholar specializing in the philosophy of David Hume, researches decision theory and analytic metaphysics, 2012 (“Shamanistic Economics,” New Economic Perspectives, September 13th, Available Online at http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/09/shamanistic-economics.html, Accessed 10-20-2012)
But here is the problem with the applicability of this philosophical thought experiment. AND And transitory successes in shamanistic economics will increase the superstitious tendencies and political passivity of others who don’t know any better, and who assume that the elites always know best.

**Elite power results in inequality catastrophic social collapse—extinction impact**
**Creamer 9** — Robert Creamer, political organizer, strategist, and author, owner of Strategic Consulting Group—a political consulting firm that works on many of the country’s most significant issue campaigns, married to Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, 2009 (“Why Growing Income Inequality Is Bad for America,” The Huffington Post, October 27th, Available Online at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-creamer/why-growing-income-inequa_b_335115.html, Accessed 10-27-2009)
4). Finally, increased income inequality is completely undemocratic. AND It is also dangerous to our future survival.

====2NC Constitutionality Turn==== 

**Turn — Constitutionality:**
**The Federal Reserve is unconstitutional.**
**Borowski 12** — Julie Borowski, Policy Analyst for FreedomWorks Foundation—a grassroots educational organization dedicated to lower taxes, less government and more freedom, 2012 (“Top 10 Reasons to End the Federal Reserve,” FreedomWorks, Available Online at http://www.freedomworks.org/files/Top10ReasonstoEndFederalReserve.pdf, Accessed 10-19-2012)
8. The Federal Reserve is Unconstitutional AND Due to my strict interpretation of the Constitution, I find the Federal Reserve to clearly violate the Constitution.

**Activist Federal Reserve policies certainly violate the Constitution.**
**Borowski 12** — Julie Borowski, Policy Analyst for FreedomWorks Foundation—a grassroots educational organization dedicated to lower taxes, less government and more freedom, 2012 (“Top 10 Reasons to End the Federal Reserve,” FreedomWorks, Available Online at http://www.freedomworks.org/files/Top10ReasonstoEndFederalReserve.pdf, Accessed 10-19-2012)
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has the power to dramatically impact our economy at a drop of the hat. AND Our Founding Fathers would be outraged that one centralized institution has unchecked and unprecedented power to control the economy and thus our lives.

**Reject every violation — even if non-unique.**
**CTFP 99** — Chattanooga Times Free Press, 1999 (“Upholding the Constitution,” July 14th, Available Online via Lexis)
It long has been highly disturbing that many public officials -- from the president of the United States, members of Congress, justices of the U.S. Supreme Court and on down the line -- have often ignored the Constitution of the United States and the Constitutions of the various states when what the Constitutions say is at variance with what the officials want to do. AND The liberty of us all in America stands on the foundation of constitutional government. We should allow no one to undermine or erode that foundation on issues either small or large.

===Dispersal===

After analyzing the various arguments, an increased federal gasoline tax seems like a good idea if the increase is large and the additional revenue is used to reduce income taxes in a progressive manner.

A. Phase-In a Price Floor and Variable Tax on Gasoline
Congress should phase-in a price floor and variable tax on gasoline. AND Ultimately, the tax revenue generated from an increase in the gasoline tax would not—and should not—be distributed to any single use, but should be allocated as the government deems appropriate.

For the past few decades, conservatives have wielded the issue of taxes like cudgel, using it beat down opponents.

===Opportunity Impact Statement===

**Text—**
**The United States federal government should commission an Opportunity Impact Statement on a proposed substantial increase in transportation infrastructure investment in Bureau of Indian Affairs’ roads including consideration of alternative approaches to achieving the goals of the proposal that may be more effective in ensuring equal access to greater opportunity and consideration of the proposal’s compliance with equal opportunity laws and other applicable legal standards. The United States federal government should implement the policy recommended by the Opportunity Impact Statement process.**

**First, subjecting the plan to a prior, binding Opportunity Impact Statement is key to maximize opportunity—the plan threatens to undermine it—every instance is key.**
**Jenkins et al. 12** — Alan Jenkins, Executive Director of The Opportunity Agenda—a communications, research, and policy organization dedicated to building the national will to expand opportunity for all, former Director of Human Rights at the Ford Foundation, served as Assistant to the Solicitor General at the U.S. Department of Justice, holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School, an M.A. in Media Studies from New School University, and a B.A. in Psychology and Social Relations from Harvard College, et al., with Juhu Thukral, Director of Law and Advocacy at The Opportunity Agenda, former founder and Director of the Sex Workers Project at the Urban Justice Center in New York City, holds a J.D. from the University of San Francisco School of Law, Kevin Hsu, Former Robert L.

Debates over the size and scope of federal spending have dominated the political discourse over the last several years. AND The OIS process is a logical outgrowth of existing statutes, regulations, and executive orders that already require data collection, public participation, and pre- and post- award analysis as part of an administrative agency’s civil rights compliance measures.

**Second, transportation projects are key—the DOT is failing to ensure equal opportunity now—the plan and permutation link but the counterplan solves.**
**Jenkins et al. 12** — Alan Jenkins, Executive Director of The Opportunity Agenda—a communications, research, and policy organization dedicated to building the national will to expand opportunity for all, former Director of Human Rights at the Ford Foundation, served as Assistant to the Solicitor General at the U.S. Department of Justice, holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School, an M.A. in Media Studies from New School University, and a B.A. in Psychology and Social Relations from Harvard College, et al., with Juhu Thukral, Director of Law and Advocacy at The Opportunity Agenda, former founder and Director of the Sex Workers Project at the Urban Justice Center in New York City, holds a J.D. from the University of San Francisco School of Law, Kevin Hsu, Former Robert L.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) encompasses federal agencies that work on issues of air, road, rail, and sea transportation, as well as oil and gas pipelines. AND An OIS process would enable the DOT to collect the information necessary to prioritize equal opportunity compliance in its funding decisions, create equal opportunity oversight and quality assurance, engage community and advocacy groups in planning and policy development, and provide clear prospective guidance to the states in their efforts to comply with equal opportunity laws.

**Third, the counterplan is key to expand opportunity, improve public accountability, and boost civic engagement—crucial to reduce inequality.**
**Jenkins et al. 12** — Alan Jenkins, Executive Director of The Opportunity Agenda—a communications, research, and policy organization dedicated to building the national will to expand opportunity for all, former Director of Human Rights at the Ford Foundation, served as Assistant to the Solicitor General at the U.S. Department of Justice, holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School, an M.A. in Media Studies from New School University, and a B.A. in Psychology and Social Relations from Harvard College, et al., with Juhu Thukral, Director of Law and Advocacy at The Opportunity Agenda, former founder and Director of the Sex Workers Project at the Urban Justice Center in New York City, holds a J.D. from the University of San Francisco School of Law, Kevin Hsu, Former Robert L.

Policymakers are charged with ensuring that federal assistance meets the needs of all Americans. AND We believe that providing the Opportunity Impact Statement is an important step in realizing our society’s promise as a land of opportunity.

====2NC Human Rights Impact==== 

**The counterplan is key to human rights.**
**Opportunity Agenda 9** — The Opportunity Agenda—a communications, research, and advocacy organization dedicated to building the national will to expand opportunity in America, 2009 (“The Opportunity Impact Statement,” Poverty & Race, Volume 18, Issue 2, March/April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Alt Press Watch)
The recent and ongoing investments in the nation's economic recovery have the potential to not only revitalize our economy, but also the American promise of opportunity itself. AND Fulfilling those values is not merely good policy, but part of our fundamental human rights.

====2NC Prior Binding Key==== 

**The OIS has to be prior and binding—the permutation fails.**
**Jenkins et al. 12** — Alan Jenkins, Executive Director of The Opportunity Agenda—a communications, research, and policy organization dedicated to building the national will to expand opportunity for all, former Director of Human Rights at the Ford Foundation, served as Assistant to the Solicitor General at the U.S. Department of Justice, holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School, an M.A. in Media Studies from New School University, and a B.A. in Psychology and Social Relations from Harvard College, et al., with Juhu Thukral, Director of Law and Advocacy at The Opportunity Agenda, former founder and Director of the Sex Workers Project at the Urban Justice Center in New York City, holds a J.D. from the University of San Francisco School of Law, Kevin Hsu, Former Robert L. Carter Fellow and Associate Counsel at The Opportunity Agenda, Nerissa Kunakemakorn, Former Robert L. Carter Fellow and Associate Counsel at The Opportunity Agenda, and Megan Haberle, Former Economic Opportunity Fellow and Associate Counsel at The Opportunity Agenda, 2012 (“Promoting Opportunity through Impact Statements: A Tool for Policymakers to Assess Equity,” American Constitution Society Issue Brief, April, Available Online at http://www.acslaw.org/sites/default/files/Jenkins_et_al_-_Promoting_Opportunity_through_Impact_Statements.pdf, Accessed 07-22-2012, p. 11)
The results of Opportunity Impact Statements can both ensure compliance with equal opportunity laws and help federal agencies decide which projects are most worthy of support. AND Absent that showing, or if a less discriminatory alternative is found, federal funding should not go forward. 64

**The process has to precede the disbursement of funding to solve.**
**Jenkins et al. 12** — Alan Jenkins, Executive Director of The Opportunity Agenda—a communications, research, and policy organization dedicated to building the national will to expand opportunity for all, former Director of Human Rights at the Ford Foundation, served as Assistant to the Solicitor General at the U.S. Department of Justice, holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School, an M.A. in Media Studies from New School University, and a B.A. in Psychology and Social Relations from Harvard College, et al., with Juhu Thukral, Director of Law and Advocacy at The Opportunity Agenda, former founder and Director of the Sex Workers Project at the Urban Justice Center in New York City, holds a J.D. from the University of San Francisco School of Law, Kevin Hsu, Former Robert L.

Instituting an OIS process would strengthen existing data collection requirements and would allow federal agencies to analyze a project or program’s relative ability to expand or diminish access to opportunity within a region before the allocation or disbursement of federal funds, thus proactively effectuating civil rights mandates.

====2NC Solvency—Native Specific==== 

**The plan has a substantial effect on Native employment opportunities—ensuring the best investment is key.**
**Tsosie 11** — Jefferson Keel, President of the National Congress of American Indians, 2011 (“Tribal Transportation: Paving The Way for Jobs, Infrastructure, and Safety in Native Communities,” Hearing Before the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, September 15th, Available Online at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-112shrg73248/html/CHRG-112shrg73248.htm, Accessed 09-09-2012)
The transit, rights of way, safety, and increasing the Indian Reservation Roads program and streamlining the process through self-determination contracting will greatly enhance our efforts. AND Some Tribes do not. But the fact is, many Tribes are engaged in that activity as we speak.

====2NC Theory==== 

**We have a civic engagement net-benefit to our interpretation—debates about the details of transportation policymaking are crucial to give students a foot in the transportation policy door—specialized knowledge of the policymaking details is a prerequisite to political participation.**
**Thomas 8** — Ren Thomas, Doctoral Student in Community and Regional Planning at the University of British Columbia, 2008 (“Engaged or Disinterested? Youth Political and Civic Participation in Canadian Transportation Planning,” Critical Planning, Volume 15, Issue 1, Summer, Available Online at http://renthomas.ca/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/thomas-article.pdf, Accessed 07-30-2012, p. 9-11)
Although young people do not typically show high rates of participation in formal political processes, a [end page 9] brief overview of public participation in transportation planning is useful to illustrate the difficulties citizens face in becoming formally involved in transportation planning. AND In other words, the exact type of knowledge that young people have admitted they don’t have, which prevents them from participating politically.

====AT: Delay==== 
**The counterplan doesn’t overburden the DOT or fund recipients.**

1. Data Collection within the DOT [end page 13]
The DOT Title VI regulations already authorize the level of data collection that would be required under the OIS process, though these have lacked proper enforcement in the past. AND [T]o assure that disproportionately high and adverse effects on minority or low income populations are identified and addressed, DOT shall collect, maintain, and analyze information on the race, color, national origin, and income level of persons adversely affected by DOT programs, policies, and activities, and use such information in complying with this Order. 79

===Privatization=== 
====1NC Generic==== 

**Text—**
**The United States federal government should initiate complete privatization of its transportation infrastructure by offering to sell all publically owned transportation infrastructures to interested private-sector entities.**

**Solvency advocate—privatization solves cost overruns, encourages innovation, and reduces our debt**
**Winston, ’10** [Clifford, senior fellow in the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution, author of “Last Exit: Privatization and Deregulation of the U.S. Transportation System”, “THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH PRIVATIZATION NOT A BANK,” http://www.economics21.org/commentary/private-sector-can-improve-infrastructure-privatization-not-bank]
The Administration could improve the nation’s infrastructure—and also improve its standing with Wall Street and the business community—by selling some roads and airports outright to the private sector…The technology is there. But it hasn’t been deployed in a timely fashion because government operators have no incentive to do so. The private sector does.

====1NC Next Gen==== 

**Text—**
**The United States federal government should commercialize the air traffic control system by creating a self-supporting non-civil service Air Traffic Organization funded. We’ll clarify.**

**Solvency advocate—counterplan solves efficiency and safety better—avoids the FAA bad turns**
**Poole 10** (Robert W. Jr., Director of Transportation Policy and Searle Freedom Trust Transportation Fellow – Reason Foundation, and Chris Edwards, Director of Tax Policy Studies – Cato Institute, “Airports and Air Traffic Control”, June, http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/transportation/airports-atc)
The way to address all three of these organizational problems is to take the ATC system out of the federal budget process and make it a self-supporting entity, funded directly by its customers. AND Countries like Canada have shown the way forward for air traffic control, and U.S. policymakers should adopt the proven organizational reforms that have been implemented abroad.

====1NC Port Dredging==== 

**Text—**
**The United States federal government should devolve port dredging authority to the private sector.**

**Dredging should be transferred to private ownership – empirics prove solves better**
**Edwards 5** Chris is the Director of Tax Policy at the Cato Institute (Cato Institute, "Privatize the Army Corps of Engineers", October 2005, http://www.cato.org/pubs/tbb/tbb-0510-27.pdf)
Reform Options To solve these problems, the civilian activities of the Corps should be AND could invest and expand as needed to relieve congestion and accommodate larger ships.

====1NC Space Elevator==== 

**The United States federal government should offer prizes, tax incentives and contracts to private companies that successfully demonstrate a space elevator with any end product being owned exclusively by the United States.**

**CP solves – overcomes NASA barriers and creates new technologies**
**Turnlinson 5** – Founder of the Space Frontier Foundation, [Space.com News, “Private Industry Can Help NASA Open the Space Frontier”, 3-11-05, http://www.space.com/171-private-industry-nasa-open-space-frontier.html]
Thus we have both a mandate for our government to explore and open space to permanent habitation, and the birth of a private sector space industry, which can power, sustain and capitalize that expansion of our civilization beyond the Earth. AND I don't know about you, but I don't want to wait any longer.

====FAA Fails Turn==== 

**Turn—FAA Fails—culture and lack of technical expertise make implementation impossible**
**Poole 07** (Robert W. Poole, Jr. is the director of transportation policy and Searle Freedom Trust Transportation Fellow at Reason Foundation. “The Urgent Need To Reform The FAA’s Air Traffic Control System.” March 2007. http://reason.org/files/7e27c68e7675e8a599716bab220978f5.pdf)
Thus, many observers are greatly concerned that the FAA’s institutional culture is poorly suited to implementing anything as dramatic as the shift from human-centric ATC to network-centric ATM. AND Thus, major institutional change is probably a prerequisite for implementing the proposed network-centric ATM system.

**Incompetence turns the case**
**Poole and Edwards 10** (Robert W. Poole, Jr. is the director of transportation policy and Searle Freedom Trust Transportation Fellow at Reason Foundation. Chris Edwards is the director of tax policy studies at Cato. Before joining Cato, Edwards was a senior economist on the congressional Joint Economic Committee. “Airports and Air Traffic Control.” June 2010. http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/transportation/airports-atc)
However, the challenge ahead for the ATC system is more complex than just financialAND Given the FAA's management and cost overrun problems in the past, simply fixing the funding problem for the ATC system without dramatically reforming its governance poses risks of larger and more dramatic failures and greater congestion down the road.

====Synoptic Delusion Turn==== 

**Effective central planning is impossible—the whole case is a product of synoptic delusion.**
**Crowley 99** — Brian Lee Crowley, founding President of AIMS, the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies, Atlantic Canada's public policy think tank, 1999 (“The Man Who Changed Everyone’s Life: The Ubiquitous Life of F.A.

Perhaps ironically, Hayek’s mission in life was to use reason to convince humanity of the limits of reason. AND “Our knowledge can only be finite, while our ignorance must necessarily be infinite.”

**Central planning is impossible and destroys civilization**
**Rockwell 5** — Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., president of the Mises Institute, 2005 (“The Hayek Moment,” The Mises Institute, The Free Market, Volume 21, Number 5, May 21, Available Online at http://mises.org/freemarket_detail.aspx?control=439, Accessed 11-28-08)
But failure does not deter the state. Indeed, we are now asked to believe that the White House is not only omnipotent but omniscient as well. ANDThe recognition of the insuperable limits to his knowledge ought indeed to teach the student of society a lesson of humility which should guard him against becoming an accomplice in men's fatal striving to control society."

===States=== 

**Text—**
**The fifty state governments should substantially increase their transportation infrastructure accessibility investment. We’ll clarify.**

**Solvency advocate—state based transportation infrastructure is comparatively better**
**Glaeser 2012**, (Edward Bloomberg View columnist and professor of economics at Harvard, Feb 13 (Web, 2-13-12) http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-14/spending-won-t-fix-what-ails-u-s-transport-commentary-by-edward-glaeser.html “Spending Won’t Fix What Ails U.S. Infrastructure,” LJ)
DE-FEDERALIZE TRANSPORT SPENDING: Most forms of transport infrastructure overwhelmingly serve the residents of a single state. AND We should move toward a system in which states and localities take more responsibility for the infrastructure that serves their citizens.

==Critiques== 
===First Priority=== 

**Our First Priority should be to First Americans—the affirmative has taken for granted that the United States is built on stolen land. Struggles for justice that do not begin with Indian land rights reinforce colonialist imperialism—the “-isms” they attempt to combat are inextricably tied up in the U.S. occupation of Native lands.**
**Churchill 2k** — Ward Churchill, Professor of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, holds a B.A. in Technological Communications and an M.A. in Communications Theory from Sangamon State University, 2000 (“I Am Indigenist: Notes on the Ideology of the Fourth World,” ZNet, September 20th, Available Online at http://www.zcommunications.org/i-am-indigenist-by-ward-churchill, Accessed 04-20-2012)
Leaving aside questions concerning the validity of various treaties, the beginning point for any indigenist endeavor in the United States centers, logically enough, in efforts to restore direct Indian control over the huge portion of the continental United States that was plainly never ceded by native nations. AND Here, I would advance the straightforward premise that the land rights of "First Americans" should be a priority for anyone seriously committed to accomplishing positive change in North America.

**Vote negative to establish as First Priority the return of indigenous land.**

**Beginning with Indian land rights is a superior activist strategy—the alternative breaks down the state’s ability to impose all forms of violence.**
**Churchill 2k** — Ward Churchill, Professor of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, holds a B.A. in Technological Communications and an M.A. in Communications Theory from Sangamon State University, 2000 (“I Am Indigenist: Notes on the Ideology of the Fourth World,” ZNet, September 20th, Available Online at http://www.zcommunications.org/i-am-indigenist-by-ward-churchill, Accessed 04-20-2012)
Not only is it perfectly reasonable to assert that a restoration of native control over unceded lands within the United States would do nothing to perpetuate such problems as sexism and classism, but the reconstitution of indigenous social standards that this would entail stands to free the affected portions of North America from such maladies altogether. AND It follows that realization of indigenous land rights serves to undermine or destroy the ability of the status quo to continue imposing a racist, sexist, classist, homophobic, militaristic order upon non-Indians.

**Finally, compromise is not an option—the affirmative’s refusal to place Indian land rights as their First Priority makes them complicit with genocidal violence.**
**Churchill 2k** — Ward Churchill, Professor of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, holds a B.A. in Technological Communications and an M.A. in Communications Theory from Sangamon State University, 2000 (“I Am Indigenist: Notes on the Ideology of the Fourth World,” ZNet, September 20th, Available Online at http://www.zcommunications.org/i-am-indigenist-by-ward-churchill, Accessed 04-20-2012)
So, all things considered, when indigenist movements like AIM advance slogans like "U.S. Out of North America," non-Indian radicals should not react defensively. AND In other words, they make themselves part of the problem rather than becoming part of the solution.

===Astropolitics=== 

**The affirmative is confined within a dominant discourse of space control – their discourse of astropolitical control reflects their elevation of technology over politics.**
**Grondin, 6** [David Grondin, Lecturer in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa, 2006, “The (Power) Politics of Space: What IR Theories have to say about American Astro-Political Discourses on Space Weaponisation,” Paper Presented At The Annual Meeting Of The International Studies Association, March 25th, Available Online via All Academic at http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/9/8/6/7/p98679_index.html, Accessed 10-26-2008, p. 25-26]
This line of argument is usually linked to technological capacities. AND You are brought back to the realities of the global homeland security state. One is doomed to either accept the logic of terror – that inexorably goes with the logic of global security – or reject it. I choose the latter.

**The affirmative is wed to a dangerous technological rationality that depoliticizes society and eliminates constraints on genocidal violence – the constant preparedness for war embodied in the affirmative’s call for space control should be rejected in order to inject democratic accountability into space policy.**
**Grondin, 7** [David Grondin, Lecturer in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa, 2007, “The US Religion of Technology in the Weaponization of Outer Space? A Case for Technological Atheism and Resisting Space War,” Paper Presented At The Annual Meeting Of The International Studies Association 48th Annual Convention, February 28th, Available Online via All Academic at http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/ 1/7/8/9/4/p178946_index.html, Accessed 10-26-2008, p. 9-13]
When turning to US national security state technocracy applied to outer Space, it reveals as useful to go back to Paul Virilio to shed light on this problematic situation. AND This constructivist view of technology thus calls for a reconceptualised politics of technology.

**Specifically, our alternative is to criticize the affirmative’s call for space control from our position as outsiders to the discourse of astropolitik. Engaging in criticism of Astropolitik is vital to re-politicize space – interrogating affirmative discourse is the most effective strategy for resistance.**
**Grondin, 7** [David Grondin, Lecturer in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa, 2007, “The US Religion of Technology in the Weaponization of Outer Space? A Case for Technological Atheism and Resisting Space War,” Paper Presented At The Annual Meeting Of The International Studies Association 48th Annual Convention, February 28th, Available Online via All Academic at http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/ 1/7/8/9/4/p178946_index.html, Accessed 10-26-2008, p. 23-26]
If it is beyond challenge that technology is the medium that manages, produces, permits, and administers the daily life of modern societies, a common discourse of engineers and technocrats and security experts often tries to make believe and convince people that the technical and social spheres are separate – when in fact technologies are always already social institutions, devised by individuals and for somethingAND But for that to happen, the scholarship on the international politics of outer Space must get more public space – more media coverage – and try to get its voice to be heard in US policymaking circles. It is not too late to hope for an atheist vision of technology in US space power politics.

It is time to try to describe, at first abstractly and later concretely, a strategy for destroying capitalism. AND If this pressing desire were a desire to live free, to be autonomous, to live in democratically controlled communities, to participate in the self-regulating activities of a mature people, then capitalism could be destroyed. Otherwise, we are doomed to perpetual slavery and possibly even to extinction.

RW/RR: In The Socialist Alternative, you argue that "given the heterogeneity of the collective worker (and its various forms of immiseration) and capital's use of differences to divide the working class in order to defeat it, a political instrument is needed to mediate among the parts of the collective worker, provide the welcoming space where popular movements can learn from each other and develop the unity necessary to defeat capital." AND We can use the opportunity of the current crisis to demonstrate how it is a system that we need to go beyond.

=====AT: Perm===== 

**Must reject the plan wholesale—the logic of compromise with the system precludes socialist transformations**
Meszaros, 95 (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 1995 [Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, p. 976]
The inescapable constraints of such adjustments are determined by the prevailing historical circumstances and by the changing relation of forces. AND And that in its own turn necessarily implies that capital’s inherent antagonisms must be ultimately ‘fought out’ to a truly irreversible, structurally safeguarded conclusion.

**Alternative Advocacy DA**
**Meszaros 95** (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 1995 [Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, p. 143]
Maintaining the stability of a system built upon a whole range of explosive structural antagonisms is quite unthinkable without the superimposition of artificial layers of complexity whose primary function is the perpetuation of the ruling order and the postponement of ‘the moment of truth’. AND However, rational arguments on their own are utterly powerless for overcoming enmity to change when the fundamental practical premisses of the materially dominant party are at stake.

=====Disabilities===== 

**The category of disability was created in the desire to construct a desirable workforce**
**Russell* and Malhotra** 2 **- * writes on the political, social and economic aspects of disablement her socio-economic analysis has been published in the Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law, the Review of Radical Political Economy, the Journal of Disability Policy Studies, Disability & Society, Monthly Review, Disability Studies Quarterly, Left Business Observer, Real World Micro, 9th edition, Socialist Register 2002, and the Backlash Against the Americans with Disabilities Act: Reinterpreting Disability Rights (Corporealities, Discourses of Disability) University of Michigan Press, 2003.**is a Canadian disability rights activist and a member of the New Democratic Party.

The ‘medicalization’ of disablement and the tools of classification clearly played an important role in establishing divisions between the ‘disabled’ and the ‘ablebodied’. AND The disability benefit system thus serves as a socially legitimized means by which the capitalist class can avoid hiring or retaining non-standard workers and can ‘morally’ shift the cost of supporting them onto poverty-based government programs — thereby perpetuating their poverty.

**Disability is constructed to reproduce capitalism**
**Kitchin 98** [Rob, Director of NIRSA and Chairperson of the Irish Social Sciences Platform, “'Out of place', 'Knowing one's place': Space, power and the exclusion of disabled people,” Disability & Society, June, [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09687599826678]]]
As separate approaches social constructivism and political economy are limited and limiting. AND Within this mode there are inherent contradictions that need to be exposed, so that unfair social relationships enshrined in the class system, and also expressed in the exclusion of disabled people, can be overthrown.

=====Free Trade===== 

**Decreases in free trade force capitalist economies to downscale into more self-sufficient economies**
**Lewis 98** [Chris H. Lewis, Instructor in the Sewall American Studies Program at the University of Colorado, 1998, "The Paradox of Global Development and the Necessary Collapse of Modern Industrial Civilization," The Coming Age of Scarcity: Preventing Mass Death and Genocide in the Twenty-first Century, edited by Michael N. Dobkowski and Isidor Wallimann, Published by Syracuse University Press, ISBN 0815627440, p. 55-56]
The successful collapse of global industrial civilization is, in part, dependent on the 80 percent not fully integrated with the global economy breaking free from their ties to modern industrial civilization. AND If these polities and nations take responsibility for helping their peoples survive the hardship and suffering imposed by the devolution of the global industrial civilization and economy, they will be better able to reduce the real threat of mass death and genocide that will arise from the collapse of modern industrial civilization.

**Free trade is premised upon a biased ideology that forcibly integrates the world into the global economy—this causes wage differentials and stratifies the world along a global rich and poor divide**
**De Angelis**, lecturer in Political Economy at University of East London, July **2000** [Massimo, Trade, the global factory and the struggles for new commons, Paper presented at the CSE conference "Global Capital and Global Struggles: Strategies, Alliances, and Alternatives"]
Let us be clear from the outset. AND To gain an independent position of planetary civil society, we must start to think about proposals of transformation of current society within a conceptual grid that is independent from the main current dogmas that sustain capital's discourse: competition and, especially, the meaning of growth. Behind these unqualified concepts, there lies the project of today’s capital’s strategies.

=====Identity Politics===== 

**Identity politics uniquely prevent successful alternatives to capitalism**
**Herod 7** (James, Columbia U graduate and political activist, “Getting Free” Pg. 33 JF)
The so-called new social movements, based on gender, racial, sexual, or ethnic identities, cannot destroy capitalism. AND Unfortunately, for the most part, their voices have been lost in all the clamor for admittance to the system by the majorities in their own movements.

=====Keynes===== 

**Keynesian interventions like the plan insulate capitalism from meaningful public contestation—the plan is mutually exclusive with the alternative.**
**Resnick and Wolff 10** — Stephen Resnick, Professor Emeritus and Helen Sheridan Memorial Scholar in the Department of Economics at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, holds a Ph.D. in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Richard D. Wolff, Professor of Economics Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Visiting Professor in the Graduate Program in International Affairs of the New School University, holds a Ph.D. in Economics from Yale University, 2010 (“The Economic Crisis: A Marxian Interpretation,” Rethinking Marxism, Volume 22, Issue 2, Available Online at http://socialistworker.org/blog/critical-reading/2011/12/26/marxist-explanation-crisis, Accessed 07-01-2012)
The Keynesian message remains what it always was: the state must save capitalism from itself. AND This effectively keeps from public debate any serious consideration of an alternative solution to capitalism's recurring crises: namely, transition to an economic system other than and different from capitalism.

=====LNG===== 

**LNG is a tool of global capitalism.**
**Zalik 8** — Anna Zalik, Associate Professor of Environmental Studies at York University, 2008 (“Liquefied Natural Gas and Fossil Capitalism,” Monthly Review, November, Available Online at http://monthlyreview.org/2008/11/01/liquefied-natural-gas-and-fossil-capitalism, Accessed 11-17-2012)
The contemporary ecological crisis places a new spin on the notion of the “resource curse,” evoking widespread concerns regarding hydrocarbon dependency. AND Fostered by corporate subsidies, the gas ultimately enters the more lucrative U.S. market, servicing that country’s hydrocarbon-accumulation model.3

**LNG is a band-aid for global fossil-fueled capitalism.**
**Zalik 8** — Anna Zalik, Associate Professor of Environmental Studies at York University, 2008 (“Liquefied Natural Gas and Fossil Capitalism,” Monthly Review, November, Available Online at http://monthlyreview.org/2008/11/01/liquefied-natural-gas-and-fossil-capitalism, Accessed 11-17-2012)
In the face of such resource sovereignty movements in the Global South, the movement of LNG from Nigeria to a terminal in Mexico—for U.S. consumption—is an example of the industry’s attempt to resolve the crises associated with on-going hydrocarbon extractionAND As a global “band-aid” for fossil capitalism, the costs and complications associated with LNG thus attract increasing public scrutiny and critique.

=====Postmodernism===== 

**The affirmative’s postmodern approach transforms material oppression into pure textuality—this ensures the triumph of global capitalism.**
**Red Collective 1** — The Red Collective, an international cadre of revolutionary Marxists, 2001 (“Revolution as Seduction, Pedagogy as Therapy, and the Subject is Always ‘Me’,” The Red Critique, Issue 1, Spring, Available Online at http://www.redcritique.org/spring2001/revolutionasseduction.htm, Accessed 08-12-2008)
The oscillations, standlessness, and opportunism of the left now is justified by appeal to some very right-wing theories that ultimately derive from Nietzsche, Heidegger and their latter-day students such as Derrida, Nancy, and deMan. AND In order to put an end to inside/outside and all other social binaries (man/woman; straight/queer; rich/poor; white/black;…) we argue that class should be overthrown and that, in order to do so at this stage of historical struggle, the gap between binaries should be heightened and their underlying contradictions brought to a crisis, not simply textualized and made invisible.

=====Ranciere===== 

**Ranciere’s vision of politics prevents material struggles against capitalism**
Peter **Hallward**, Professor of Modern European Philosophy at Middlesex University, **2005** (“Jacques Ranciere and the Subversion of Mastery,” Paragraph, Volume 28, Issue 1, March, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Academic Search Premiere, p. 40-41)
The value of Ranciere's intervention literally speaks for itself in precisely this sense. AND The risk is that Ranciere's egalitarianism, like Schiller's aesthetic play, might remain confined to the 'unsubstantial kingdom of the imagination'.

**Ranciere’s egalitarianism is fundamentally anti-political—it privileges discursive strategies at the expense of material political struggles**
Voyou **Désœuvré**, philosophy blogger, **2010** (“Jacques Rancière’s neoliberal pedagogy,” July 12th, Available Online at http://blog.voyou.org/2010/07/12/jacques-rancieres-neoliberal-pedagogy/, Accessed 02-16-2011)
That a supposed egalitarianism ends up underwriting a marked authoritarianism is consistent with a more general failing of Rancière’s work, which is that his radicalism seems to be limited to that of early 19th century republicanism. AND What’s missing from Rancière is an understanding of a social revolution which would involve a genuine reconfiguration, rather than a shuffling of appearances: a political movement where “the content goes beyond the phrase.”

=====Surface Transportation Infrastructure===== 

**The affirmative props up a neoliberal transportation policy that builds surface transportation instead of public transportation—the impact is socio-spacial racist segregation**
Farmer 11 [Stephanie, Sociology @ Roosevelt, “Uneven public transportation development in neoliberalizing Chicago”, USA Environment and Planning A 43]
Public transportation policy is one dimension of spatial restructuring deployed by entrepreneurial governments to create place-based competitive advantages for global capital. ANDHowever, in the neoliberal approach to urban planning and economic development, public transportation is but one of a constellation of institutions that create and reproduce spatialized racial inequalities.

(“Capitalism vs. the Climate,” Published Online on November 9, 2011 for The Nation, Available Online at http://www.thenation.com/article/164497/capitalism-vs-climate?page=full)
The deniers did not decide that climate change is a left-wing conspiracy by uncovering some covert socialist plot. AND But real climate solutions are ones that steer these interventions to systematically disperse and devolve power and control to the community level, whether through community-controlled renewable energy, local organic agriculture or transit systems genuinely accountable to their users.

**Progressive collective action key to solve climate change—free market makes warming inevitable**
**Klein 11**—Naomi Klein is an award-winning journalist, syndicated columnist, fellow at The Nation Institute and author of the international and New York Times bestseller The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism. In 2004 her reporting from Iraq for Harper’s Magazine won the James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism. Klein is a former Miliband Fellow at the London School of Economics and holds an honorary Doctor of Civil Laws from the University of King’s College. (“Capitalism vs. the Climate,” Published Online on November 9, 2011 for The Nation, Available Online at http://www.thenation.com/article/164497/capitalism-vs-climate?page=full)
So let’s summarize. AND There is simply no way to square a belief system that vilifies collective action and venerates total market freedom with a problem that demands collective action on an unprecedented scale and a dramatic reining in of the market forces that created and are deepening the crisis.

=====Cooperation===== 

**Capitalism makes competition inevitable—prevents genuine international cooperaiton**
**Spector 10** – Associate Professor of Sociology at Purdue University Calumet [Alan J Spector, “Neoliberal Globalization and Capitalist Crises in the Age of Imperialism” in “Globalization in the 21st Century: Labor, Capital, and the State on a World Scale”, pg 48-51]
How might this impact international relations? AND How the increased economic pressures of today will be resolved cannot easily be predicted, but history should caution us against predicting one hundred years of world peace, especially as today’s pressures and crises have become globalized in this shrinking world.

=====Disabilities===== 

**Cap is the root cause of social exclusion – plan can’t solve – turns the medical model**
**Kitchin 98** [Rob, Director of NIRSA and Chairperson of the Irish Social Sciences Platform, “'Out of place', 'Knowing one's place': Space, power and the exclusion of disabled people,” Disability & Society, June, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09687599826678 SS]
It is now generally recognised that disabled people are marginalised and excluded from `mainstream’ society. AND A Marxist or political economy approach is not, however, the only way to try and explain the bases of social exclusion.

**Disability is constructed to reproduce capitalism**
**Kitchin 98** [Rob, Director of NIRSA and Chairperson of the Irish Social Sciences Platform, “'Out of place', 'Knowing one's place': Space, power and the exclusion of disabled people,” Disability & Society, June, [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09687599826678]]]

AND Within this mode there are inherent contradictions that need to be exposed, so that unfair social relationships enshrined in the class system, and also expressed in the exclusion of disabled people, can be overthrown.

**Cap is the root cause of eugenic theory and the exclusion of PWD. Focus on production caused an exclusionary class of disabled persons because they weren’t “fit” to contribute to the industrial society**
**Russell* and Malhotra** 2 **- * writes on the political, social and economic aspects of disablement her socio-economic analysis has been published in the Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law, the Review of Radical Political Economy, the Journal of Disability Policy Studies, Disability & Society, Monthly Review, Disability Studies Quarterly, Left Business Observer, Real World Micro, 9th edition, Socialist Register 2002, and the Backlash Against the Americans with Disabilities Act: Reinterpreting Disability Rights (Corporealities, Discourses of Disability) University of Michigan Press, 2003.**is a Canadian disability rights activist and a member of the New Democratic Party.

The primary oppression of disabled persons (i.e. of people who could work, in a workplace that was accommodated to their needs) is their exclusion from exploitation as wage labourers.6 AND Whether or not codified into law, the sterilization of disabled people was common in a number of countries in the first half of the twentieth century, including Britain, Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden, and Canada.25

=====Economic Collapse===== 

**Capitalism makes economic collapse inevitable**
**Foster 10** — John Bellamy Foster, Professor of Sociology at the University of Oregon, Editor of the Monthly Review, 2010 (“The Great Financial Crisis—Three Years On,” Monthly Review: An Independent Socialist Magazine, Volume 62, Issue 5, October, Available Online at http://monthlyreview.org/2010/10/01/the-great-financial-crisis-three-years-on, Accessed 10-25-2011)
It is true that misguided neoliberal deficit-fighting economic policies during a slump will cause further damage to economic prospects. AND The sooner we begin to construct this qualitatively new system through our mass struggles, the better the long-term prospects for humanity and the earth will be.

=====Environment===== 

**This means we control terminal impact uniqueness—environmental collapse makes extinction inevitable—try or die for the alternative**
**Taylor 8** [Graeme Taylor is a social activist committed to constructive global transformation and the coordinator of BEST Futures, a project supporting sustainable solutions through researching how societies change and evolve, Evolution's Edge: The Coming Collapse and Transformation of Our World, Pomegranate Press, 2008, ISBN: 9781550923810, EBrary, pg. 117-8]
The real bottom line is not financial profits but survival, and our survival is utterly dependent on our environments. AND When they can’t meet their essential needs, they weaken and become increasingly dysfunctional and incapable of managing stress.

**Capitalism destroys the environment—data proves**
**Visser 10** (“From the Age of Greed to the Age of Responsibility” Wayne is Senior Associate at the University of Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership www.waynevisser.com/chapter_age_responsibility.pdf)
So this begs the question: is capitalism itself fundamentally flawed? AND They are basically punters with no particular interest in the horse that they’re backing, as long as it wins’.

**Capitalism protects pollution in the name of growth**
**Smith 11** — Richard Smith, Research Associate at the Institute for Policy Research & Development in London, holds a Ph.D. from the University of California-Los Angeles, 2011 (“Green capitalism: the god that failed,” Real-World Economics Review, Issue 56, Available Online at http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue56/Smith56.pdf, Accessed 10-19-2011, p. 116)
2. Second, no capitalist government on earth can impose “green taxes” that would drive the coal industry or any other industry out of business, or even force major retrenchments by suppressing production because, among other important reasons, given capitalism, this would just bring on recession and mass unemployment if not worse. This means the carbon tax strategy to stop global warming is a non-starter. And without green taxes, the entire green capitalist project collapses.

**Expansion makes a laundry-list of ecological crises inevitable**
**Foster 9** (John Bellamy, Professor of Sociology at University of Oregon, “The Paradox of Wealth: Capitalism and Ecological Destruction”, November 09, http://monthlyreview.org/2009/11/01/the-paradox-of-wealth-capitalism-and-ecological-destruction)
In the Oh shit era, the debate, McKibben says, is over. AND The planetary ecological crisis is increasingly all-encompassing, a product of the destructive uncontrollability of a rapidly globalizing capitalist economy, which knows no law other than its own drive to exponential expansion.

=====Ethics===== 

**Capitalism objectifies our relationship to the other—a-priori ethical obligation to reject**
**Morgareidge 98**—Associate Professor of Philosophy at Lewis and Clark College (Clayton, “Why Capitalism is Evil”, Radio Active Philosophy, Lewis and Clark Educational Papers, http://legacy.lclark.edu/~clayton/commentaries/evil.html)
Well, what is the foundation of moral life? AND Only when the end of capitalism is on the table will ethics have a seat at the table.

=====Keynes===== 

**The critique turns the case: capitalism ensures the rollback of Keynesian interventions while cementing class oppression—empirically proven.**
**Wolff 10** — Richard D. Wolff, Professor of Economics Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Visiting Professor in the Graduate Program in International Affairs of the New School University, holds a Ph.D. in Economics from Yale University, 2010 (“The Keynesian Revival: a Marxian Critique,” Alternate Routes: A Journal of Critical Social Research, October 23rd, Available Online at http://www.rdwolff.com/content/keynesian-revival-marxian-critique, Accessed 07-01-2012)
This Marxian theory begins from the historical observations summarized in this paper’s first paragraph.[5] AND Macro-level efforts to control and constrain capitalism’s instability failed because of the capitalists’ continued appropriation and politically effective distributions of the surpluses produced inside enterprises.

=====Poverty===== 

**Capitalism necessitates structural poverty—means that their internal-link to their terminal impact is inevitable—even if they resolve all of neoliberalism, corporations will still exploit the poor**
**Magdoff and Foster 10** (What Every Environmentalist Needs to Know About Capitalism Fred Magdoff s professor emeritus of plant and soil science at the University of Vermont in Burlington and a director of the Monthly Review Foundation and John Bellamy Foster is editor of the independent socialist magazine Monthly Review and professor of sociology at the University of Oregon in Eugene. Monthly Review, March 2010)
The characteristics of capitalism discussed above—the necessity to grow; AND The production of great wealth and, at the same time great poverty, within and between countries is not coincidental— wealth and poverty are likely two sides of the same coin.

**Systemic harms outweigh their probabilistic internal-link chains—you are 100% sure that capitalism causes four out of five people to die because of poverty—this means you multiply the magnitude of our extinction scenarios by five because only socialism can provide terminal impact uniqueness for all lives lost due to poverty**
**Magdoff and Magdoff 5** (Approaching Socialism Fred is a professor emeritus of plant and soil science at the University of Vermont in Burlington and a director of the Monthly Review Foundation; Harry worked for the United States Department of Commerce http://monthlyreview.org/2005/07/01/approaching-socialism)
Capitalism, with a number of political variations, has produced more goods, inventions, new ideas, and technological advances than in all of previous history. AND The estimate that 100,000 Iraqis have died as a result of the U.S. invasion gives some idea of the magnitude of the disaster that has fallen on that nation.

=====War===== 

**Capitalism makes war inevitable—excess capital is invested in the military—used to open new markets**

By the early twenty-ﬁrst century, global capitalism was in crisis. AND I trust my reasons for rejecting such an argument have been made clear in this critical article.

We must understand the reality of our present lawless world, where corporate driven military might unleashes pre-emptive wars, invasions and occupations and the UN system stands paralyzed , its Charter disregarded , the Treaties and conventions signed and ratified , flouted at every step . AND The unlimited quest for establishing monopoly over the planet earth’s resources and markets , has led the world to witness unending wars , sometimes referred to as ‘long wars’ , if that phrase makes it seem less destructive , and the unending pursuit of weapon platforms , for attaining ‘full spectrum dominance’ and the ‘Strategic Defense Initiative’ (SDI ) or the Star Wars initiated by the ‘free market’ of the Reagan administration and Thatcherism , accelerating the death and destruction that we have witnessed , all across the globe be it in Angola , Congo, Somalia, Afghanistan , Iraq , Palestine , Central and Latin America , Yugoslavia , Lebanon , Gaza and earlier in Korea, Vietnam and Cambodia among other countries with the UN Security Council in some cases acquiescing and even assisting .

**Capitalism is collapsing—transition is inevitable.**
**Wallerstein 11** — Immanuel Wallerstein, Senior Research Scholar in the Sociology Department at Yale University, recipient of the Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award from the American Sociological Association, holds a Ph.D. from Columbia University, 2011 (“Modern capitalism has reached the end of its rope,” Transcript of comments made to RT News, October 4th, Available Online at http://rt.com/news/end-capitalism-system-replace-999/, Accessed 10-25-2011)
Modern capitalism has reached the end of its rope. AND And we are in transition to another system and, in fact, the real political struggle that is going on in the world that most people refuse to recognize is not about capitalism – should we have or should we not have it – but about what should replace it.

**But, the our alternative vision of democratic socialism is critical for effective transition**
**Lebowitz 5** — Michael A. Lebowitz, Emeritus Professor of Economics at Simon Fraser University (Canada), 2005 (“The Knowledge of a Better World,” Monthly Review: An Independent Socialist Magazine, Volume 57, Issue 3, July-August, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Academic Search Elite, p. 67)
The most immediate obstacle, though, is the belief in TINA, i.e., that there is no alternative. AND For this reason, the battle of ideas is essential.

=====AT: Capitalism Inevitable===== 

**Capitalism confines our thinking—it is only inevitable until we challenge it.**
**Akhtar 6** — Aasim Sajjad Akhtar, Professor of Colonial History and Political Economy at the Lahore University of Management Sciences and political activist with the People’s Rights Movement, 2006 (“The Professionalization of Political Culture,” Capitalism Nature Socialism, Volume 17, Number 3, September, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Routledge Journals, p. 88-89)
There can be little doubt that the miseries faced by the working people of the world today can only be transcended by confronting the system that (re)produces them, and this confrontation will only take place if working people believe they can beat the system. AND In any case, it may well be the overwhelming destructiveness of the system that impels us to consider how to beat it.

=====AT: Transition Wars===== 

**Empirically, withdrawal causes non-violent transitions—Soviet Union, apartheid regime, and berlin wall prove**
**Trainer, 2K** [Ted Trainer, Visiting Fellow in the Faculty of Arts at the University of New South Wales, 2000, “Where are we, where do we want to be, how do we get there?,” Democracy & Nature, Volume 6, Number 2, July, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Academic Search Complete]
It should also be recognised that sometimes radical change seems to occur without any overt conflict. AND But before that it is quite likely that capitalism will enjoy another period of boom.

===Climate <span style="font-family: sans-serif; text-align: start;">Catastrophism</span>=== 

**First, the affirmative’s apocalyptic framing of climate change results in denial and despair, undermining the political will to act.**
**Foust et al. 8** [Christina R. Foust, Assistant Professor in the Department of Human Communication Studies at the University of Denver, et al., with William O. Murphy, Doctoral Student and Graduate Teaching Instructor in the Department of Human Communication Studies at the University of Denver, and Chelsea Stow, Doctoral Student and Graduate Teaching Instructor in the Department of Human Communication Studies at the University of Denver, 2008, “Global Warming and Apocalyptic Rhetoric: A Critical Frame Analysis of US Popular and Elite Press Coverage from 1997-2007,” Paper Submitted to the Environmental Communication Division of the National Communication Association Convention in San Diego, November 20th, Available Online at http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p260125_index.html, Accessed 03-18-2009, p. 22-23]
Elements of an apocalyptic frame could be said to exist in most of the articles we read, though all elements were not present in each article. AND By agreeing with the prophesies, “believers” feel a sense of control over the situation because they are “right,” not necessarily because they are taking collective and personal steps to resolve the issue.

**Second, this turns and outweighs the case—catastrophic climate reps justify to environmental destruction.**
**Crist 7** [Eileen Crist, Associate Professor of Science and Technology in Society at Virginia Tech University, 2007, “Beyond the Climate Crisis: A Critique of Climate Change Discourse,” Telos, Volume 141, Winter, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Telos Press, p. 33-36]
While the dangers of climate change are real, I argue that there are even greater dangers in representing it as the most urgent problem we face. ANDBut while technologically preempting the worst of climate change may temporarily avert some of those losses, such a resolution of the climate quandary will not put an end to—will barely address—the ongoing destruction of life on Earth.

**The alternative is to replace the affirmative’s apocalyptic framing of climate change with alternative frames that emphasize human agency and responsibility. Vote negative to productively frame climate change.**
**Foust et al. 8** [Christina R. Foust, Assistant Professor in the Department of Human Communication Studies at the University of Denver, et al., with William O. Murphy, Doctoral Student and Graduate Teaching Instructor in the Department of Human Communication Studies at the University of Denver, and Chelsea Stow, Doctoral Student and Graduate Teaching Instructor in the Department of Human Communication Studies at the University of Denver, 2008, “Global Warming and Apocalyptic Rhetoric: A Critical Frame Analysis of US Popular and Elite Press Coverage from 1997-2007,” Paper Submitted to the Environmental Communication Division of the National Communication Association Convention in San Diego, November 20th, Available Online at http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p260125_index.html, Accessed 03-18-2009, p. 24-25]
In conclusion, we hope to inspire more scholarship in the spirit of Moser and Dilling’s (2007) call for a greater inter-disciplinary conversation on climate change. AND Through a less tragic, more productive framing of the issues of climate change, we may expand the common ground needed to build a political will for dealing with climate change.

====1NC Shell==== 

**FIRST—we control uniqueness – the world is getting better in the status quo because of progressive social change.**
Stephen Eric Bronner, Distinguished Professor of Political Science and a Member of the Graduate Faculty in Comparative Literature and German Studies at Rutgers University, 2004 (Reclaiming the Enlightenment: Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement, Published by Columbia University Press, ISBN 9780231126090, p. xi)
Humanity is not in the past, but rather in the making. AND Cynicism always comes cheap. The real challenge lies in recognizing how the "system," which was never as "totally administered" as many would like to think has been changed for the better through social action inspired by the Enlightenment.

**SECOND—engagement with the political sphere is crucial to give meaning to theory – the affirmative’s abandonment of Enlightenment politics perpetuates oppression.**
Stephen Eric Bronner, Distinguished Professor of Political Science and a Member of the Graduate Faculty in Comparative Literature and German Studies at Rutgers University, 2004 (Reclaiming the Enlightenment: Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement, Published by Columbia University Press, ISBN 9780231126090, p. xii-xiii)
Enlightenment intellectuals provide an analogy for what contemporary intellectuals should strive to accomplish and a model of how to combat oppressive institutions, unjustifiable privileges, and anachronistic cultural practices. AND If philosophy really has been an expression of what Novalis termed "transcendental homelessness," which I doubt, then perhaps it is time to confront the philosophical with the political and, finally, for the prodigal to return home.

**SPECIFICALLY—Zizek lacks a practical political agenda—the 1AC was delivered without reference to the kind of society the affirmative seeks or the practical means by which to realize it.**
Andrew Robinson, Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Politics at the University of Nottingham, and Simon Tormey, Professor of Politics and Critical Theory at the University of Nottingham, 2004 (“Zizek Is Not A Radical,” an earlier version of an article that appears in Thesis Eleven, Available Online at http://homepage.ntlworld.com/simon.tormey/articles/Zizeknotradical.pdf, Accessed 01-20-2009)
Zizek does not offer much by way of a positive social agenda. AND How is a now 'impossible' model of class struggle be transformed into a politics relevant to the present period?

**AND—this makes the affirmative an empty gesture—an analysis of historical revolutions reveals the importance of engagement with tangible political programs in order to bring about meaningful change.**
Andrew Robinson, Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Politics at the University of Nottingham, and Simon Tormey, Professor of Politics and Critical Theory at the University of Nottingham, 2004 (“Zizek Is Not A Radical,” an earlier version of an article that appears in Thesis Eleven, Available Online at http://homepage.ntlworld.com/simon.tormey/articles/Zizeknotradical.pdf, Accessed 01-20-2009)
As useful as such a reading is, this is not the Zizek who emerges on closer examination. AND The transition from this 'wasteland of the suicide and the solitary killer' to revolutionary politics requires the repetition of negation in a different register,152 connected to a positive project to change the world and relying on the imaginaries Zizek denounces, the carnival spirit and the ability to dream.153

**HOWEVER—this does not absolve the affirmative of their responsibility for the consequences of their radical gesture – to embrace Zizek’s politics is to embrace the worst forms of barbarism in human history.**
Johann **Hari**, award-winning journalist and playwright, Columnist for the Independent, **2007** (“Pseud's corner,” The New Statesman, April 30th, Available Online at http://www.newstatesman.com/film/2007/04/slavoj-zizek-intellectual, Accessed 01-20-2009)
To the academic world's small population of postmodernists, Slavoj Zizek - a shambling, rambling Slovenian philosopher - is a folk hero. AND In the end, they leave us nothing but a theory-clown with bloody tears.

**AND—this results in the death of hope – to accept that the “radical act” of the 1ac is the best we can do is to settle for callous inhumanity and the continuation of status quo oppression.**
Andrew **Robinson**, Ph.D. in Political Theory at the University of Nottingham, **2005** (“The Political Theory of Constitutive Lack: A Critique,” Theory & Event, Volume 8, Issue 1, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Project Muse)
Zizek's anti-capitalism has won him friends in leftist circles, but the capitalism to which he objects is not the capitalism of classical Marxist critique. AND Lacanian theory tends, therefore, to produce an "anything goes" attitude to state action: because everything else is contingent, nothing is to limit the practical consideration of tactics by dominant elites.

**ULTIMATELY—cynicism is the death of effective politics – by foreclosing hope, the affirmative prevents the realization of a better world. Only embracing hope and taking tangible steps to improve the status quo can effectively overcome the debilitating effects of cynicism and despair.**
Dr. Henry A. **Giroux**, Global Television Network Chair in Communication Studies at McMaster University, **2005** (“Translating the Future and the Promise of Democracy,” Address to Convocation of Memorial University of Newfoundland, Gazette, Volume 37, Number 15, June 9th, Available Online at http://www.mun.ca/marcomm/gazette/issues/vol37no15/convocation13.php, Accessed 12-02-2006)
As you well know, the futures we inherit are not of our own making, but the futures we create for generations of young people who follow us arise out of our ability to imagine a better world, recognize our responsibility to others, and define the success of a society to the degree that it can address the needs of coming generations to live in a world in which the obligations of a global democracy and individual responsibility mutually inform each other. AND To quote Bono, a rock star with a political sensibility, “this is a time for bold measures. This is the country, and you are the generation.” Thank you.

**Instead of succumbing to the siren call of the 1AC’s pessimism, we advocate that the judge endorse an alternative approach in which our role as scholars is to actively prefigure—and construct in actuality—alternative social forms.**

**The goal of our scholarship should be to bring into existence the change we seek, not to heroically isolate ourselves from the ideological order. This political strategy is mutually exclusive with the affirmative’s in every way—the role of the ballot is to choose the superior option.**
Andrew **Robinson**, Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Politics at the University of Nottingham, **and** Simon **Tormey**, Professor of Politics and Critical Theory at the University of Nottingham, **2004** (“Zizek Is Not A Radical,” an earlier version of an article that appears in Thesis Eleven, Available Online at http://homepage.ntlworld.com/simon.tormey/articles/Zizeknotradical.pdf, Accessed 01-20-2009)
Zizek's politics are not merely impossible, but potentially despotic, and also (between support for a Master, acceptance of pain and alienation, militarism and the restoration of order) tendentially conservative. AND Through enacting utopia, we have the ability to bring the 'no-where' into the 'now-here'.

**SECOND—the decision to engage politics is a prior question – the content of that engagement is secondary.**
Stephen Eric **Bronner**, Distinguished Professor of Political Science and a Member of the Graduate Faculty in Comparative Literature and German Studies at Rutgers University, **2004** (Reclaiming the Enlightenment: Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement, Published by Columbia University Press, ISBN 9780231126090, p. x)
Enlightenment intellectuals may have laced their political engagement with drama, but they never fell into the trap of demanding all or nothing. AND In keeping with the decline of radical political parties, and the identification of resistance with the expression of subjectivity, the Enlightenment has been subjected to a new metaphysical form of "immanent" critique. Its political legacy has thus become a secondary concern.

====2NC—Overidentification Link==== 

**Overidentification is politically moronic. Zizek can’t present a non-fictional example because all of them would be co-opted by stronger political forces.**
Kripa 4 — Henry Krips, university of pittsburgh “Couching Politics: Zizek’s Rules for Radicals,” Psychoanalysis, Culture, and Society, 9, 2004, pg. questia
Zizek justifies his equivocation between these two apparently different sorts of political concerns, by claiming that they "intersect". AND In doing so, I turn in more detail to the work of Alinsky.

====AT: “That’s Not Our Zizek”==== 

**Zizek’s distinction between his politics and bad politics is utterly nonsensical—don’t be fooled by rhetorical tricks that attempt to paper over the violence of the affirmative’s political philosophy.**
Andrew **Robinson**, Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Politics at the University of Nottingham, **and** Simon **Tormey**, Professor of Politics and Critical Theory at the University of Nottingham, **2004** (“Zizek Is Not A Radical,” an earlier version of an article that appears in Thesis Eleven, Available Online at http://homepage.ntlworld.com/simon.tormey/articles/Zizeknotradical.pdf, Accessed 01-20-2009)
How does Zizek distinguish his 'leftist' politics from 'rightist' alternatives which would equally meet the formal criteria of an Act? AND Furthermore, if the authenticity of an Act is dependent on an empirical assessment of where the actual social void is, then Zizek's account of the Act as the assertion of a Truth over and against the facts is undermined.

====2NC—Violence/Fascism Link/Impact==== 

**Zizek’s apologists are wrong – his politics embrace mass violence and fascism.**
Adam **Kirsch**, Senior Editor at The New Republic, **2008** (“The Deadly Jester,” The New Republic, December 3rd, Available Online at http://www.tnr.com/story_print.html?id=097a31f3-c440-4b10-8894-14197d7a6eef, Accessed 11-18-2008)
That sentence is a remarkable moment in Zizek's writing. AND I hope so, because the idea that they can hear him without recoiling from him is too dismal, and frightening, to contemplate.

====2NC—Truth Link/Impact==== 

**Turn—Truth:**
**A. Zizek doesn’t believe in “truth” – embracing his politics leaves us without the ability to make or test truth claims.**
Andrew **Robinson**, Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Politics at the University of Nottingham, **and** Simon **Tormey**, Professor of Politics and Critical Theory at the University of Nottingham, **2004** (“Zizek Is Not A Radical,” an earlier version of an article that appears in Thesis Eleven, Available Online at http://homepage.ntlworld.com/simon.tormey/articles/Zizeknotradical.pdf, Accessed 01-20-2009)
As becomes evident 'class struggle' is not for Zizek an empirical referent and even less a category of Marxisant sociological analysis, but a synonym for the Lacanian Real. AND A 'truth-effect' occurs whenever a work produces a strong emotional reaction, and it need not be identified with empirical accuracy: lies and distortions can have a truth-effect, and factual truth can cover the disavowal of desire and the Real.22

**B. This surrenders hope for effectively confronting all major impacts.**
Alan **Sokal**, Professor of Physics at New York University, **1996** (“A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies,” Lingua Franca, May/June, Available Online at http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9605/sokal.html, Accessed 09-09-2008)
Why did I do it? AND Nor can we combat false ideas in history, sociology, economics, and politics if we reject the notions of truth and falsity.
2NC—Alternative
Zizek’s focus on individual Acts renders the affirmative decisively conservative – only the alternative can produce real social change.
Andrew Robinson, Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Politics at the University of Nottingham, and Simon Tormey, Professor of Politics and Critical Theory at the University of Nottingham, 2004 (“Zizek Is Not A Radical,” an earlier version of an article that appears in Thesis Eleven, Available Online at http://homepage.ntlworld.com/simon.tormey/articles/Zizeknotradical.pdf, Accessed 01-20-2009)
Furthermore, despite Zizek's emphasis on politics, his discussion of the Act remains resolutely individualist – as befits its clinical origins. AND I also want freedom from people fit to take over'.93

====2NC—Practical Consequences Link/Impact==== 

**Turn—Practical Consequences:**
**Zizek's politics prevents real world change – details are key to build public support.**
Robin **Hahnel**, Professor of Economics at American University, **2007** (“Eco-localism: A Constructive Critique,” Capitalism Nature Socialism, Volume 18, Number 2, June, p. 63-65)
Some anti-capitalists advocate denouncing capitalism as the root source of many of today's problems. AND How best to organize a system of equitable cooperation is not a trivial intellectual problem, and [end page 64] the answers will not be obvious without a great deal of deliberation, which must take place before the answers are needed.

====2NC—Psychoanalysis Bad==== 

**Prefer our evidence—**
**A. Upholding traditional standards for evaluating argumentation is good – it is the only way to productively engage the world of ideas.**
Geoffrey Galt **Harpham**, President and Director of the National Humanities Center, **2003** (“Doing the Impossible: Slavoj Zizek and the End of Knowledge,” Critical Inquiry, Volume 29, Number 3, Spring, Available Online at http://www.uchicago.edu/research/jnl-crit-inq/issues/v29/v29n3.harpham1.html, Accessed 01-06-2009)
The standard format of argumentation is so deeply ingrained in academic culture that it generally goes unremarked. AND While this process cannot, of course, altogether eliminate flaws of observation, description, or reasoning, it does at least invite the scholarly conversation to continue, because conclusions arrived at in this way can either be challenged on the grounds of procedural flaws or can serve as the starting point for further investigation.

**B. Zizek violates the basic tenets of argumentation – subject their excerpts of his work to strict scrutiny – witty examples are not a reason to vote affirmative.**
Geoffrey Galt **Harpham**, President and Director of the National Humanities Center, **2003** (“Doing the Impossible: Slavoj Zizek and the End of Knowledge,” Critical Inquiry, Volume 29, Number 3, Spring, Available Online at http://www.uchicago.edu/research/jnl-crit-inq/issues/v29/v29n3.harpham1.html, Accessed 01-06-2009)
Zizek's work, by contrast, seems to be formed almost entirely of endgames in which the sense of conclusion, with its payoffs and rewards, is always present. AND Informed throughout by the spirit of conclusion, these units do not, in themselves, conclude, but simply gutter out at the end, like a sparkler; no sense of fairness attends the terminus and no invitation to further work by others is implied.

**Turn—Methodology:**
**A. Lacanian politics are premised upon a flawed methodology – the “constitutive lack” is non-falsifiable pscyho-babble that prefigures the outcome of lacanian analysis. Discard all evidence that relies on psychoanalytic theory to generate conclusions about politics.**
Andrew **Robinson**, Ph.D. in Political Theory at the University of Nottingham, **2005** (“The Political Theory of Constitutive Lack: A Critique,” Theory & Event, Volume 8, Issue 1, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Project Muse)
The theoretical underpinnings of political Lacanianism typically rely on a "postmodern" disdain for essentialism, grounds and teleology, and articulate wider belief in contingency (for instance, by emphasizing contemporaneity). AND Laclau in particular emphasizes his belief in the 'exhilarating' significance of the present69, hinting that he is committed to euphoric investments generated through the repetition of the same.

**B. Holding the affirmative to a rigorous evidentiary standard is key to effective decision-making – without subjecting empirical evidence to the scientific method, the conclusions of their authors should not be evaluated.**
Lee **Epstein**, Edward Mallinckrodt Distinguished University Professor of Political Science and Professor of Law at Washington University in St. Louis, and Gary King, Professor of Government at Harvard University and Senior Science Advisor in the Evidence and Information for Policy Cluster at the World Health Organization, **2002** (“Empirical Research and the Goals of Legal Scholarship: The Rules of Inference," University of Chicago Law Review (69 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1), Winter, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
At the same time, the current state of empirical legal scholarship is deeply flawed. AND These "rules" have an important place in legal studies, but not when the goal is to learn about the empirical world.

===Instrumental Rationality=== 

**A. Links**
**The Aff’s approach to transportation planning sticks with conventional models and processes – that boost instrumental, not communicative, rationality.**
**Willson ‘1** (Richard Willson is a professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, California State Polytechnic University, Transportation 28: 1–31, 2001 – http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf)
The paper opens by reviewing and critiquing the instrumental rationality model that is the espoused planning theory of the profession. AND Finally, instrumental rationality assumes that the actors in a planning process are autonomous individuals who refine their knowledge against universal principles, and that planning roles can be divided into various analysis, evaluation and decision-making tasks. In this model, planning activities focus on analytic issues such as modeling and forecasting, impact analysis and economic evaluation.

**Policy acting without prior, deep public dialogue is steeped in instrumental rationality. Plan and perm shatter social justice and true democracy.**
**Willson ‘1** (Richard Willson is a professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, California State Polytechnic University, Transportation 28: 1–31, 2001 – http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf)
Purpose of planning. The purpose of transportation planning continues to be to develop strategies for connecting people and goods with destinations. AND Accordingly, communicative rationality involves experimental approaches because developing the planning process is an explicit part of the planning activity.

**The alternative to instrumental and scientific rationality is communicative rationality. It unlocks solvency.**
**Willson ‘1** (Richard Willson is a professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, California State Polytechnic University, Transportation 28: 1–31, 2001 – http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf)
For planning, however, gridlock is not gridlock until we have defined it as a problem and decided to do something to address it. AND It reorients planning from a form of scientific, instrumental rationality to a form of reason based on consensual discussion.1

**Implications**
**First – Solvency is try-or-die for us – conventional paradigm can no longer succeed.**
**Willson ‘1** (Richard Willson is a professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, California State Polytechnic University, Transportation 28: 1–31, 2001 – http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf)
The “problem” of transportation planning increasingly requires a communicative rationality approach. AND Communicative rationality may help transportation planners understand and resolve the dichotomous way that they often think about the rational and political dimensions of their work.

**Second – Aff’s rationalist approach is epistemologically flawed. Their harm and solvency claims are rigged-games.**
**Willson ‘1** (Richard Willson is a professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, California State Polytechnic University, Transportation 28: 1–31, 2001 – http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf)
The theory of knowledge, or epistemology, that is implied by instrumental rationality is scientific objectivism. AND In short, political processes rarely “hold still” for the rigid and time-consuming methods of conventional rational planning.

**Without more-direct democracy, extinction is inevitable. Only the alt can spillover and ensure transition**
**Gare ‘3** Arran, Swinburne University social sciences professor, Swinburne University, Melbourne, Australia, Ph.D. from Murdoch University, "Beyond Social Democracy? Beyond Social Democracy?" Democracy and Nature, 9(3), Nov 2003, via EBSCO database
In the new order, the state’s role, along with a range of new institutional structures ranging from the local to the international level, is exclusively to create the stable framework for the efficient functioning of the market. AND The question then is whether people are prepared to struggle for democracy now, given that their failure to do so not only means accepting their subjugation and brutalization, but also the destruction of the ecological conditions of their existence.

**Independently, Social justice should be the debate’s top priority – it’s an obligation.**
**Nieutvenhuis ‘10** Prof Jan Nieutvenhuis, Dept of Education Management and Policy Studies, Faculty of Education, University of Pretoria, Acta Academica 2011: 43(1) – available at: http://up-za.academia.edu/JanNieuwenhuis/Papers/882363/Social_justice_in_education_today
Accept the geo-historical context of the struggle as something that must be reconciled with attempts to create social justice. ADN For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.

**Even if we shouldn’t always have deontology, social justice must be the top priority in transportation policy. This requires a shift from instrumental rationality.**

In this paper, the author argues that transport planning has become highly sciencitized discipline. AND I intend to close my discussion in this paper by suggesting that moral principles such as equity and by implication social justice must become the nerve center of transport planning practice and education, if this important specialization has to make any significant contribution to the most important exercise of nation building. Improving one or two intersections or roundabouts could never achieve these moral ends.

===Normativity=== 
====1NC Shell==== 

**There is no connection between the affirmative’s normative prescription and any practical worldly effect—the question “what should we do?” ignores that we are not in a position to “do” the plan.**
Pierre **Schlag**, Professor of Law at the University of Colorado, **1990** (“Normative and Nowhere to Go,” Stanford Law Review (43 Stan. L. Rev. 167), November, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
But then again, that is precisely one of my points. AND Yet despite its obvious desire to have worldly effects, worldly consequences, normative legal thought remains seemingly unconcerned that for all practical purposes, its only consumers are legal academics and perhaps a few law students – persons who are virtually never in a position to put any of its wonderful normative advice into effect. 32

**This role confusion makes us complicit with real pain and death—vote negative because the affirmative's pedagogical approach to debate is flawed.**
Pierre **Schlag**, Professor of Law at the University of Colorado, **1990** (“Normative and Nowhere to Go,” Stanford Law Review (43 Stan. L. Rev. 167), November, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
In fact, as a further step in this degeneration/development, it now appears that it is very difficult to discern any significant difference between normative legal thought and the operation, performance, reproduction, and proliferation of bureaucratic practices and institutions. AND There is nothing for him to do here – nothing he can do. He is a moral character in a world where the role of moral thought has become at best highly ambivalent, a normative thinker in a world where normative legal thought is already largely the bureaucratic logic of institutions.

Pa. L. Rev. 933), April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
1. Permission to Ignore Suffering
The history of organized religion shows that intense immersion in at least certain types of normative system is no guarantee against cruelty, intolerance or superstition. 83 AND Judges write with blood, 95 but normativity is the filter that prevents us from seeing this. It focuses our attention on abstraction, when it is particularity and real-world detail that alone move us. 96

Normativity not only anesthetizes powerful actors, making it easier for them to do their work, it can paralyze the rest of us, leading us to cooperate passively in our own mistreatment. AND Another car will come along. Staring at the headlights prevents the doe from seeing that problem, just as entering into platitudinous, scripted discourse with the various insurance [*958] adjusters of the world prevents us from appreciating our own dilemma.

**Thinking normatively predetermines outcomes—makes change impossible**
Pierre **Schlag**, Professor of Law at the University of Colorado, **1991** (“Normativity and the Politics of Form,” University of Pennsylvania Law Review (139 U. Pa. L. Rev. 801), April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
One question will no doubt recur to the reader throughout this article: "But what should we do?" AND What we're doing, of course, is normative legal thought.

**Consideration of normative questions hinders change—vote negative on presumption.**
Pierre **Schlag**, Professor of Law at the University of Colorado, **1991** (“Normativity and the Politics of Form,” University of Pennsylvania Law Review (139 U. Pa. L. Rev. 801), April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
Many legal thinkers understand this dramatic conflict in terms of an opposition between the "realities" of practice and the "ideals" of the legal academy. AND In part that is because this article puts in question the very coherence, meaningfulness, and integrity of the kinds of normative disputes and discussion that almost all of us in the legal academy practice.

====AT: Framework==== 

**There’s no advantage to their framework—talking about policy proposals doesn’t mean doing policy proposals.**
Pierre **Schlag**, Professor of Law at the University of Colorado, **1991** (“The Problem of the Subject,” Texas Law Review (69 Tex. L. Rev. 1627), June, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
In legal thought, the sterility of this approach is manifest in articles that exhort us to engage in choosing behavior while refraining from telling us what to choose. AND Whether such talk has any desired political effect depends on how the aesthetics of power have enabled and constituted this political value talk and on the context within which this political value talk is issued and heard (assuming it is heard at all).

**Their framework is a rigged game—it presumes that participants in the debate are politically empowered subjects capable of choosing between competing proposals when in fact we are not and the choices have already been made for us.**
Pierre **Schlag**, Professor of Law at the University of Colorado, **1991** (“The Problem of the Subject,” Texas Law Review (69 Tex. L. Rev. 1627), June, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
The Sartrean metaphysic constantly calls for individual subjects to recognize their responsibilities and to choose. AND By presupposing the authenticity of the Sartrean subject, critical legal thought has greatly underestimated the extent to which this "free" subject, in its very "freedom to choose," is already constructed to compulsively act out choosing behavior – regardless of whether the social, political, or rhetorical scene warrants or even enables a choice to be made at all.

**The critique turns all of their policy relevance and education arguments—normative legal thought is politically debilitating.**
Pierre **Schlag**, Professor of Law at the University of Colorado, **1991** (“The Problem of the Subject,” Texas Law Review (69 Tex. L. Rev. 1627), June, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
But the subject is a problem. AND Rather than contributing to our understanding or to the realization of the good or the right, all this normative argument simply perpetuates a false aesthetic of social life – one that prevents "us" 430 from even recognizing the sort of bureaucratic practices that constitute and channel our thought and action.

====AT: Permutation==== 

**Nesting DA—attempts to incorporate our criticism into the normative discourse neutralizes its effectiveness and inoculates normativity against challenges to its hegemony—supercharges our link.**
Pierre **Schlag**, Professor of Law at the University of Colorado, **1991** (“Normativity and the Politics of Form,” University of Pennsylvania Law Review (139 U. Pa. L. Rev. 801), April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
One of the classic ways the normative rhetoric extends and insulates itself from displacement is "nesting." ANDEven within the ostensibly destabilizing influences that comprise cls thought -- neo-Marxism, phenomenology, structuralism, deconstruction -- the most successful strains of contestatory thought have been those most configured in the image of rationalism: structuralism and Sartrean existentialism. 289

**Co-Option DA—it’s all or nothing—the permutation reinforces normativity.**
Richard **Delgado**, Charles Inglis Thomson Professor of Law at the University of Colorado, 1991 (“Moves,” University of Pennsylvania Law Review (139 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1071), April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
Move number six. AND All views that see law and legal scholarship as inherently, basically, fundamentally normative must be reconsidered. 30

**Prescription DA—tacking on a prescription for policy change to our criticism saps it of its effectiveness—voting negative is key to avoid colonization of our challenge to normativity.**
Pierre **Schlag**, Professor of Law at the University of Colorado, **1991** (“Normativity and the Politics of Form,” University of Pennsylvania Law Review (139 U. Pa. L. Rev. 801), April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
This mimetic repetition and successive embedding of the same rationalist normative rhetoric in different sectors of social life (the intellectual, the professional, and the social), occurs as our attention is focused on other matters – on prescriptions, recommendations, substance, conclusions, theories. AND Some challenges and some dislocations must simply be kept outside of the rationalist rhetorical system altogether.

===Positive Peace=== 

**The affirmative’s focus on war as an isolated event perpetuates militarism and turns case—crisis-based politics demobilizes resistance**
**Cuomo, 96** [Chris Cuomo, Ph.D., 1992, University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Philosophy University of Cincinnati Hypatia Fall 1996.Vol.11, Iss. 4; pg. 30]
In "Gender and `Postmodern' War," Robin Schott introduces some of the AND the face of what appears to be the inevitability of war and militarism.

**Our alternative is performative—criticizing the affirmative’s approach to peace opens up space for emancipatory politics.**
Pinar **Bilgin**, Associate Professor of International Relations at Bilkent University (Turkey), **2005** (“Conclusion,” Regional Security in the Middle East: A Critical Perspective, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415325498, p. 205-207)
Emphasising the mutually interactive relationship between intellectuals and social movements should not be taken to AND of a 'desired' future but is also cognisant of 'threats to the future'.

===Radical Orthodoxy Critique of the State=== 

====1NC—Radical Orthodoxy Critique==== 

**The affirmative expresses a moral demand for __state action__ to offer compassion and fulfill an obligation to the Other. This call to “make the state ethical” is a form of __state soteriology__ — the aff looks to the state for salvation. This faith in the state should be __rejected__ in favor of faith in the Eucharist.**
**__Cavanaugh 99__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” //Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology//, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 182-183)
//Humankind was created for communion, but is everywhere divided…Nevertheless, I think it is a useful exercise to consider in general terms the pathologies which modern states seem to share—especially that of atomization of the citizenry—and the common stories which serve to enact these pathologies.//

**There are __three disadvantages__ to state soteriology:**

**1. __Atomization__ — The state destroys __true connections__ between individuals.**
**__Cavanaugh 99__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” //Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology//, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 192-193)
Why has the state failed to save us? Let me outline the argument of this section in three points.
//The state mythos is based on a ‘theological’ anthropology which precludes any truly social process…The state can never truly integrate the individual and the group because there is nothing transcending the two-dimensional calculus of individual-aggregate through which individual and group are related.//

**2. Homogenization — The state obliterates Otherness.**
**__Cavanaugh 99__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” //Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology//, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 193-194)
//State soteriology has tried to unify humankind by incorporation into a body of a perverse sort…This signals not the acceptance but the obliteration of the identity of the other.//

**3. __Violence__ — The state is the __primary cause__ of violence and war.**
**__Cavanaugh 99__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” //Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology//, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 194)
//The state has promised peace but has brought violence…In a word, violence becomes the state’s religio, its habitual discipline for binding us one to another.//

**They can’t win __offense__ — defenses of the state lack __empirical grounding__.**
**__Cavanaugh 4__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 2004 (“Killing For The Telephone Company: Why The Nation-State Is Not The Keeper Of The Common Good,” //Modern Theology//, Volume 20, Issue 2, April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via EBSCOhost ATLA Serials, p. 243-244)
//In Christian social ethics the assumption is often made, with a minimum of examination, that the responsibility for promoting and protecting the common good falls to the state…Only in the conclusion will I make some brief comments on what this implies positively for Christian thinking and practice.//

**The alternative is __Eucharistic Anarchism__. This rejection of state soteriology is __mutually exclusive__ with the aff.**
**__Cavanaugh 99__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” //Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology//, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 194-195)
//If it is true that the modern state is but a false copy of the Body of Christ, then it should be obvious that state power is the last thing the Church should want…My comments—necessarily brief—will follow on the three points of the state mythos I addressed above.//

**The alternative __alone__ is better than the aff or permutation — three reasons:**

**1. It challenges the __fundamental distinction__ between “us” and “them”.**
**__Cavanaugh 99__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” //Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology//, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 195-196)
//The Eucharist defuses both the false theology and the false anthropology of will and right by the stunning ‘public’ leitourgia in which humans are made members of God’s very Body…As members of the Body, we then become nourishment for others—including those not part of the visible Body—in the [end page 195] unending trinitarian economy of gratuitous giving and joyful reception. 53 Property and dominium are thus radically questioned.//

**2. It overcomes the __dichotomy__ between center and periphery.**
**__Cavanaugh 99__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” //Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology//, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 196)
//The Eucharist aims to build the Body of Christ, which is not simply centripetal: we are united not just to God, as to the center, but to one another…Here we might apply Alan of Lille’s comment about absolute Being to the Body of Christ: it is an ‘intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere.’ 55//

**3. It breaks down the __boundaries__ separating people.**
**__Cavanaugh 99__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” //Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology//, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 196-197)
//The Eucharist transgresses national boundaries and redefines who our fellow-citizens are. Rousseau was right to note that communion among churches is a [end page 196] threat to the unity of the state…This practice is a sign of the peace which cannot be specified through the formal adjudication of contractual obligations, but can be constructed only in the direct encounter of human beings who consider themselves members of one another and of the Prince of Peace.//

====2NC/1NR—State Violence Impact==== 

**This is __the biggest impact__ — state violence __empirically__ outweighs.**
**__Lummis 6__** — C. Douglas Lummis, author, activist, retired professor of political science at Tsuda College in Tokyo, and Rajni Kothari Chair in Democracy at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, 2006 (“The Smallest Army Imaginable,” //Alternatives: Global, Local, Political//, Volume 31, Issue 3, July-September, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Academic Search Premier, p. 318-320)
//The right of belligerency is one part (along with police powers and judicial powers) of what Max Weber called “the right of legitimate violence,” the monopoly of which he took to be the defining characteristic of the modern state…Far from being the guarantor of public freedom and safety, the state with its monopoly of legitimate violence has become the greatest killer.//
====2NC/1NR—Alternate Solvency==== 

**The alt solves the case best — this evidence __proves the link__ and __beats the perm__.**
**__Cavanaugh 4__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 2004 (“Killing For The Telephone Company: Why The Nation-State Is Not The Keeper Of The Common Good,” //Modern Theology//, Volume 20, Issue 2, April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via EBSCOhost ATLA Serials, p. 266-269)
//The nation-state is neither community writ large nor the protector of smaller communal spaces, but rather originates and grows over against truly common forms of life…Nevertheless, the Church needs to take seriously its task of promoting spaces where participation in the common good of God's life can flourish.//

====2NC/1NR—They Say: “State Inevitable”==== 

**The state is __not__ inevitable — this is a __link__.**
**__Cavanaugh 4__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 2004 (“Killing For The Telephone Company: Why The Nation-State Is Not The Keeper Of The Common Good,” Modern Theology, Volume 20, Issue 2, April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via EBSCOhost ATLA Serials, p. 245-246)
//The word "state" is sometimes used loosely to refer to the political form through which a stable group of people is organized…The nation-state first arises in the eighteenth century, and becomes prevalent only in the nineteenth century and following.15//

====2NC/1NR—They Say: “State Good – Corporate Power”==== 

**The state __fuels__ corporate control, it doesn’t protect against it.**
**__Cavanaugh 4__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 2004 (“Killing For The Telephone Company: Why The Nation-State Is Not The Keeper Of The Common Good,” //Modern Theology//, Volume 20, Issue 2, April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via EBSCOhost ATLA Serials, p. 264-266)
//Understanding this apparently contradictory double movement is crucial to understanding the relationship of the nation-state to the process that has come to be called globalization…Nation-states may be resources for ad hoc resistance to the process of globalization, but in the long run, the prospects for resistance are undermined by the lack of autonomy of the political in the governance of nation-states.//
====2NC/1NR—Permutation==== 

**The permutation __maintains adherence to state soteriology__ — the mythos of state salvation is __mutually exclusive__ with the alternative.**
**__Cavanaugh 99__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” //Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology//, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 190)
//In the modern age, Christians have tended to succumb to the power of the state soteriology I have just sketched, and they have done so often on Christian grounds…It will be my task in this section of the essay to suggest that state soteriology offers a false unity and a false peace which are fundamentally at odds with the Christian story.//

**The alternative __alone__ is best — incorporating the state __fails__ and __distorts the Eucharist__.**
**__Cavanaugh 99__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” //Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology//, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 197-198)
//This brief display of a few central eucharistic themes is not intended to idealize the actual practice of the Eucharist in our divided churches…True peace depends not on the subsumption of this conflict, but on a recovered sense of its urgency.//


====2NC/1NR—Alternate Solvency==== 

**The alt solves the case best — this evidence __proves the link__ and __beats the perm__.**
**__Cavanaugh 4__** — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 2004 (“Killing For The Telephone Company: Why The Nation-State Is Not The Keeper Of The Common Good,” //Modern Theology//, Volume 20, Issue 2, April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via EBSCOhost ATLA Serials, p. 266-269)
//The nation-state is neither community writ large nor the protector of smaller communal spaces, but rather originates and grows over against truly common forms of life…Nevertheless, the Church needs to take seriously its task of promoting spaces where participation in the common good of God's life can flourish.//


====2NC/1NR—They Say: “We Change the State”==== 

**Their evidence relies on __Levinasian ethics__—we’ll impact turn. Reducing ethics to an encounter with the face of the Other prevents Eucharistic transcendence.**
**__Blond 98__** — Phillip Blond, Ph.D. Candidate in Theology in the Faculty of Divinity at the University of Cambridge and former Prize Fellowship in Philosophy at the New School for Social Research, 1998 (“Theology before philosophy,” //Post-Secular Philosophy: Between Philosophy and Theology//, Edited by Philip Blond, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415097770, p. 33-35)
//Since I have already raised certain questions about a phenomenological approach to theology, I will stay with those thinkers (Levinas and Marion) who in the collection attempt to approach transcendence via the phenomenological method…For the sublime fracture that Levinas proposes in order to overcome this atheistic world only functions, as we might expect, to confirm it.//

**Their argument also relies on the concept of “__towards__” — they view the state as something that is always moving //towards// ethics. __We critique this framing__.**
**__Rossi 97__** — Vincent Rossi, Eastern Orthodox Theologian at Rose Hill College and Founder of the Eleventh Commandment Fellowship, a Christian Environmental Organization, 1997 (“Liturgizing the World: Religion, Science and the Environmental Crisis in Light of the Sacrificial Ethic of Sacred Cosmology,” //Ecotheology//, Volume 5, Issue 3, July, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Academic Search Complete, p. 84)
//To repeat, and it bears repeating, the only principle that will save the world from suffering all the ecological plagues of the Apocalypse is sacrifice…'Towards' in the context of the environmental crisis is a peculiarly pernicious bit of self-deception because it allows us to postpone the only practice that offers a prayer of real progress in stemming the tide of ecological, psychological and cosmological self-destruction: sacrifice, voluntary renunciation as an ethical science.//

===Rodriguez PIK=== 

**Their contention that “infusing equality into the decision-making process is key to combat global destruction” situations their opposition to U.S. imperialism as something that is “out there”. This necessarily trades off with efforts to resist oppression here at home—the affirmative should be held responsible for their decision to frame the aff in this way.**

**Vote negative to reject this political framing. This is a floating PIC.**
Dylan **Rodriguez**, Professor and Chair of the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of California-Riverside, holds an M.A. <span class="GRcorrect">and</span> Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies from the University of California-Berkeley, **2008** (“Warfare and the Terms of Engagement,” Abolition Now!: Ten Years of Strategy and Struggle Against the Prison Industrial Complex, Edited by The CR10 Publications Collective, Published by AK Press, ISBN 1904859968, p. 93)
We are collectively witnessing, surviving, and working in a time of unprecedented state-organized human capture and state-produced physical/social/psychic alienation, AND when there are overlapping, and no less profoundly oppressive, declarations of and mobilizations for war in our very own, most intimate and nearby geographies of “home.”

**This impact outweighs the case by entrenching institutionalized dehumanization—vote negative to make this domestic warfare our starting point for resistance.**
Dylan **Rodriguez**, Professor and Chair of the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of California-Riverside, holds an M.A. <span class="GRcorrect">and</span> Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies from the University of California-Berkeley, **2008** (“Warfare and the Terms of Engagement,” Abolition Now!: Ten Years of Strategy and Struggle Against the Prison Industrial Complex, Edited by The CR10 Publications Collective, Published by AK Press, ISBN 1904859968, p. 94-97)
This time of crisis and emergency necessitates a critical examination of the political and institutional logics that structure so much of the US progressive left, AND Our non-profit left, in particular, seems content to engage in desperate (and usually well-intentioned) attempts to manage the casualties of domestic warfare, foregoing the urgency of an abolitionist praxis that openly, critically, and radically addresses the moral, cultural, and political premises of these wars.

===Taoism=== 

**Live in the present: the affirmative’s obsession with studying the past and predicting the future destroys its own benefits**
**Watts**, dean of the American Academy of Asian Studies and research fellow at Harvard University, **1951**
(Alan, The Wisdom of Insecurity, pg 34-6)
This is the typical human problem. The object of dread may not be an operation in the immediate future. AND If, then, we cannot live happily without an assured future, we are certainly not adapted to living in a finite world where, despite the best plans, accidents will happen, and where death comes at the end.

**Attachment is the root cause of suffering—rather than engage in perpetual action to satisfy our ego, we should endorse inaction in the face of suffering**
**Slabbert**, Taoist teacher and philosopher, **2001** (Jos, “Tao Te Ching: How to Deal With Suffering,” http://www.taoism.net/theway/suffer.htm)
All-encompassing Suffering is an all-encompassing phenomenon, and it includes forms of suffering the sufferer is not even aware of. ANDIt is almost as if the author of the Tao te Ching knew that to take suffering too seriously will only entrap one even more deeply in suffering. A light, delicate touch is needed. It is the way of acceptance and detachment.

**No one knows what is good and bad because no one has access to all rational information. Reject the aff’s judgments and endorse inaction, even if we lose all life on earth**
**Kirkland, 98** [Russell Kirkland, Associate Professor of Religion (and Asian Studies), “"Responsible Non-Action" In a Natural World: Perspectives from the Nei-Yeh, Chuang-Tzu, and Tao-Te Ching,” 1998, University of Georgia, http://kirkland.myweb.uga.edu/rk/pdf/pubs/ECO.pdf]
Why It Is Wrong to Resent Unexpected Changes In Chuang-tzu 18, we find two famous stories in which a man experiences a sudden and deeply personal transformation, a transformation that strikes others around him as deeply troubling.5 AND The Taoist lesson seems, in this regard, to be the same in each case: things happen, and some things cause us distress because we attach ourselves sentimentally to certain people, objects, and patterns of life; when those people, objects, or patterns of life take a sudden or drastic turn into a very different direction, a mature and responsible person calms his or her irrational emotions, and takes the morally responsible course of simply accepting the new state of things.

==Case Turns== 
===Capital Flight=== 

**Turn—Private investment capital is zero sum—a national infrastructure bank attracts capital from developing country markets**
**Pacific Standard** Oct 10, **2008** “Beyond the Gas Tax: Bring On the (Financing) Hybrids,” http://www.psmag.com/business-economics/beyond-the-gas-tax-bring-on-the-financing-hybrids-4186/
Given the current volatility of the equities market, the low interest rates of the government bond market and the risky nature of investments in corporate credit instruments and real estate, infrastructure is now seen as a “safe haven” for long-term investors, a senior bank official told us. AND In the meantime, we must devise other ways to supplement the inadequate stream of revenues from the gas tax.

**Turns the case—developing country investment prevents global economic collapse**
Justin Yifu **Lin and** Doerte **Doemeland**, January **2012** This paper is a product of the Office of the Chief Economist, Development Economics Vice Presidency, “Beyond Keynesianism: Global Infrastructure Investments in Times of Crisis,” Policy Research Working Paper 5940, World Bank, http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/01/10/000158349_20120110085008/Rendered/PDF/WPS5940.pdf
Although the financial crisis of 2008 officially came to an end in the United States in June 20092, its repercussions continue to be felt across the globe. AND The government could, however, use existing financial resources, technical assistance and improvements in policies and the institutional environment to make infrastructure projects more attractive for private investors.

===Credit Downgrade=== 
====1NC Shell==== 

**Absent fiscal discipline, Moody’s will downgrade US credit rating**
**Gongloff 11** Mark Gongloff, Wall Street Journal, 08/2/’11, [Moody’s Affirms US AAA Rating, http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2011/08/02/moodys-affirms-us-aaa-rating/] VN
Moody’s just came out and said, great job, USA, you get to keep your AAA rating…In assigning a negative outlook to the rating, Moody’s indicated, however, that there would be a risk of downgrade if (1) there is a weakening in fiscal discipline in the coming year; (2) further fiscal consolidation measures are not adopted in 2013; (3) the economic outlook deteriorates significantly; or (4) there is an appreciable rise in the US government’s funding costs over and above what is currently expected.

**Further downgrades cause T-bond flight—that creates a debt crisis which collapses the economy**
**Rowley 12** Charles Rowley, Professor Emeritus of Economics at George Mason University, 10/15/12, “Renewed threats to U.S. credit rating,” Charles Rowley’s blog, http://charlesrowley.wordpress.com/2012/06/15/renewed-threats-to-u-s-credit-rating/
If Moody’s downgrades and if S & P further downgrades U.S. credit ratings, this would move the United States out of the exclusive club of AAA-rated nations, and throw into question the privileged status of U.S. Treasury securities as a safe haven for global investors. Greece here we come.

====2NC Overview==== 

**Second downgrade is the tipping point—many investors are legally required to sell-off non-triple A assets—that terrifies investors**
**Dow Jones Newswires 10/11** Rob Curran (Reporter at Dow Jones Newswires, Dow Jones, 10/11, The Dow Jones Newswires)
JUST as Europe's sovereign [[#|debt]] storm is clearing up somewhat, investors see a day of reckoning for US debt on the horizon…The respite from the European bond-market storm - if there is a respite - may be brief.

**That collapse the global economy**
**Goldwein 11**—Marc Goldwein, senior policy analyst for the fiscal policy program at the New America Foundation and former Associate Director of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (also known as the Bowles-Simpson Commission), 8/11/11, “Drawing a AAA-Road Map for Post-Downgrade America,” The Atlantic, http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/08/drawing-a-aaa-road-map-for-post-downgrade-america/243463/
... Okay, Panic a Little If rating downgrades don't augur immediate crises, they tend to indicate trouble on the horizon…When that occurs, it is possible we could experience a global economic crisis akin to the financial crisis of 2009, except with no one available to bail out the U.S. government.

====2NC Uniqueness==== 

**Obama’s shown fiscal discipline—CBO reports prove spending will continue to fall**
**Baker 12** (Peter, “Obama More Conservative Than Hoover? Someone Thinks So,” 5-23-12,
<span style="color: windowtext;">[[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/obama-more-conservative-than-hoover-someone-thinks-so/]]</span>)
COLORADO SPRINGS — It’s not every day that a White House boasts of being more conservative than Herbert Hoover…Each president would like to assign blame for that to the other.

====CCS Link==== 

**If the plan only does demonstrations, than it doesn’t solve—costs are too high for companies to take the risk**
**Johnson 6-11** Steve, “Co-op Rep: EPA Off Base on Carbon,” http://www.ect.coop/public-policy-watch/energy-environment/electric-cooperative-epa-carbo-reduction-rule/45194
A Mid-Atlantic G&T official told a congressional panel that a federal carbon reduction standard impairs the plans of his cooperative and other electric utilities for future base load generation. AND ODEC has been working on carbon sequestration research, but Hudgins said the technology is unlikely to be commercially viable within a decade, as the agency insists.

**It’s cost prohibitive—plan costs trillions of dollars**
**Romm 10** – Senior Fellow at American Progress and Ph.D. in physics from MIT (Joe, “New study finds geologic sequestration ‘is not a practical means to provide any substantive reduction in CO2 emissions’” Center for American Progress April 27 2010 [[http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2010/04/27/205870/ccs-stunner-new-study-finds-geologic-sequestration-is-not-a-practical-means-to-provide-any-substantive-reduction-in-co2-emissions/]]) MLR
The fact is that the concerns laid out in the new study are not new ones. AND “Red flags should be going up everywhere when you talk about this amount of liquid being put underground.”

**Trigger Flip: Crowd Out—deficit spending crowds out private investment—interest payments cause higher taxes—creates a fiscal crisis**
**CBO 10** Congressional Budget Office, has produced independent, nonpartisan, timely analysis of economic and budgetary issues to support the Congressional budget process, 7/27/10, “Federal Debt and the Risk of a Fiscal Crisis,” Congressional Budget Office, http://www.cbo.gov/publication/21625
Although deficits during or shortly after a recession generally hasten economic recovery, persistent deficits and continually mounting debt would have several negative economic consequences for the United States…To restore investors confidence, policymakers would probably need to enact spending cuts or tax increases more drastic and painful than those that would have been necessary had the adjustments come sooner.

====2NC Overview==== 
**Yes, there is debt now, but this is a linear DA—government spending creates dead-weight losses—every dollar spent costs two dollars of private capital—takes out and turns their stimulus advantage**
**Edwards 11** Chris Edwards, B.A. and M.A. in economics, 9-20-11, Cato Institute <http://www.cato.org/publications/congressional-testimony/damaging-rise-federal-spending-debt>
Let's take a look at how federal spending damages the economy over the long-run…Thus, a $10 billion high-speed rail line would cost the private economy $20 billion or more.

===Earthquake (CCS Specific)=== 

**CCS triggers Earthquakes and those earthquakes destroy CO2 repositories – means aff can’t solve**
**Zoback and Gorelick 5/4/12** [Mark D. Zoback Professor at the Department of Geophysics at Stanford University, and Steven M. Gorelick Professor of Environmental Earth System Sciences at Stanford University, “Earthquake triggering and large-scale geological storage of carbon dioxide” Found on the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, May 4th, 2012 /SM]
Despite its enormous cost, large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) is considered a viable strategy for significantly reducing CO2 emissions associated with coal-based electrical power generation and other industrial sources of CO2 AND Because even small- to moderate-sized earthquakes threaten the seal integrity of CO2 repositories, in this context, large-scale CCS is a risky, and likely unsuccessful, strategy for significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

===Inflation=== 

**Inflation remains low but further stimulus will increase it—investor perception is on the brink.**
**Time Business 12** — Time Business, 2012 (“Fed Inflation Hawks Warn More Stimulus Could Fuel Prices,” Byline Sam Gustin, April 11th, Available Online at http://business.time.com/2012/04/11/fed-inflation-hawks-warn-more-stimulus-could-fuel-prices/, Accessed 06-30-2012)
Are inflation hawks preparing to take flight?...For now, they’ve been unable to sway the conventional wisdom. Hopefully, they won’t end up being canaries in the coal mine.

**Inflation tanks growth—investor perception negates stimulus benefits.**
**Volcker 11** — Paul A. Volcker, served as Chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987, worked for the federal government for over 30 years serving under John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan, 2011 (“A Little Inflation Can Be a Dangerous Thing,” New York Times, September 18th, Available Online at http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/opinion/a-little-inflation-can-be-a-dangerous-thing.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print, Accessed 06-30-2012)
So now we are beginning to hear murmurings about the possible invigorating effects of “just a little inflation.”…At a time when foreign countries own trillions of our dollars, when we are dependent on borrowing still more abroad, and when the whole world counts on the dollar’s maintaining its purchasing power, taking on the risks of deliberately promoting inflation would be simply irresponsible.

===Wage Deflation (NIB Specific)=== 

**Turn—plan causes outsourcing/wage deflation**
**Prestowitz 11** - president of the Economic Strategy Institute and writes on the global economy for FP (Clyde, “Where the jobs went”. July 11. http://prestowitz.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/07/11/where_the_jobs_went)
The idea of stimulus incorporated in the standard economic models is that it will create demand for goods and services produced in America and thereby drive investment in new factories and jobs to produce more of those goods and services. AND Until our economists and officials begin to wrestle with the need for the United States not only to stimulate its economy but to do so in ways that will lay the basis for America to increase its wealth-producing capacity and pay its way, they are likely to find themselves in a continuous state of shock.

==Impact Turns== 
===Advanced Manufacturing Bad=== 
====1NC—Advanced Manufacturing Bad==== 

**1. Turn—Efficiency: Their commitment to advanced manufacturing is just a commitment to automation and mass unemployment—turns the economy advantage and leads to massive amounts of income inequality.**
**Brain 3**—Marshall Brain is the founder of HowStuffWorks.com and was the host of the show “Factory Floor” which appeared on the National Geographic channel. (“Robotic Nation,” Published on Brain’s personal website in 2003, Available Online at http://marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm)
American society has no way to deal with a situation where half of the workers are unemployed. AND I believe that it is time to start rethinking our economy and understanding how we will allow people to live their lives in a robotic nation.

**This triggers catastrophic social collapse—it’s an existential risk.**
**Creamer 9** — Robert Creamer, political organizer, strategist, and author, owner of Strategic Consulting Group—a political consulting firm that works on many of the country’s most significant issue campaigns, married to Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, 2009 (“Why Growing Income Inequality Is Bad for America,” The Huffington Post, October 27th, Available Online at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-creamer/why-growing-income-inequa_b_335115.html, Accessed 10-27-2009)
4). Finally, increased income inequality is completely undemocratic. AND The undemocratic increase in the distribution of wealth and income is not only wrong. It is also dangerous to our future survival.

**2. Turn: Nanotech— molecular manufacturing leads to a nanotech arms race unconstrained by MAD—four reasons nano-weapons are different from nuclear weapons.**
**The CRN 8**—The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology is a non-profit independent research and advocacy think tank concerned with the major societal and environmental implications of advanced nanotechnology. (“Dangers of Molecular Manufacturing,” Originally Published on April 26, 2003 and most recently updated on February 7, 2008, Accessed on 2013-02-12, Available Online at http://www.crnano.org/dangers.htm)
Molecular manufacturing raises the possibility of horrifically effective weapons. AND It may also, by enabling many nations to be globally destructive, eliminate the ability of powerful nations to "police" the international arena. By making small groups self-sufficient, it can encourage the breakup of existing nations.

**3. Turn: Deterrence—Robotic warfare undermines MAD—it makes it easier not harder to justify going to war.**
**Singer 12**—Peter W. Singer is the director of the 21st Century Defense Initiative and a senior fellow in Foreign Policy at Brookings. Singer’s research focuses on three core issues: the future of war, current U.S. defense needs and future priorities, and the future of the U.S. defense system. Singer is the author of Wired for War: The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century. (“The Robotics Revolution,” Published on December 11, 2012 by The Brookings Institute, Available Online at http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/12/11-robotics-military-singer?rssid=LatestFromBrookings&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BrookingsRSS%2Ftopfeeds%2FLatestFromBrookings+%28Latest+From+Brookings%29)
And now we possess a technology that removes the last political barriers to war. AND Now, the technology opens up new possibilities, and new questions for our democracies.

**The assumptions about rationality that underlie deterrence are incorrect—miscalculation ensures breakdown and conflict.**
David **Krieger**, President of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Hawaii, **2K** (“The Irrationality of Deterrence: A Modern Zen Koan,” Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, April 7th, Available Online at http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2000/04/ 07_krieger_irrationality.htm, Accessed 01-20-2006)
The concept of deterrence, which underlies the nuclear weapons policies of the United States and other nuclear weapons states, presupposes human rationality in all cases. AND We don't always get our information straight, and we seldom have all of the facts.

====2NC—Efficiency Turn==== 

**Even if increasing efficiency in the abstract is good for society, given status quo economic realities it will only cause more suffering**
**Ford 11**—Martin Ford is the founder of a Silicon Valley-based software development firm and the author of the book The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future. He holds a computer engineering degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and a graduate business degree from the University of California, Los Angeles. (“Technology making jobs obsolete…,” Published on Econfuture on November 7, 2011, Available Online at http://econfuture.wordpress.com/2011/11/07/technology-making-jobs-obsolete/)
I also have never said that advancing technology, or job automation, is “a bad thing.” AND In time, people will default or debt service will leave them with little discretionary income to spend on other things — creating the risk of a deflationary spiral. I’ve written more about this in a previous post.

**A strong middle class is key to economic growth.**
**Konczal 12** — Mike Konczal, Fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, 2012 (“Why a Strong Middle Class Is Necessary For Growth,” Next New Deal—the blog of the Roosevelt Institute, May 18th, Available Online at http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/why-strong-middle-class-necessary-growth, Accessed 06-12-2012)
Heather Boushey and Adam S. Hersh from the Center for American Progress have a new paper out, "The American Middle Class, Income Inequality, and the Strength of Our Economy: New Evidence in Economics," that summarizes the case for why inequality can damage the economy. AND All of these have consequences for our economy.

====2NC—Nanotech==== 

**Grey Goo outweighs extinction—causes destruction of the universe**
Howard **Rheingold**, (Appointed lecturer at Stanford, Editor Emeritus of Whole Earth Review, Utne Magazine Independent Press Award, widely recognized as a leading authority on social implications of technology), Fall, 1992, Whole Earth Review, www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1510/is_n76/ai_12635777
It looks as if something even more powerful than thermonuclear weaponry is emanating from that same, strangely fated corner of New Mexico where nuclear physicists first knew sin. AND The entire story of life on earth thus far might be just the wetware prologue to a longer, larger, drier tale, etched in silicon rather than carbon, and blasted to the stars -- purposive spores programmed to seek, grow, evolve, expand. That's what a few people think they are on the verge of inventing.

**Nano-tech turns hegemony and the economy**
**Gubrud 97** (Mark Avrum, Superconductivity Researcher at U of MD. 1997. “Nanotechnology and International Security.” Foresight 5th Conference Paper)
Whereas the perfection of nuclear explosives established a strategic stalemate, advanced molecular manufacturing based on self-replicating systems, or any military production system fully automated by advanced artificial intelligence, would lead to instability in a confrontation between rough equals. AND Accompanied by economic upheaval, general uncertainty and disputes over the future of major resources and of humanity itself, such a runaway crisis would likely erupt into large-scale rearmament and warfare well before another technological plateau was reached.

====2NC­—Deterrence==== 

**A subpoint: Irrationality – our Krieger evidence smokes theirs – deterrence relies on the theory that humans will always act in their own interests – this blind faith in human rationality is IRRATIONAL. Humans are subject to emotions and passions which ensure rationality will inevitably breakdown. More evidence.**
David **Krieger**, President of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Hawaii, **2K** (“The Irrationality of Deterrence: A Modern Zen Koan,” Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, April 7th, Available Online at http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2000/04/ 07_krieger_irrationality.htm, Accessed 01-20-2006)
Even more detrimental to the theory of deterrence is irrationality. AND What if he believes he has nothing more to lose, like a nuclear-armed Hitler in his bunker? So much for deterrence!

**Their defense of drones extends biopolitical rationality and renders whole populations calculable.**
**Wilcox 9** — Lauren Wilcox, Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at the University of Minnesota, holds a M.Sc. in Political Science from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a B.A. in International Studies and Political Science from Macalester College, 2009 (“Body Counts: The Politics of Embodiment in Precision Warfare,” Paper presented to the American Political Science Association, December 11th, Available Online at http://www.polisci.umn.edu/pdf/Body%20Counts%20Theory%20Colloquium.doc, Accessed 09-22-2011)
In discourse of precision warfare, the deaths of civilians occupy a substantial, if not crucial, role. AND As one proponent writes, “[Precision munitions] should be our weapon of choice because it is the most discriminate, prudent and risk-free weapon in our arsenal,” (Melinger 2001).

===Growth Good=== 

**Economic decline increases the risk of war—strong statistical support.**
**Royal 10** — Jedidiah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, M.Phil. Candidate at the University of New South Wales, 2010 (“Economic Integration, Economic Signalling and the Problem of Economic Crises,” Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, Edited by Ben Goldsmith and Jurgen Brauer, Published by Emerald Group Publishing, ISBN 0857240048, p. 213-215)
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict. AND As such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.

**And—economic growth is vital to effectively confront every global problem—additional resources are needed.**
**Silk 93** — Leonard Silk, Distinguished Professor of Economics at Pace University, Senior Research Fellow at the Ralph Bunche Institute on the United Nations at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and former Economics Columnist with the New York Times, 1993 (“Dangers of Slow Growth,” Foreign Affairs, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
Like the Great Depression, the current economic slump has fanned the firs of nationalist, ethnic and religious hatred around the world. AND But economic growth – and growth alone – creates the additional resources that make it possible to achieve such fundamental goals as higher living standards, national and collective security, a healthier environment, and more liberal and open economies and societies.

**And—even if transition is desirable, transitioning now is bad—we’re not ready.**
**Trainer 2k** — Ted Trainer, Visiting Fellow in the Faculty of Arts at the University of New South Wales, 2000 (“Where are we, where do we want to be, how do we get there?,” Democracy & Nature: The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, Volume 6, Number 2, July, Available Online at http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol6/trainer_where.htm, Accessed 10-05-2008)
If there is a boom we in the Eco-village Movement should welcome it, through gritted teeth, because it will give us the time we desperately need. AND We need at least two more decades to build the understanding, and the most effective way to do that is by developing examples.

**And—growth overcomes scarcity—ingenuity outweighs finitude.**
**Ben-Ami 11** — Daniel Ben-Ami, journalist and author, regular contributor to spiked, has been published in the American, the Australian, Economist.com, Financial Times, the Guardian, the Independent, Novo (Germany), Ode (American and Dutch editions), Prospect, Shanghai Daily, the Sunday Telegraph, the Sunday Times, and Voltaire (Sweden), 2011 (“Growth is good,” Ode, June, Available Online at http://www.odemagazine.com/doc/print/75/growth-is-good, Accessed 08-16-2011)
There are many reasons why the notion of scarce resources is mistaken. AND It is not a question of needing, say, three planets to sustain humanity, but of making this planet more productive.

===Nieto Bad=== 
====1NC—Nieto Bad==== 

**The plan enables Nieto to carry out his capitalist imperialist agenda — the impact is brutality and the destruction of working people.**
**Grupo Espartaquista 12** — Grupo Espartaquista de México—a communist worker’s organization in Mexico, 2012 (“Mexico: PRI Back at Helm of Capitalist State,” Translated from Spanish, International Communist League, September, Available Online at http://www.icl-fi.org/english/wv/1012/mexico.html, Accessed 01-05-2013)
This situation allows even the corrupt and repressive PRI to pose as a lesser evil, even though Peña Nieto has promised nothing but further austerity, disguised by vague declarations, and more privatizations—notably of [state oil company] PEMEX, about which he has not been vague at all. AND Gun control laws limit the rights of the population and guarantee that the state and criminals maintain a monopoly of weapons.

**The alternative joins forces with the Mexican working class to forge a cross-border anti-capitalist coalition.**
**Grupo Espartaquista 12** — Grupo Espartaquista de México—a communist worker’s organization in Mexico, 2012 (“Mexico: PRI Back at Helm of Capitalist State,” Translated from Spanish, International Communist League, September, Available Online at http://www.icl-fi.org/english/wv/1012/mexico.html, Accessed 01-05-2013)
It is necessary to break the ties that bind the proletariat to the supposedly “progressive” bourgeoisie. AND The main potential ally of the Mexican working class is the powerful U.S. proletariat, which must also break with the “national unity” promoted by its “own” bourgeoisie. For joint class struggle on both sides of the border!

**Only the alternative solves — voting neg fights against Mexican capitalist imperialism.**
**Grupo Espartaquista 12** — Grupo Espartaquista de México—a communist worker’s organization in Mexico, 2012 (“Mexico: PRI Back at Helm of Capitalist State,” Translated from Spanish, International Communist League, September, Available Online at http://www.icl-fi.org/english/wv/1012/mexico.html, Accessed 01-05-2013)
Basing ourselves on the experience of the Russian Revolution of 1917, we fight for a workers and peasants government through socialist revolution. AND Rather, these indispensable demands serve as a bridge to socialist revolution and the establishment of a planned economy that, through the expropriation of the capitalists, will devote the entire economy not to fattening the wallets of a handful of magnates but to satisfying the needs of the population.

**Nieto’s agenda will decimate the working class.**
**La Botz 12** — Dan La Botz, American labor union activist, 2012 (“Mexico: The PRI is Back, the Left In Disarray,” New Politics, September 16th, Available Online at http://newpol.org/content/mexico-pri-back-left-disarray, Accessed 01-05-2013)
The victory of Enrique Peña Nieto, a man notorious for his repression of a poor people’s movement in the town of Atenco when he was governor of the State of Mexico and known as the public face of the country’s most notoriously corrupt party, represents a defeat not only for the left, but for democracy, decency and social justice in Mexico. AND The proposed reforms would render it virtually impossible to organize genuine unions, make it even more difficult than it already is to strike, and allow employers to subcontract and to hire temporary and part-time workers, practices now prohibited.

====2NC—Nieto Bad==== 

**And, Nieto’s agenda benefits Mexico’s 1%, foreign investors while continuing to disadvantage Mexico’s population**
**Imison 12**—Imison is a freelance journalist based in Mexico City who has written for a variety of publications (“What Now for the Mexican Left?,” Published by Counterpunch in July 2012, Available Online at http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/07/03/what-now-for-the-mexican-left/)
So the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which governed Mexico as a de facto dictatorship for 71 years, wins back power south of the border after a twelve-year absence. AND Pledges were made to replace rooftops and pave roads in impoverished communities – cement sales skyrocket every six years – if residents gave up their vote for Peña Nieto.

**Nieto wants to privatize PEMEX—that inflicts needless suffering on the Mexican working class—even if not fully privatized, still devastating—means they don't access the social security turn—misunderstands situation there.**
**Azul 12/18**—Rafael Azul (“Peña Nieto moves toward privatization of Mexican oil,” Published by the World Socialist Web Site on 18 December 2012, Available Online at http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2012/12/18/mexi-d18.html)
No sooner had Enrique Peña Nieto, the candidate of the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party), won the presidential election in July, he began to implement a conservative, pro-business agenda, first with his support for labor reform legislation and second by laying out an energy policy. AND
BP has offered to share with Pemex the oil capping technology that it derived from its experience in the Gulf of Mexico, at “no cost” to the Mexicans, as a way of creating a working relationship with Pemex.

===Species Loss Good=== 
====1NC Shell==== 

**Its key to evolutionary change and long-term benefit**
Michael **Boulter** (professor of paleobiology at the University of East London) **2002** Extinction: Evolution and the End of Man, p. 170
The same trend of long-drawn-out survival of the final relicts has been further considered by Bob May’s group at Oxford, particularly Sean Nee. AND The harder the abuse, the greater the change to the environment. But it also follows that it brings forward the extinctions of a whole selection of vulnerable organisms.

**Biodiversity is bad—complex systems are more prone to total failure—simple ones are stable**
Jim **Heath 1999** Orchids Australia, December, http://www.orchidsaustralia.com/whysave.htm
Some people say we can’t afford to lose any species, no matter what species they are. AND In other words, there’s no biological law that says we have to save the orchids because they add diversity, and that added diversity makes the biological world more stable.

**The impact is extinction**
Michael **Boulter** (professor of paleobiology at the University of East London) **2002** Extinction: Evolution and the End of Man, p. 67
If biological evolution really is a self-organised Earth-life system there are some very important consequences. AND It would come to a stop. Extinctions are necessary to retain life on this planet.

====2NC Overview==== 

**Here’s more evidence—catastrophic species loss now is critical to maintain life on earth —exponential increase in life forms would destroy everything without culling**
Michael **Boulter** (professor of paleobiology at the University of East London) **2002** Extinction: Evolution and the End of Man, 183-184
The system of life on Earth behaves in a similar way for all its measurable variables, whether they are communities or ecosystems. AND It would need to start again from scratch.

==Case== 
===ITS=== 
====Productivity==== 

**Keynesianism Fails—Empirics—multiple historical examples prove stimulus fails**
**Riedl 10** — Brian M. Riedl, Grover M. Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs at The Heritage Foundation, holds a B.A. in Economics and Political Science from the University of Wisconsin and an M.A. in Public Affairs from Princeton University, 2010 (“Why Government Spending Does Not Stimulate Economic Growth: Answering the Critics,” Wall Street Journal, January 9th, Available Online at http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703481004574646551469288292.html?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines, Accessed 01-27-2010)
Indeed, President Obama's stimulus bill failed by its own standards AND There is every reason to expect another round to fail as miserably as the past ones, and it would bury the nation deeper in debt.

**Evidence for transportation enhancing growth is tenuous and disputed**
Tom **Rye**, Professor of Transport Policy & Mobility Management in the School of Engineering and the Built Environment and David Scotney, Edinburgh Napier University, **11**, [“ DOES REDUCING JOURNEY TIMES IMPROVE THE ECONOMY – AND, IF NOT, WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR TRANSPORT ASSESSMENT?,” STSG, http://www.stsg.org/star/2011/TomRye.pdf] E. Liu
This section of the paper considers the question of how far the available empirical evidence supports the view that new surface transport infrastructure investment will help to increase GDP – both in terms of the immediate employment impact of the investment itself as a public works project, and then more widely, as a stimulus to general economic activity? AND ‘Today, in mature economies like the UK, with well-established networks and where connectivity between economic centres is already in place, the evidence suggests that there is considerably less scope for transport improvements to deliver the periods of rapid growth seen historically.

**Food prices don’t cause massive instability**
**Sonin, 08** – Professor at the New Economic School, is a columnist for Vedomosti Konstantin (Sonin, Moscow Times April 29, 2008 “The Upside of High Food Prices”, http://www.nes.ru/russian/about/MassMedia/0Sonin /Moscow%20Times/2008/Apr29.htm
Of course, rising food prices adversely affect people from countries that import grain. AND. Inefficiency, corruption and simple mismanagement on the government's part might lead to political instability and even to civil war, but a rise in the prices of food prices by itself is not a cause for instability in grain-exporting

====Bioterrorism==== 

**Bioterror unlikely – difficult to acquire, make and spread**
**Kellman, 1** – Prof of International Law & Dir of International Weapons Control Center, 2001 (Barry, “Biological terrorism: Legal Measures for Preventing Catastrope, 24 Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy,” Spring, http://academic.udayton.edu/health/syllabi/Bioterrorism/1Introduction/bioterror02.htm)
How difficult it is to make biological weapons and how much sophistication is required are matters in sharp dispute. AND from settling and an inversion layer to confine the cloud to lower altitudes would aid dissemination.

===JARC=== 
====Transportation Apartheid==== 

**JARC fails — no empirical support for program effectiveness.**
**Sandoval et al. 09**—J.S. Onésimo Sandoval is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice and received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley. Eric Petersen is an Associate at Cambridge Systematics and received his Ph.D. from Northwestern University. Kim L. Hunt is a principal with the O-H Community Partners, Ltd. (“A Case Study of Job Access and Reverse Commute Programs in the Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Metropolitan Regions,” Published in the Journal of Public Transportation (Vol. 12, No. 4) in 2009, Accessed on October 20, 2012, Available Online at http://www.nctr.usf.edu/jpt/pdf/JPT12-4Sandoval.pdf)
One important aspect of the JARC program was that TEA-21 limited funding of Access-to-Jobs programs to 50 percent of each grantee’s project, unlike the 80 percent match generally available for highway projects and New Start transit projects (Government Accounting Office 1998). AND This raises a legitimate point about the long-term sustainability of JARC programs.

**Transportation insufficient to solve equality — other factors are must come first**
**Preston 2009** — John Preston, Transportation Research Group, School of Civil Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton (“Epilogue: Transport policy and social exclusion— Some reflections” Transport Policy 16 (2009), p. 140–142)
Alternative approaches to quantification might involve developing measures of social inclusion as part of ongoing attempts to quantify Quality of Life such as work that has been undertaken for the World Health Organisation (Skevington et al., 2004), for the Economic and Social Research Council (Gilhooly et al., 2003) and for the Audit Commission (2005). AND This is reflective of a wider issue—that transport policy may only be a secondary tool to reducing social exclusion, with policies concerning employment, income, housing, social care, health and education of greater primary importance, although the intermediate goods status of transport means that it has impacts on many of these primary factors.

**Transportation equality is impossible — strict equality shouldn’t be the goal of policy**
**Martens et al 12** — Karel Martens, Institute for Management Research, Radboud University Nijmegen, Aaron Golub, School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning and School of Sustainability, Arizona State University, Glenn Robinson, School of Engineering and Institute for Urban Research, Morgan State University, 2012 (“A justice-theoretic approach to the distribution of transportation benefits: Implications for transportation planning practice in the United States,” Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, Volume 46, Issue 4, May 2012, Pages 684–695)
Let us first consider equal distribution of access in relation to space. AND More precisely, this observation suggests that equality of access cannot be achieved across-the-board and that a non-equal distribution must be proposed explicitly.

**National transportation policies can’t solve — it is the desire for a hyper mobile world that creates exclusion, not specific policies**
**Lucas 12** — Karen Lucas, Senior Research Fellow in Transport, Accessibility and Social Disadvantage, Transport Studies Unit, University of Oxford, Associate Editor (UK and Ireland) for the Journal of Transport Geography, 2012 (“Transport and social exclusion: Where are we now?” Transport Policy
Volume 20, March 2012, Pages 105–113, Science Direct)
Urry (2000) builds on this theme of dynamic exclusion from the transport system within his new mobilities paradigm. AND This implies that the problem of transport-related exclusion largely lies outside the influence of national or local policy makers.

**Transportation not key to equality — other issues are more important to combatting exclusion**
**Lucas 12** — Karen Lucas, Senior Research Fellow in Transport, Accessibility and Social Disadvantage, Transport Studies Unit, University of Oxford, Associate Editor (UK and Ireland) for the Journal of Transport Geography, 2012 (“Transport and social exclusion: Where are we now?” Transport Policy
Volume 20, March 2012, Pages 105–113, Science Direct)
Furthermore, transport and social exclusion can never survive as a solely transport-focused agenda. AND Similarly, large transport infrastructure projects need to be more transparent in their ex ante analyses to consider their long-term social equity effects on local populations and communities.

**Housing segregation is the lynchpin of all other forms of racial discrimination.**
**Powell 8** — john a. powell, Williams Chair in Civil Rights and Civil Liberties at the Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University and Executive Director of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University, 2008 (“Symposium: The Fair Housing Act After 40 Years: Continuing The Mission To Eliminate Housing Discrimination And Segregation: Reflections on the Past, Looking to the Future: The Fair Housing Act at 40,” Indiana Law Review (41 Ind. L. Rev. 605), Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
The Fair Housing Act was conceived under a set of conditions very different from the ones we practice in today: a predominately production-oriented subsidized housing market, a clear city-suburban quality-of-life dichotomy, and a simplified mortgage market pre-securitization (and internationalization). AND Failing to ensure fair housing for all Americans will undoubtedly undermine efforts to promote integration in every other area of American life.
