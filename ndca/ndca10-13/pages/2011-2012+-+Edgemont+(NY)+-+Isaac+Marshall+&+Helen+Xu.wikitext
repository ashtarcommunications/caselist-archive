Specifically, The experience of Asian-Americans is uniquely shaped by two interlocking forms of white supremacy – FIRST is the original founding violence of the United States – the genocide of indigenous Americans, enslavement of Blacks, and subjugation of Asian migrant labor – SECOND is western military domination of Asia which shapes domestic social relations in America – the struggle for Asian liberation requires linking and analyzing both these systems and moving beyond racial binarisms.

=Thus the advocacy: the United States ought not exist.= 
The role of the ballot is to determine which team has created the most actionable anti-white supremacy scholarship.
Successful politics against White Supremacy must begin with analysis of the key historical moments that constitute contemporary American imperialism and racism – our uncovering of historical violence against Asian migrants helps us formulate contemporary anti-racism coalitions based on early survival strategies.

The military will try to close this gap through ad hoc purchasing of commercial satellites:

This has two impacts

Second, replacing ad hoc purchasing with long-term contracts creates a partnership for cooperative innovation.

Sears ’9

Commercial SATCOM capabilities, as always, are essential to future UAV and ISR missions and requirements. Developments in select markets bring new synergies that stretch beyond the atypical boundaries of connectivity and telemetry for UAVs and special sensors. Let me frame five major focus areas for the future of SATCOM from ORBCOMM’s perspective:
Dynamic Capacity. SATCOM core functions … Twitter feed as that of a UAV.


Independently, the satellites the military does manage to produce on its own will suck – using commercial SATCOM instead is key to “every level of military operations.”

//Now more than ever before, the military’s use of commercial satellite communications … commercial Satcom providers is one of necessity, not luxury.//

The president’s budget for NASA released today (see **[[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/factsheet_department_nasa/|fact sheet]]**) is similar to the **[[http://www.aip.org/fyi/2010/082.html|Senate compromise]]** last year, but contains some key differences.
Notably the issues remain how much to spend on a heavy lift rocket and launch vehicle, and how much to invest in private-sector initiatives, such as **[[http://blogs.chron.com/sciguy/archives/2011/01/spacex_sends_a_message_to_budgetcutting_lawmakers_1.html|SpaceX]]**, which two months ago became the first commercial entity to launch a spacecraft into orbit and subsequently recover it upon its return to Earth.
As has been the case for some time, __NASA is being asked to straddle a fence and support both commercial access to low-Earth orbit and build its own fleet of new space vehicles__. In this budget environment, however, there’s just not enough money to do both.
__Under last year’s Senate compromise__, for 2012, __NASA would spend $400 million to foster private development of commercial crew services to orbit, and $4.05 billion on a launch rocket and crew vehicle__.
In the President’s proposed budget, NASA would spend $850 million on commercial crew services, but just $2.8 billion on a new NASA rocket and crew vehicle.

===1NC Anthro=== 

**We’ll begin with a narrative**
**Two summers ago there was a forest teeming with life behind the Greenville elementary school. It was surely nothing like it was before central avenue was paved but it was nevertheless a refuge of nature amongst the scripted shrubberies of suburbia.**
**Last summer the roar of saws began, wood chippers lined the streets, and men in hard hats sweated beneath the sun. Today the trees of wood are gone along with the singing of blue jays and the tail dances of the squirrels. Today the trees are made of metal, strewn with power cables whose electrical drone has replaced the songs of the birds. And the only dancing the squirrels do is beneath the tires of the neighbor’s Prius.**
**We are all animals, but somehow our non-human brothers and sisters are forgotten – the 1AC is but another example of this anthropocentrism embodied in forgetting our relationship with nature. The institutions the aff criticizes were not built only upon the backs of Asian bodies, but also on top of forests not so different from the one in Greenville.**

**<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The A Sub point of our advocacy is Anthropocentrism in Silence</span>**

**This “silence” on oppression of other species is the dominant characteristic of anthropocentrism in movements to liberate the oppressed – without considering the more than human world, the expansion of liberties to the “alien” merely becomes the expansion of the exploitation of nature – this turns their project by replicating spiciest hierarchies that constitute white supremacy**
