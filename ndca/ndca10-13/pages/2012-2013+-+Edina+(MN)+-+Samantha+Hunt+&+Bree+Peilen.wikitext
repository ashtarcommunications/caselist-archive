**The communism we speak of is not an ideal, but a movement that reacts to contradictions in the capitalist system – This vision of communism is thwarted by a perceived lack of revolutionary subject**

**Transportation infrastructure is the bastion of global capitalism’s abuses – it creates zones of inclusion and exclusion – Only by accepting the mantel of the revolutionary subject and the excluded can we engage in universalized antagonism where we can recapture value to life and stave off human extinction**

**We must engage the state as planners – Using a universalized particular demand to provide transportation for urban populations acts as a counter-methodology to that of neoliberal planning**

**The affirmative represents an ethical shift that embraces contingency in the face of certainty – This represents a dramatic shift from existing, unquestioned institutions**

//<span style="color: black;">Ethics obligate us to act. We present the story of Harry Ramos, trapped in World Trade Center during 9/11, as a metaphor for our position when faced with unending suffering and impending death. Instead of abandoning the others, Harry saved a helpless co-worker in the ultimate gesture of ethics – in the same manner, we ask you to help the slum dwellers and Excluded even if other forms of suffering are inevitable</span>//
