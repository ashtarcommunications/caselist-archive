===Impartiality NC=== 
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The standard is maximizing impartiality. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Impartiality means the absence of irrelevant factors in determinations and the assurance of due process for all tried. Alex Tuckness<span style="font-size: 12pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Alex/Desktop/Lincoln%20Douglas/Alex's%20Kind%20of%20Half%20in%20my%20Butt%20NEG%20lincoln%20douglas.doc#_ftn1|[1]]]</span> 1 writes:</span>
**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The ideal of impartiality is</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;"> a</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> **__central...__**</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">a member of my ethnic group, or a personal friend is not</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">This is the best standard for six reasons. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">First, all individuals are fundamentally morally equal. There is no justification for treating some individuals as having less worth than others; legal systems that arbitrarily treat certain groups as having more value than others embody a mindset that leads to the worst sorts of atrocities and genocides. Partiality denies this equal moral worth by suggesting that some are more valuable than others based on irrelevant factors.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Second, impartiality is the most fundamental and only verifiable necessary and sufficient condition of legal systems because it’s the only way to accurately assign due. Definitionally, partiality means that judges don’t give individuals what they deserve but rather what the judges want the individuals to have based on their relationship. Stepping outside of an impartial perspective means that individuals aren’t given their due. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Third, impartiality is sufficient for the validity of a legal system. The particular content of just legal determinations is infinitely variable depending on the issue at hand, but as long as adjudicators approach every situation with honest impartiality, they maximize their likelihood of correctly distributing due because they discount irrelevant factors. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Fourth, impartiality is key to accurate verdicts. Tuckness 2:</span>

**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">People</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">from both of these traditions, and indeed from legal traditions around the world</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">, **__can agree ...__**</span>**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> all else being equal, better secure justice </span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">for the persons under its jurisdictions.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Fifth, impartiality is necessary for utilitarian calculations because impartial procedures defeat the purpose of a legal system, which is to properly assign due, by making faulty determinations. Rendering legitimacy to this practice results in systematic oppression. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Sixth, impartiality is necessary for deontological determinations because deontology demands that individuals be treated fairly, and partiality definitionally denies this principle.</span>

**<span style="background-color: white; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 9.5pt;">Second, Rehabilitation programs confer benefits on those who don’t deserve them.</span>**

Prison rehabilitation programs...programs are more justifiable outside than inside the criminal justice system.

**<span style="background-color: white; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 9.5pt;">Third, retribution takes away the unfair advantage a criminal has away from them. </span>**

Alternatively, the imposition of punishment...thereby adjusting criminals' positions relative to their fellows.
