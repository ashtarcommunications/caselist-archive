<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Contemporary globalization is driven by a combination of new transport and communication technologies, knowledge-intensive production technologies, new open-trade institutions, neo-liberal ideologies, and logistical innovations facilitating ﬂows of goods, services, capital, and knowledge. Global network corporations</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">—the major agents of globalization—</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">simultaneously exploit economies of scale in widening markets and economies of scope in information, ﬁnancial, and marketing networks, while maintaining production units in urban regions around the world to take advantage of lower costs.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;"> Global capital thus uses urban regions as organizational structures to enhance returns, while also seeking infrastructure investments that improve accessibility and knowledge sharing. This explains the rapid growth of multinational ﬁrms in large metropolitan corridors surrounding such global cities as London, New York, Tokyo, and Los Angeles. Smaller urban areas, less endowed with global accessibility and knowledge, fare differently in the competition for global production locations. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">The ability of a smaller urban region to participate in the global division of labor depends on what cost advantages it can offer or what growth strategies it can develop that allow it to export to global markets</span></span><span style="background: lime; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-highlight: lime;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;"> The evolution of globally competitive urban centers shifts important aspects of economic policy to the urban level, with an increasing role for urban economic policy. CO N C L U S I O N S This essay advances two ideas. First, the </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">economic effects of transport improvements are dependent on the context in which the improvements are made.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;"> Economic outcomes vary according to the state of the preexisting transportation network, the state of economic development, and the nature of competition in the regions. This suggests that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">economic assessments of transport improvements must incorporate a broader range of interrelationships and data than are typically reviewed in transportation analyses</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">. Second, economic history teaches that </span>__sustained improvements in transportation,__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;"> going hand in hand with parallel improvements in information and production technologies and institutional structures, cause structural and developmental transformations— suggesting </span>that very<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">long-term transport effects are joint consequences of the evolution of transport, information, production, and institutional structures.</span> </span>


====Transportation industry is direct alienation of the worker from their labor, it is intrinsically capitalist====

We produce what Marx calls a ‘useful effect’. The ‘useful effect’ of the transport industry is the actual moving of goods and people from one place to another</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">. Raw materials move from the mines to the ports and factories, finished products are transported to and from the markets, workers are brought from their homes to the work-places. The movement of commodities (the result of the work of transport workers) adds value to the various commodities being moved – the greater the distance, the greater the value added: <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">… </span></span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">the use-value of things has no existence except in consumption, and this may necessitate a change of place on the part of the product, in other words, it may require the additional process of production of the transportation industry. The productive capital invested in this industry adds value to the transported products, partly by transferring value to the transported products from the means of transportation</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;"> [i.e., the using-up and 'wear and tear' of rails, roads, engines etc.], partly by adding value through labour-power used in transportation [i.e., the using-up and 'wear and tear' of shunters, drivers, signalmen, etc]. This last-named addition of value consists, as it does in all capitalist production, of a reproduction of wages and of surplus-value. Look at the production of a Ford motor car. It is the product of the collective labour of thousands of men and women. They work on the production lines and in the offices of factories at Broadmeadows and Geelong, in the rubber mills and glass-works, and also in the transport industry – carrying raw materials, components and finished parts from one plant to another. However, both </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">the car and the profits from its future sales are owned by a small group of share-holders in the U.S.A. This is the contradiction of capitalism – production is carried out collectively by thousands of workers who do not own what they produce</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;"> They are paid a wage which represents the amount necessary to keep the worker and the family from week to week, but no more than that. The products, like the factories, are owned by a small handful of people. In Australia, these people are mainly U.S., British and Japanese monopoly capitalists.</span> </span>

Everything is allowed, solicited even, as a critical topic: the prospect of a global ecological catastrophe</span>; violations of human rights; sexism, homophobia, anti-feminism; growing violence not only in faraway countries, but also in our own megalopolises; <span class="underline">the gap between the First and the Third World, between rich and poor;</span> the shattering impact of the digitalization of our daily lives ... today, </span>**__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">there is nothing easier than to get</span>__** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">international, state or corporate </span>**__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">funds for a multidisciplinary research project on how to fight new forms of ethnic, religious or sexist violence. <span class="underline">The problem is that all this occurs against the background of a fundamental</span></span>__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Denkverbot: a </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">prohibition on thinking</span>. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Today’s liberal-democratic hegemony is sustained by a kind of unwritten Denkverbot similar to the infamous Berufsverbot (prohibition on employing individuals with radical Left leanings in the state organs) in Germany in the late 1960s — <span class="underline">the moment we show a minimal sign of engaging in political projects which aim seriously to challenge the existing order, the answer is immediately: “Benevolent as it is, this will inevitably end in a new Gulag!”</span> </span>**__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">The ideological function of constant references to the Holocaust, the Gulag, and more recent Third World catastrophes is thus to serve as the support of this</span>__** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Denkverbot</span> **__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">by <span class="underline">constantly reminding us how things could have been much worse</span></span>__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: “Just look around and see for yourself what will happen if we follow your radical notions!” What we encounter here is the ultimate example of what Anna Dinerstein and Mike Neary have called the project of disutopia: “not just the temporary absence of Utopia, but the political celebration of the end of social dreams”.2 And the demand for “scientific objectivity” amounts to just another version of the same Denkverhot: the moment we seriously question the existing liberal consensus, we are accused of abandoning scientific objectivity for outdated ideological positions. This is the “Leninist” point on which one cannot and should not concede: <span class="underline">today, actual freedom of thought means freedom to question the prevailing liberal-democratic “post-ideological” consensus — or it means nothing</span>. The Right to Truth The perspective of the critique of ideology compels us to invert Wittgenstein’s “What one cannot speak about, thereof one should be silent” into “What one should not speak about, thereof one cannot remain silent”. </span>**__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">If you want to speak about a social system, you cannot remain silent about its repressed excess</span>__**<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">.</span> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The point is not to tell the whole Truth but, precisely, to append to the (official) Whole the uneasy supplement which denounces its falsity. As Max Horkheimer put it back in the l930s: “If you don’t want to talk about capitalism, then you should keep silent about Fascism.” </span>**__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Fascism is the inherent “symptom”</span>__** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">(the return of the repressed) </span>**__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">of capitalism</span>__****__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">,</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> the key to its “truth”, not just an external contingent deviation of its “normal” logic. And the same goes for today’s situation: those who do not want to subject liberal democracy and the flaws of its multiculturalist tolerance to critical analysis, should keep quiet about the new Rightist violence and intolerance. If we are to leave the opposition between liberal-democratic universalism and ethnic/religious fundamentalism behind, the first step is to acknowledge the existence of liberal fundamentalism: the perverse game of making a big fuss when the rights of a serial killer or a suspected war criminal are violated, while ignoring massive violations of “ordinary” people’s rights. More precisely, the politically correct stance betrays its perverse economy through its oscillation between the two extremes: either fascination with the victimized other (helpless children, raped women . . .), or a focus on the problematic other who, although criminal, and so on, also deserves protection of his human rights, because “today it’s him, tomorrow it’ll be us” (an excellent example is Noam Chomsky’s defence of a French book advocating the revisionist stance on the Holocaust). On a different level, a similar instance of the perversity of Political Correctness occurs in Denmark, where people speak ironically of the “white woman’s burden”, her ethico-political duty to have sex with immigrant workers from Third World countries — this being the final necessary step in ending their exclusion. Today, in the era of what Habermas designated as die neue Unubersichtlichkeit (the new opacity),~ </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">our everyday experience is more mystifying than ever: modernization generates new obscurantisms; the reduction of freedom is presented to us as the dawn of new freedoms</span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">.</span> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The perception that we live in a society of free choices</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, in which we have to choose even our most “natural” features (ethnic or sexual identity), <span class="underline">is the form of appearance of its very opposite: of the absence of true choices</span>. The recent trend for “alternate reality” films, which present existing reality as one of a multitude of possible outcomes, is symptomatic of a society in which choices no longer really matter, are trivialized. The lesson of the time-warp narratives is even bleaker, since it points towards a total closure: the very attempt to avoid the predestined course of things not only leads us back to it, but actually constitutes it — from Oedipus onwards, we want to avoid A, and it is through our very detour that A realizes itself. <span class="underline">In these circumstances, we should be especially careful not to confuse the ruling ideology with ideology which seems to dominate</span>. More than ever, we should bear in mind Walter Benjamin’s reminder that it is not enough to ask how a certain theory (or art) positions itself with regard to social struggles — we ask how it actually functions in these very struggles. In sex, the true hegemonic attitude is not patriarchal repression, but free promiscuity; in art, provocations in the style of the notorious “Sensation” exhibitions are the norm, the example of art fully integrated into the establishment. Ayn Rand brought this logic to its conclusion, supplementing it with a kind of Hegelian twist, that is, reasserting the official ideology itself as its own greatest transgression, as in the title of one of her late non-fiction books: “Capitalism, This Unknown Ideal”, or in “top managers, America’s last endangered species”. Indeed, <span class="underline">since the “normal” functioning of capitalism involves some kind of disavowal of the basic principle of its functioning (today’s model capitalist is someone who, after ruthlessly generating profit, then generously shares parts of it, giving large donations to churches, victims of ethnic or sexual abuse, etc., posing as a humanitarian), the ultimate act of transgression is to assert this principle directly, depriving it of its humanitarian mask</span>. I am therefore tempted to reverse Marx’s Thesis 11: </span>__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">t<span class="underline">he</span></span><span class="underline"> <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">first task today is precisely not to succumb to the temptation to act</span></span>__<span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, to intervene directly and change things </span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">(which then inevitably ends in a cul-de-sac of debilitating impossibility: “What can we do against global capital?”), </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">but to question the hegemonic ideological co-ordinates</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> In short, our historical moment is still that of Adorno: To the question “What should we do?” I can most often truly answer only with “I don’t know.” I can only try to analyse rigorously what there is. <span class="underline">Here people reproach me: When you practise criticism, you are also obliged to say how one should make it better. To my mind, this is incontrovertibly a bourgeois preiudice</span>. </span>**__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Many times in history it so happened that the very works which pursued purely theoretical goals transformed consciousness, and thereby also social reality. <span class="underline">If, today, we follow a direct call to act, this act will not be performed in an empty space — it will be an act within the hegemonic ideological coordinates</span></span>__**<span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: those who “really want to do something to help people” get involved in</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> (undoubtedly honourable) exploits like Mediecins sans frontieres, <span class="underline">Greenpeace,</span> feminist and anti-racist campaigns, <span class="underline">which are all not only tolerated but even supported by the media, even if they seemingly encroach on economic territory</span> (for example, denouncing and boycotting companies which do not respect ecological conditions, or use child labour) <span class="underline">— they are tolerated and supported as long as they do not get too close to a certain limit.6 This kind of activity provides the perfect example of interpassivity:7 of doing things not in order to achieve something, but to prevent something from really happening, really changing.</span> All this frenetic humanitarian, Politically Correct, etc., activity fits the formula of “Let’s go on changing something all the time so that, globally, things will remain the same!”. If standard Cultural Studies criticize capitalism, they do so in the coded way that exemplifies Hollywood liberal paranoia: <span class="underline">the enemy is “the system”, the hidden “organization”, the anti-democratic “conspiracy”, not simply capitalism and state apparatuses. The problem with this critical stance is not only that it replaces concrete social analysis with a struggle against abstract paranoiac fantasies, but that — in a typical paranoiac gesture — it unnecessarily redoubles social reality, as if there were a secret Organization behind the “visible” capitalist and state organs</span>. What we should accept is that there is no need for a secret “organization-within-an-organization”. the “conspiracy” is already in the “visible” organization as such, in the capitalist system, in the way the political space and state apparatuses work.8 Let us take one of the hottest topics in today’s “radical” American academia: postcolonial studies. The problem of postcolonialism is undoubtedly crucial; however, postcolonial studies tend to translate it into the multiculturalist problematic of the colonized minorities’ “right to narrate” their victimizing experience, of the power mechanisms which repress “otherness,” so that, at the end of the day, we learn that the root of postcolonial exploitation is our intolerance towards the Other, and, furthermore, that this intolerance itself is rooted in our intolerance towards the “Stranger in Ourselves”, in our inability to confront what we have repressed in and of ourselves — the politico-economic struggle is thus imperceptibly transformed into a pseudopsychoanalytic drama of the subject unable to confront its inner traumas. . . . (Why pseudo-psychoanalytic? Because the true lesson of psychoanalysis is not that the external events which fascinate and/or disturb us are just projections of our inner repressed impulses. The unbearable fact of life is that there really are disturbing events out there: there are other human beings who experience intense sexual enjoyment while we are half-impotent; there are people submitted to terrifying torture.. . . Again, the ultimate truth of psychoanalysis is not that of discovering our true Self, but that of the traumatic encounter with an unbearable Real.) </span>**__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">The true corruption of American academia is not primarily financial</span>__**, <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">it is not only that universities are able to buy many European critical intellectuals (myself included — up to a point), </span>**__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">but conceptual</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: <span class="underline">notions of “European” critical theory are imperceptibly translated into the benign universe of Cultural Studies chic.</span> At a certain point, this chic becomes indistinguishable from the famous Citibank commercial in which scenes of East Asian, European, Black and American children playing is accompanied by the voice-over: “People who were once divided by a continent ... are now united by an economy” — at this concluding highpoint, of course, the children are replaced by the Citibank logo. <span class="underline">The great majority of today’s “radical” academics silently count on the long-term stability of the American capitalist model</span>, with a secure tenured position as their ultimate professional goal (a surprising number of them even play the stock market). <span class="underline">If there is one thing they are genuinely afraid of, it is a radical shattering of the (relatively) safe life-environment of the “symbolic classes” in developed Western societies.</span> </span>**__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Their excessive Politically Correct zeal when they are dealing with sexism, racism, Third World sweatshops, and so on, is thus ultimately a defence against their own innermost identification, a kind of compulsive ritual whose hidden logic is: “Let’s talk as much as possible about the necessity of a radical change, to make sure that nothing will really change</span>__****__<span style="background: lime; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: lime;">!</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">” The journal October is typical of this: when you ask one of the editors what the title refers to, they half-confidentially indicate that it is, of course, that October — in this way, you can indulge in jargonistic analyses of modern art, with the secret assurance that you are somehow retaining a link with the radical revolutionary past.. . . With regard to this radical chic, our first gesture towards Third Way ideologists and practitioners should be one of praise: at least they play their game straight, and are honest in their acceptance of the global capitalist co-ordinates — unlike pseudo-radical academic Leftists who adopt an attitude of utter disdain towards the Third Way, while <span class="underline">their own radicalism ultimately amounts to an empty gesture which obliges no one to do anything definite</span>. There is, of course, a strict distinction to be made here between authentic social engagement on behalf of exploited minorities (for example, organizing illegally employed chicano field workers in California) and the multiculturalist/postcolonial “plantations of no-risk, no-fault, knock-off rebellion” which prosper in “radical” American academia<span class="underline">. If, however, in contrast to corporate multiculturalism”, we define “critical multiculturalism” as a strategy of pointing out that “there are common forces of oppression, common strategies of exclusion, stereotyping, and stigmatizing of oppressed groups, and thus common enemies and targets of attack,” I do not see the appropriateness of the continuing use of the term “multiculturalism”, since the accent shifts here to the common struggle. In its normal accepted meaning, multiculturalism perfectly fits the logic of the global market</span>.</span>

The point about the human, betrayed by this absence, is precisely that it is not sovereignly self-possessed and complete, enjoying undisputed tenure in and of itself. Modes of justice therefore reliant upon such a subject lack the very foundations in the self that they most violently insist upon seeing inscribed there. This does not, however, mean that the dissolution of the subject also entails the dissolution of Justice. Quite the reverse. The subject was never a firm foundation for justice, much less a hospitable vehicle for the reception of the call of another Justice. It was never in possession of that self-possession which was supposed to secure the certainty of itself, of a self-possession that would enable it ultimately to adjudicate everything. The very indexicality required of sovereign subjectivity gave rise rather to a commensurability much more amenable to the expendability required of the political and material economies of mass societies than it did to the singular, invaluable, and uncanny uniqueness of the self. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-color: lime; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">The</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-color: lime; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">value of the subject became the standard unit of currency for</span> <span style="background-color: lime; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">the political arithmetic of States and the political economies of capitalism.</span></span> <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">They trade in it still to devastating global effect.
