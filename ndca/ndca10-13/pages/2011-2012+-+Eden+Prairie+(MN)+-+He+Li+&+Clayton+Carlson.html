 <strong>Contention One is Inherency</strong><br />

<strong>The US is rapidly expanding BMD capabilities in the status quo that will fail without SBMD deployment</strong><br />
<strong>Mooney, 08</strong> (Kevin, staff writer for CNS News. “Space-Based Missile Defense Needed to Counter Global Threats, Experts Say” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:964:http://www.cnsnews.com/public/Content/Article.aspx?rsrcid=36145 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cnsnews.com/public/Content/Article.aspx?rsrcid=36145" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnsnews.com/public/Content/Article.aspx?rsrcid=36145</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:964 -->)<br />

Only a space-based missile defense system capable of intercepting and destroying incoming warheads in the “boost phase” (shortly after they are launched) can adequately protect America from emerging global threats, national security experts told a forum hosted the Heritage Foundation on Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2008. The ground- and sea-based systems deployed by the U.S. over the past few years are a promising start that can help guard against limited strikes from rogue powers such as North Korea and Iran, the Bush administration maintains. However, the existing system is not equipped to handle the more sophisticated weaponry and countermeasures that Russia and China are now developing, warned Amb. Hank Cooper, chairman of the missile defense research organization High Frontier. Moreover, rogue states like Iran “who know how to play the game” also are testing new missile technology that could be deployed against the U.S. in unconventional ways, Cooper suggested. One nightmare scenario involves a ship-borne Scud missile that could be used to launch and explode a nuclear weapon in the atmosphere over the U.S., creating an electromagnetic pulse that would fry electronics, he warned. The most compelling program design to date stems from President Reagan’s “Strategic Defense Initiative” (SDI), which was first spelled out in a March 1983 address, Cooper noted. Going back to the late 1980s and early 1990s, plans called for small, highly mobile, space-based interceptors called “brilliant pebbles” that would be housed in protective cylinders and armed with the ability to intercept and destroy incoming missiles. Former President George H.W. Bush endorsed the idea, although it ultimately was discontinued under the Clinton administration and has not been reactivated since that time, Cooper lamented. “We lost a generation of the best that came out of the SDI era in the early ‘90s and this has not been restored,” Cooper said. “This was an effective, affordable defense [concept] that could be used to stay ahead of countermeasures.” While the idea of missile defense remains controversial inside the United States, the spread of missile technology and heightened availability of destructive weaponry has not gone unnoticed in parts of Asia and Europe, where policymakers now seem keen on the idea of employing a protective shield, Jeff Kueter, president of the George Marshall Institute, observed in response to a question from CNSNews.com. “What we can see is a remarkable change in attitudes, particularly among some of our international partners, in recognizing the threat they face from ballistic missiles in their willingness to work with the U.S. to develop these capabilities,” he said. Kueter credited Japan for working in close cooperation with the U.S. to help build up sea-based anti-missile systems on the U.S. Navy’s Aegis Vessels. He also said America’s European partners have been moving in a positive direction. As CNSNews.com previously reported, there are now 26 NATO countries expressing formal support for missile defense. The multi-layered anti-missile system now in place includes a mix of ground- and sea-based systems that have the ability to attack incoming ballistic weapons in their mid-course and terminal phases, Kueter noted. Currently, the U.S. has 24 ground-based mid-course interceptors stationed in Alaska and California, with 30 planned for the end of this year, according to the U.S. Defense Department’s Missile Defense Agency (MDA). There also are 12 Aegis ships equipped with the surveillance and tracking systems needed to perform mid-course missile defense missions at the present time, and an additional six are scheduled to become a part of the fleet over the next few months, the MDA reports. Additional missile interceptors also will be installed as part of the Aegis system on 18 vessels in 2009, according to the MDA. The goal is to have 100 interceptors capable of engaging missiles in their terminal phase operating on Aegis before the end of next year, Kueter pointed out. The European Site Initiative also has gained momentum recently. Current plans call for 10 U.S. ground-based interceptors to be installed in Poland where they will operate in conjunction with a radar system in the Czech Republic. The missile interceptors will be placed at the Redzikovo Polish military base close to the Baltic Sea in the northern part of the country. Also on deck and ready for deployment in 2010 is the U.S. Army’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. It can protect against both short- and medium-range missiles and can do so at longer ranges and higher altitudes than the interceptors now in use. The THAAD system will complement existing anti-missile defenses – not replace them – adding another layer to America’s present multi-layered, anti-missile defense blanket. These additional steps are effective as far as they go -- but, ultimately, there is no substitute for a space-based defensive layer that can target enemy warheads in their most vulnerable, earliest stages, Cooper argued. “A space-interceptor system is actually multi-layered, in and of itself, because it has a global presence and is capable of intercepting a missile in the boost phase, or mid-course phase, or even in the high endo-atmosphere before the re-entry phase,” he said. The boost phase is a “great time” to hit the target because the rocket is still burning, is easy to see, and can be destroyed before any decoys are deployed, Cooper observed. In the absence of a space-based defense, there are two systems with boost phase implications currently in development: the Airborne Laser System and Multiple Kill Vehicles. The Airborne Laser is housed inside a modified 747, where it would target moving missiles. Multiple Kill Vehicles, which are much smaller versions of the current crop of anti-missile interceptors, are capable of launching several kill vehicles at one time. “Neither system gets us where we need to be,” Kueter acknowledged in his talk. Still, he does see value in pursuing both systems as a way of sharpening and honing technology that can be more effectively applied as part of a larger missile-defense architecture over the long term.<br />

<strong>Space already weaponized – X-37B should have triggered the link and makes conflict over space more likely</strong><br />

The hush-hush X-37B robotic space plane launched by the United States Air Force late Thursday is many things, but it's no space weapon, according to high-ranking official with the project. Gary Payton, Air Force deputy undersecretary of space programs, scoffed at speculation that the X-37B space plane is the vanguard for a space weapon fleet and said its main purpose is to test space technology, not orbital weapons. &quot;I don't know how this could be called a weaponization of space,&quot; Payton told reporters this week before the launch. &quot;Fundamentally, it's just an updated version of the space shuttle kinds of activities in space.&quot; Payton's comments were aimed at questions from reporters on how the secretive nature of this X-37B may appear to other countries with and without assets in space. The unmanned X-37B space plane, now known as the Orbital Test Vehicle 1, actually began its life as a civilian project founded by NASA in 1999 to test landing and other spacecraft technologies. NASA turned the program over to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 2004. The Air Force took control of the project in 2006. [X-37B spacecraft photos.] Space policy analyst Joan Johnson-Freese, professor of National Security Studies at the Naval War College in Newport, RI, has told SPACE.com that the X-37B could either be a major advancement in human spaceflight or be the unmanned end result of the Air Force's dream of building a crewed space plane. &quot;In any case, it is likely that other countries will see it as another capability intended to assure the United States will be able to dominate access to and the use of space,&quot; she said in an earlier interview. Spaceship or weapon? Payton said that the X-37B launch is primarily aimed at testing fundamental technologies for reusable spacecraft and space applications. &quot;If these technologies on the vehicle prove to be as good as we estimate, it will make our access to space more responsive, perhaps cheaper, and push us in the vector toward being able to react to warfighter needs more quickly,&quot; Payton said. But it is the spacecraft's appearance as a rapid-response vehicle that can be launched on unmanned rockets has led to some speculation of its potential as a space weapon. &quot;Regardless of its original intent, the most obvious and formidable [potential use] is in service as a space fighter - a remotely piloted craft capable of disabling multiple satellites in orbit on a single mission and staying on orbit for months to engage newly orbited platforms,&quot; comparative military studies professor Everett Dolman, if the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies at the Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base in Montgomery, Ala., has told SPACE.com. That capability &quot;would be a tremendous tactical advantage.&quot; Dolman said it's still too early to determine what the ultimate use for the X-37B, or any future successors, may be. The X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle 1 was built by Boeing in Seal Beach, Calif., and weighs about 11,000 pounds (about 5,000 kg). This SPACE.com X-37B graphic illustrates some details of the space plane and its relative size. Mini-shuttle in space Air Force officials have said the X-37B will be tested as a &quot;flexible space test platform to conduct various experiments and allow satellite sensors, subsystems, components and associated technology to be efficiently transported to and from the space environment.&quot; The space plane's payload bay can fit a couple of small satellites to be launched and deployed, but it does not have a robotic arm to grapple objects in space and retrieve them. That means it could be used to support military operations oversees by rapidly deploying space-based assets like small communications or reconnaissance satellites. &quot;This launch helps ensure that our warfighters will be provided the capabilities they need in the future,&quot; said Air Force Col. Andre Lovett, 45th Space Wing vice commander, Launch Decision Authority for the mission, after the launch. The X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle also has a long loiter time in space. It has a solar array tucked in its payload bay that can keep it powered up for around 270 days, Air Force officials have said. &quot;We, the Air Force, have suite of military missions in space and this new vehicle could potentially help us do those missions better,&quot; Payton said. Payton has said he envisions the X-37B has functioning much like the SR-71 Blackbird spy aircraft, being on alert in times of need to fly a mission that could support military operations. The time between flights, during a rush period of many space launches, could be as little as 10 to 15 days, Payton said. It is still unknown how long the first X-37B will remain in orbit. But when it returns, it is expected to autonomously fly itself through the Earth's atmosphere and land at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, with Edwards Air Force Base as a backup.<br />

It is a rule in strategy, one derived empirically from the evidence of two and a half millennia, that anything of great strategic importance to one belligerent, for that reason has to be worth attacking by others. And the greater the importance, the greater has to be the incentive to damage, disable, capture, or destroy it. In the bluntest of statements: space warfare is a certainty in the future because the use of space in war has become vital. . . . Regardless of public sentimental or environmentally shaped attitudes towards space as the pristine final frontier, space warfare is coming.20 The strategic value of space to states is not in question. Advanced spacefaring states are already reliant—and moving toward dependence—on space-derived services for activities across every sector of their societies. Spacepower is becoming critical to their styles of warfighting. Likewise, the injury that can be caused to such states by menacing their space systems can be considerable. Given these incentives, the beast of war will either break its chains all at once or stretch them slowly over time.21<br />

China is expected to launch its Tiangong 1 space laboratory in the coming days. A country that only eight years ago put its first taikonaut (astronaut) into orbit could, in eight more years, be the only country to possess a permanently-crewed space station. Chinese media report that the Tiangong 1, or “Heavenly Palace”, is being readied for flight at the Jiuquan launch facility in Inner Mongolia. The module represents the first element of China’s plan to develop a manned space station, which Beijing hopes will be fully operational by 2020. Professor Kwing-Lam Chan of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology is involved in analysis of China’s lunar program. He explains the objective of this first Tiangong mission: “It’s a lab for testing the connection between spacecraft: Shenzhou 8 will be sent [up] probably this year, and will be connected to Tiangong 1 for testing, but will not carry people,” he said. State media report that China’s space program aims to enhance the country’s “progress, power and prestige”. Under military authority, it has advanced rapidly despite European Union and U.S. embargoes on trading in defense-related technologies with China. The Shenzhou spacecraft emerged from Russian Soyuz technology in the late 1990s. A first manned space mission for China followed in 2003, making a national hero of the taikonaut Colonel Yang Liwei. Professor K.L. Yung of Hong Kong Polytechnic University is helping develop equipment that China will use on the Moon next year. He suggests that while China’s space program is no more advanced those of other space-faring nations, a team of elite engineers and scientists is making incremental and cost-effective progress. “The main reason is obviously salaries in China are not that high. The other reason is, they are developing a lot of their own components because of the high-tech embargo; it actually helps them.” With the International Space Station, funded by Russia, the United States, Canada, Japan and the EU, slated for retirement in 2020, Yung points out that China could soon emerge as the only nation with a permanent, manned space platform. The potential for such a strategic advantage in space, aligned with China’s ballooning defense budget, is causing international concern. Last week, the U.S. Defense Department published its annual report on China’s military capabilities. The report concluded that Beijing is developing “extensive space warfare technologies&quot;. The report also found little evidence that “China’s leaders have fully thought through the global effects of employment of these strategic capabilities”. Although Beijing insists it “opposes the weaponization of space”, India, Japan and Korea continue to play catch up with their own indigenous space programs.<br />

<strong>Terrestrial military dominance entirely dependent on space assets - weaponization key to their protection</strong><br />

<br />
The United States has embarked on a revolutionary military transformation designed to extend its dominance in military engagements. Space capabilities are the lynchpin of this transformation, enabling a level of precision, stealth, command and control, intelligence gathering, speed, maneuverability, flexibility, and lethality heretofore unknown. This twenty-first century way of war promises to give the United States a capacity to use force to influence events around the world in a timely, effective, and sustainable manner. And this is a good thing, a true transformation from conflicts past. That the process of transformation was well underway became evident in 1991, when the world’s fourth largest military was defeated in just ten days of ground combat. Unfathomably complicated battle equipment, sleek new aircraft, and promising new missile interceptors publicly debuted. Arthur C. Clarke went so far as to dub Operation DESERT STORM (ODS) the world’s first space war, as none of the accomplishments of America’s new look military would have been possible without support from space. Twelve years later, in Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), assertions as to the central role of space power could no longer be denied. America’s military had transitioned from space supported to a fully space enabled force, with astonishingly positive results. Indeed, most of the nation’s current space power functions were successfully exercised in OIF, including space lift, command and control, intelligence including rapid battle damage assessment, timing and navigation, and meteorological support. The tremendous growth in space reliance from OSD to OIF is evident in the raw numbers. Despite engaging with a 60 percent smaller force (fewer than 200,000 personnel v. over 500,000), satellite communications usage increased four-fold, from 200 to 800 Mbps (Megabits per second) capacity. Newly possible operational concepts such as reach back (intelligence analysts in the United States sending information directly to frontline units) and reach forward (rear-deployed commanders able to direct battlefield operations in real time) reconfigured the tactical concept of war. The value of Predator and Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), completely reliant on satellite communications and navigation for their operation, was confirmed. Special Forces units, paradoxically tethered to satellite support and yet practically unfettered in their silent movements because of them, ranged throughout Iraq in independent operations that were extremely disruptive. But the paramount effect of space-enabled warfare was in the area of combat efficiency. Space assets allowed all weather, day-night precision munitions to provide the bulk of America’s striking power. Strikes from standoff platforms, including Vietnam-Era B-52s, allowed maximum target devastation with extraordinarily low death and collateral devastation. In ODS, 90 percent of munitions used were unguided. Of the ten percent that were guided, none was GPS capable. By OIF, 70 percent were precision guided, more than half of those from GPS satellites. In ODS, fewer than five percent of aircraft were GPS-equipped. By OIF, all were. During ODS, GPS proved so valuable to the army that it procured and rushed into theater over 4,500 commercial receivers to augment the meager 800 military-band ones it could deploy from stockpiles, an average of one per company (about 200 personnel). By OIF, each army squad (6-10 soldiers) had at least one military GPS receiver. With such demonstrated utility and reliance, there is no question the US must guarantee space access if it is to be successful in future conflicts. Its military has stepped well over the threshold of a new way of war. It is simply not possible to go back to the violently spasmodic mode of combat typical of pre-space intervention. The United States is now highly discriminating in the projection of violence, parsimonious in the intended breadth of its destruction. For the positive process of transformation to continue, however, space weapons must enter the combat inventory of the United States.<br />

<strong>Only option is to weaponize space – critical to preserving hegemony. Weaponization by other nations inevitable – US needs to be first to prevent arms race</strong><br />

<br />
This is the context in which the world now exists. The relatively stable global hegemony of US dominance since 1945, punctuated by limited wars and shifting balances of opposition, has relied on technology-dominant global power projection. Today, that technology is wholly integrated and inextricable from space support, and no state relies more on space power for its economic and security well-being than the US. Any effort to deny space capabilities would be a direct challenge to its hegemonic power, and the United States must confront the usurper or abdicate its leadership position. To be sure, China’s increasing space emphasis and its cultural antipathy to military transparency suggests that a serious attempt at seizing control of space is in the works. A lingering fear is the sudden introduction of an unknown capability (call it Technology X) that would allow a hostile state to place multiple weapons into orbit quickly and cheaply. The advantages gained from controlling the high ground of space would accrue to it as surely as to any other state, and the concomitant loss of military power from the denial of space to America’s already-dependent military forces could cause the immediate demise of the extant international system. The longer the United States dithers on its military responsibilities, the more likely a potential opponent could seize low-earth orbit before America is able to respond. And in such circumstances, the US certainly would respond. Conversely, if America were to weaponize space, it is not at all sure that any other state or group of states would find it rational to counter in kind. The entry cost to provide the necessary infrastructure is still too high—hundreds of billions of dollars, at minimum. The years of investment needed to achieve a comparable counter-force capability—essentially from scratch—would provide more than ample time for the United States to entrench itself in space and readily counter preliminary efforts to displace it. The tremendous effort in time and resources would be worse than wasted. Most states, if not all, would opt not to counter US deployments directly. They might oppose American interests with asymmetric balancing, depending on how aggressively it uses its new power, but the likelihood of a hemorrhaging arms race in space should the United States deploy weapons first—at least for the next few years—is remote. This reasoning does not dispute the fact that US deployment of weapons in outer space would represent the addition of a potent new military capacity, one that would assist in extending the current period of American hegemony well into the future. Clearly this would be intimidating, and America must expect severe condemnation and increased competition in peripheral areas. But such an outcome is less threatening than another, particularly non-liberal authoritarian state doing so, as the necessity of a response in kind is compelling. Placement of weapons in space by the United States would be perceived correctly as an attempt at continuing American hegemony. Although there is obvious opposition to the current international balance of power, the majority of states seem to regard it as at least tolerable. A continuation of the status quo is thus minimally acceptable, even to states working toward its demise. As long as the United States does not employ its power arbitrarily, the situation would be bearable initially and grudgingly accepted over time. Mirror-imaging does not apply here. An attempt by China to dominate space would be part of an effort to break the land-sea-air dominance of the United States in preparation for a new international order. Such an action would challenge the status quo, rather than seek to perpetuate it. This would be disconcerting to nations that accept, no matter how grudgingly, the current international order—including the venerable institutions of trade, finance, and law that operate within it—and intolerable to the United States. As leader of the current system, the United States could do no less than engage in a perhaps ruinous space arms race, save graciously decide to step aside and accept a diminished world status. Seizing the initiative and securing low-Earth orbit now, while the United States is dominant in space infrastructure, would do much to stabilize the international system and prevent an arms race in space. The enhanced ability to deny any attempt by another nation to place military assets in space and to readily engage and destroy terrestrial anti-satellite capacity would make the possibility of large-scale space war or military space races less likely, not more. Why would a state expend the effort to compete in space with a superpower that has the extraordinary advantage of holding securely the highest ground at the top of the gravity well? So long as the controlling state demonstrates a capacity and a will to use force to defend its position, in effect expending a small amount of violence as needed to prevent a greater conflagration in the future, the likelihood of a future war in space is remote.<br />

<strong>BP solves ballistic missiles and is imperative to US heg via deterrence – even perception of space leadership key to US military and economic primacy</strong><br />
<strong>IFPA 9,</strong> (Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, “Missile Defense, the space Relationship, &amp; the Twenty-First Century”) Amy<br />
A symptom of this problem is the fact that, in spite of a commitment to protecting the United States from ballistic missile attack, little has been done to revive the cutting-edge technologies developed in the 1980s and early 1990s – technologies that produced the most effective, least costly ways to defend the U.S. homeland, its deployed troops, and its international partners from the threat of ballistic missile attack. The most impressive of these initiatives was Brilliant Pebbles. By 1992, that initiative – entailing the deployment of a constellation of small, advanced kill-vehicles in space – had developed a cheap, effective means of destroying enemy ballistic missiles in all modes of flight. Yet in the early 1990s, along with a number of other promising programs, it fell victim to a systematic eradication of space-based technologies that marked the closing years of the twentieth century and still impedes the development of the most effective missile defense today. The current state of affairs surrounding missile defense carries profound implications for the safety and security of the United States, and its role on the world stage in the decades to come. Without the means to dissuade, deter, and defeat a growing number of strategic adversaries, the United States will be unable to maintain its status of global leadership. The creation of effective defenses against ballistic missile attack remains central to this task. Historically, it is evident that the major geopolitical options that become available have been exploited by one nation or another. Those nations that are most successful in recognizing and acting on such options have become dominant. Others that have failed or have consciously decided not to do so are relegated to inferior political status. A salient case in point is ocean navigation and exploration. The Chinese were the first to become preeminent in this retrospectively pivotal area during the early Ming dynasty. However, domestic politics – strongly resembling missile defense politics in the United States of the past several decades – allowed this great national lead to be dissipated, with historic consequences felt until the present day, a full half millennium later. The subsequent assumption by Portugal of this leading maritime role resulted in geopolitical preeminence that was eventually lost to other powers. In the twenty-first century, maintenance of its present lead in space may indeed be pivotal to the basic geopolitical, military, and economic status of the United States. Consolidation of the preeminent U.S. position in space akin to Britain’s dominance of the oceans in the nineteenth century is not an option, but rather a necessity, for if not the United States, some other nation, or nations, will aspire to this role, as several others already do. For the United States, space is a crucially important twenty-first century geopolitical setting that includes a global missile defense. As American policy makers look ahead, new momentum and direction are needed in the pursuit of a truly global missile defense capability that incorporates space-based interdiction capabilities and addresses the current and emerging threats of the twenty-first century security setting. This updated edition of the IWG Report first published in 2006 contains new information and takes account of accomplishments and challenges that have arisen in recent years. It also addresses such issues as costs and timelines, together with other topics directly related to missile defense such as the evolving threat environment. The updated report is intended as an educational tool for those who seek to understand more fully the national security implications of missile defense and the requirements for missile defense.<br />

<strong>Heg key to global stability and accesses every major impact</strong><br />
<strong>Thayer</strong>, Professor of Strategic Studies, <strong>6</strong> - Associate Professor of Defense and Strategic Study @ Missouri State University, Former Research Fellow @ International Security Program @ Harvard Belfer Center of Science and International Affairs (Bradley, “In Defense of Primacy,” The National Interest, November/December)<br />
<br />
A grand strategy based on American primacy means ensuring the United States stays the world's number one power the diplomatic, economic and military leader. Those arguing against primacy claim that the United States should retrench, ei¬ther because the United States lacks the power to maintain its primacy and should withdraw from its global commitments, or because the maintenance of primacy will lead the United States into the trap of &quot;imperial overstretch.&quot; In the previous issue of The National Interest, Christopher Layne warned of these dangers of pri¬macy and called for retrenchment.1 Those arguing for a grand strategy of retrenchment are a diverse lot. They include isolationists, who want no foreign military commitments; selective engagers, who want U.S. military commitments to centers of economic might; and offshore balancers, who want a modified form of selective engagement that would have the United States abandon its landpower presence abroad in favor of relying on airpower and seapower to defend its in¬terests. But retrenchment, in any of its guis¬es, must be avoided. If the United States adopted such a strategy, it would be a profound strategic mistake that would lead to far greater instability and war in the world, imperil American security and deny the United States and its allies the benefits of primacy. There are two critical issues in any discussion of America's grand strategy: Can America remain the dominant state? Should it strive to do this? America can remain dominant due to its prodigious military, economic and soft power capa-bilities. The totality of that equation of power answers the first issue. The United States has overwhelming military capa¬bilities and wealth in comparison to other states or likely potential alliances. Barring some disaster or tremendous folly, that will remain the case for the foreseeable future. With few exceptions, even those who advocate retrenchment acknowledge this. So the debate revolves around the desirability of maintaining American pri¬macy. Proponents of retrenchment focus a great deal on the costs of U.S. action¬ but they fall to realize what is good about American primacy. The price and risks of primacy are reported in newspapers every day; the benefits that stem from it are not. A GRAND strategy of ensur¬ing American primacy takes as its starting point the protec¬tion of the U.S. homeland and American global interests. These interests include ensuring that critical resources like oil flow around the world, that the global trade and monetary regimes flourish and that Washington's worldwide network of allies is reassured and protected. Allies are a great asset to the United States, in part because they shoulder some of its burdens. Thus, it is no surprise to see NATO in Afghanistan or the Australians in East Timor. In contrast, a strategy based on re¬trenchment will not be able to achieve these fundamental objectives of the United States. Indeed, retrenchment will make the United States less secure than the present grand strategy of primacy. This is because threats will exist no mat¬ter what role America chooses to play in international politics. Washington can¬not call a &quot;time out&quot;, and it cannot hide from threats. Whether they are terror¬ists, rogue states or rising powers, his¬tory shows that threats must be confront¬ed. Simply by declaring that the United States is &quot;going home&quot;, thus abandoning its commitments or making unconvinc¬ing half pledges to defend its interests and allies, does not mean that others will respect American wishes to retreat. To make such a declaration implies weak¬ness and emboldens aggression. In the anarchic world of the animal kingdom, predators prefer to eat the weak rather than confront the strong. The same is true of the anarchic world of interna¬tional politics. If there is no diplomatic solution to the threats that confront the United States, then the conventional and strategic military power of the United States is what protects the country from such threats. And when enemies must be confront¬ed, a strategy based on primacy focuses on engaging enemies overseas, away from .American soil. Indeed, a key tenet of the Bush Doctrine is to attack terrorists far from America's shores and not to wait while they use bases in other countries to plan and train for attacks against the United States itself. This requires a phys¬ical, on the ground presence that cannot be achieved by offshore balancing. Indeed, as Barry Posen has noted, U.S. primacy is secured because America, at present, commands the &quot;global com¬mon&quot; the oceans, the world's airspace and outer space allowing the United States to project its power far from its borders, while denying those common avenues to its enemies. As a consequence, the costs of power projection for the United States and its allies are reduced, and the robustness of the United States' conventional and strategic deterrent ca¬pabilities is increased.' This is not an advantage that should be relinquished lightly. A remarkable fact about international politics today -in a world where Ameri¬can primacy is clearly and unambiguous¬ly on display--is that countries want to align themselves with the United States. Of course, this is not out of any sense of altruism, in most cases, but because doing so allows them to use the power of the United States for their own purposes, ¬their own protection, or to gain greater influence. Of 192 countries, 84 are allied with America -their security is tied to the United States through treaties and other informal arrangements and they include almost all of the major economic and military powers. That is a ratio of almost 17 to one (85 to five), and a big change from the Cold War when the ratio was about 1.8 to one of states aligned with the United States versus the Soviet Union. Never before in its history has this coun¬try, or any country, had so many allies. U.S. primacy -and the bandwagon¬ing effect has also given us extensive in¬fluence in international politics, allowing the United States to shape the behavior of states and international institutions. Such influence comes in many forms, one of which is America's ability to cre¬ate coalitions of like minded states to free Kosovo, stabilize Afghanistan, invade Iraq or to stop proliferation through the Pro¬liferation Security Initiative (PSI). Doing so allows the United States to operate with allies outside of the where it can be stymied by opponents. American led wars in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq stand in contrast to the UN's inability to save the people of Darfur or even to conduct any military campaign to realize the goals of its charter. The quiet effec¬tiveness of the PSI in dismantling Libya's WMD programs and unraveling the A. Q. Khan proliferation network are in sharp relief to the typically toothless attempts by the UN to halt proliferation. You can count with one hand coun¬tries opposed to the United States. They are the &quot;Gang of Five&quot;: China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Venezeula. Of course, countries like India, for example, do not agree with all policy choices made by the United States, such as toward Iran, but New Delhi is friendly to Washington. Only the &quot;Gang of Five&quot; may be expected to consistently resist the agenda and ac¬tions of the United States. China is clearly the most important of these states because it is a rising great power. But even Beijing is intimidated by the United States and refrains from openly challenging U.S. power. China proclaims that it will, if necessary, re¬sort to other mechanisms of challenging the United States, including asymmetric strategies such as targeting communica¬tion and intelligence satellites upon which the United States depends. But China may not be confident those strategies would work, and so it is likely to refrain from testing the United States directly for the foreseeable future because China's power benefits, as we shall see, from the international order U.S. primacy creates. The other states are far weaker than China. For three of the &quot;Gang of Five&quot; cases Venezuela, Iran, Cuba it is an anti U.S. regime that is the source of the problem; the country itself is not intrin¬sically anti American. Indeed, a change of regime in Caracas, Tehran or Havana could very well reorient relations. THROUGHOUT HISTORY, peace and stability have been great benefits of an era where there was a dominant power Rome, Britain or the United States today. Schol¬ars and statesmen have long recognized the irenic effect of power on the anarchic world of international politics. Everything we think of when we con¬sider the current international order free trade, a robust monetary regime, increas¬ing respect for human rights, growing de¬mocratization is directly linked to U.S. power. Retrenchment proponents seem to think that the current system can be maintained without the current amount of U.S. power behind it. In that they are dead wrong and need to be reminded of one of history's most significant lessons: Appalling things happen when international orders collapse. The Dark Ages fol¬lowed Rome's collapse. Hitler succeeded the order established at Versailles. With¬out U.S. power, the liberal order cre¬ated by the United States will end just as assuredly. As country and western great Rai Donner sang: &quot;You don't know what you've got (until you lose it).&quot; Consequently, it is important to note what those good things are. In addition to ensuring the security of the United States and its allies, American primacy within the international system causes many positive outcomes for Washing¬ton and the world. The first has been a more peaceful world. During the Cold War, U.S. leadership reduced friction among many states that were historical antagonists, most notably France and West Germany. Today, American primacy helps keep a number of complicated rela¬tionships aligned -between Greece and Turkey, Israel and Egypt, South Korea and Japan, India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia. This is not to say it fulfills Woodrow Wilson's vision of ending all war. Wars still occur where Washington's interests are not seriously threatened, such as in Darfur, but a Pax Americana does reduce war's likelihood, particularly war's worst form: great power wars. Second, American power gives the United States the ability to spread de¬mocracy and other elements of its ideol¬ogy of liberalism. Doing so is a source of much good for the countries concerned as well as the United States because, as John Owen noted on these pages in the Spring 2006 issue, liberal democracies are more likely to align with the United States and be sympathetic to the American worldview.3 So, spreading democracy helps maintain U.S. primacy. In addition, once states are governed democratically, the likelihood of any type of conflict is significantly reduced. This is not because democracies do not have clashing inter¬ests. Indeed they do. Rather, it is because they are more open, more transparent and more likely to want to resolve things amicably in concurrence with U.S. lead¬ership. And so, in general, democratic states are good for their citizens as well as for advancing the interests of the United States. Critics have faulted the Bush Admin¬istration for attempting to spread democ¬racy in the Middle East, labeling such an effort a modern form of tilting at windmills. It is the obligation of Bush's crit¬ics to explain why democracy is good enough for Western states but not for the rest, and, one gathers from the argument, should not even be attempted. Of course, whether democracy in the Middle East will have a peaceful or sta¬bilizing influence on America's interests in the short run is open to question. Per¬haps democratic Arab states would be more opposed to Israel, but nonetheless, their people would be better off. The United States has brought democracy to Afghanistan, where 8.5 million Af¬ghans, 40 percent of them women, voted in a critical October 2004 election, even though remnant Taliban forces threat¬ened them. The first free elections were held in Iraq in January 2005. It was the military power of the United States that put Iraq on the path to democracy. Wash¬ington fostered democratic governments in Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Caucasus. Now even the Middle East is increasingly democratic. They may not yet look like Western style democracies, but democratic progress has been made in Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Iraq, Ku¬wait, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt. By all accounts, the march of democracy has been impressive. Third, along with the growth in the number of democratic states around the world has been the growth of the glob¬al economy. With its allies, the United States has labored to create an economically liberal worldwide network character¬ized by free trade and commerce, respect for international property rights, and mo¬bility of capital and labor markets. The economic stability and prosperity that stems from this economic order is a glob¬al public good from which all states ben¬efit, particularly the poorest states in the Third World. The United States created this network not out of altruism but for the benefit and the economic well being of America. This economic order forces American industries to be competitive, maximizes efficiencies and growth, and benefits defense as well because the size of the economy makes the defense burden manageable. Economic spin offs foster the development of military technology, helping to ensure military prowess. Perhaps the greatest testament to the benefits of the economic network comes from Deepak Lal, a former Indian foreign service diplomat and researcher at the World Bank, who started his ca¬reer confident in the socialist ideology of post independence India. Abandoning the positions of his youth, Lal now recog¬nizes that the only way to bring relief to desperately poor countries of the Third World is through the adoption of free market economic policies and globaliza¬tion, which are facilitated through Amer¬ican primacy.4 As a witness to the failed alternative economic systems, Lal is one of the strongest academic proponents of American primacy due to the economic prosperity it provides.<br />

<br />
Dolman: Well, I think that some assumptions that you made are extremely problematic. You know, the Soviet Union launched twenty ASATs into space and those were the worst of debris smashing into other satellites. Did that cause a debris problem? No, because it is a planned orbital mechanics issue that the kinetic force of that engagement goes into the atmosphere and debris is burned up on reentry. There are thus ways to use weapons in space that don’t really cause a debris problem, and there are ways to use them that ac-tually clean up space in orbit. But also I agree with you. No hegemon, no empire, no state or business lasts forever. Does that mean that we should accelerate our own decline? No. It is important to do things to extend it. The United States inevitably will lose its power relative to the rest of the world, so it needs to set up the conditions that are seen as beneficial around the world in such a way that whoever replaces the United States is going to be in the same sort of liberal mode that the United States had been, the same type of benevolent hegemon or follow-on power. What it cannot do is set up a situation where the next power is likely to be antithetical to those ideas. What I am talking about is extending the period of American hegemony into the foreseeable future, not creating a permanent empire in that sense, but continuing to have a situation where there is a power to create and enforce some sort of order.<br />

There is little reason to believe the United States will forego the capacity to influence decisions and events beyond its borders, with military force if necessary. Whether that capacity comes from space as well as the other military domains is undetermined. But, the operational deployment of space weapons would increase that capacity by providing for nearly instantaneous force projection worldwide. This force would be precise, unstoppable, and deadly. At the same time, the United States would forgo some of its ability to intervene directly in other states because the necessary budget tradeoffs would diminish its capacity to do so. A space-heavy American military would structurally limit potential American imperial ambitions while simultaneously extending its global leadership role. The need to limit collateral damage, the requirement for precision to allay the low volume of fire, and the tremendous cost of space weapons will ensure they are used for high-value, time-sensitive targets. An opposing state’s calculation of survival no longer would depend on interpreting whether or not the United States desires to be a good neighbor; whether it will invade and occupy its territory. Without sovereignty at risk, fear of a space-dominant American military will subside. The United States will maintain its position of hegemony as well as its security, and the world will not be threatened by the specter of a future American empire.<br />

Space weapons are expensive; alternatives are cheaper and just as effective. This is the first argument against space weaponization, although it is an easy one to set aside. Of course space weapons are expensive—very expensive, though not necessarily more expensive than terrestrially based systems that may accomplish the same objectives, not to mention objectives that cannot be met otherwise—but so are all revolutionary technologies, particularly those that pioneer a new medium. Furthermore, the state that achieves cutting-edge military technology first has historically been the recipient of tremendous battlefield advantage, and so pursuit of cut-ting-edge technology continues— despite the enormous cost. Moreover, the cultural and economic infrastructure that allows for and promotes innovation in the highest technologies tends to remain at the forefront of international influence. All empires decline and eventually are subsumed, but it has not been their search for the newest technologies or desire to stay at the forefront of innovation that causes their declines. Rather, it has been the policies of those states, generally an overexpansion of imperial control or an economic decision to freeze technologies, that result in their stagnation and demise. Space and space technology represent both the resources and the innovation that can keep a liberal and responsible American hegemony in place for decades, if not centuries, to come; furthermore, unless America maintains this technological edge, it will likely lose its preeminence.<br />

The Response Given this multiplicity of ballistic missile threats, the Unit¬ed States must deploy a missile defense that deters hostile states from developing or acquiring missile capabilities that could threaten the United States, its allies and coalition part¬ners, and its forces deployed abroad. Furthermore, America’s missile defense R&amp;D programs, together with planned de¬ployments, must be sufficiently robust to dissuade would-be missile possessors from attempting to challenge the United States. Washington must deter future enemies from acquir¬ing ballistic missiles, just as in the past it dissuaded them from developing strategic bombers because of America’s abil¬ity to overwhelm such systems. Finally, U.S. missile defense must be capable of defeating those ballistic missiles, what¬ever their range and type, that could be launched against the United States. U.S. and allied ballistic missile defense capabilities are an essential element of a broader damage limitation strat¬egy. The purpose of this strategy is to protect and defend the people, territory, infrastructure, and institutions of the United States and its allies to the greatest extent possible. This strategy is a marked departure from the retaliation-based deterrence strategy of the Cold War. It is a strategy specifically tailored to meeting the security demands result¬ing from the emerging multi-polar world, which has been brought about, at least in part, by the proliferation of bal¬listic missiles and nuclear weapons. A mix of offensive and defensive strategic forces, which are modernized to meet the new and challenging requirements of this strategy, will be necessary. Thus, a global and layered ballistic missile de¬fense system must be intricately linked to other strategic forces, where the broader strategic posture of the U.S. and its allies results in security benefits that are greater than the sum of its parts. As the United States dissuades future potential possess¬ors, it must recognize that threats are increasing at a pace that no longer allows the luxury of long lead times within which a missile defense could be developed and deployed. Therefore, the United States must develop and rapidly field a missile defense with global reach, capable of coping with threats against the United States and its forces and allies from any direction. At the same time, America must attempt to dissuade hostile actors from acquiring missiles by render¬ing such investments a poor use of limited resources. Ad-ditionally, given the uncertainty in predicting where, when, and by whom missiles might be launched – and what their targets may be – constant defenses are called for that are capable of intercepting missiles irrespective of their geo¬graphic origin. Other things being equal, it is preferable to intercept threatening ballistic missiles as far away from their intend¬ed targets and as early in their flight trajectory as possible. Best of all would be to have the capability to destroy an at¬tacking missile shortly after it is launched, while its rockets still burn and any perturbation will lead to its destruction – with, in many cases, the debris falling back onto the area from which the attack was launched in the first place. The ca¬pability to interdict a missile and its warheads in any phases of their flight (boost, midcourse, and terminal) requires an ability to detect and intercept the attack within a very few minutes and to track and destroy the attacking missile and its warheads during their longer midcourse traverse through space before they reenter the atmosphere. Finally, the last-ditch defense would be to destroy the attacking missiles as they reenter and pass through the atmosphere – and as ac¬companying debris and decoys burn up on reentry – in the terminal phase en route to their targets. The best defense ca¬ pability would be layered so that it could provide opportuni¬ties for destruction in all three phases of flight. Only space-based defenses inherently have this global capability and permanence. While sea-based defenses can move freely through the two-thirds of the earth’s surface that are oceans, their capability is limited by geography and by the specific operations of the fleet – including where the sea-based missile defense happens to be deployed at any given time, and how quickly it could be redeployed to meet a crisis situation. Air-based and ground-based defenses, meanwhile, can have global capabilities, but frequently take considerable time to deploy when and where needed and are also depen¬dent on the cooperation of U.S. friends and allies in permit¬ting the necessary supporting activities on their territories. Thus, only a space-based missile defense will possess both constancy and global availability, irrespective of allied sup¬port and agreement. As such, space-based missile defense constitutes the only truly global system, with all the rest be¬ing either regional or local.91 In the case of sea-based systems, namely the Aegis pro¬gram discussed in section 2, we have a regional system ca¬pable of boost-phase, midcourse, and terminal intercept de¬pending on where and how it is positioned, or vectored. It has a near-global application for regional operations, be¬cause it is sea-based and theoretically it can be deployed over any portion of the earth’s surface covered by oceans. A land-based system can theoretically be deployed anywhere over about one-third of the world’s surface and, depending on how it is vectored, under some limited conditions would also be capable of boost-phase, midcourse, and terminal in¬terception. Yet space-based missile defense alone is truly global in reach because of the medium in which it oper¬ates, unconstrained by overflight or territorial restrictions. It also offers inherent interdiction advantages, described in greater detail below.<br />

SBMD progressed through various programs, such as GPALS, Brilliant Pebbles, Clementine, and SBL, despite dwindling support from presidential administrations following President Reagan’s. Pres. George W. Bush paved the way for the next administration to put SBMD on the international agenda. According to The National Security Strategy of the United States of America(2006), the United States may need new approaches to deter state and nonstate actors and deny them the objectives of their attacks.50 Additionally, the National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction (2002) states that “today’s threats are far more diverse and less predictable than those of the past. States hostile to the United States and to our friends and allies have demonstrated their willingness to take high risks to achieve their goals, and are aggressively pursuing WMD and their means of delivery as critical tools in this effort. As a consequence, we require new methods of deterrence.”51Cooperation on missile defense initiatives could increase global stability. By banding together in coalitions, countries can deter war by repelling an attack against any member.52 States and rogue elements will not be able to strike surreptitiously if they know that the international community could quickly discern the origin of any launch and compute potential impact points. Attempts by a rogue element to destabilize the region through the attribution of attacks to a state may initially promote the rogue elements own agenda. However, data provided by missile defense and other sensors can refute such claims. The shared international ability to identify launch and impact points might deter states and rogue elements from launching in the first place. The more nations cooperate with each other, the more stable the world becomes. Policymakers need to invest in the development of many different capabilities, including SBMD, to negate missiles in their boost phase and use the information gleaned from these developments to inform decisions. One approach involves bringing a system to the prototype stage for testing and accurately gauging its performance. This approach could let the United States invest in only a limited number of prototypes, thus deferring large-scale production to allow further research, development, and testing. These efforts could decrease the risk of failure during production and deployment.53 When the need arises, the United States should capitalize on preexisting prototypes as long as the industrial base could support rapid production. By funding R&amp;D for SBMD, the United States would ensure the viability of these technologies. The DOD cannot expect developments in commercial industry to be available for national security purposes. Competitive pressures force industry to fund near-term R&amp;D programs and choose near-term survival over long-term possibilities.54 Applied research into SBMD technologies would allow the United States to gain more knowledge about boost-phase defenses. America will get as much R&amp;D in SBMD technologies as it is willing to fund.<br />

Note: First 2 sentences are myths which the author intends to challenge.<br />
<br />
Space is too vast to be controlled. If one state weaponizes, then all other states will follow suit, and a crippling arms race in space will ensue. Space is indeed vast, but a quick analysis of the fundamentals of space terrain and geography shows that control of just LEO would be tantamount to a global gate or checkpoint for entrance into space, a position that could not be flanked and would require an incredible exertion of military power to dislodge. Thus, the real question quickly becomes not whether the United States should weaponize space first, but whether it can afford to be the second to weaponize space. Space has been dubbed the ultimate high ground (see figure 19–2). As with the high ground throughout history, whosoever sits ensconced upon it accrues incredible benefit on the terrestrial battlefield. This comes from the dual advantages of enhanced span of command acuity (visibility and control) and kinetic power. It is simply easier and more powerful to shoot down the hill than up it. The pace of technological development, particularly in microsatellites and networked operations, could allow a major spacefaring state to quickly establish enough independent kinetic kill vehicles in LEO (through multiple payload launches) to effectively deny entry or transit to any other state. Currently, the United States has the infrastructure and capacity to do so; China may in the very near future. Russia is also a potential candidate for a space coup. Should any one of these states put enough weapons in orbit, they could engage and shoot down attempts to place counterspace assets in orbit, effectively taking control of outer space. Indeed, the potential to be gained from ensuring spacepower projection while denying that capability in others is so great that some state, some day, will make the attempt. In order to ensure that no one tries, space weapons opponents argue that the best defense is a good example. So long as the United States does not make any effort to weaponize space, why would any competing state be tempted to do so? And even if another state does attempt it, the United States has the infrastructure to quickly follow suit and commence a campaign of retrieval in space. Not only does the logic escape us, but also it seems that by waiting, the United States is guaranteeing what space weapons opponents fear most: a space arms race.<br />

The United States and South Korea have totally disregarded North Korea's repeated objections by launching the 10-day joint war games Ulchi Freedom Guardian on August 16, involving 530,000 forces from the United States, South Korea and seven other countries. The number of US-led multilateral combat troops is more than enough to undertake a surprise invasion of North Korea. Objectives of the games It is all too obvious that in their multilateral war games, the Americans seek an opportunity to invade North Korea, capture its top leadership and establish a pro-American regime. Tokyo's Asahi Shimbun August 13 quoted military sources as revealing that far from defensive, the war game is part of the US-South Korea joint operation plan &quot;5027&quot;, with troops training for a wide variety of missions, including a full-scale multilateral coalition invasion of North Korea, and a bid to capture supreme leader Kim Jong-il and topple the North Korean regime. Agence France-Presse reported on August 7 that one of the key objectives of the exercises was a search and destroy mission for North Korean nuclear weapons: &quot;US and South Korean troops will practice destroying North Korean weapons of mass destruction during an annual joint exercise this month to improve their combat-readiness,&quot; according to a report. &quot;The allies will form a combined unit called the Joint Task Force for Elimination (JTF-E) when they begin a 10-day Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise on August 16,&quot; South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. It seems the Americans are mad enough to risk initiating war with North Korea. A North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman stated on August 17: The US is staging exercises for a war of aggression against its dialogue partner while putting up signboard of dialogue. This incoherent behavior on the part of the US is only adding to the skepticism about whether it is sincere towards dialogue or not. It is very ill-boding that the US let &quot;a special action unit&quot; participate in the on-going joint military exercises as it is one tasked with detecting and destroying nuclear weapons of the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea]. The prevailing situation goes to prove that the US is not set to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula through dialogue and negotiations but sees an opportunity to deprive it of nuclear deterrent by a brigandish method. No attempt on the part of the US to do harm to the DPRK by force of arms can go with dialogue. This will only face the mode of merciless counteraction of Korean-style. Nobel Peace Prize winning Barack Obama is most likely to be the first American president who will be fighting six aggressive wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Libya, Yemen and Korea, to paraphrase the words of former Reuters columnist Sherwood Ross.

Any incident in Korea by design, accident, or miscalculation could erupt into a devastating DPRK-US war, with the Metropolitan US serving as a main war theater. Rodong Sinmun warned on August 16: &quot;The Korean Peninsula is faced with the worst crisis ever. An all-out war can be triggered by any accident.&quot; Recent incidents illustrate the real danger of miscalculation leading to a total shooting war, given the volatile situation on the Land of Morning Calm. 1. The most recent case in point is the August 10 shelling of North Korea by the South. Frightened South Korea marines on Yeonpyeong Island mistook three noises from a North Korean construction site across the narrow channel for artillery rounds, taking an hour to respond with three to five artillery rounds. The episode serves as a potent reminder to the world that the slightest incident can lead to war. A reportedly malfunctioning firefinder counter-artillery radar system seems to partly account for the panicky South Korean reaction. South Korean conservative newspaper the Joong Ang Daily reported August 17: &quot;A military source said that radar installed to detect hostile fire did not work last week when North Korea fired five shots toward the Northern Limit Line (NLL), the disputed maritime border, on Aug 10. &quot;'We must confirm the location of the source of the firing through the ARTHUR (Artillery Hunting Radar) and HALO (hostile artillery location) systems, but ARTHUR failed to operate, resulting in a failure to determine the source of the fire,' said the source.&quot; BBC reported on November 25 last year the aggressive nature of troops on the South Korea-held five islands in North Korean waters. &quot;Seen in this sense, they (five islands including Yeonpyeong Island) could provide staging bases for flanking amphibious attacks into North Korea if South Korea ever takes the offensive.&quot; 2. An almost catastrophic incident took place at dawn on June 17 near Inchon. South Korean marines stationed on Gyodong Island near Inchon Airport fired rifles at a civilian South Korean jetliner Airbus A320 with 119 people aboard as it was descending to land, after mistaking it for a North Korean military aircraft. The Asiana Airlines flight was carrying 119 people from the Chinese city of Chengdu. About 600 civilian aircraft fly near the island every day, including those flying across the NLL, but they face a perennial risk of being misidentified as a hostile warplane. It is nothing short of a miracle that the Airbus A320 was not hit and nobody harmed. 3. On March 26, 2010, the high-tech South Korean corvette Sokcho fired 130 rounds at flocks of birds, mistaking them for a hostile flying object. The innocent birds looked like a North Korean warplane just at a time when an alleged North Korean midget submarine had managed to escape with impunity after torpedoing the hapless Cheonan deep inside security-tight South Korean waters. The South Korean military's habit of firing at the wrong target increases the risk of an incident running out of control. CNN aired a story December 16, headlined: &quot;General: South Korea Drill Could Cause Chain Reaction.&quot; F/A-18 pilot-turned Marine Corp General James Cartwright told the press in the Pentagon, &quot;What we worry about, obviously, is if that it [the drill] is misunderstood or if it's taken advantage of as an opportunity. &quot;If North Korea were to react to that in a negative way and fire back at those firing positions on the islands, that would start potentially a chain reaction of firing and counter-firing. &quot;What you don't want to have happen out of that is ... for us to lose control of the escalation. That's the concern.&quot; Agence France-Presse on December 11 quoted former chief of US intelligence retired admiral Dennis Blair as saying that South Korea &quot;will be taking military action against North Korea&quot;. New Korean war differs from other wars Obama and the Americans seem to be incapable of realizing that North Korea is the wrong enemy, much less that a new Korean War would be fundamentally different from all other wars including the two world wars. Two things will distinguish a likely American Conflict or DPRK-US War from previous wars. The first essential difference is that the US mainland will become the main theater of war for the first time since the US Civil War (1861-1865), giving the Americans an opportunity to know what it is like to have war fought on their own land, not on faraway soil. The US previously prospered by waging aggressive wars on other countries. Thus far, the Americans could afford to feel safe and comfortable while watching TV footage of war scenes from Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Libya as if they were fires raging across the river. The utmost collateral damage has been that some American veterans were killed or returned home as amputees, with post traumatic stress disorder, only to be left unemployed and homeless. However, this will no longer be the case. At long last, it is Americans' turn to have see their homeland ravaged. An young North Korea in 1950-53 was unable to carry the war all the way across the Pacific Ocean to strike back, but the present-day North Korea stands out as a fortress nuclear weapons state that can withstand massive American ICBM (Intercontinental ballistic missile) attacks and launch direct retaliatory transpacific strikes on the Metropolitan USA. The second essential difference is that the next war in Korea, that is, the American Conflict or the DPRK-USA War would be the first actual full-fledged nuclear, thermonuclear war that mankind has ever seen, in no way similar to the type of nuclear warfare described in science fiction novels or films. North Korea is unique among the nuclear powers in two respects: One is that the Far Eastern country, founded by legendary peerless hero Kim Il-sung, is the first country to engage and badly maul the world's only superpower in three years of modern warfare when it was most powerful, after vanquishing Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. The other is that North Korea is fully ready to go the length of fighting mankind's first and last nuclear exchange with the US. The DPRK led by two Kim Il-sungs - the ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander Kim Jong-il and his heir designate Kim Jong-eun - is different from Russia under Nikita Khrushchev which backed down in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Khrushchev and his company never fought the Americans in war. As a rule, most countries are afraid to engage the Americans. As the case is with them, North Korea is the last to favor war with the Americans. However, it is no exaggeration to say that the two North Korean leaders are just one click away from ordering a retaliatory nuclear strike on the US military forces in Guam, Hawaii and metropolitan centers on the US mainland. On behalf of Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-eun will fire highly destructive weapons of like Americans have never heard of or imagined to evaporate the US. The North Koreans are too proud of being descendents of the ancient civilizations of Koguryo 2,000 years ago and Dankun Korea 5,000 years ago, to leave the Land of morning Calm divided forever with the southern half under the control of the trigger-happy, predatory US. The North Koreans prefer to fight and die in honor rather than kowtow to the arrogant Americans. At the expense of comforts of a better life, North Koreans have devoted more than half a century to preparing for nuclear war with the Americans. All available resources have been used to convert the whole country into a fortress, including arming the entire population and indigenously turning out all types of nuclear thermonuclear weapons, and developing long-range delivery capabilities and digital warfare assets. An apocalyptic Day After Tommorow-like scenario will unfold throughout the US, with the skyscrapers of major cities consumed in a sea of thermonuclear conflagration. The nuclear exchange will begin with retaliatory North Korean ICBMs detonating hydrogen bombs in outer space far above the US mainland, leaving most of the country powerless. New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco and major cities should be torched by ICBMs streaking from North Korea with scores of nuclear power stations exploding, each spewing as much radioactive fallout as 150-180 H-bombs.<br />

<br />
STEPANAKERT, Nagorno-Karabakh — This is where the first war set off by the Soviet collapse took place. And it may be where the next one breaks out. Twenty years ago, Armenians and Azerbaijanis, unleashed from Soviet control, waged a bitter struggle for this mountainous region in the South Caucasus. A cease-fire was reached in 1994, after about 30,000 people had been killed, leaving Nagorno-Karabakh outside Azerbaijan’s control, as an unrecognized, de facto republic in the hands of ethnic Armenians. Since then, no one on either side has had the will to hammer out a settlement. Tension has been put to use by those in power — in Azerbaijan, in Armenia proper and here in separatist Nagorno-Karabakh. Democracy, human rights, an unfettered press, a genuine opposition — these are the sorts of things that get put aside in times of crisis. And here, the crisis has been going on for two decades and shows little sign of letting up. “The development of democracy has fallen hostage to the conflict,” said Masis Mayilian, Nagorno-Karabakh’s former foreign minister and a onetime candidate for president. “This is very handy for totalitarian regimes.” A renewal of the war would be a disaster for all concerned, unless it were very quick. On this they agree. The two sides are much more heavily armed than they were in 1991, especially Azerbaijan. It might be very difficult for Iran, Turkey and Russia to remain uninvolved — and impossible to confine the fighting to Nagorno-Karabakh itself. A major supply route used by the United States to provision troops in Afghanistan would be disrupted. But resistance to a peace settlement along the lines of a proposal sponsored by the United States, France and Russia has been stiff. “We share the wish that there be no war,” said Robert Bradtke, the U.S. diplomat involved in the talks. “But do the parties have the political will?” So far, they don’t. Azerbaijan and Armenia, which negotiates on behalf of Nagorno-Karabakh, say they support the international effort to find a way toward settling the first post-Soviet conflict. “It is high time to do it,” Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mamedyarov said recently in Moscow after meeting with his counterpart from Russia, which is especially intent on getting an agreement. But Azerbaijan also says that it will never formally surrender territory. And the people of Nagorno-Karabakh say they will never give up the right of self-determination. For two decades, both sides have kept passions inflamed, which turns out to be good politics for those at the top. But with snipers on both sides shooting at one another every day, occasionally causing casualties, and plenty of saber-rattling rhetoric, the chances of stumbling into a war of miscalculation, or a war of hotheadedness, are considerable. Tevan Poghosyan, who in the 1990s represented Karabakh in the United States and now runs a think tank in Yerevan, Armenia’s capital, said war is inevitable. It will take another round of fighting, he said, to “steam” the poison out.<br />

<strong>Escalates to nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Blank 2k</strong> – Stephen, Fall 2000, World Affairs, “Grand Strategy and the Transcaspian Region”, JSTOR, BBQ<br />
<br />
Russia's warnings about U.S. efforts to obtain military-political-economic leverage in the Transcaspian and the Russian elite's extreme sensitivity regarding the region show that Moscow will resolutely contest expanded U.S. presence. The war in Chechnya shows that Russia is willing to do so forcefully, if necessary. Russia's new draft military doctrine suggests that Moscow will threaten even World War III if there is Turkish intervention, yet the new Russo-Armenian and Azeri-Turkish treaties suggest just such a possibility.(75) Conceivably, the two larger states could then be dragged in to rescue their allies from defeat. The Russo-Armenian treaty is virtually a bilateral military alliance against Baku. It reaffirms Russia's lasting military presence in Armenia, commits Armenia not to join NATO, and could justify further fighting in Nagomo-Karabakh or further military pressure against Azerbaijan that will impede energy exploration and marketing.(76) It also reconfirms Russia's determination to resist U.S. presence and to remain the regional hegemon. Thus many structural conditions for conventional war or protracted ethnic conflict where third parties intervene now exist in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia. The outbreak of violence by disaffected Islamic elements, the drug trade, the Chechen wars, and the unresolved ethnopolitical conflicts that dot the region, not to mention the undemocratic and unbalanced distribution of income across corrupt governments, provide plenty of tinder for future fires. Many Third World conflicts generated by local structural factors also have great potential for unintended escalation. Big powers often feel obliged to rescue their proxies and proteges. One or another big power may fail to grasp the stakes for the other side since interests here are not as clear as in Europe. Hence commitments involving the use of nuclear weapons or perhaps even conventional war to prevent defeat of a client are not well established or clear as in Europe. For instance, in 1993 Turkish noises about intervening on behalf of Azerbaijan induced Russian leaders to threaten a nuclear war in that case. Precisely because Turkey is a NATO ally but probably could not prevail in a long war against Russia, or if it could, would conceivably trigger a potential nuclear blow (not a small possibility given the erratic nature of Russia's declared nuclear strategies), the danger of major war is higher here than almost everywhere else in the CIS or the &quot;arc of crisis&quot; from the Balkans to China. As Richard Betts has observed, The greatest danger lies in areas where (1) the potential for serious instability is high; (2) both superpowers perceive vital interests; (3) neither recognizes that the other's perceived interest or commitment is as great as its own; (4) both have the capability to inject conventional forces; and (5) neither has willing proxies capable of settling the situation.(77)<br />

<strong>Scenario Three is Accidental Launch</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Accidental Launch inevitable:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A. Cyberterrorism</strong><br />
<strong>Fritz 9</strong> – Jason Fritz (Director of New Media Learning &amp; Development and editor of the Office of Information Technology) May 2009 “Hacking Nuclear Command and Control” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:978:http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Jason_Fritz_Hacking_NC2.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Jason_Fritz_Hacking_NC2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Jason_Fritz_Hacking_NC2.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:978 --><br />
<br />
This paper will analyse the threat of cyber terrorism in regard to nuclear weapons. Specifically, this research will use open source knowledge to identify the structure of nuclear command and control centres, how those structures might be compromised through computer network operations, and how doing so would fit within established cyber terrorists’ capabilities, strategies, and tactics. If access to command and control centres is obtained, terrorists could fake or actually cause one nuclear-armed state to attack another, thus provoking a nuclear response from another nuclear power. This may be an easier alternative for terrorist groups than building or acquiring a nuclear weapon or dirty bomb themselves. This would also act as a force equaliser, and provide terrorists with the asymmetric benefits of high speed, removal of geographical distance, and a relatively low cost. Continuing difficulties in developing computer tracking technologies which could trace the identity of intruders, and difficulties in establishing an internationally agreed upon legal framework to guide responses to computer network operations, point towards an inherent weakness in using computer networks to manage nuclear weaponry. This is particularly relevant to reducing the hair trigger posture of existing nuclear arsenals. All computers which are connected to the internet are susceptible to infiltration and remote control. Computers which operate on a closed network may also be compromised by various hacker methods, such as privilege escalation, roaming notebooks, wireless access points, embedded exploits in software and hardware, and maintenance entry points. For example, e-mail spoofing targeted at individuals who have access to a closed network, could lead to the installation of a virus on an open network. This virus could then be carelessly transported on removable data storage between the open and closed network. Information found on the internet may also reveal how to access these closed networks directly. Efforts by militaries to place increasing reliance on computer networks, including experimental technology such as autonomous systems, and their desire to have multiple launch options, such as nuclear triad capability, enables multiple entry points for terrorists. For example, if a terrestrial command centre is impenetrable, perhaps isolating one nuclear armed submarine would prove an easier task. There is evidence to suggest multiple attempts have been made by hackers to compromise the extremely low radio frequency once used by the US Navy to send nuclear launch approval to submerged submarines. Additionally, the alleged Soviet system known as Perimetr was designed to automatically launch nuclear weapons if it was unable to establish communications with Soviet leadership. This was intended as a retaliatory response in the event that nuclear weapons had decapitated Soviet leadership; however it did not account for the possibility of cyber terrorists blocking communications through computer network operations in an attempt to engage the system. Should a warhead be launched, damage could be further enhanced through additional computer network operations. By using proxies, multi-layered attacks could be engineered. Terrorists could remotely commandeer computers in China and use them to launch a US nuclear attack against Russia. Thus Russia would believe it was under attack from the US and the US would believe China was responsible. Further, emergency response communications could be disrupted, transportation could be shut down, and disinformation, such as misdirection, could be planted, thereby hindering the disaster relief effort and maximizing destruction. Disruptions in communication and the use of disinformation could also be used to provoke uninformed responses. For example, a nuclear strike between India and Pakistan could be coordinated with Distributed Denial of Service attacks against key networks, so they would have further difficulty in identifying what happened and be forced to respond quickly. Terrorists could also knock out communications between these states so they cannot discuss the situation. Alternatively, amidst the confusion of a traditional large-scale terrorist attack, claims of responsibility and declarations of war could be falsified in an attempt to instigate a hasty military response. These false claims could be posted directly on Presidential, military, and government websites. E-mails could also be sent to the media and foreign governments using the IP addresses and e-mail accounts of government officials. A sophisticated and all encompassing combination of traditional terrorism and cyber terrorism could be enough to launch nuclear weapons on its own, without the need for compromising command and control centres directly.<br />

<strong>B. Russian and US safeguards will fail</strong><br />

<br />
It should be shocking that nearly 20 years after the Cold War our nuclear stance toward Russia is largely unchanged. While strictly speaking we no longer &quot;target&quot; Russia, we still have the previous, longstanding targeting plans plugged into the system, and it would only take a few minutes to bring those plans back online and make Russia a target again. Similarly, we still maintain an overall policy of &quot;launch on warning&quot; that initiates plans for a nuclear response strike in the event of a ballistic missile launch against the United States. “Launch on warning” was instigated by fears of a massive Soviet nuclear strike on US intercontinental ballistic missile sites and nuclear-capable bomber airfields. The short window of decision making under such circumstances means that a US president, once informed of indications of an incoming missile strike, would have as little as 15 minutes to decide whether or not to order a retaliatory nuclear strike. Once those nuclear missiles have been launched, there is no way to call them back or to disable them. Under the best of circumstances, this &quot;launch on warning&quot; approach—or &quot;hair trigger&quot; as it has come to be known—put the MAD in the theory of Mutually Assured Destruction. But in several key senses, these are no longer the best of circumstances, and a set of seemingly unconnected issues raises the specter that an accidental nuclear launch, perhaps followed by a &quot;launch on warning&quot; exchange, could still occur. First, Russian early-warning detection satellites have been in a steady state of decline since the breakup of the Soviet Union and, according to intelligence estimates, significant swaths of the Russian horizon lie dark due to insufficient coverage. This &quot;blindness&quot; could lead to hyper-awareness within the ranges of the remaining sensors. Combined with the even shorter decision time frame that delayed awareness would bring, this does not lend itself to thorough and conservative judgment. Second, while each side denies it, both states are engaged in activities that could be perceived as threatening to the other, perhaps increasing tension that would make a rapid reaction to a perceived threat more likely. For its part, the US continues to push for missile defense deployments on the western edge of Russia, with the stated intention of guarding against Iranian missiles. US efforts to develop new nuclear warheads and a new conventional &quot;global strike&quot; capability are also seen by Russia as degrading their own deterrence capabilities. For its part, Russian deployments of new nuclear-tipped missiles looks like a jab directed at the United States. Finally, three disturbing lapses in US nuclear weapons safety and security reduce confidence that the overall US nuclear weapons infrastructure remains well-managed and under strict command and control. Last August, a B-52 bomber was accidentally loaded with six nuclear warheads and flown from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The bomber was supposed to transport nonnuclear cruise missiles. Then, in March 2008, Defense Department officials learned and subsequently acknowledged that they had 18 months prior mistakenly shipped four nuclear missile fuses to Taiwan. Finally, an internal Defense Department review commissioned by Secretary Gates to study security of the US nuclear weapons complex concluded that the US military cannot locate hundreds of sensitive nuclear missile components. &quot;According to previously undisclosed details obtained by the Financial Times, the investigation also concluded that the Air Force could not account for many sensitive components previously included in its nuclear inventory. One official said the number of missing components was more than 1,000.&quot; While none of these incidents directly indicates an increased danger of accidental launch, they do indicate an overall erosion of system robustness making accidents more prone to occur. Again, due to the reality that most of the world’s nuclear weapons remain under the control of the US and Russia, the likelihood is that if a serious accidental incident occurred, it would be within this legacy construct. Common sense might indicate that better relations between the two countries would mean that less oversight is needed. But due to the history of the Cold War and the nature of the arsenals as discussed above, precisely the opposite is true, especially if the goal is to reduce the danger of an accidental nuclear launch. Surviving the Cold War without a nuclear exchange demanded intense and sustained efforts on a range of fronts from the political to the military, and as the global community strives to move beyond a Cold War mindset, it is clear that succeeding in this new world will as well. It is good that President Bush has found in Russian president Medvedev a smart colleague who understands the issues. The question is how will these two leaders apply their smarts and understanding in order to avoid an accidental nuclear war.<br />

The oranges are different. They would be space-based interceptors, defensive weapons, designed to save lives and property. They would be small and compact defensive weapons, in this case Brilliant Pebbles (BP), that would use not explosives but their own body weight to provide kinetic energy. This would occur when the device (pebble) first “sees” the hostile nuclear weapon as it is launched, and locks on to the ascending missile. The device, powered by a mini-rocket, then would streak down or out or up to strike the missile (like a large pebble) and knock it out of commission.Obviously, seconds count, because once the pebble “sees” the missile firing, it must respond instantly or it is too late and the hostile missile is well on its way to its target. The problem of accidental activation, however, would be virtually eliminated, because the autonomous system – like cruise control on an automobile – would be designed to be switched off as the BPs pass over friendly or non-hostile territory and turned on again over potentially hostile territory and programmed to do so automatically.38A reasonable comparison is the average home security system, which must be real-time automated, to activate its alarms the second an unwanted intruder shows up, so that law enforcement can respond effectively. Obviously, a prudent owner will turn off the alarm when moving about the premises or when expecting guests, but otherwise the owner wants the system armed to be able to respond quickly when needed.<br />

The bitter disputes over national missile defense (NMD) have obscured a related but dramatically more urgent issue of national security: the 4,800 nuclear warheads--weapons with a combined destructive power nearly 100,000 times greater than the atomic bomb that leveled Hiroshima--currently on “hair-trigger” alert. Hair-trigger alert means this: The missiles carrying those warheads are armed and fueled at all times. Two thousand or so of these warheads are on the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) targeted by Russia at the United States; 1,800 are on the ICBMs targeted by the United States at Russia; and approximately 1,000 are on the submarine-based missiles targeted by the two nations at each other. These missiles would launch on receipt of three computer-delivered messages. Launch crews--on duty every second of every day--are under orders to send the messages on receipt of a single computer-delivered command. In no more than two minutes, if all went according to plan, Russia or the United States could launch missiles at predetermined targets: Washington or New York; Moscow or St. Petersburg. The early-warning systems on which the launch crews rely would detect the other side’s missiles within tens of seconds, causing the intended--or accidental--enemy to mount retaliatory strikes. “Within a half-hour, there could be a nuclear war that would extinguish all of us,” explains Bruce Blair. “It would be, basically, a nuclear war by checklist, by rote.”<br />

The sequences of inquiry and application would thus demand looking at the feasibility of striking hostile missile launches in their boost phase through the development of space-based systems. While other elements involving theater and terminal (last resort) missile defenses already were being looked at by the Army (land-based) and the Navy (seabased), these by their nature were limited in both range and scope; so that – even by 1983 with massive nuclear proliferation going on – there was no coherent, overarching global system being considered to which sea and land assets could be linked, so as to develop a robust, layered defense against any launch point in the world. Conceptually, these linkages can be described in terms of a logic pyramid. The base of the pyramid is comprised of space-based systems, because they are global and, thus, can do the most; they can see farther and strike farther. Seabased systems are next best, because they are flexible for surface deployment (theoretically over two-thirds of the Earth) and, therefore, superb for sophisticated regional operations. Finally, at top of the pyramid – supported by space- and sea-based capabilities to maximize their effectiveness – are the fixed and vectored land-based terminal defenses systems. Each component (space, sea, land) is important in its own way, but without space at the base, the other systems are limited in what they can do. In this pyramid, there is no “best” any more than an aircraft carrier is “best” over a cruiser, which is “better” than a destroyer. All are equally important, but only in terms of their particular functions. When they act together, they can provide a formidable defense. When they are forced to act alone, they can be overwhelmed. Space allows them to act together.<br />

Back to the Future: A Practical Solution President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) imagined the capability to defeat a massive Soviet attack, with space-based elements forming a core element of the system. While the administration of the elder President Bush scaled the system down, the Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) system would have been able to intercept ballistic missiles in the ballistic phase of flight using small space-based interceptors known as &quot;Brilliant Pebbles.&quot; Much of GPALS, notably minus the space-based interceptors, evolved into today's BMDS. In fact, it is striking how much the BMDS looks like GPALS, given the 20 years since the first Bush Administration rolled out the concept. As with the current BMDS, the idea behind GPALS was not to overcome a massive Soviet strike, but instead to defeat an &quot;accidental launch&quot; or an attack from a rogue state. Only space-based missile defenses can provide the coverage and on-station time required of a practical boost phase interceptor. Space-based lasers could provide such a defense, but only chemically fuelled lasers have the power to do so effectively. However, a chemical-laser satellite would be an enormous spacecraft, capable of only a few shots without refueling (look at the ABL, a modified Boeing 747). Given the pluses of space-based defenses and the minuses of lasers, the U.S. should revisit Brilliant Pebbles or similar space-based missile defense concepts. Just what was Brilliant Pebbles? Essentially, the concept envisioned a system of low-orbiting interceptors, each &quot;Pebble&quot; a kill vehicle contained in a spacecraft that would provide electrical power, communications, and an infrared-sensor. These small vehicles (described as a &quot;watermelon in a jacket&quot;), would have had a total spacecraft and kill vehicle mass of around 220 pounds. GPALS envisioned a satellite constellation of around 750 to 1,000 Pebbles, capable of engaging up to 200 targets. Brilliant Pebbles could engage both theater and strategic missiles not only in the boost phase, but in the mid-course and terminal phases as well. Ambassador Henry F. Cooper, former SDIO chief, says that when the Clinton Administration cancelled Brilliant Pebbles in 1994, the system was, in fact, the most mature of any missile defense concept. In fact, many of the technologies for Pebbles have been demonstrated in space (such as in the Clementine moon mission) and utilized in current missile defense systems. The Motorola Iridium communications satellites have further proved Brilliant Pebbles' concept of a large constellation of networked satellites designed to operate as an integrated system. In fact, no Brilliant Pebbles technology remained untested at the end of 1994, and many have since been refined. If the goal is to defend against the ballistic missile threat posed by such states as Iran or North Korea, a substantially downsized Pebbles constellation could provide a viable boost-phase defense. A 2004 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) study suggested that as few as 70 satellites, orbiting in a belt from 45 degrees north latitude to 45 degrees south latitude, could provide a two-shot capability against liquid-fuelled ballistic missiles. (Liquid-fuelled missiles ascend more slowly than solid rocket-propelled missiles, requiring more interceptors to defend against them, as interceptors would have to be closer to their targets). Less than ten light-lift launch vehicles such as the Minotaur or Falcon 1 could orbit such a constellation. Studies suggest that the full system of 1,000 Pebbles--with a replacement for each Pebble over 20 years--could cost under $19 billion in 2008 dollars. Although the relationship is not linear, a system of perhaps 200 Pebbles would be significantly cheaper. In considering the number of Pebbles to place in the constellation, planners should also consider that the revived Brilliant Pebbles would operate as part of an integrated, layered defense in conjunction with existing and planned sea and land-based systems, not as their replacement. Blunting the Critics The hurdles to placing a revived Brilliant Pebbles-like system in orbit are predominantly political, not technical, in nature. Originally, space-based missile defenses faced stiff opposition because of their prohibition by the Antiballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty of 1972. The U.S., of course, withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2002, but there remains continued unfriendliness, in the U.S. and abroad, to deploying weapons in space. Some mistakenly claim that such weapons are a violation of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, although that treaty actually prohibits placing weapons of mass destruction, in space, not weapons en bloc. From a practical standpoint, weapons have already travelled into space. The then-Soviet Union, the U.S., and China have all demonstrated anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, and admittedly, even the current surface-based U.S. BMDS provides a displayed dual-use--if not originally purposed--capability as an ASAT weapon. Boost and mid-course missile defenses should have little trouble in downing space launches, as well. The potential for the wide use of missile defenses as a space denial platform rightly puts many people, in many nations, ill at ease. The Russians know the U.S. BMDS presents little danger to their strategic arsenal and that a small constellation of space-based interceptors would not either. Still, the potential for the U.S. BMDS to expand into one that can defeat Russian strategic weapons--even as the Russians and the U.S. draw down their nuclear arsenals--while remote, nonetheless exists. The U.S. could field space-based missile defenses while assuaging the concerns of Russia, and others. Ideally, a multinational coalition, of which Russia would be part, might build and operate the system, sharing the costs and enjoying the protection. The U.S. should work to overcome the legal and political obstacles to such a multinational system, not the least of which is the concern surrounding technology transfer. The U.S. should entreat Russia to become a fully integrated partner in the BMDS, just as have nations such as Japan. However, the U.S. must be prepared to go it alone on space-based missile defenses. Even then, the U.S. should operate the system transparently, perhaps with the permanent presence of multinational (particularly Russian and perhaps even Chinese) observers in the system's operations center. The U.S. could further show good faith by reducing its nuclear arsenal below even the thresholds set in the new START treaty, while still maintaining a viable nuclear deterrent for as long as other nations have such weapons. The cost savings achieved by reducing the U.S. nuclear deterrent to the minimum credible level might even offset the expenditures required to field space-based missile defenses, and to enhance surface-based interceptors, as well. Conclusion Space-based missile defenses represent no threat to the strategic arsenals of Russia or other major nuclear weapons states. Surface and, if built, space-based missile defenses will not be destabilizing factors in the relationship between nuclear-armed states, if the U.S. constructively engages the international community as to their purpose and convincingly shows their benefit to all who seek the protection of these systems. Rather, missile defenses will be a key factor--along with diplomacy, counter-proliferation and non-proliferation activities, and verifiable disarmament--in ushering in a world without nuclear weapons. A space-based interceptor system, similar in concept to Brilliant Pebbles, would at last provide a viable boost-phase defense, greatly enhancing the layered defense against ballistic missiles. For all of the protection they could provide, missile defenses alone do not represent a panacea in eliminating the nuclear threat. The U.S. and its partners in peace must continue actions designed to secure nuclear and fissile materials and prevent their use by rogue states and non-state actors in delivery systems other than missiles (e.g. the &quot;suitcase nuke&quot;), and must continue the full range of arms control activities designed to put the nuclear genie fully back in the bottle. Still, the U.S. and its friends would be foolish to forgo the full range of options available to defend themselves while waiting for that great day to arrive.<br />

A space-based KEI is designed to hit a ballistic missile in its boost phase, when the warhead(s) has not yet separated from the missile and is most vulnerable, as well as in the midcourseand high-terminal phases. Kinetic kill vehicles would be placed in low-earth orbit, where they would remain until a hostile missile launch was detected. For intercepts in the boost or terminal phases, a kinetic kill vehicle would accelerate out of orbit toward the missile which would be destroyed by direct impact. Midcourse intercepts would occur in space. Over a decade ago, the United States had developed technology for light-weight propulsion units, sensors, computers, and other components of an advanced kill vehicle. This concept, Brilliant Pebbles, consisted of a constellation of about 1000 satellites that combined its own early-warning and tracking capability with high maneuverability to engage attacking ballistic missiles in all phases of their flight trajectory. Each pebble was designed to identify the nature of the attack, which might include up to 200 ballistic missiles; and since it knew its own location and that of all other pebbles, each could calculate an optimum attack strategy from its own perspective and execute an intercept maneuver, while simultaneously informing the other pebbles of its action. This operational concept enabled a robustly viable, testable, operational capability that survived numerous scientific and engineering peer reviews in the 1989-90 time period, including by some groups that were hostile to the idea of missile defense in general, and space-based defenses But the technology was clearly established, supporting the Pentagon’s approved acquisition plan that each of the pebbles would operate autonomously because each carried the equivalent of a Cray-1 computer and could do its own calculations for trajectory and targeting analysis. Each also had its own navigation sensors, allowing it to determine its location and the location of its neighbors – as well as to detect and track the target ballistic missiles and calculate a good approximation of what its neighbors saw.12 These pebbles would act as sensor platforms until all or part of the constellation was authorized to intercept hostile missiles. In fact, their infrared sensors provided the warning and tracking capability needed to alert the Brilliant Pebbles constellation enabling it to intercept ballistic missiles in the boost and subsequent phases of flight. The constellation would provide a redundant, and for some applications, superior capability than the geosynchronous Defense Support Program satellites used since the early 1970s as a key element of the U.S. Early Warning and Tactical Assessment system. Their small size, meanwhile, made them difficult to target, while their relatively low cost made them easy to replace. The autonomy of Brilliant Pebbles in detecting launch and undertaking interception complicated the use of countermeasures against their command and control. And because of the number of Brilliant Pebbles deployed in space, these defenses would have multiple opportunities for interception, thus increasing their chances of a successful intercept in either the boost or midcourse phases, or even high in the earth’s atmosphere during reentry in the terminal phase. These characteristics stand in contrast to the current GMD interceptors which, in the limited numbers presently planned, may not provide more than one independent intercept opportunity. Although there has been no formal program to develop the key technologies further, advances in the commercial, civil and other defense sectors over the past decade will now permit even lighter mass, lower cost, and higher performance than would have been achieved by the 1990-era Brilliant Pebbles technology base. Thus, lighter weight and smarter components can now empower a Brilliant Pebbles interceptor with greater acceleration/velocity making possible boost-phase intercept of even short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. If the necessary investments are made to upgrade Brilliant Pebbles- type technology for the twenty-first century, boost-phase intercept from space will also be feasible against high acceleration ICBMs that would have exceeded the capabilities of the 1990 Brilliant Pebbles.13 And as noted above, the same sensor and kill-vehicle technology can be used for ground- and sea-based interceptors – notably on the VLS-compatible, high-velocity Navy SM-3 interceptor. Reviving and building on the Brilliant Pebbles concept and related technologies is essential for the deployment of effective SBIs, as well as improved interceptors for use in other basing modes, especially at sea. To move forward the United States must identify and exploit programs that were under development more than a decade ago. In other words, we should “go back to the future” as the point of departure for the increasingly robust missile defense that will be needed beyond what was initially planned for deployment in 2004-2005. Our engineers did it before, and can do it again to defeat the growing ballistic missile threat. One feasible option for testing and initial deployment of a revived space-based interceptor system based on Brilliant Pebbles would be to deploy, say, 40 to 120 interceptors for a space-system test bed analogous to the ground- and sea-based test beds. After demonstrating feasibility by testing against missiles of all ranges in all possible phases of their flight, this test bed would have a limited capability and could be expanded to become a fully capable defensive constellation. Based on the fully approved Defense Acquisition Board plan from 1991, an SBI system with as many as 1000 Brilliant Pebbles could be developed, tested, deployed and operated for twenty years with a low-to-moderate risk, event-driven acquisition program for $11 billion in 1990 dollars, or $16 billion when inflated to 2005 dollars.<br />

While critics of missile defense systems make valid arguments, so do the proponents. They argue that missile defense systems strengthen deterrence by introducing uncertainty into the calculus of an adversary by defeating the advantage gained by launching a first strike with ballistic missiles. They can limit the damage done if deterrence fails and there is a missile attack on the United States. Missile defenses are advantageous in a regional situation, adding to extended deterrence. This is especially relevant given the proliferation of ballistic missile technology as well as the robust testing program demonstrated by countries such as Iran and North Korea. The non-rational actor or rogue state threat also leads to an advantage, as missile defenses can provide a hedge against the failure of deterrence. And lastly, missile defenses provide U.S. leadership with additional flexibility. They can choose to defend and then apply all elements of U.S. national power against the adversary vice simply responding with an immediate retaliatory attack. As with the opponent arguments, many of the proponent positions cannot be conclusively proven with evidence. There is no way to know for certain if a country did or did not do something solely because the U.S. deployed ballistic missile defenses.<br />

<strong>Arms control or codes of conduct fails – challengers will outpace us and undermine satellite security</strong><br />
<strong>Kueter, 07</strong> - is president of the George C. Marshall Institute, a nonprofit think tank dediicated to science and technology in public policy (Jeff, New Atlantis, “China's Space Ambitions -- And Ours,” Spring, lexis)<br />
<br />
Setting aside such semantic quibbling, the real challenge now facing the United States is how best to deter, deny, and dissuade the Chinese, and other emerging space powers, from hostile actions in space. One approach would involve diplomacy and international discussions. For some time, arms-control advocates have been pushing for agreements to ban weapons in space. More recently, in light of the changed circumstances brought on by China's tests, the focus has shifted to securing &quot;codes of conduct&quot; and devising &quot;rules of the road&quot; to regulate how nation-states behave in space. Sympathetically interpreting China's recent tests as an understandable reaction to U.S. policies, arms-control advocates have characterized American actions in space as dangerous and provocative, and have condemned the United States for refusing to enter into international negotiations. Only a treaty, they argue, can restrain the Americans' aggressive tendencies. As one arms-control advocate told the Washington Post, the Chinese were responding to U.S. space policies and sending a signal to the Pentagon: &quot;We can play this game, too, and we can play it dirtier than you.&quot; Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, told the Post that the United States must initiate &quot;an international agreement to ban the development, testing, and deployment of space weapons and anti-satellite systems.&quot; This attitude--blaming America for other countries' actions and demanding that the United States preemptively disarm itself--is reminiscent of the old Cold War debates over nuclear weapons. Also strikingly familiar to students of the Cold War is Beijing's hypocritical hand-wringing over the specter of an arms race in, and the weaponization of, outer space. As Michael Pillsbury has pointed out, &quot;While China has publicly assumed a leadership position in international activities to ban space weapons, there is an active group within China not only advocating the weaponization of space but also putting forth specific proposals for implementation of a Chinese space-based weapons program.&quot; Even while the PLA was successfully executing at least two anti-satellite tests, the Chinese diplomatic corps was raging against the supposed weaponization of space by the United States. At a U.N. conference on space in 2006, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official, Tang Guoqiang, complained about actions in space that could &quot;cause serious consequences&quot;: &quot;The policy of a certain country [i.e., the United States] to test, deploy and use weapons and weapon systems in outer space [is] disconcerting. Outer space is the common heritage of mankind and [the] weaponization of outer space is bound to trigger off [an] arms race in outer space, thus rendering outer space a new arena for military confrontation.&quot; Even after the January 2007 ASAT test, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official insisted that countries &quot;opposed to the weaponization of space&quot; should &quot;join hands to realize this goal.&quot; Existing treaties allow actions to protect and defend national interests in space. Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty forbids signatories (including the United States and China) from placing nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on the Moon, and prohibits the testing of weapons, conduct of maneuvers, or construction of fortifications on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Since October 1967, when the treaty went into force, nearly every U.S. president has interpreted its requirements in such a way as to explicitly allow the development, operation, and maintenance of the space-control capabilities needed to ensure freedom of action in space and to deny such freedom of action to adversaries. During successive administrations of both political parties, the National Security Council has interpreted the treaty as not barring the deployment of space-based missile defenses or other systems to perform space-control missions. Work to draft new treaties continues apace. China and Russia have been spearheading international efforts to construct a framework to govern space. The Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) process at the U.N. Conference on Disarmament calls for formal negotiations to prohibit the placement of weapons in orbit or on celestial bodies. But whatever shreds of credibility this international process had were destroyed by the recent Chinese tests. Another diplomatic tack contemplated by those opposed to &quot;weaponizing space&quot; is the adoption of multilateral codes of conduct. To a certain extent, such norms will develop organically on their own, as the growing interdependence between economic and security interests forces government and commercial satellite operators to cooperate, and as Washington increasingly coordinates its space activities with military and civil space authorities in allied and friendly nations. Over time, new norms for shared space situational awareness, debris mitigation, and orbital traffic management may emerge among responsible space-faring nations. But such norms make no sense if the parties have not first built up trust. And if such norms are externally imposed, they will be nothing more than unverifiable arms control agreements in camouflage. Absent the ability to ascertain or enforce compliance, a code-of-conduct rule regime will be weak and, more likely than not, ineffectual. A rules system for space between potential adversaries that relies on voluntary compliance and lacks viable punitive measures will be a hollow one. (Nor, for that matter, would an international treaty &quot;banning&quot; anti-satellite testing be enforceable or verifiable; the ignominious record of enforcing and verifying treaties prohibiting activities on Earth should be proof enough of that.) The chief failing of the diplomatic approach to dealing with the new reality of space weapons is that it is blind to the reason a potential adversary like China would seek access to space in the first place--namely, the desire to be able to inflict a crippling blow against U.S. military and economic might by decapitating its surveillance and communications abilities. Those pushing for a new treaty or a code of conduct have yet to explain why China would abandon capabilities that threaten the &quot;soft underbelly&quot; of American military power. The Chinese regime clearly aspires to develop such capabilities; there is little reason to believe it would negotiate them away. The United States should resist calls for such futile diplomatic efforts.<br />

<span class="Underline">Excluding random failures, the operational life of a GPS satellite tends to be limited by the amount of power that its solar arrays can produce. This power level declines over time as the solar arrays degrade in the space environment until eventually they cannot produce enough power to maintain all of the satellite’s subsystems. The effects of this power loss can be mitigated somewhat by actively managing satellite subsystems—shutting them down when they are not needed—thereby reducing the satellite’s overall consumption of power. The Air Force currently employs this approach—referred to as current management—to extend the life of GPS satellites. According to the Air Force, it would also be possible to significantly reduce a satellite’s consumption of power and further extend the life of its PNT mission by shutting off a second payload on a GPS satellite once the satellite could not generate enough power to support both the missions. Shutting off the second payload once the satellite cannot support both missions—known as power management—would further mitigate the impact of a delay in GPS III. However, the impact is limited to increasing the predicted size of the constellation by about 1 satellite. For example, if the GPS III program were delayed by 1 year, the guaranteed size of the constellation (at the 95 percent confidence level) would decline to about 21 satellites by fiscal year 2017 if current management were employed and to about 22 satellites if power management were employed. See figure 5 for details. If the GPS III program were delayed by 2 years, the guaranteed size of the constellation (at the 95 percent confidence level) would decline to about 18 satellites by fiscal year 2018 if current management were employed and to about 19 satellites if power management were employed.

<span class="Underline">Precision agriculture is now changing the way farmers and agribusinesses view the land from which they reap their profits. Precision agriculture is about collecting timely geospatial information on soil-plant-animal requirements and prescribing and applying site-specific treatments to increase agricultural production and protect the environment. Where farmers may have once treated their fields uniformly, they are now seeing benefits from micromanaging their fields. Precision agriculture is gaining in popularity largely due to the introduction of high technology tools into the agricultural community that are more accurate, cost effective, and user friendly. Many of the new innovations rely on the integration of on-board computers, data collection sensors, and GPS time and position reference systems. Many believe that the benefits of precision agriculture can only be realized on large farms with huge capital investments and experience with information technologies. Such is not the case. There are inexpensive and easy-to-use methods and techniques that can be developed for use by all farmers. Through the use of GPS, GIS, and remote sensing, information needed for improving land and water use can be collected. Farmers can achieve additional benefits by combining better utilization of fertilizers and other soil amendments, determining the economic threshold for treating pest and weed infestations, and protecting the natural resources for future use. GPS equipment manufacturers have developed several tools to help farmers and agribusinesses become more productive and efficient in their precision farming activities. Today, many farmers use GPS-derived products to enhance operations in their farming businesses. Location information is collected by GPS receivers for mapping field boundaries, roads, irrigation systems, and problem areas in crops such as weeds or disease. The accuracy of GPS allows farmers to create farm maps with precise acreage for field areas, road locations and distances between points of interest. GPS allows farmers to accurately navigate to specific locations in the field, year after year, to collect soil samples or monitor crop conditions. Crop advisors use rugged data collection devices with GPS for accurate positioning to map pest, insect, and weed infestations in the field. Pest problem areas in crops can be pinpointed and mapped for future management decisions and input recommendations. The same field data can also be used by aircraft sprayers, enabling accurate swathing of fields without use of human “flaggers” to guide them. Crop dusters equipped with GPS are able to fly accurate swaths over the field, applying chemicals only where needed, minimizing chemical drift, reducing the amount of chemicals needed, thereby benefiting the environment. GPS also allows pilots to provide farmers with accurate maps. Farmers and agriculture service providers can expect even further improvements as GPS continues to modernize. In addition to the current civilian service provided by GPS, the United States is committed to implementing a second and a third civil signal on GPS satellites. The first satellite with the second civilian signal was launched in 2005. The new signals will enhance both the quality and efficiency of agricultural operations in the future.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The population-crash scenario is surely the most appalling. Plummeting crop yields would cause some powerful countries to try to take over their neighbors or distant lands -- if only because their armies, unpaid and lacking food, would go marauding, both at home and across the borders. The better-organized countries would attempt to use their armies, before they fell apart entirely, to take over countries with significant remaining resources, driving out or starving their inhabitants if not using modern weapons to accomplish the same end: eliminating competitors for the remaining food. This would be a worldwide problem -- and could lead to a Third World War -- but Europe's vulnerability is particularly easy to analyze. The last abrupt cooling, the Younger Dryas, drastically altered Europe's climate as far east as Ukraine. Present-day Europe has more than 650 million people. It has excellent soils, and largely grows its own food. It could no longer do so if it lost the extra warming from the North Atlantic.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">GPS began operations with a full constellation of satellites in 1995. Over time, GPS has become vital to military operations and a ubiquitous infrastructure underpinning major sections of the economy, including telecommunications, electrical power distribution, banking and finance, transportation, environmental and natural resources management, agriculture, and emergency services. GPS is used by all branches of the military to guide troop movements, integrate logistics support, enable components underlying battlespace situational awareness, and synchronize communications networks. In addition, U.S. and allied munitions are guided to their targets by GPS signals and GPS is used to locate military personnel in distress. Civil agencies, commercial firms, and individuals use GPS and GPS augmentations to accurately navigate from one point to another. Commercial firms use GPS and GPS augmentations to route their vehicles, as do maritime industries and mass transit systems. In addition to navigation, civil departments and agencies and commercial firms use GPS and GPS augmentations to provide high-accuracy, three-dimensional positioning information in real time for use in surveying and mapping and other location-based services. The aviation community worldwide uses GPS and GPS augmentations to increase the safety and efficiency of flight. GPS and GPS augmentations are also used by the agricultural community for precision farming, including farm planning, field mapping, soil sampling, tractor guidance, and crop scouting; the natural resources management community uses GPS for wildfire management and firefighting, pesticide and herbicide control, and watershed and other natural resources asset management. GPS is increasingly important to earth observation, which includes operational roles in weather prediction, the measurement of sea level change, monitoring of ocean circulation, and mitigation of hazards caused by earthquakes and volcanoes. GPS helps companies and governments place satellites in precise orbits, and at correct altitudes, and helps monitor satellite constellation orbits. The precise time that GPS broadcasts is crucial to economic activities worldwide, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Of all the responsibilities associated with modern society’s infrastructure, few are as important as keeping the electric power grid healthy and functional. To do this requires the accurate measurement of the voltage and current on generation, transmission and distribution lines, and buses. These measurements are necessary for controlling, protecting, scheduling, operating, maintaining, and planning of the power network as well as billing customers correctly. For many power-system applications, these measurements must be time tagged to within microseconds of absolute time using GPS transmissions. In 1996 on the West Coast and again in 2003 on the East Coast, two costly wide-area power grid blackouts cost society at total of at least $10 billion and disrupted the lives of millions. What can be done to prevent or at the least minimize these disastrous events depends on what we do with these measurements to provide timely and cost-effective solutions. Time and frequency reference systems such as GPS and five other enabling technological advances of late have, when tightly integrated, the potential of enhancing and lowering overall power system costs. At present, a GPS receiver is the most efficient and universally accepted time source used at power system measurement sites. Knowing the relative phase angle of the voltages and currents in a particular region enables the instantaneous computation of the active and reactive power, which can be used in billing, protective relaying, and system-calming control algorithms. The timely acquisition and dissemination of wide-area power system quantities to centralized sites is believed to be absolutely essential in managing the quality, security, and stability of large power system grids. Other important timing techniques arriving include the use of deterministic communication techniques, which can provide wide-area time synchronizing of all data sources to a fixed and stable delay (within microseconds or less) using Ethernet protocols.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The third type could happen if the electricity fails. Reactors depend on off-site electric power to run cooling systems and control rooms, with emergency diesel generators for automatic backup. Unfortunately, according to Olsen, even in the US these generators are &quot;not even 90 percent reliable.&quot; In the US, most local emergency officials are planning for three weeks without power. But diesel generators often overheat and usually are not operated for weeks at a time. Many generators also have digital components that may be subject to Y2K failure. &quot;It takes only two hours without the cooling system functioning for reactor fuel to melt,&quot; Olsen says. Power failures also could cause &quot;a meltdown of nuclear fuel storage pools.... These pools must be cooled for at least five years.&quot; Loss of off-site electrical power poses the most prominent risk to nuclear powerplant safety. Reliable back-up power is needed immediately at each nuclear site. Fuel cells and gas turbines are more reliable than diesel generators. There are well over 1,000 private utilities, non-utility generators, public utilities, and rural electric cooperatives in the US and Canada operating more than 15,000 generating units. Many will reach the millennium with Y2K issues unresolved. The US electric power grid is fragile. In 1996, two disruptions in one five-week period caused 190 generating stations (including several nuclear reactors) to shut down. On August 10, 1996, a sagging tree limb in Oregon caused a short that caused a blackout in California, Arizona and New Mexico. Millions of people were left without power. In some regions, the blackout lasted several weeks. MRS notes that increasingly severe winter storms have caused power outages in the eastern US in recent years. Such wintertime power failures &quot;could lead to extended blackouts and resultant nuclear catastrophes.&quot; The NIRS has petitioned the NRC to require all nuclear power stations to stockpile a 20-day supply of fuel for diesel generators. Batteries charged by solar cells, windmills, hydroelectric or geothermal energy would give the greatest assurance of long-term stability</span><br />

<span class="Underline">As US bombs and missiles began to rain on Afghanistan, the certainty of terror retaliation inside the US has turned our 103 nuclear power plants into potential weapons of apocalyptic destruction, just waiting to be used against us. One or both planes that crashed into the World Trade Center on September 11 could have easily obliterated the two atomic reactors now operating at Indian Point, about 40 miles up the Hudson River. Indian Point Unit One was shut long ago by public outcry. But Units 2 and 3 have operated since the 1970s. Reactor containment domes were built to withstand a jetliner crash but today's jumbo jets are far larger than the planes that were flying in the 1970s. Had one of those hijacked jets hit one of the operating reactors at Indian Point, the ensuing cloud of radiation would have dwarfed the ones at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. The intense radioactive heat within today's operating reactors is the hottest anywhere on the planet. Because Indian Point has operated so long, its accumulated radioactive burden far exceeds that of Chernobyl. The safety systems are extremely complex and virtually indefensible. One or more could be wiped out with a small aircraft, ground-based weapons, truck bombs or even chemical/biological assaults aimed at the work force. A terrorist assault at Indian Point could yield three infernal fireballs of molten radioactive lava burning through the earth and into the aquifer and the river. Striking water, they would blast gigantic billows of horribly radioactive steam into the atmosphere. Thousands of square miles would be saturated with the most lethal clouds ever created, depositing relentless genetic poisons that would kill forever. Infants and small children would quickly die en masse. Pregnant women would spontaneously abort or give birth to horribly deformed offspring. Ghastly sores, rashes, ulcerations and burns would afflict the skin of millions. Heart attacks, stroke and multiple organ failure would kill thousands on the spot. Emphysema, hair loss, nausea, inability to eat or drink or swallow, diarrhea and incontinence, sterility and impotence, asthma and blindness would afflict hundreds of thousands, if not millions. Then comes the wave of cancers, leukemias, lymphomas, tumors and hellish diseases for which new names will have to be invented. Evacuation would be impossible, but thousands would die trying. Attempts to quench the fires would be futile. More than 800,000 Soviet draftees forced through Chernobyl's seething remains in a futile attempt to clean it up are still dying from their exposure. At Indian Point, the molten cores would burn uncontrolled for days, weeks and years. Who would volunteer for such an American task force? The immediate damage from an Indian Point attack (or a domestic accident) would render all five boroughs of New York City an apocalyptic wasteland. As at Three Mile Island, where thousands of farm and wild animals died in heaps, natural ecosystems would be permanently and irrevocably destroyed. Spiritually, psychologically, financially and ecologically, our nation would never recover. This is what we missed by a mere 40 miles on September 11. Now that we are at war, this is what could be happening as you read this. There are 103 of these potential Bombs of the Apocalypse operating in the US. They generate a mere 8 percent of our total energy. Since its deregulation crisis, California cut its electric consumption by some 15 percent.

<span class="Underline">GIS is defined as an information system that is used to input, store, retrieve, manipulate, analyze and output geographically referenced data or spatial data. All methods of collecting information about earth without touching it are forms of remote sensing. Satellites, radars and aerial photographs are the different ways of acquiring remotely sensed data. GPS is a system of twenty-four satellites that allows the co-ordinates of any point on or near earth’s surface to be measured with extremely high precision 3. GIS is an umbrella term which integrates wide range of datasets available from different sources including RS and GPS. Therefore, GIS is often termed as core of spatial technology having built-in power to analyze integrated dataset and to present the results as useful information to assist decision making. This article attempts to present the technology of GIS and its functionalities with regard to applications in malaria research and control during the last decade. The research articles have been grouped into six categories according to the usage of the technology. Spatial data sources, mapping and geo-processing tools, distance calculation, digital elevation model (DEM), model, buffer zone, and geo-statistical analysis have been investigated in detail, illustrated with examples as per the derived results. Finally, a conclusion is drawn incorporating various aspects of malaria epidemiology covered by different tools and future prospects for better decision support. GIS in malaria research and control (i) Spatial data sources: Epidemiology of vectorborne diseases is changing fast with the availability of data using new methods of spatial data collection like GPS and RS. The GPS has been used mainly for field data collection and remote sensing by means of aerial photographs and satellite imageries has succeeded in providing descriptive climatic and landscape features. RS data in GIS have been used widely for identification, characterization, monitoring, surveillance of breeding habitats and mapping of malaria risk. GIS maps developed from aerial photographs in Dar-esSalaam, Tanzania facilitated efficient larval surveillance and complete coverage of targeted areas with larval control 4. Remote sensing imageries in a GIS was used for identification and characterization of the habitats that produced potential Anopheles vector mosquitoes in the Republic of Korea 5. Integrated use of remote sensing and GIS has been successfully demonstrated in many studies related to mapping of malaria risk in different parts of Africa 6-7. Combined with data from surveillance activities, GIS and GPS are ideal tools for generating base maps, mapping breeding habitats and analysis of areas of high disease prevalence. Mapping of the study site, Mulago III parish - a typical urban slum located in Kampala, the capital of Uganda was done using GPS and GIS to generate a sampling frame for a longitudinal study of malaria incidence and treatment 8. GPS data integrated into a GIS were used to map anopheline larval habitats in the Suba district in Western Kenya 9. GPS recording of the co-ordinates and elevation of anopheline larvae aquatic sites, integrated and mapped using a GIS helped determine An. arabiensis breeding on the Mount Kenya highlands indicating indigenous malaria transmission in the area 10. GPS data of Anopheles sp. breeding sites integrated into the digital map of Ouagadougou, Africa, helped analyze a gradient of endemicity between the urban centre and the periphery 11. (ii) Mapping and geo-processing tools: GIS mapping and geo-processing tools have contributed immensely towards the development of spatial epidemiology of malaria. GIS has enabled data to be geo-referenced, mapped and geo-processed to carry out sophisticated analysis. Geo-processing by means of overlay and intersection has helped in building spatial analysis. Overlay combines two or more map layers within a GIS to create one or more new map layers of new information. Examples have been drawn from the studies done in various countries making use of these spatial features for deriving useful results. GIS-based malaria incidence mapping has been used for risk assessment at national, regional, town and village level. Such mapping is considered crucial for analyzing past as well as present disease trends. Risks maps developed on the basis of mapped malaria incidence are tools for targeted and cost-effective control of disease. Mapping of both Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum malaria incidence distribution for 8 years (1995-2002) on the islands of Sri Lanka at subdistrict resolution helped in the assessment of malaria risk in the country 12. This mapping was updated for 10 months preceding tsunami in December 2004 to assess the post-disaster malaria situation in Sri Lanka 13. GIS was used to perform a retrospective analysis of malaria case data for the past 37 years and district-wise malaria incidence data for past 6 years to determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria incidence in Thailand 14. GIS was introduced in Mpumalanga province of South Africa to stratify malaria risk on the basis of disease incidence at town and village level 15. Section-wise mapping of malaria incidence from 1991-2001 helped identify malaria receptivity and trends within each paradigm of Mewat district, Haryana, India 16. Many maps of global malaria risk distribution in space and time have been prepared using GIS. Mapping the global distribution of malaria is motivated by a need to define populations at risk for appropriate resource allocation to combat the disease. Hay et al 17 used GIS to overlay historical maps of malaria risk to create a single global distribution map of malaria risk which illustrated range changing from 1900 to 2002. Also overlaying of contemporaneous population surfaces helped quantify changes in the numbers of people living in areas of malaria risk. Snow et al 18 defined the global extent of the clinical episodes caused by P. faliciparum worldwide by combining epidemiological, geographical and demographic data. Guerra et al 19 constructed an evidenced based spatial description of the global distribution of P. falciparum and P. vivax by combing in a GIS several sources of information on malaria risk. Combining these maps with those of human population distribution enabled estimates of the global population at risk of P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria during 2005. A newly launched ‘Malaria Atlas Project (MAP)’ is developing global maps of malaria transmission intensity to identify the distribution of populations at risk on the basis of classified malaria endemicity based on globally generated parasite rate database 20. Spatial analyses using geo-processing tools had assisted in establishing relationship between malaria incidence and other potentially related variables. Such studies are done to identify risk factors for high receptivity. GIS based malaria information management system developed for urban malaria scheme in India ensured that if a localized spurt of the disease occurs, it can be associated rapidly with a likely cause, a specific vector and a probable human source so that appropriate preventive action can be taken to arrest any rising trend</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Can GPS be used to detect underground nuclear explosions? A research team is developing a software program that uses GPS to analyze the ionospheric effect of nuclear explosions. Results would show when and where a country has conducted a secret underground nuclear test. Team members are Jihye Park, Ralph. R. B. von Frese, and Dorota A. Grejner-Brzezinska from The Ohio State University and Jade Yu Morton from Miami University. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1996, but not all nuclear countries have ratified it, including the United States, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, and Israel. Also, India, North Korea, and Pakistan have not signed the treaty. Park, a doctoral student in geodetic science at Ohio State, created the computer program to detect changes in the ionosphere from nuclear weapons testing. A previous study showed that the ionosphere was disturbed by underground nuclear testing conducted by Russia in 1990. GPS is capable of precisely measuring the total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere along the path between satellite and receiver at a GPS station, so Park and her team decided to begin researching the use of GPS in detecting nuclear explosions. “Many studies have been done to monitor and model the atmosphere using GPS technology,” Park said. “Research has proven that GPS can detect natural disasters such as earthquakes or tsunamis. This study broadens those areas of study with its capability to detect underground explosions.” Detonation of a nuclear weapon results in a shockwave that travels through the atmosphere, changing the density of charged particles in the ionosphere. “The explosions can’t hide from the ionosphere,” said von Frese, geophysicist and project leader. “Our technology would be another nail in the structure to detect explosions.” “One of the arguments is ‘Well, how do you prove that a clandestine explosion occurred?’” said Grejner-Brzezinska, Park’s adviser and GPS World’s Tech Talk blog editor. “Now we can say, ‘Here, we have the data from GPS to show when and where.’” According to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) nuclear testing has been carried out in the past by the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea (see Figure 1). Researchers, and those monitoring treaty violations, are able to target specific geographic areas that are equipped for tests, since development of a nuclear test site requires a lot of technical effort and budget. For example, the North Korean tests carried out in 2006 and 2009 were very close geographically. “They tend to stick to the same site and reuse their facilities for nuclear testing,” von Frese said. “So a country that has previously conducted underground nuclear testing probably will reuse the site if new testing is needed.” “They could be monitored using GPS as long as there are GPS stations nearby,” Park said. The new GPS nuclear-detection technology was presented at the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization meeting held June 8–10 in Vienna, Austria, and received press coverage that drew additional interest.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Consequences of using modern nuclear weapons can be far more serious than previously imagined. These consequences relate to the fact that most of the heat generated in the planetary interior is a result of nuclear decay. Over the last few decades, all superpowers have been developing so-called &quot;neutron bombs&quot;. These bombs are designed to emit intensive neutron radiation while creating relatively little local mechanical damage. Military are very keen to use neutron bombs in combat, because lethal neutron radiation can penetrate even the largest and deepest bunkers. However, the military seem to ignore the fact that a neutron radiation is capable to reach significant depths in the planetary interior. In the process of passing through the planet and losing its intensity, a neutron beam stimulates nuclei of radioactive isotopes naturally present inside the planet to disintegrate. This disintegration in turn, generates more neutron and other radiation. The entire process causes increased nuclear heat generation in the planetary interior, far greater than the initial energy of the bomb. It typically takes many days or even weeks for this extra heat to conduct/convect to the surface of the planet and cause increased seismic/volcanic activity. Due to this variable delay, nuclear tests are not currently associated with seismic/volcanic activity, simply because it is believed that there is no theoretical basis for such an association. Perhaps you heard that after every major series of nuclear test there is always a period of increased seismic activity in some part of the world. This observable fact CANNOT be explained by direct energy of the explosion. The mechanism of neutron radiation accelerating decay of radioactive isotopes in the planetary interior, however, is a VERY PLAUSIBLE and realistic explanation. The process of accelerating volcanic activity is nuclear in essence. Accelerated decay of unstable radioactive isotopes already present in the planetary interior provides the necessary energy. The TRUE danger of modern nuclear weaponry is that their neutron radiation is capable to induce global overheating of the planetary interior, global volcanic activity and, in extreme circumstances, may even cause the entire planet to explode.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">America and much of the world depend on GPS for accurate position, navigation, and timing (PNT) information and this space-based asset has become essential to the military as well as the public at large. The US armed forces’ ability to successfully execute global operations with great speed and effectiveness is significantly enhanced by the precision location, guidance and navigation capabilities delivered by GPS. Most recently, the system was integral to every military branch in the US-led coalition’s success in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. For example, special forces mounted on horseback in Afghanistan summoned GPS-guided precision air strikes to engage enemy targets with pinpoint accuracy and then used the system to navigate safely back to base. Likewise, in Iraq, GPS demonstrated its value by allowing Air Force pilots to streak through the sky with confidence because they knew exactly where they were and where they needed to go. It would be difficult to fight today’s conflicts without this enabling technology.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Hyten: To me the most important thing GPS III brings is a larger bus, which is the platform of the satellite. It allows you to do additional things. It has more power so it can provide more power to the ground. The GPS signal right now is very weak, GPS III will provide signals that would be hard to interfere with, either accidentally or on purpose. In the future we will have a more robust power system in space. We can then transmit a more powerful signal to the ground. We will have a lot of anti-jam capabilities on those future satellites that will make the system more difficult to jam, more robust, more capable, and will allow us to fight through a lot of different problems that we really can’t do with the previous versions. Our efforts are focused on the warfighter. Most of the new capabilities are designed to provide that ensured navigation and timing signal to warfighters around the world.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">In March, one of the Western world’s worst nightmares came true. The United States and South Korea began their annual joint military exercise, code-named “Foal Eagle,” involving over 10,000 American soldiers and an additional 200,000 South Korean troops. One of the scenarios played out during the drill, simulating a potential military conflict between the two sides of the peninsula in the event that longtime North Korean leader Kim Jong II dies and his son Kim Jong Un is incapable of establishing control, seemed more than realistic. Toward the end of the exercise, global positioning systems started to fail, particularly in areas such as the capital, Seoul and the city of Paju. Most affected were US Tomahawk cruise missiles as well as Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) bomb kits, which are supposed to turn regular bombs into smart bombs and accurate satellite-guided weapons. After a short investigation, South Korean intelligence discovered that North Korea had activated two different systems to jam the satellite signal. The first was a vehicle-mounted device North Korea had purchased from Russia in the early 2000s, which is believed to be capable of jamming GPS signals from 50 to 100 km. away. The second system was a spinoff and upgrade of the Russian system manufactured domestically in North Korea that is believed to cost less but has the ability to jam GPS reception within a radius of 400 km. Israel, which for years has feared and prepared for the possibility that in a future conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Syria or Iran, its GPS systems will fail, followed these developments closely. The Israel Defense Forces has already considered the possibility that North Korea has sold its GPS jamming system to Middle East countries including Lebanon, Syria and Iran. Just last month, Russia announced that it had sold a series of advanced radar jammers to Iran. Called Avtobaza, the electronic intelligence system might also be able to jam GPS-guided platforms and munitions. “We are preparing and expect that this will be a challenge we will have to deal with in a future war,” a senior IDF officer explained recently. “Our enemies are also building up capabilities.” The ability to jam GPS systems has been a taboo subject within the Israeli defense establishment for years, but with a new conflict looming on the horizon – possibly following an Israeli strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities – there is no ignoring the likelihood that in a future war Israeli smart bombs will be rendered satellite-less. The development of GPS began in the 1970s by the Pentagon and today consists of two dozen satellites that provide global coverage for receivers to determine their precise location within a few meters. The satellites revolve around the earth at an altitude of 20,000 km. and complete one orbit roughly every 12 hours. Over the years, GPS has become an integral part of civilian life and not just of the military. It is used by ships to navigate at sea, by cars to travel by land and by the civil aviation industry as well. Most cellular phones come with GPS chips and its capabilities are often taken for granted. The IDF took its first major step into the world of GPS in 2000 when it became the first foreign customer outside of the US to receive JDAM kits. These were fitted onto 2,000-pound Mk-84 bombs, turning them into precision satellite-guided smart bombs. JDAMs enable Israel Air Force pilots to launch bombs from a standoff position without needing to fly directly over targets where they could be threatened by enemy air defense missile systems. An example of how importance JDAMs are for Israel was provided during Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip almost three years ago. Out of all the bombs dropped, 81 percent were smart bombs, the largest percentage of precision guided weapons ever used in conflict anywhere in the world. But with the reliance come the risks, as jamming systems are more easily available today on the open market. There is also the lingering fear that one day – possibly to prevent Israel from taking military action – the US will shut down the GPS satellites. Maj.-Gen. (res.) Eitan Ben-Eliyahu was commander of the IAF when Israel placed its first order of JDAM kits. “I pushed very hard for the JDAMs since I understood that they were going to provide us with new capabilities that would change the way we operate,” he said. “There are potential problems but when calculating the risks together with the benefits, it is definitely worth relying on such systems.” Israel’s doesn’t just rely on GPS in the air. Take navigation for ground forces as an example. In today’s IDF, Merkava tanks, Namer armored personnel carriers and artillery howitzers are all connected to the Tzayad Digital Army Program (DAP), which shows the position of all friendly and enemy forces. “If a country doesn’t take any precautions to protect GPS then it will be in trouble, since jammers are something that will likely be on a future battlefield,” explained Nir Lavi, director of marketing at Rokar, a Jerusalem-company based that has developed technology to make GPS systems immune to jamming. According to David Last, a former president of the Royal Institute of Navigation and a GPS consultant to the British government, Hezbollah could theoretically place a special radio transmitter on an elevated surface – like a tall mountain in southern Lebanon – and potentially block Israeli GPS from working within a radius of several kilometers. “It takes so little jamming to remove GPS and to jam over a very considerable area – it only requires a radio transmitter that is portable and is easily obtained. If you place it in an elevated location, you can cover a large area,” Last said.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The US remains unalterably a maritime nation, dependent on the seas which provide the avenues for our commerce and the links to our allies and friends. ...Naval forces are uniquely valuable to the Nation for they provide special advantages and flexible options in their employment.11 These two excerpts neatly summarize current Navy and Marine Corps philosophy on the role of maritime forces in a power projection contingency. The amphibious warfare strategy follows the Navy's three-phase approach, describing how Marine forces will operate across the spectrum of conflict. A Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) can be selectively tailored to fit a given task and rapidly deploy by sea or airlift. Marine forces can perform special operations, act as a combined air-sea-land expeditionary force, or accomplish forcible entries. According to one Marine Corps publication, amphibious forces &quot;provide an unmatched forcible entry capability. Great emphasis is placed on forward presence as the key to conventional deterrence. Forward presence is enhanced through the peacetime deployment of forces such as the III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) in the Pacific and a Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) in the Mediterranean. Maritime prepositioning ships in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean carry 30 days of supplies for a Marine Amphibious Brigade. All of these assets have the effect of reducing response time in the event of a regional crisis. The ability to respond quickly with forces tailored for a particular contingency give the Marine Corps a significant capability to act as an expeditionary force. According to General Kelley, characteristics such as the ability to forward deploy, independently loiter for extended periods of time, or rapidly move ashore have made Navy-Marine forces the traditional instrument of choice &quot;particularly in the early stages of a crisis response. 14 Forward-deployed Marine units such as amphibious ready groups (ARGs) serve as a &quot;visible and credible indicator of American capability to react to sudden, unforeseen crises involving U.S. interests. ì15 These units can loiter over the horizon at sea without a need for forward basing or external sustainment, ready to assault the beach if so ordered. A force structure that is deployable, sustainable, and has an excellent forced-entry capability presumably enables the Marines Corps to &quot;meet the national need for an expeditionary/rapid deployment force.î16 In the final analysis, one of the most cherished traditions of the Marine Corps is their past history as the nation's expeditionary force. Whether or not they will remain so in the future is hotly contested. In his 1989 testimony to the Senate Armed Service Committee, Commandant of the Marine Corps General Alfred M. Gray said the Marine Corps remained this nation's expeditionary force ready to respond to a wide range of crises without the need for mobilization. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">In addition to automobile and handheld consumer devices, GPS has become the commercial mainstay of transportation systems worldwide, providing navigation for aviation, ground, and maritime operations. Farmers use precision navigation through GPS and an augmentation system to plow, cultivate, and harvest their fields. Surprisingly to many people, auto-pilot assisted/controlled vehicles will probably be realized in the near future. Civil aviation is continuously increasing its reliance on satellite-based navigation in preparation for the expected increase in air traffic. Aircraft can actually fly user-specified routes from point-to-point with reduced dependency on ground infrastructure, resulting in enhanced landing approaches. The potential savings from these improvements to civil aviation stem from increased efficiency of the air traffic control infrastructure. Life-saving missions, including disaster relief and emergency services currently depend on GPS for locating victims and deploying resources. The potential savings in human life and resources worldwide are astounding. Even everyday, commonplace activities such as banking, mobile phone operations, and control of power grids are facilitated by the accurate timing provided by GPS.</span><br />

After World War II, the United States pumped billions of dollars into war-ravaged western Europe to prevent it from falling to the influence of the Communist Soviet Union. The Marshall Plan included humanitarian aid, such as food and medical care; expert advice for rebuilding destroyed infrastructures, such as transportation and communication networks and public utilities; and outright monetary grants. Educational exchange programs, such as President Obama's 100,000 Strong initiative with China, are also an element of soft power.

<br />
<span class="Underline">At first glance, the disparity between American power and that of the rest of the world looks overwhelming. The United States is the only country with both intercontinental nuclear weapons and large, state-of-the-art air, naval and ground forces capable of global deployment. The United States also leads the world in the information-based ‘revolution in military affairs’. With American spending constituting nearly half of world military expenditure, it would be very difficult for other nations to organise a traditional military challenge against the United States. In economic size, America’s roughly one-quarter share of world economic output (at official exchange rates) is equal to the next three countries combined. In terms of soft power and cultural prominence, the United States is far and away the world’s number-one film and television exporter. The country also attracts the most foreign students each year to its institutions of higher education. In terms of power resources, America is well ahead. But power measured in resources is not the same as power measured in terms of being able to produce the outcomes one wants. Some analysts describe this world as unipolar, others as multipolar, but both descriptions are wrong, because each is an oversimplification of the situation in a world where no one form of power is decisive. Unipolarity is misleading because it exaggerates the degree to which the United States is able to get the results it wants in some dimensions of world politics, while multipolarity is misleading because it implies several roughly equal counties. Power defined in behavioural terms – the ability to influence others to produce the outcomes one wants – always depends on context. Power today is distributed among countries in a pattern that resembles a complex, three-dimensional chess game. On the top board (representing the first context in which power resources may be analysed), military power is largely unipolar. But on the middle board, economic power among states is already multipolar, with the United States, Europe and Japan representing a majority of world economic output, and China’s dramatic growth rapidly making it the fourth major player. On this economic board, the United States is not a hegemon, and often must bargain as an equal. The bottom chessboard is the realm of transnational relations that involve actors crossing borders outside of government control. This realm includes players as diverse as bankers electronically transferring sums larger than most national budgets, terrorists transferring black-market weapons and hackers disrupting Internet operations. It also includes ecological threats, such as pandemics and global climate change, that can do damage on a scale equal or larger to that of major wars. (More people died in the 1918 flu pandemic, for example, than as a direct result of the First World War.) This adds a new dimension to questions of security and risk, and includes issues for which the military instruments that dominate the top board are clearly insufficient. On this bottom board, power is widely dispersed, and it makes no sense to speak of unipolarity, multipolarity or hegemony. And yet it is from this bottom board that many of the most important security challenges arise. Those who recommend a hegemonic American foreign policy based on traditional military power are relying on inadequate analysis, and like one-dimensional chess players in a three-dimensional game, they will eventually lose. Because of its leading edge in the information revolution and its past investment in traditional power resources, the United States will likely remain the world’s single most powerful country in military, economic and soft-power terms well into the twenty-first century. While potential coalitions to check American power could be created, countries like Russia, China and India have differing goals and priorities, and it is unlikely that they would become firm military allies unless the United States used its hard, coercive power in an overbearing, unilateral manner that undermined its soft or attractive power. Because soft power is particularly important in dealing with issues arising from the bottom chessboard of transnational relations, America’s resources in this area are increasingly important. While polls show that American soft power has declined in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq, they also show that the cause of the decline is government policies, not American culture and values. This is important because policies can change relatively quickly, while culture and values change more slowly. In the early 1970s, American policies in Vietnam led to low ratings in polls, but the country regained much of its soft power within a decade. Still, the United States should guard against taking its soft-power resources for granted, as modern challenges to its leadership and security are of a different sort than they used to be. The contemporary information revolution and its attendant brand of globalisation are transforming and shrinking the world. At the beginning of this new century, these two forces combined to increase American power. But with time, technology will spread to other countries and peoples, and America’s relative pre-eminence will diminish. For example, at the beginning of this century, the American twentieth of the global population represented more than half of the world’s Internet users. Today that share has already declined. At some point in the future, the Asian cyber-community and economy will loom larger than their American counterparts. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">A grand strategy based on American primacy means ensuring the United States stays the world's number one power the diplomatic, economic and military leader. Those arguing against primacy claim that the United States should retrench, ei¬ther because the United States lacks the power to maintain its primacy and should withdraw from its global commitments, or because the maintenance of primacy will lead the United States into the trap of &quot;imperial overstretch.&quot; In the previous issue of The National Interest, Christopher Layne warned of these dangers of pri¬macy and called for retrenchment.1 Those arguing for a grand strategy of retrenchment are a diverse lot. They include isolationists, who want no foreign military commitments; selective engagers, who want U.S. military commitments to centers of economic might; and offshore balancers, who want a modified form of selective engagement that would have the United States abandon its landpower presence abroad in favor of relying on airpower and seapower to defend its in¬terests. But retrenchment, in any of its guis¬es, must be avoided. If the United States adopted such a strategy, it would be a profound strategic mistake that would lead to far greater instability and war in the world, imperil American security and deny the United States and its allies the benefits of primacy. There are two critical issues in any discussion of America's grand strategy: Can America remain the dominant state? Should it strive to do this? America can remain dominant due to its prodigious military, economic and soft power capa¬bilities. The totality of that equation of power answers the first issue. The United States has overwhelming military capa¬bilities and wealth in comparison to other states or likely potential alliances. Barring some disaster or tremendous folly, that will remain the case for the foreseeable future. With few exceptions, even those who advocate retrenchment acknowledge this. So the debate revolves around the desirability of maintaining American pri¬macy. Proponents of retrenchment focus a great deal on the costs of U.S. action¬ but they fall to realize what is good about American primacy. The price and risks of primacy are reported in newspapers every day; the benefits that stem from it are not. A GRAND strategy of ensur¬ing American primacy takes as its starting point the protec¬tion of the U.S. homeland and American global interests. These interests include ensuring that critical resources like oil flow around the world, that the global trade and monetary regimes flourish and that Washington's worldwide network of allies is reassured and protected. Allies are a great asset to the United States, in part because they shoulder some of its burdens. Thus, it is no surprise to see NATO in Afghanistan or the Australians in East Timor. In contrast, a strategy based on re¬trenchment will not be able to achieve these fundamental objectives of the United States. Indeed, retrenchment will make the United States less secure than the present grand strategy of primacy. This is because threats will exist no mat¬ter what role America chooses to play in international politics. Washington can¬not call a &quot;time out&quot;, and it cannot hide from threats. Whether they are terror¬ists, rogue states or rising powers, his¬tory shows that threats must be confront¬ed. Simply by declaring that the United States is &quot;going home&quot;, thus abandoning its commitments or making unconvinc¬ing half pledges to defend its interests and allies, does not mean that others will respect American wishes to retreat. To make such a declaration implies weak-ness and emboldens aggression. In the anarchic world of the animal kingdom, predators prefer to eat the weak rather than confront the strong. The same is true of the anarchic world of interna¬tional politics. If there is no diplomatic solution to the threats that confront the United States, then the conventional and strategic military power of the United States is what protects the country from such threats. And when enemies must be confront¬ed, a strategy based on primacy focuses on engaging enemies overseas, away from .American soil. Indeed, a key tenet of the Bush Doctrine is to attack terrorists far from America's shores and not to wait while they use bases in other countries to plan and train for attacks against the United States itself. This requires a phys¬ical, on the ground presence that cannot be achieved by offshore balancing. Indeed, as Barry Posen has noted, U.S. primacy is secured because America, at present, commands the &quot;global com¬mon&quot; the oceans, the world's airspace and outer space allowing the United States to project its power far from its borders, while denying those common avenues to its enemies. As a consequence, the costs of power projection for the United States and its allies are reduced, and the robustness of the United States' conventional and strategic deterrent ca¬pabilities is increased.' This is not an advantage that should be relinquished lightly. A remarkable fact about international politics today -in a world where Ameri¬can primacy is clearly and unambiguous¬ly on display--is that countries want to align themselves with the United States. Of course, this is not out of any sense of altruism, in most cases, but because doing so allows them to use the power of the United States for their own purposes, ¬their own protection, or to gain greater influence. Of 192 countries, 84 are allied with America -their security is tied to the United States through treaties and other informal arrangements and they include almost all of the major economic and military powers. That is a ratio of almost 17 to one (85 to five), and a big change from the Cold War when the ratio was about 1.8 to one of states aligned with the United States versus the Soviet Union. Never before in its history has this coun¬try, or any country, had so many allies. U.S. primacy -and the bandwagon¬ing effect has also given us extensive in¬fluence in international politics, allowing the United States to shape the behavior of states and international institutions. Such influence comes in many forms, one of which is America's ability to cre¬ate coalitions of like minded states to free Kosovo, stabilize Afghanistan, invade Iraq or to stop proliferation through the Pro¬liferation Security Initiative (PSI). Doing so allows the United States to operate with allies outside of the where it can be stymied by opponents. American led wars in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq stand in contrast to the UN's inability to save the people of Darfur or even to conduct any military campaign to realize the goals of its charter. The quiet effec¬tiveness of the PSI in dismantling Libya's WMD programs and unraveling the A. Q. Khan proliferation network are in sharp relief to the typically toothless attempts by the UN to halt proliferation. You can count with one hand coun¬tries opposed to the United States. They are the &quot;Gang of Five&quot;: China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Venezeula. Of course, countries like India, for example, do not agree with all policy choices made by the United States, such as toward Iran, but New Delhi is friendly to Washington. Only the &quot;Gang of Five&quot; may be expected to consistently resist the agenda and ac¬tions of the United States. China is clearly the most important of these states because it is a rising great power. But even Beijing is intimidated by the United States and refrains from openly challenging U.S. power. China proclaims that it will, if necessary, re¬sort to other mechanisms of challenging the United States, including asymmetric strategies such as targeting communica¬tion and intelligence satellites upon which the United States depends. But China may not be confident those strategies would work, and so it is likely to refrain from testing the United States directly for the foreseeable future because China's power benefits, as we shall see, from the international order U.S. primacy creates. The other states are far weaker than China. For three of the &quot;Gang of Five&quot; cases Venezuela, Iran, Cuba it is an anti U.S. regime that is the source of the problem; the country itself is not intrin¬sically anti American. Indeed, a change of regime in Caracas, Tehran or Havana could very well reorient relations. THROUGHOUT HISTORY, peace and stability have been great benefits of an era where there was a dominant power Rome, Britain or the United States today. Schol¬ars and statesmen have long recognized the irenic effect of power on the anarchic world of international politics. Everything we think of when we con¬sider the current international order free trade, a robust monetary regime, increas¬ing respect for human rights, growing de-mocratization is directly linked to U.S. power. Retrenchment proponents seem to think that the current system can be maintained without the current amount of U.S. power behind it. In that they are dead wrong and need to be reminded of one of history's most significant lessons: Appalling things happen when international orders collapse. The Dark Ages fol-lowed Rome's collapse. Hitler succeeded the order established at Versailles. With¬out U.S. power, the liberal order cre¬ated by the United States will end just as assuredly. As country and western great Rai Donner sang: &quot;You don't know what you've got (until you lose it).&quot; Consequently, it is important to note what those good things are. In addition to ensuring the security of the United States and its allies, American primacy within the international system causes many positive outcomes for Washing¬ton and the world. The first has been a more peaceful world. During the Cold War, U.S. leadership reduced friction among many states that were historical antagonists, most notably France and West Germany. Today, American primacy helps keep a number of complicated rela¬tionships aligned -between Greece and Turkey, Israel and Egypt, South Korea and Japan, India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia. This is not to say it fulfills Woodrow Wilson's vision of ending all war. Wars still occur where Washington's interests are not seriously threatened, such as in Darfur, but a Pax Americana does reduce war's likelihood, particularly war's worst form: great power wars. Second, American power gives the United States the ability to spread de¬mocracy and other elements of its ideol¬ogy of liberalism. Doing so is a source of much good for the countries concerned as well as the United States because, as John Owen noted on these pages in the Spring 2006 issue, liberal democracies are more likely to align with the United States and be sympathetic to the American worldview.3 So, spreading democracy helps maintain U.S. primacy. In addition, once states are governed democratically, the likelihood of any type of conflict is significantly reduced. This is not because democracies do not have clashing inter¬ests. Indeed they do. Rather, it is because they are more open, more transparent and more likely to want to resolve things amicably in concurrence with U.S. lead¬ership. And so, in general, democratic states are good for their citizens as well as for advancing the interests of the United States. Critics have faulted the Bush Admin¬istration for attempting to spread democ¬racy in the Middle East, labeling such an effort a modern form of tilting at windmills. It is the obligation of Bush's crit¬ics to explain why democracy is good enough for Western states but not for the rest, and, one gathers from the argument, should not even be attempted. Of course, whether democracy in the Middle East will have a peaceful or sta¬bilizing influence on America's interests in the short run is open to question. Per¬haps democratic Arab states would be more opposed to Israel, but nonetheless, their people would be better off. The United States has brought democracy to Afghanistan, where 8.5 million Af¬ghans, 40 percent of them women, voted in a critical October 2004 election, even though remnant Taliban forces threat¬ened them. The first free elections were held in Iraq in January 2005. It was the military power of the United States that put Iraq on the path to democracy. Wash¬ington fostered democratic governments in Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Caucasus. Now even the Middle East is increasingly democratic. They may not yet look like Western style democracies, but democratic progress has been made in Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Iraq, Ku¬wait, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt. By all accounts, the march of democracy has been impressive. Third, along with the growth in the number of democratic states around the world has been the growth of the glob¬al economy. With its allies, the United States has labored to create an economically liberal worldwide network character¬ized by free trade and commerce, respect for international property rights, and mo¬bility of capital and labor markets. The economic stability and prosperity that stems from this economic order is a glob¬al public good from which all states ben¬efit, particularly the poorest states in the Third World. The United States created this network not out of altruism but for the benefit and the economic well being of America. This economic order forces American industries to be competitive, maximizes efficiencies and growth, and benefits defense as well because the size of the economy makes the defense burden manageable. Economic spin offs foster the development of military technology, helping to ensure military prowess. Perhaps the greatest testament to the benefits of the economic network comes from Deepak Lal, a former Indian foreign service diplomat and researcher at the World Bank, who started his ca¬reer confident in the socialist ideology of post independence India. Abandoning the positions of his youth, Lal now recog¬nizes that the only way to bring relief to desperately poor countries of the Third World is through the adoption of free market economic policies and globaliza¬tion, which are facilitated through Amer¬ican primacy.4 As a witness to the failed alternative economic systems, Lal is one of the strongest academic proponents of American primacy due to the economic prosperity it provides. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The Lockheed Martin (NYSE : LMT) team developing the U.S. Air Force's next generation Global Positioning System has turned on initial power to the program's pathfinder spacecraft, known as the GPS III Non Flight Satellite Testbed (GNST). The milestone gives the team high confidence in meeting the scheduled launch of the first GPS III satellite in 2014. The GPS III program is the lowest risk solution to constellation sustainment and the most affordable path to meet the needs of military, commercial and civilian users worldwide. GPS III will improve position, navigation and timing services and provide advanced anti-jam capabilities yielding superior system security, accuracy and reliability. With a focus on affordability, the GPS III team is first developing the GNST, a full-sized prototype of the GPS III spacecraft used to identify and solve issues prior to the first space vehicle. This approach significantly reduces risk, improves production predictability, increases mission assurance and lowers overall program costs. The GNST, populated with fully functional non-flight boxes, provides space vehicle design level validation; early verification of ground, support, and test equipment; and early confirmation and rehearsal of transportation operations. &quot;Turning initial power on for the GNST is a major milestone for the GPS III team demonstrating we are well on track to deliver the first satellite for launch in 2014,&quot; said LtCol Don Frew, the U.S. Air Force's GPS III program manager. &quot;Our joint government and industry team is committed to delivering GPS III on schedule to sustain and modernize the GPS constellation for users worldwide.&quot; The GPS III team has installed power subsystem components, harnesses, and tracking, telemetry and control hardware on the GNST structure to support phased checkout of the integrated design. Flight software versions have also been delivered for all of the spacecraft and payload computer processors. In parallel, GPS III teammate ITT is integrating the GNST Navigation Payload at their facility in Clifton, NJ. Successfully powering on the GNST demonstrates initial mechanical integration, validates the GNST's interfaces and leads the way for electrical and integrated hardware-software testing. The GNST will be shipped to Lockheed Martin's GPS III Processing Facility in Denver late this year to demonstrate Assembly, Integration and Test procedures. It will then be delivered to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in the summer for 2012 for pathfinding activities at the launch site. &quot;Together with the Air Force, we continue to meet major program milestones on or ahead of schedule and we are committed to delivering GPS III spacecraft affordably and efficiently,&quot; said Keoki Jackson, Lockheed Martin's GPS III program director. &quot;Our progress on the GNST is already saving the program money, eliminating risk early and providing highly reliable mission assurance for GPS constellation sustainment.&quot; Building on lessons learned from previous GPS space programs; the U.S. Air Force's GPS III acquisition approach is considered by many to be the model for future space acquisition. The program has reinstated rigorous technical specifications and standards, and placed a strong emphasis on systems engineering with a robust mission assurance process. These actions provide the basis for verifying the quality of the technical work and ensuring issues are surfaced and corrected earlier in the program. For GPS III, Lockheed Martin is building on its proven record of delivering highly reliable GPS spacecraft. The fleet of Lockheed Martin-built GPS IIR and IIR-M satellites makes up the majority of the operational GPS constellation. The satellites have exceeded 140 cumulative operational years on-orbit with a reliability record of better than 99.9 percent. Lockheed Martin heritage also dates back to the production of the Oscar and Nova satellites, the programs that paved the way to the current GPS system.</span><br />

Regardless, Michael Krepon, president emeritus of the Henry L. Stimson Center, stated in an interview that the Chinese test appeared to be a political statement challenging US superiority in space. It is unlikely that the Chinese would openly attack the GPS constellation considering the international reliance on GPS for everything from civil air traffic navigation to precision timing for banking transactions. However, with the emergence of other GNSS, the protection of deterrence may lessen due to the availability of alternative navigation and timing sources should a potentially hostile nation attempt to degrade the US military’s precision strike capability.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The US has many productive bilateral relationships on satellite navigation issues. US-Japanese cooperation on GPS has included regular policy and technical consultations since 1996 and is currently based on the 1998 Clinton-Obuchi Joint Statement. Japan’s MT-SAT Satellite Based Augmentation System, which was declared operational in September 2007, is fully compatible and interoperable with GPS. Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS), which will improve GPS coverage over Japan, has also been designed to be compatible and interoperable with GPS. The US is working with Japan to set up QZSS monitoring stations in Hawaii and Guam. The European Union and the US signed a GPS-Galileo Cooperation Agreement in 2004. We jointly designed a new civil signal modulation known as MBOC (multiplexed binary offset carrier) that will be used on both GPS III and the Galileo open service. We also confirmed compatibility and interoperability between the planned signals known as L5 on GPS and E5a on Galileo. Aside from technical cooperation, we have opened channels for bilateral communication on issues related to trade and civil applications, next-generation GNSS, and security. We have started a joint outreach initiative intended to promote the future user benefits of a combined GPS-Galileo service. Russia and the US have been negotiating a GPS-GLONASS Cooperation Agreement since 2004. Productive technical working group meetings have been held. Russia is considering a proposal for GLONASS to adopt two new civil code division multiple access signals at L1 and L5 which will be interoperable with GPS, supporting an emerging international consensus on use of L1 and L5 for interoperable civil signals. India and the US have had policy and technical consultations on GPS cooperation underway since 2005. Interoperability between the US government supported wide area augmentation system and India’s planned GPS and GEO Augmented Navigation (GAGAN) system based on GPS, has been agreed. The US and India are also discussing greater interoperability between GPS and the planned India Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS). US and India recently conducted a productive GPS-IRNSS interoperability and compatibility working group and an ITU coordination meeting in Bangalore in January of 2008. In addition to Indian efforts, the US also held a GPS policy and technical consultation with Australia in April of 2007 leading to the signing of a joint delegation statement on GPS cooperation.</span><br />

Rocket emissions have two distinct effects on ozone: short-term and long-term. Following launch, rapid chemical reactions between plume gases and particles and ambient air that has been drawn into the plume wake cause immediate changes in the composition of the local atmosphere. During this phase, which lasts for several hours, the concentrations of radicals in the plume can be thousands of times greater than the concentrations found in the undisturbed stratosphere, and the ozone loss is dramatic. Long-term effects occur as gas and particulate emissions from individual launches become dispersed throughout the global stratosphere and accumulate over time. The concentrations of emitted compounds reach an approximate global steady state as exhaust from recent launches replaces exhaust removed from the stratosphere by natural atmospheric circulation.<br />

<br />
As is well understood, the space policies of the Bush administration were decidedly oriented toward military security concerns and independent action. The 2006 National Space Policy unabashedly proclaimed the U.S. intention to maintain a dominant position in space indefinitely. This policy orientation dismissed multilateral cooperation as impinging on U.S. “freedom of action,” throwing weight instead behind a wide range of technology development initiatives founded on the assumption that deployment of weapons in space was, if not already factual, certainly inevitable.2 U.S. commercial and civil engagement was overshadowed by these security concerns, expressed through the tightening of export control restrictions inhibiting a broad range of technology sharing. Once again, U.S. space policy was subsumed by other national priorities, in this case dominated by military security concerns. This background is essential for appreciating how the space policies of the Obama administration are beginning to genuinely break new trails. The U.S. National Space Policy issued in June 2010 has been widely recognized for its cooperative and multilateral tone, including as explicit near-term goals the expansion of international cooperation on all activities and pursuing international as well as national measures to enhance space stability. Particularly notable are the document’s emphasis on orienting U.S. “leadership” toward fostering international cooperation, and its references, in its concluding section, to cooperation with other states and non-state actors in the pursuit of national security space objectives.3 Less broadly noticed was this policy’s clarity and coherence in articulating a vision for U.S. space activities on its own terms. The document is organized around core principles, subsidiary goals and implementing guidelines that exceed its predecessors in delineating a longer-term direction for U.S. space policy that is integrated with, rather than derivative of, broader U.S. global aims.4 The policy also was generated and issued far earlier in the tenure of the administration than either of its predecessors, indicating an increased prioritization of attention to space policy at higher levels of policy-making. To some degree, a turn toward multilateral cooperation in U.S. space policy was to be expected. China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision increased awareness of the challenge of space debris and the need for better global information sharing on space situational awareness (SSA).5 Also, new budget realities and unpromising technological developments have scaled back ambitions in some quarters for solving U.S. space security concerns with new independent capabilities. Finally, the Obama administration has pursued a more cooperative disposition across a wide range of global policy challenges, from Iranian nuclear ambitions to global climate change. But the improved clarity of vision in the 2010 Space Policy suggests that the emphasis on fostering global cooperation on space-related activities is more grounded in deliberate foresight than sailing the prevailing political winds. The 2011 National Security Space Strategy, released February 4, is best interpreted against this background of the Obama administration’s turn toward both greater international space cooperation and greater attention to space policy in general. This first-of-its-kind strategic statement culminates a congressionally mandated space posture review.6 The initial section portraying the strategic environment to which U.S. security policy must be responsive highlights the growing problems of space debris, orbital congestion and coordination among a growing number of space actors — not state-based security threats per se. The Security Space Strategy features the objective of a “stable space environment in which nations exercise shared responsibility.”7 Specific provisions intended to implement this strategy, relevant to the preceding observations, include:8 • The strategy presents a full section on “Partnering with Responsible Nations, International Organizations, and Commercial Firms.” This category is not wholly multilateral in the traditional sense, displaying a symbiosis of alliance-building and collective cooperation not always carefully distinguished; i.e., “The United States will lead in building coalitions of like-minded space-faring nations and, where appropriate, work with international institutions to do so.” • The strategy intends to “encourage responsible behavior in space and lead by the power of example,” a significant observation given the tendency of U.S. policy-makers (as noted above) not to expect quid pro quo responses to cooperative gestures. Also, the strategy states the U.S. “will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, and norms of behavior for responsible space operations.” [italics added] In the context of the section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression,” the strategy similarly intends to “support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space” as well as “pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint,” along with other measures. This emphasis on norm-building and the role of example suggests a near-term endorsement of the development of “codes of conduct” for space activities (such as the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct, discussed below), whether or not such concord leads to more formal arms control arrangements in the longer-term. • The Department of Defense is directed to “foster cooperative SSA relationships,” and to “expand provision of safety of flight services to U.S. Government agencies, other nations, and commercial firms.” Greater SSA information sharing has been a key suggestion for fostering international cooperation; the U.S. possesses globally superior SSA capabilities, but restricts the sharing of this information on the basis of national security concerns.9 Hence, this nominal commitment is significant in its own right. • The strategy commits to reforming export controls. “In particular, as new opportunities arise for international collaboration, a revised export control system will better enable the domestic firms competing for these contracts.” As noted above, the oppressive impact of current U.S. export controls not only impinges on U.S. commercial space actors but also epitomizes the high degree to which U.S. policy has subsumed commercial and civil interests to national security concerns. The strategy appears to acknowledge this connection and commit to remedy it. • The most assertive passages of the statement are moderated with community-building intent. For example, the strategy’s section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression” concludes that the U.S. “will retain the right and capabilities to respond in self-defense, should deterrence fail,” but immediately adds that the U.S. “will use force in a manner that is consistent with longstanding principles of international law, treaties to which the United States is a party, and the inherent right of self defense.” • The concluding and most conflict-oriented section of the strategy opens by noting that “some actors may still believe counterspace actions could provide military advantage.” Counterspace capabilities, unarticulated in the document, include ASATs, ground-based directed energy weapons and satellite transmission jamming. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy Gregory Schulte explained at the strategy’s rollout that China is a principal concern in this regard, but so is the proliferation of these technologies: “If Ethiopia can jam a commercial satellite, you have to worry what others can do.”10 This section of the strategy does not, however, call for maintaining options to develop complementary space conflict capabilities. Rather, the strategy asserts that the U.S. “must be prepared to ‘fight through’ a degraded environment,” and identifies “resilience” and “space protection” as the key criteria. The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective, highlighting those elements expressing consistency with the 2010 National Space Policy’s bend toward fostering greater international collaboration. Perhaps as striking as the prevalence of such passages, however, is the absence of expressed intention — even couched in hedging language — to sustain or expand the kind of independent space-based military capabilities that were the centerpiece of the prior administration’s aims (if not its accomplishments). Again, to some extent this turn in tone is overdetermined by extenuating global circumstances. But one must still be struck by the degree to which developments such as the Chinese ASAT test have not ignited the kind of response one might have anticipated only a few short years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its sends concerning U.S. policy toward the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct.12 The strategy did not explicitly endorse this EU initiative, but Mr. Schulte, at the February 4 presentation of the strategy, highlighted the initiative “as a potential way” to promote “transparency and confidence-building measures, which tend to be voluntary as opposed to legally binding.” A week earlier, Rose Gottemoeller, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, stated at the Conference on Disarmament that the administration was nearing a decision on whether the U.S. would sign on to the code, and what modifications might be required in order to do so.13 As U.S. interest in the Code of Conduct has increased, debates over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. These policy movements toward multilateral engagement and commitment to behavioral standards (even if non-binding) mark a sharp departure from the stiff resistance to curtailing U.S. “freedom of action” in the previous administration, and have accordingly generated resistance from congressional opponents on just those terms. Prior to the release of the National Security Space Strategy, a group of 37 Republican senators led by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl issued a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concern over a potential multilateral commitment that might limit development and/or deployment of space-based missile defense interceptors and ASAT-defeating systems.14 Critics also decried the strategy’s emphasis on “the old fallacious assumption that the power of example will prevent adversaries from doing the United States harm,” and endorsed maintaining the goal of U.S. retention of a “dominant position in military and intelligence space capabilities.”15 In fact, the administration’s warming toward normative commitments in general — and the EU Code of Conduct in particular — are in part intended to forestall pressure for more formal and binding measures that would definitively cut off the “hedge” of unilateral U.S. weapons development options.16 The balance of U.S. debate may have shifted toward greater international cooperation, but the terms of the debate remain the same. In sum, the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing in U.S. policy toward greater global engagement but also, and more importantly, a step toward greater long-term coherence in thinking concerning the core goals of U.S. space activities. Even supporters of the general directions of the strategy noted its more-than-expected breadth of thought.17 But if this reading is sound, the strategy is still but one step on a long road, and ongoing debates over the role of U.S. space policy vis-à-vis broader national security interests will insure that road is bumpy. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that more specific guidelines for military implementation of the strategy remain to be developed.18 Many devils may lurk in these details.<br />

International cooperation is valuable to a given nation in that it tends to increase political sustainability. Within the United States, a program is made safer from cancellation to the extent that Congress and the administration are not willing to break international agreements. Indeed, the integration of Russia into the ISS program may well have saved the program from cancellation (consider that the year before Russia was introduced as a partner, the ISS was saved by one vote in Congress). Once cooperation has commenced, canceling a program becomes inconsistent with political sustainability as long as the utility cost associated with the loss of diplomatic benefits and the negative effects on reputation of terminating an international agreement is larger in magnitude than the utility cost that must be paid to maintain the system. In the case of the ISS, international cooperation does provide a rationale for sustaining the pro-gram, because canceling the program would result in a net loss in utility. The corollary to this is that there is a high cost to be paid by any nation that chooses to unilaterally withdraw from an existing cooperative endeavor. This cost comes in the form of damage to the departing nation’s reputation or credibility. In general, any unilateral action sends a signal that the actor is an unpredictable and therefore an unreliable and possibly disrespectful partner. This tends to sabotage the possibility of future cooperation. As such, there is a long-term benefit to maintaining cooperation, even when the immediate cost may seem to call for terminating it. If cooperation has never occurred (as is the case be-tween China and the United States), the advent of cooperation is a significant event, likely delivering a lot of diplomatic utility. On the other hand, if cooperation is the norm (as is the case between Canada and the United States), it is to be expected. The diplomatic utility of maintaining this cooperation is often not recognized. Nevertheless, the diplomatic utility cost of terminating this cooperation is large, because it would alienate a key ally. If it were necessary to cease cooperation, a mutual choice to do so would likely mitigate many of the negative reputation effects, because there would be no unilateral actor to whom one could assign blame. Indeed, if both parties choose to cease cooperat-ing simultaneously, this would mitigate the negative-reputation effect—rather, there would be a “mutual divorce.” Such a mutual decision would be significantly more tenable, in a diplomatic sense, because each party might outline a set of grievances and conditions for the termination of cooperation. Furthermore, since the agreement would be termi-nated in a spirit of mutual understanding, the possibility of future beneficial cooperation would be more likely.<br />

Perhaps of even greater concern is that several other nations, including one of China’s regional rivals, India, may feel compelled to seek ­offensive as well as defensive capabilities in space. The U.S. trade journal Defense News, for instance, quoted unidentified Indian defense officials as stating that their country had already begun developing its own kinetic-energy (nonexplosive, hit-to-kill) and laser-based antisatellite weapons. If India goes down that path, its archrival Pakistan will probably follow suit. Like India, Pakistan has a well-developed ballistic missile program, including medium-range missiles that could launch an antisatellite system. Even Japan, the third major Asian power, might join such a space race. In June 2007 the National Diet of Japan began considering a bill backed by the current Fukuda government that would permit the development of satellites for “military and national security” purposes. As for Russia, in the wake of the Chinese test President Vladimir Putin reiterated Moscow’s stance against the weaponization of space. At the same time, though, he refused to criticize Beijing’s actions and blamed the U.S. instead. The American efforts to build a missile defense system, Putin charged, and the increasingly aggressive American plans for a military position in space were prompting China’s moves. Yet Russia itself, as a major spacefaring power that has incorporated satellites into its national security structure, would be hard-pressed to forgo entering an arms race in space. Given the proliferation of spacefaring entities, proponents of a robust space warfare strategy believe that arming the heavens is inevitable and that it would be best for the U.S. to get there first with firepower. Antisatellite and space-based weapons, they argue, will be necessary not only to defend U.S. military and commercial satellites but also to deny any future adversary the use of space capabilities to enhance the performance of its forces on the battlefield. Yet any arms race in space would almost inevitably destabilize the balance of power and thereby multiply the risks of global conflict. In such headlong competition—whether in space or elsewhere—equilibrium among the adversaries would be virtually impossible to maintain. Even if the major powers did achieve stability, that reality would still provide no guarantee that both sides would perceive it to be so. The moment one side saw itself to be slipping behind the other, the first side would be strongly tempted to launch a preemptive strike, before things got even worse. Ironically, the same would hold for the side that perceived itself to have gained an advantage. Again, there would be strong temptation to strike first, before the adversary could catch up. Finally, a space weapons race would ratchet up the chances that a mere technological mistake could trigger a battle. After all, in the distant void, reliably distinguishing an intentional act from an accidental one would be highly problematic. Hit-to-Kill Interceptors According to assessments by U.S. military and intelligence officials as well as by independent experts, the Chinese probably destroyed their weather satellite with a kinetic-energy vehicle boosted by a two-stage medium-range ballistic missile. Technologically, launching such direct-ascent antisatellite weapons is one of the simplest ways to take out a satellite. About a dozen nations and consortia can reach low Earth orbit (between roughly 100 and 2,000 kilometers, or 60 to 1,250 miles, high) with a medium-range missile; eight of those countries can reach geostationary orbit (about 36,000 kilometers, or 22,000 miles, above Earth). But the real technical hurdle to making a hit-to-kill vehicle is not launch capacity; it is the precision maneuverability and guidance technology needed to steer the vehicle into its target. Just how well China has mastered those techniques is unclear. Because the weather satellite was still operating when it was destroyed, the Chinese operators would have known its exact location at all times. Ground-Based Lasers The test of China’s direct-ascent antisatellite device came on the heels of press reports in September 2006 that the Chinese had also managed to “paint,” or illuminate, U.S. spy satellites with a ground-based laser [see lower box on page 83]. Was Beijing actually trying to “blind” or otherwise damage the satellites? No one knows, and no consensus seems to have emerged in official Washington circles about the Chinese intent. Per¬haps China was simply testing how well its network of low-power laser-ranging stations could track American orbital observation platforms. Even so, the test was provocative. Not all satellites have to be electronically “fried” to be put out of commission. A 1997 test of the army’s MIRACL system (for midinfrared advanced chemical laser) showed that satellites designed to collect optical images can be temporarily disrupted—dazzled—by low-power beams. It follows that among the satellites vulnerable to such an attack are the orbital spies. The U.S. and the former Soviet Union began experimenting with laser-based antisatellite weapons in the 1970s. Engineers in both countries have focused on the many problems of building high-power laser systems that could reliably destroy low-flying satellites from the ground. Such systems could be guided by “adaptive optics”: deformable mirrors that can continuously compensate for atmospheric distortions. But tremendous amounts of energy would be needed to feed high-power lasers, and even then the range and effectiveness of the beams would be severely limited by dispersion, by attenuation as they passed through smoke or clouds, and by the difficulty of keeping the beams on-target long enough to do damage. During the development of the SDI, the U.S. conducted several laser experiments from Hawaii, including a test in which a beam was bounced off a mirror mounted on a satellite. Laser experiments continue at the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. Pentagon budget documents from fiscal years 2004 through 2007 listed antisatellite operations among the goals of the Starfire research, but that language was removed from budget documents in fiscal year 2008 after Congress made inquiries. The Starfire system incorporates adaptive optics that narrow the outgoing laser beam and thus increase the density of its power. That capability is not required for imagery or tracking, further suggesting that Starfire could be used as a weapon. Yet despite decades of work, battle-ready versions of directed-energy weapons still seem far away. An air force planning document, for instance, predicted in 2003 that a ground-based weapon able to “propagate laser beams through the atmosphere to [stun or kill low Earth orbit] satellites” could be available between 2015 and 2030. Given the current state of research, even those dates seem optimistic. Co-orbital Satellites Recent advances in miniaturized sensors, powerful onboard computers and efficient rocket thrusters have made a third kind of antisatellite technology increasingly feasible: the offensive microsatellite. One example that demonstrates the potential is the air force’s experimental satellite series (XSS) project, which is developing microsatellites intended to conduct “autonomous proximity operations” around larger satellites. The first two microsatellites in the program, the XSS-10 and XSS-11, were launched in 2003 and 2005. Though ostensibly intended to inspect larger satellites, such microsatellites could also ram target satellites or carry explosives or directed-energy payloads such as radio-frequency jamming systems or high-powered microwave emitters. Air force budget documents show that the XSS effort is tied to a program called Advanced Weapons Technology, which is dedicated to research on military laser and microwave systems. During the cold war the Soviet Union developed, tested and even declared operational a co-orbital antisatellite system—a maneuverable interceptor with an explosive payload that was launched by missile into an orbit near a target satellite in low Earth orbit. In effect, the device was a smart “space mine,” but it was last demonstrated in 1982 and is probably no longer working. Today such an interceptor would likely be a microsatellite that could be parked in an orbit that would cross the orbits of several of its potential targets. It could then be activated on command during a close encounter. In 2005 the air force described a program that would provide “localized” space “situational awareness” and “anomaly characterization” for friendly host satellites in geostationary orbit. The program is dubbed ANGELS (for autonomous nanosatellite guardian for evaluating local space), and the budget line believed to represent it focuses on acquiring “high value space asset defensive capabilities,” including a “warning sensor for detection of a direct ascent or co-orbital vehicle.” It is clear that such guardian nanosatellites could also serve as offensive weapons if they were maneuvered close to enemy satellites. And the list goes on. A “parasitic satellite” would shadow or even attach itself to a target in geostationary orbit. Farsat, which was mentioned in an appendix to the [Donald] Rumsfeld Space Commission report in 2001, “would be placed in a ‘storage’ orbit (perhaps with many microsatellites housed inside) relatively far from its target but ready to be maneuvered in for a kill.” Finally, the air force proposed some time ago a space-based radio-frequency weapon system, which “would be a constellation of satellites containing high-power radio-frequency transmitters that possess the capability to disrupt/¬destroy/disable a wide variety of electronics and national-level command and control systems.” Air force planning documents from 2003 envisioned that such a technology would emerge after 2015. But outside experts think that orbital radio-frequency and microwave weapons are technically feasible today and could be deployed in the relatively near future. Space Bombers Though not by definition a space weapon, the Pentagon’s Common Aero Vehicle/Hypersonic Technology Vehicle (often called CAV) enters into this discussion because, like an ICBM, it would travel through space to strike Earth-bound targets. An unpowered but highly maneuverable hypersonic glide vehicle, the CAV would be deployed from a future hypersonic space plane, swoop down into the atmosphere from orbit and drop conventional bombs on ground targets. Congress recently began funding the project but, to avoid stoking a potential arms race in space, has prohibited any work to place weapons on the CAV. Although engineers are making steady progress on the key technologies for the CAV program, both the vehicle and its space plane mothership are still likely decades off. Some of the congressional sensitivity to the design of the CAV may have arisen from another, much more controversial space weapons concept with parallel goals: hypervelocity rod bundles that would be dropped to Earth from orbital platforms. For decades air force planners have been thinking about placing weapons in orbit that could strike terrestrial targets, particularly buried, “hardened” bunkers and caches of weapons of mass destruction. Commonly called “rods from God,” the bundles would be made up of large tungsten rods, each as long as six meters (20 feet) and 30 centimeters (12 inches) across. Each rod would be hurled downward from an orbiting spacecraft and guided to its target at tremendous speed. Both high costs and the laws of physics, however, challenge their feasibility. Ensuring that the projectiles do not burn up or deform from reentry friction while sustaining a precise, nearly vertical flight path would be extremely difficult. Calculations indicate that the nonexplosive rods would probably be no more effective than more conventional munitions. Furthermore, the expense of lofting the heavy projectiles into orbit would be exorbitant. Thus, despite continued interest in them, rods from God seem to fall into the realm of science fiction. Obstacles to Space Weapons What, then, is holding the U.S. (and other nations) back from a full-bore pursuit of space weapons? The countervailing pressures are threefold: political opposition, technological challenges and high costs. The American body politic is deeply divided over the wisdom of making space warfare a part of the national military strategy. The risks are manifold. I remarked earlier on the general instabilities of an arms race, but there is a further issue of stability among the nuclear powers. Early-warning and spy satellites have traditionally played a crucial role in reducing fears of a surprise nuclear attack. But if antisatellite weapons disabled those eyes-in-the-sky, the resulting uncertainty and distrust could rapidly lead to catastrophe. One of the most serious technological challenges posed by space weapons is the proliferation of space debris, to which I alluded earlier. According to investigators at the air force, NASA and Celestrak (an independent space-monitoring Web site), the Chinese antisatellite test left more than 2,000 pieces of junk, baseball-size and larger, orbiting the globe in a cloud that lies between about 200 kilometers (125 miles) and 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) above Earth’s surface. Perhaps another 150,000 objects that are a centimeter (half an inch) across and larger were released. High orbital velocities make even tiny pieces of space junk dangerous to spacecraft of all kinds. And ground stations cannot reliably monitor or track objects smaller than about five centimeters (two inches) across in low Earth orbit (around a meter in geostationary orbit), a capability that might enable satellites to maneuver out of the way. To avoid being damaged by the Chinese space debris, in fact, two U.S. satellites had to alter course. Any shooting war in space would raise the specter of a polluted space environment no longer navigable by Earth-orbiting satellites. Basing weapons in orbit also pre¬sents difficult technical obstacles. They would be just as vulnerable as satellites are to all kinds of outside agents: space debris, projectiles, electromagnetic signals, even natural micrometeoroids. Shielding space weapons against such threats would also be impractical, mostly because shielding is bulky and adds mass, thereby greatly increasing launch costs. Orbital weapons would be mostly autonomous mechanisms, which would make operational errors and failures likely. The paths of objects in orbit are relatively easy to predict, which would make hiding large weapons problematic. And because satellites in low Earth orbit are overhead for only a few minutes at a time, keeping one of them constantly in range would require many weapons. Finally, getting into space and operating there is extremely expensive: between $2,000 and $10,000 a pound to reach low Earth orbit and between $15,000 and $20,000 a pound for geostationary orbit. Each space-based weapon would require replacement every seven to 15 years, and in-orbit repairs would not be cheap, either. Alternatives to Space Warfare Given the risks of space warfare to national and international security, as well as the technical and financial hurdles that must be overcome, it would seem only prudent for spacefaring nations to find ways to prevent an arms race in space. The U.S. focus has been to reduce the vulnerability of its satellite fleet and explore alternatives to its dependence on satellite services. Most other space-capable countries are instead seeking multilateral diplomatic and legal measures. The options range from treaties that would ban antisatellite and space-based weapons to voluntary measures that would help build transparency and mutual confidence. The Bush administration has adamantly opposed any form of negotiations regarding space weapons. Opponents of multilateral space weapons agreements contend that others (particularly China) will sign up but build secret arsenals at the same time, because such treaty violations cannot be detected. They argue further that the U.S. cannot sit idly as potential adversaries gain spaceborne resources that could enhance their terrestrial combat capabilities. Proponents of international treaties counter that failure to negotiate such agreements entails real opportunity costs. An arms race in space may end up compromising the security of all nations, including that of the U.S., while it stretches the economic capacities of the competitors to the breaking point. And whereas many advocates of a space weapons ban concede that it will be difficult to construct a fully verifiable treaty—because space technology can be used for both military and civilian ends—effective treaties already exist that do not require strict verification. A good example is the Biological Weapons Convention. Certainly a prohibition on the testing and use (as opposed to the deployment) of the most dangerous class of near-term space weapons—destructive (as opposed to jamming) antisatellite systems—would be easily verifiable, because earthbound observers can readily detect orbital debris. Furthermore, any party to a treaty would know that all its space launches would be tracked from the ground, and any suspicious object in orbit would promptly be labeled as such. The international outcry that would ensue from such overt treaty violations could deter would-be violators. Since the mid-1990s, however, progress on establishing a new multilateral space regime has lagged. The U.S. has blocked efforts at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to begin negotiations on a treaty to ban space weapons. China, meanwhile, has refused to accept anything less. Hence, intermediate measures such as voluntary confidence-building, space traffic control or a code of responsible conduct for spacefaring nations have remained stalled. Space warfare is not inevitable. But the recent policy shift in the U.S. and China’s provocative actions have highlighted the fact that the world is approaching a crossroads. Countries must come to grips with their strong self-interest in preventing the testing and use of orbital weapons. The nations of Earth must soon decide whether it is possible to sustain the predominantly peaceful human space exploration that has already lasted half a century. The likely alternative would be unacceptable to all.<br />

Johnson-Freese makes the case for a comprehensive U.S. space strategy that fosters cooperation with major space powers; this in turn requires moving away from a U.S. military doctrine of space control and reinforcing the peaceful uses of outer space. She acknowledges the possibility that the United States might need space weapons one day but concludes that the case for such weapons is not now compelling. This argument assumes, as Johnson-Freese believes, that China is willing to accept her vision of a cooperative future in space. The one scenario that stands most prominently in the way of this vision is a potential confrontation between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan. Johnson-Freese argues persuasively that national security is not the only driver for China’s space policy; other drivers are economic development and national pride. The United States and Soviet Union managed to carve out a zone of cooperation in space, but this was possible only during upswings in bilateral relations. U.S. space cooperation with China may well be possible under similar circumstances. Johnson-Freese advocates legally binding agreements to manage the security dilemma in space. In the interim, Johnson-Freese does not envision an arms race in space between the United States and China, since Beijing will pursue asymmetric responses to U.S. military plans. Consequently, if the Bush administration’s policies continue unabated, the United States will be ‘‘racing against itself.’’ But Beijing will be ‘‘hedging its bets’’ against the development of space weapons by the Pentagon. Johnson-Freese did not predict ASAT testing as part of this hedging strategy; neither did she rule this out. She resorts to occasional overstatement, as when referring to space weapons as ‘‘bright, shiny objects that the Bush administration seems fixated upon.’’ But overall, her book makes an informed and well-defended case that the Bush administration’s space policies could benefit from course corrections. Mike Moore’s book, Twilight War: The Folly of U.S. Space Dominance, is also written with lay readers in mind. Moore, a former editor of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, writes with clarity and passion against the policy preferences of U.S. ‘‘space warriors.’’ Moore is interested primarily in the military uses of space, a narrower focus than Space as a Strategic Asset, but one that leaves room for many digressions about the history of airpower and U.S. exceptionalism, which he believes is one of the root causes of unwise U.S. military space policy. Some readers may take issue with the extent of these digressions; this reviewer learned from them. Moore doesn’t mince words. His central thesis is that the Bush administration’s space policy is not only ‘‘headed in the wrong direction,’’ but that the pursuit of space dominance is ‘‘a lulu of a mistake,’’ and that the initiation of military strikes in space by the United States ‘‘will guarantee conflict and, possibly, a new cold war.’’ He argues for ‘‘a new and unrelentingly tough space treaty’’ to ensure that no nation could dominate space. Moore contends that such a treaty, ‘‘if it is hardheaded enough’’ and if it is negotiated by ‘‘the most skeptical realists,’’ can be fully verifiable. It must also, in his view, contain ‘‘tough and certain’’ sanctions against violators. To enforce the treaty, he argues that signatories must be ‘‘unfailingly willing’’ to destroy the spaceports of states that violate treaty provisions.<br />

President Obama’s FY2012 budget request provides funding for three multiagency R&amp;D initiatives. Funding for the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is requested in the amount of $2.130 billion for FY2012, $217 million (11.3%) above the FY2010 actual level of $1.931 billion. The overall increase in the FY2012 NNI funding request is due, in part, to funding for what the administration refers to as “signature initiatives:” Nanoelectronics for 2020 and Beyond; Sustainable Manufacturing: Creating the Industries of the Future; and Nanotechnology for Solar Energy Collection and Conversion. Under the Administration’s FY2012 request, nanotechnology funding would increase at the Department of Energy by $237 million (63.3%) over its FY2010 funding level, at the Department of Health and Human Services by $24 million (5.0%), at NASA by $13 million (64.0%), and at the National Science Foundation by $11 million (2.5%). Funding for FY2012 would fall for the Department of Defense by $71 million (-16.2%), the Department of Homeland Security by $12 million (-53.4%), and the Department of Agriculture by $4 million (-18.2%). Nanotechnology funding for other NNI agencies would remain flat in FY2012.<br />

Drexler anticipated many of these possibilities in Engines of Destruction (Chapter 11 of Engines of Creation): &quot;Able to replicate swiftly, they [nanites] could become abundant in a matter of days. Able to make almost anything, they could be programmed to duplicate existing weapons, but made from superior materials.... States could use replicating assemblers to build arsenals of advanced weapons, swiftly, easily, and in vast quantity. States could use special replicators directly to wage a sort of germ warfare—one made vastly more practical by programmable, computer-controlled &quot;germs.&quot; &quot; In summary, he notes, &quot;a state that makes the assembler [nanite] breakthrough could rapidly create a decisive military force—if not literally overnight, then at least with unprecedented speed.&quot; Thus, today's military nobody—even today's Somalia—could become the world's next leading superpower. Could, in fact, become something incalculably more powerful: the world's first nanopower. And—as noted in the afterword to the author's book Nano—&quot;the first nanopower, if it plays its cards right, will be the only nanopower, and will remain unchallenged for the foreseeable future.

<strong>Heg collapse causes global nuclear war</strong><br />

<br />
THROUGHOUT HISTORY, peace and stability have been great benefits of an era where there was a dominant power--Rome, Britain or the United States today. Scholars and statesmen have long recognized the irenic effect of power on the anarchic world of international politics. Everything we think of when we consider the current international order--free trade, a robust monetary regime, increasing respect for human rights, growing democratization--is directly linked to U.S. power. Retrenchment proponents seem to think that the current system can be maintained without the current amount of U.S. power behind it. In that they are dead wrong and need to be reminded of one of history's most significant lessons: Appalling things happen when international orders collapse. The Dark Ages followed Rome's collapse. Hitler succeeded the order established at Versailles. Without U.S. power, the liberal order created by the United States will end just as assuredly. As country and western great Ral Donner sang: &quot;You don't know what you've got (until you lose it).&quot; Consequently, it is important to note what those good things are. In addition to ensuring the security of the United States and its allies, American primacy within the international system causes many positive outcomes for Washington and the world. The first has been a more peaceful world. During the Cold War, U.S. leadership reduced friction among many states that were historical antagonists , most notably France and West Germany. Today, American primacy helps keep a number of complicated relationships aligned --between Greece and Turkey, Israel and Egypt, South Korea and Japan, India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia. This is not to say it fulfills Woodrow Wilson's vision of ending all war. Wars still occur where Washington's interests are not seriously threatened, such as in Darfur, but a Pax Americana does reduce war's likelihood, particularly war's worst form: great power wars.<br />

<strong>SCOTT 90</strong><br />
(Charles E., professor of Philosophy at Pennsylvania State University, “The Question of Ethics: Nietzsche, Foucault, Heidegger,” Ed. John Sallis, p. 173-174)<br />
<br />
One pathogenic aspect of our Western ethos that we have followed is the ascetic ideal. It is characterized by many types of refusal and denial regarding the manner in which human life occurs, and on Nietzsche's account the ascetic ideal reinforces this denial with a habitual insistence on the continuous presence of meaning in all dimensions of life and being. In our ascetic withdrawal from life we join forces with hopelessness, suffering, death, and helplessness by giving them meaning, in our appropriation of them, that far exceeds their occurrence and that subordinates them within a scheme of meaning and hope. The rule governing the ascetic ideal is found in its incorporation and blind expression of the hopelessness and meaninglessness that it is designed to overcome. This incorporation of what it is constitutes the ideal's nihilism for Nietzsche: the affirmations within the ascetic ideal project their opposites and produce a spiral of unwitting and inevitable violence in the spirituality that they create. The denial of life within the boundaries of the ascetic ideal continuously reestablishes the power of the ideal. But when this movement is broken by a self-overcoming like that in Nietzsche's genealogy of the ascetic ideal, the rule of the ascetic ideal is interrupted and a possibility is opened for life-affirmations that do not suppress the most fearful occurrences involved in being alive. The joyousness of life without the illusion of continuous meaning, the joyousness that Nietzsche found in early Greek culture, was lost, according to his reading, in the course of the increasing cultural dominance of those whose nerve has failed before the disheartening flow of life. The ascetic ideal expresses this failure in its insistence on meaning and in its persistent manufacture of hope out of illusions bred of the failure. Heidegger is perhaps at his most non-Nietzschean point when in his Rector's address he turns to the Greek division between the everyday and the question of being. This is an ironic moment in Heidegger's thought: he traces the origins of his own move to separate the future of the German university from the German Volkstum, (that is, from dominant popular culture) to the emergence of the separation of thought from everyday life in Greek culture. But this move is not associated with the joyousness that Nietzsche uses as his reference in delimiting the ascetic ideal. According to Nietzsche's genealogy we have lost an earthly affirmation of life in the midst of the specific suffering of everyday existence. Nietzsche countenances fully the brutality, the fateful shattering of hope, the disappointments that break people's lives, the individual and social tragedies. The debilitation of minds and bodies is juxtaposed to people's savoring food and drink, enjoying sexual pleasure. It is juxtaposed to friendship, the energy of ambition, the struggle between competitors, the mixture of desperation and exhilaration in efforts of accomplishment. Nietzsche's move is toward affirmation in the midst of chaotic living when he speaks of what is lost in the blind and self-deceived chaos of asceticism that is ordered by the illusion of continuous meaning. In this affirmation one has an awareness, presumably a full awareness, of the otherness to human interest that radically distresses us. People's attention is delimited by it. Rather than escape or turn away from it, people are delimited by it in their relations with things. Rather than appropriate the suffering of life in ascetic self-denial, human beings stand over against its otherness, its unthinkableness, its density. They need not attempt to embody it in forms that seem to shape it to human and thinkable dimensions. They live in the inappropriable, meaningless dark vacuity, with it and other to it, out of it and in it. They are angel and animal, Nietzsche said. Not to be lost, not to be redeemed, not to be overcome, it is juxtaposed to a will to live, an affirmation with, and not in spite of, the chaos.<br />

No other concept in international relations packs the metaphysical punch, nor commands the disciplinary power of &quot;security.&quot; In its name, peoples have alienated their fears, rights and powers to gods, emperors, and most recently, sovereign states, all to protect themselves from the vicissitudes of nature--as well as from other gods, emperors, and sovereign states. In its name, weapons of mass destruction have been developed which have transfigured national interest into a security dilemma based on a suicide pact. And, less often noted in international relations, in its name billions have been made and millions killed while scientific knowledge has been furthered and intellectual dissent muted. We have inherited an ontotheology of security, that is, an a priori argument that proves the existence and necessity of only one form of security because there currently happens to be a widespread, metaphysical belief in it. Indeed, within the concept of security lurks the entire history of western metaphysics, which was best described by Derrida &quot;as a series of substitutions of center for center&quot; in a perpetual search for the &quot;transcendental signified.&quot; From God to Rational Man, from Empire to Republic, from King to the People--and on occasion in the reverse direction as well, for history is never so linear, never so neat as we would write it--the security of the center has been the shifting site from which the forces of authority, order, and identity philosophically defined and physically kept at bay anarchy, chaos, and difference. Yet the center, as modern poets and postmodern critics tell us, no longer holds. The demise of a bipolar system, the diffusion of power into new political, national, and economic constellations, the decline of civil society and the rise of the shopping mall, the acceleration of everything --transportation, capital and information flows, change itself--have induced a new anxiety. As George Bush repeatedly said--that is, until the 1992 Presidential election went into full swing--&quot;The enemy is unpredictability. The enemy is instability.&quot; One immediate response, the unthinking reaction, is to master this anxiety and to resecure the center by remapping the peripheral threats. In this vein, the Pentagon prepares seven military scenarios for future conflict, ranging from latino small-fry to an IdentiKit super-enemy that goes by the generic acronym of REGT (&quot;Reemergent Global Threat&quot;). In the heartlands of America, Toyota sledge-hammering returns as a popular know-nothing distraction. And within the Washington beltway, rogue powers such as North Korea, Iraq, and Libya take on the status of pariah-state and potential video bomb-site for a permanently electioneering elite.<br />

The three long-stalled free-trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia finally look as though they will make their way through Congress next week. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said he expects Senate to begin work Monday on the deals as well as on a renewal of the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which has been one of the major sticking points between the parties in considering the trade pacts. The trade deals are one of the few areas of broad bipartisan agreement on which Congress is poised to act this fall; passage of the deals would give both parties the chance to make the case that they are working on creating jobs.<br />

In the blink of an eye, a subject purely in the realm of science fiction became science fact — and a major cultural phenomenon, not to mention a huge government program. At its funding peak during the Apollo years, NASA consumed over four percent of the entire federal budget. The funding would not have flowed so freely if not for the urgency of the race with the Soviets. Had the Soviets been rushing not up to space but down to the bottom of the Marianas Trench (which had in fact just been reached in 1960), the United States would have spent lavishly to get there first. Had Kennedy not been assassinated and had he won a second term, he might well have ended the Apollo program himself as it became clear that we were winning the space race and as the race became less urgent in the face of other national priorities. A couple of months before his death, Kennedy even told NASA Administrator James Webb that he “wasn’t that interested in space.” And that has been NASA’s fundamental problem ever since. The American people and their representatives in Congress are just not that interested in space, and never have been, going all the way back to Apollo. And it shows in our space policy, which has from the start been confused and contradictory.<br />

<strong>Pol cap is key – Obama has to fight labor opposition and push through TAA</strong><br />

<br />
Still, Congress' approval of the South Korea, Colombia and Panama deals is not assured. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation which opposes the deals, boasted on Wednesday that opponents may have the votes to stop the pacts, which they see as a threat to U.S. jobs. &quot;I think we have a real shot at it,&quot; Trumka said. In addition to the challenge from organized labor, Obama must persuade Republicans focusing on spending cuts to renew a retraining program for displaced workers known as Trade Adjustment Assistance. This is critical to gaining enough Democratic votes in the Senate to approve the trade pacts. Republican opposition to TAA &quot;makes our job, quite frankly, a little bit easier, because no one is going to support those trade agreements without TAA,&quot; said Trumka. Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senator Charles Schumer also have signaled plans to push for a vote on legislation to pressure China to revalue its currency in conjunction with the free trade pacts. That would inflame relations with Beijing and possibly trigger tit-for-tat trade retaliation if Obama does not expend political capital to block it. The early start of the 2012 U.S. election campaigns, however, may dampen Obama's appetite to lead aggressively on trade. But &quot;if the administration spends the effort and actually finishes the job (the trade deals) with Congress, that will send a very positive signal,&quot; said Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.<br />

Fourth, and finally, the KORUS FTA will give impetus to global trade liberalization: By demonstrating that two large, advanced economies can conclude a high- quality agreement eliminating both tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade and investment, the KORUS FTA could help spur further trade liberalization both within the Asia- Pacific region and globally. It will send a signal to our other trading partners, encouraging them to open their economies and creating a competitive dynamic that would spur more rapid progress on the multilateral trade liberalization front.<br />

<strong>Trade prevents nuclear war</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Spicer 96</strong> (The Challenge from the East and the Rebirth of the West, p. 121)<br />
<br />
The choice facing the West today is much the same as that which faced the Soviet bloc after World War II: between meeting head-on the challenge of world trade with the adjustments and the benefits that it will bring, or of attempting to shut out markets that are growing and where a dynamic new pace is being set for innovative production. The problem about the second approach is not simply that it won't hold: satellite technology alone will ensure that he consumers will begin to demand those goods that the East is able to provide most cheaply. More fundamentally, it will guarantee the emergence of a fragmented world in which natural fears will be fanned and inflamed. A world divided into rigid trade blocs will be a deeply troubled and unstable place in which suspicion and ultimately envy will possibly erupt into a major war. I do not say that the converse will necessarily be true, that in a free trading world there will be an absence of all strife. Such a proposition would manifestly be absurd. But to trade is to become interdependent, and that is a good step in the direction of world stability. With nuclear weapons at two a penny, stability will be at a premium in the years ahead.<br />

Mr. Westling stats that “Space Development is the only long term answer to the, just starting, energy shortage; which will otherwise continue until we have an economic collapse.” He believes that no-one is doing space development . Instead, we have space technology, not development. NASA has no TRL 10 – therefore no plans to develop space .

We are currently in the process of choosing some new challenges. We have solicited ideas from scientists and engineers within NASA and from the public. Almost two hundred ideas were submitted, and some of them will be reflected in the new prize challenges. In addition to benefiting NASA missions, we are also interested in prize challenges that address national and global needs such as energy, climate change, health, and education. Innovation from Anywhere The winners of the challenges show that innovation comes from diverse and sometimes unexpected sources. The first Astronaut Glove Challenge was won by Peter Homer, who developed his design working alone at his dining room table in Maine. Homer conducted dozens of failed experiments that helped him arrive at the winning design. After winning the prize he formed his own company to manufacture pressure-suit gloves and related products. Another competitor in that challenge, Ted Southern, is a costume designer from New York who partnered with a former rival and won the second-place prize in the latest astronaut glove competition. In the first two years of the Regolith Excavation Challenge, no team came close to meeting the requirements: to create a self-propelled robot that could dig up and dump at least 150 kilograms of lunar soil into a container in thirty minutes. Then, in 2009, three of the twenty-three participating teams far surpassed the requirements. The winner of the $500,000 prize was a team from Worcester Polytechnic Institute led by undergraduate Paul Ventimiglia. Their excavator moved 440 kilograms, almost three times the amount required. Many prize competitors are existing small businesses; these small companies find that the prize competitions allow them to focus their efforts and provide them with visibility and credibility not easily attained in fields that are often dominated by large corporations. That was the outcome for Armadillo Aerospace, based in northern Texas, and Masten Space Systems of Mojave, California, the two Lunar Lander Challenge winners. Both companies have been recognized nationally as entrepreneurs and are pursuing new opportunities with potential commercial and government customers.<br />

<span class="Underline">UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The Palestinian leader took his people's quest for independence to the heart of world diplomacy Friday, seeking U.N. recognition of Palestine and sidestepping negotiations that have foundered for nearly two decades under the weight of inflexibility, violence and failure of will. The bid to win recognition of a state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem — submitted over the objections of the U.S. — laid bare the deep sense of Palestinian exasperation after 44 years of Israeli occupation. &quot;The time is now for the Palestinian Spring, the time for independence,&quot; Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared. &quot;The time has come to end the suffering and the plight of millions of Palestine refugees in the homeland and the diaspora, to end their displacement and to realize their rights.&quot; After Abbas submitted his formal application, international mediators called on Israel and the Palestinians to return to long-stalled negotiations and reach an agreement no later than next year. The Quartet — the U.S., European Union, U.N. and Russia — urged both parties to draw up an agenda for peace talks within a month and produce comprehensive proposals on territory and security within three months. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the proposal &quot;represents the firm conviction of the international community that a just and lasting peace can only come through negotiations between the parties.&quot; Similar plans have failed to produce a peace agreement, and it was unclear how the two sides could bridge their huge differences and resume talks.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Greater international environmental regulation can increase international tension. Foreign policy is a bag of goods that includes issues from free trade to arms trading to human rights. Each new issue in the bag weighs it down, lessening the focus on other issues and even creating conflicts between issues. Increased environmental regulations could cause countries to lessen their focus on international threats of violence such as the sale of ballistic missiles or border conflicts between nations. As countries must watch over more and more issues arising in the international policy arena, they will stretch the resources necessary to deal with traditional international issues. As Schaefer (2000, 46) writes, “Because diplomatic currency is finite . . . it is critically important that the United States focus its diplomatic efforts on issues of paramount importance to the nation. Traditionally, these priorities have been opposing hostile domination of key geographic regions, supporting our allies, securing vital resources, and ensuring access to foreign economies.”</span><br />

<span class="Underline">A United Nations vote on Palestinian membership would be ruinous. Yet with little time left before the U.N. General Assembly meets, the United States, Israel and Europe have shown insufficient urgency or boldness in trying to find a compromise solution. The need for action is even more acute after alarming tensions flared in recent days between Israel and two critical regional players — Egypt and Turkey. Last week, the United States made a listless effort to get Palestinians to forgo the vote in favor of new peace talks. The pitch was unpersuasive. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, said the Americans made no concrete proposal. “To be frank with you, they came too late,” he said. His frustration is understandable. Since President Obama took office, the only direct negotiations between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Mr. Abbas lasted a mere two weeks in September 2010. Both sides share the blame with Mr. Obama and Arab leaders (we put the greater onus on Mr. Netanyahu, who has used any excuse to thwart peace efforts). But the best path to statehood remains negotiations. The United States and its Quartet partners (the European Union, the United Nations and Russia) should put a map and a deal on the table, with a timeline for concluding negotiations and a formal U.N. statehood vote. The core element: a Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders with mutually agreed land swaps and guarantees for Israel’s security. The Security Council and the Arab League need to throw their full weight behind any plan. To get full U.N. membership the Palestinians have to win Security Council approval. The administration has said it will veto any resolution — ensuring the further isolation of Israel and Washington. If they fail in the Security Council, the Palestinians have said they will ask the General Assembly for enhanced observer status as a nonmember state. Even the more modest General Assembly vote, which the Palestinians are sure to win, would pave the way for them to join dozens of U.N. bodies and conventions, and could strengthen their ability to pursue cases against Israel at the International Criminal Court. But Israel would still control Palestinian territory, leaving the Palestinians disaffected after the initial euphoria. Congress has threatened to cut millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinian Authority if it presses for a U.N. vote. Instead of just threatening the Palestinians, Congress should lean on Mr. Netanyahu to return to talks. Israel has said it would cut millions of dollars in tax remittances to the authority. Such counterproductive moves could bring down the most moderate leadership the Palestinians have had, empower Hamas and shred vital security cooperation between Israel and the authority. It is astonishing that this late in the game, America and Europe remain divided over some aspects of a proposal for peace talks — like Israel’s demand for recognition as a Jewish state. Mr. Obama in particular needs to show firmer leadership in pressing Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas to resume talks. If a U.N. vote takes place, Washington and its partners will have to limit the damage, including continuing to finance the Palestinian Authority. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The gathering storm in the Middle East is gaining momentum. War clouds are on the horizon and like conditions prior to World War I all it takes for explosive action to commence is a trigger. Turkey’s provocative flotilla - often described in Orwellian terms as a humanitarian mission - has set in motion a flurry of diplomatic activity, but if the Iranians send escort vessels for the next round of Turkish ships, it could present a casus belli. It is also instructive that Syria is playing a dangerous game with both missile deployment and rearming Hezbollah. According to most public accounts Hezbollah is sitting on 40,000 long, medium and short range missiles and Syrian territory has served as a conduit for military material from Iran since the end of the 2006 Lebanon War. Should Syria move its own scuds to Lebanon or deploy its troops as reinforcement for Hezbollah, a wider regional war with Israel could not be contained. In the backdrop is an Iran with sufficient fissionable material to produce a couple of nuclear weapons. It will take some time to weaponize missiles, but the road to that goal is synchronized in green lights since neither diplomacy nor diluted sanctions can convince Iran to change course. Iran is poised to be the hegemon in the Middle East. It is increasingly considered the “strong horse” as American forces incrementally retreat from the region. Even Iraq, ironically, may depend on Iranian ties in order to maintain internal stability. From Qatar to Afghanistan all political eyes are on Iran. For Sunni nations like Egypt and Saudi Arabia regional strategic vision is a combination of deal making to offset the Iranian Shia advantage and attempting to buy or develop nuclear weapons as a counter weight to Iranian ambition. However, both of these governments are in a precarious state. Should either fall, all bets are off in the Middle East neighborhood. It has long been said that the Sunni “tent” must stand on two legs, if one, falls, the tent collapses. Should that tent collapse and should Iran take advantage of that calamity, it could incite a Sunni-Shia war. Or feeling its oats and no longer dissuaded by an escalation scenario with nuclear weapons in tow, war against Israel is a distinct possibility. However, implausible it may seem at the moment, the possible annihilation of Israel and the prospect of a second holocaust could lead to a nuclear exchange.</span><br />

This was most clearly demonstrated by: • the establishment of a national space agency, the RKA, now Roscosmos; • the turning around of the program from the most self-sufficient national program to the most globally competitive in the world; • the attraction of significant foreign investment to sustain the manned and unmanned program; • 87 space-based companies which entered joint ventures with American and European companies to sustain and develop their projects; • the opening of new cosmodromes (Svobodny and Dombarovska), the development of new launching systems (Barents Sea) and a launch base in French Guyana; • the adaptation of missiles to serve as launchers: Rockot, Start, Dnepr and Shtil; • the introduction of new upper stages: Ikar, Fregat, Briz KM and Briz M. The Russian space program began to show the promise of new life: • fresh groups of cosmonauts were recruited; • the production line of the Soyuz and Proton rockets was increased; • the Soyuz 2 series was introduced; • progress was made in the preparation of a new family of rockets, the Angara. It is possible that 1997 marked the low point of the extreme financial and organizational pressure inflicted on the Russian space program. Ten years later, Russia was in a better position to develop future projects. In 2005 the government approved a new federal space plan. Here we review its key elements, for they mark out the intended future path of Russian space exploration.</span><br />

 <span class="Underline"><strong>Space is merely an outlet for the state to expand its capitalist grip – infinite wars will be fought over new resources – also their advantages are made up and/or inevitable in capitalism</strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Dickens 9</strong> – Visiting Professor of Sociology at the University of Essex</span><br />
<span class="Underline">(Peter, “The Cosmos as Capitalism’s Outside,” The Sociological Review, 57: 66–82)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">The imminent conquest of outer space raises the question of ‘outside’ and ‘inside’ yet again. Capitalism now has the cosmos in its sights, an outside which can be privately or publicly owned, made into a commodity, an entity for which nations and private companies can compete. As such the cosmos is a possible site of armed hostilities. This means, contra Hardt and Negri, that there is an outside after all, one into which the competitive market can now expand indefinitely. A new kind of imperialism is therefore underway, albeit not one attempting to conquer and exploit people ‘outside’ since there are no consumers or labour power to exploit in other parts of the solar system. Ferrying wealthy tourists into the cosmos is a first and perhaps most spectacular part of this process of capital's cosmic expansion. Especially important in the longer term is making outer space into a source of resources and materials. These will in due course be incorporated into production-processes, most of which will be still firmly lodged on earth. Access to outer space is, potentially at least, access to an infinite outside array of resources. These apparently have the distinct advantage of not being owned or used by any pre-existing society and not requiring military force by an imperializing power gaining access to these resources. Bringing this outside zone into capitalism may at first seem beneficial to everyone. But this scenario is almost certainly not so trouble-free as may at first seem. On the one hand, the investment of capital into outer space would be a huge diversion from the investments needed to address many urgent inequalities and crises on Earth. On the other hand, this same access is in practice likely to be conducted by a range of competing imperial powers. Hardt and Negri (2000) tell us that the history of imperializing wars is over. This may or may not be the case as regards imperialism on earth. But old-style imperialist, more particularly inter-imperialist, wars seem more likely than ever, as growing and competing power-blocs (the USA and China are currently amongst the most likely protagonists) compete for resources on earth and outer space. Such, in rather general terms, is the prospect for a future, galactic, imperialism between competing powers. But what are the relations, processes and mechanisms underlying this new phenomenon? How should we understand the regional rivalries and ideologies involved and the likely implications of competing empires attempting to incorporate not only their share of resources on earth but on global society's ‘outside’? Social crises, outer spatial fixes and galactic imperialism Explanatory primacy is given here to economic mechanisms driving this humanization of the universe. In the same way that they have driven imperializing societies in the past to expand their economic bases into their ‘outsides’, the social relations of capitalism and the processes of capital-accumulation are driving the new kind of outer space imperialisms. Such is the starting-point of this paper (See alsoDickens and Ormrod, 2007). It is a position based on the work of the contemporary Marxist geographer David Harvey (2003) and his notion of ‘spatial fixes’. Capitalism continually constructs what he calls ‘outer transformations.’ In the context of the over-accumulation of capital in the primary circuit of industrial capital, fresh geographic zones are constantly sought out which have not yet been fully invested in or, in the case of outer space, not yet been invested in at all. ‘Outer spatial fixes’ are investments in outer space intended to solve capitalism's many crises. At one level they may be simply described as crises of economic profitability. But ‘economic’ can cover a wide array of issues such as crises of resource-availability and potential social and political upheavals resulting from resource-shortages. Furthermore, there is certainly no guarantee that these investments will actually ‘fix’ these underlying economic, political and social crises. The ‘fix’ may well be of a temporary, sticking-plaster, variety. </span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>Capitalism causes an irrational hystericization of self-preservation, causing ecological catastrophe, famine, disease, war, and finally extinction.</strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline">Deborah <strong>Cook</strong>, Professor of Philosophy, University of Windsor, 20<strong>06</strong>, “Staying Alive: Adorno and Habermas on Self-Preservation Under Late Capitalism.”</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">In the passage in Negative Dialectics where he warns against self-preservation gone wild, Adorno states that it is “only as reflection upon … self-preservation that reason would be above nature” (1973, 289). To rise above nature, then, reason must become “cognizant of its own natural essence” (1998b, 138). To be more fully rational, we must reflect on what Horkheimer and Adorno once called our underground history (1972, 231). In other words, we must recognize that our behavior is motivated and shaped by instincts, including the instinct for self-preservation (Adorno 1998a, 153). In his lectures on Kant, Adorno makes similar remarks when he summarizes his solution to the problem of self-preservation gone wild. To remedy this problem, nature must first become conscious of itself (Adorno 2000, 104). Adopting the Freudian goal of making the unconscious conscious, Adorno also insists that this critical self-understanding be accompanied by radical social, political, and economic changes that would bring to a halt the self-immolating domination of nature. This is why mindfulness of nature is necessary but not sufficient to remedy unbridled self-preservation. In the final analysis, society must be fundamentally transformed in order rationally to accommodate instincts that now run wild owing to our forgetfulness of nature in ourselves. By insisting on mindfulness of nature in the self, Adorno champions a form of rationality that would tame self-preservation, but in contrast to Habermas, he thinks that the taming of self-preservation is a normative task rather than an accomplished fact. Because self-preservation remains irrational, we now encounter serious environmental problems like those connected with global warming and the greenhouse effect, the depletion of natural resources, and the death of more than one hundred regions in our oceans. Owing to self-preservation gone wild, we have colonized and destabilized large parts of the world, adversely affecting the lives of millions, when we have not simply enslaved or murdered their inhabitants outright. Famine and disease are often the result of ravaging the land in the name of survival imperatives. Wars are waged in the name of self-preservation: with his now notoriously invisible weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was said to represent a serious threat to the lives of citizens in the West. The war against terrorism, waged in the name of self-preservation, has seriously undermined human rights and civil liberties; it has also been used to justify the murder, rape, and torture of thousands. As it now stands, the owners of the means of production ensure our survival through profits that, at best, only trickle down to the poorest members of society. Taken in charge by the capitalist economy, self-preservation now dictates that profits increase exponentially to the detriment of social programs like welfare and health care. In addition, self-preservation has gone wild because our instincts and needs are now firmly harnessed to commodified offers of satisfaction that deflect and distort them. Having surrendered the task of self-preservation to the economic and political systems, we remain in thrall to untamed survival instincts that could well end up destroying not just the entire species, but all life on the planet.</span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">Does this recourse to artistic description imply that we are in danger of regressing to a contemplative attitude that somehow betrays the urgency to &quot;do something&quot; about the depicted horrors? Let's think about the fake sense of urgency that pervades the left-liberal humanitarian discourse on violence: in it, abstraction and graphic (pseudo)concreteness coexist in the staging of the scene of violence-against women, blacks, the homeless, gays ... &quot;A woman is raped every six seconds in this country&quot; and &quot;In the time it takes you to read this paragraph, ten children will die of hunger&quot; are just two examples. Underlying all this is a hypocritical sentiment of moral outrage. Just this kind of pseudo-urgency was exploited by Starbucks a couple of years ago when, at store entrances, posters greeting customers pointed out that a portion of the chain's profits went into health-care for the children of Guatemala, the source of their coffee, the inference being that with every cup you drink, you save a child's life. There is a fundamental anti-theoretical edge to these urgent injunctions. There is no time to reflect: we have to act now. Through this fake sense of urgency, the post-industrial rich, living in their secluded virtual world, not only do not deny or ignore the harsh reality outside their area-they actively refer to it all the time. As Bill Gates recently put it: &quot;What do computers matter when millions are still unnecessarily dying of dysentery?&quot; Against this fake urgency, we might want to place Marx's wonderful letter to Engels of 1870, when, for a brief moment, it seemed that a European revolution was again at the gates. Marx's letter conveys his sheer panic: can't the revolutionaries wait for a couple of years? He hasn't yet finished his Capital. A critical analysis of the present global constellation-one which offers no clear solution, no &quot;practical&quot; advice on what to do, and provides no light at the end of the tunnel, since one is well aware that this light might belong to a train crashing towards us-usually meets with reproach: &quot;Do you mean we should do nothing? Just sit and wait?&quot; One should gather the courage to answer: &quot;YES, precisely that!&quot; There are situations when the only truly &quot;practical&quot; thing to do is to resist the temptation to engage immediately and to &quot;wait and see&quot; by means of a patient, critical analysis. Engagement seems to exert its pressure on us from all directions. In a well-known passage from his Existentialism and Humanism, Sartre deployed the dilemma of a young man in France in 1942, torn between the duty to help his lone, ill mother and the duty to enter the Resistance and fight the Germans; Sartre's point is, ofcourse, that there is no a priori answer to this dilemma. The young man needs to make a decision grounded only in his own abyssal freedom and assume full responsibility for it.</span><br />

 <span class="Underline"><strong>THEIR RHETORIC OF ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS DRIVES A LOGIC OF ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY THAT DEMANDS INEFFECTIVE STATE RESPONSES TO MANAGE ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Ole Waever, 95,</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Senior Researcher at the Center for Peace &amp; Conflict Research, On Security, p. 63-64</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">Central to the arguments for the conceptual innovation of environmen¬tal or ecological security41 is its mobilization potential. As Buzan points out, the concept of national security &quot;has an enormous power as an instrument of social and political mobilization&quot; and, therefore, &quot;the obvious reason for putting environmental issues into the security agenda is the possible magni¬tude of the threats posed, and the need to mobilize urgent and unprece¬dented responses to them. The security label is a useful way both of sig-nalling danger and setting priority, and for this reason alone it is likely to per¬sist in the environmental debates.&quot;42 Several analysts have, however, warned against securitization of the environmental issue for some of these very rea¬sons, and some of the arguments I present here fit into the principled issue of securitization/desecuritization as discussed earlier in this chapter. A first argument against the environment as a security issue, mentioned, for exam¬ple, by Buzan, is that environmental threats are generally unintentional.43 This, by itself, does not make the threats any less serious, although it does take them out of the realm of will. As I pointed out earlier, the field of secu¬rity is constituted around relationships between wills: It has been, conven¬tionally, about the efforts of one will to (allegedly) override the sovereignty of another, forcing or tempting the latter not to assert its will in defense of its sovereignty. The contest of concern, in other words, is among strategic actors imbued with intentionality, and this has been the logic around which the whole issue of security has been framed. In light of my earlier discussion, in which I stressed that &quot;security&quot; is not a reflection of our everyday sense of the word but, rather, a specific field with traditions, the jump to environ-mental security becomes much larger than might appear at first to be the case. I do not present this as an argument against the concept but, rather, as a way of illuminating or even explaining the debate over it. Second in his critique of the notion of environmental security, Richard Moss points out that the concept of &quot;security&quot; tends to imply that defense from the problem is to be provided by the state: The most serious consequence of thinking of global change and other envi¬ronmental problems as threats to security is that the sorts of centralized gov¬ernmental responses by powerful and autonomous state organizations that are appropriate for security threats are inappropriate for addressing most environmental problems. When one is reacting to the threat of organized external violence, military and intelligence institutions are empowered to take the measures required to repel the threat. By this same logic, when responding to environmental threats, response by centralized regulatory agencies would seem to be logical. Unfortunately, in most cases this sort of response is not the most efficient or effective way of addressing environ¬mental problems, particularly those that have a global character.44 Moss goes on to warn that &quot;the instinct for centralized state responses to security threats is highly inappropriate for responding effectively to glob¬al environmental problems.&quot;45 It might, he points out, even lead to mili¬tarization of environmental problems .46 A third warning, not unrelated to the previous two, is the tendency for the concept of security to produce thinking in terms of us-them, which could then be captured by the logic of nationalism. Dan Deudney writes that &quot;the 'nation' is not an empty vessel or blank slate waiting to be filled or scripted, but is instead profoundly linked to war and 'us vs. them' thinking ( . . . ) Of course, taking the war and 'us vs. them' thinking out of national-ism is a noble goal. But this may be like taking sex out of 'rock and roll,' a project whose feasibility declines when one remembers that 'rock and roll' was originally coined as a euphemism for sex.&quot;47 The tendency toward &quot;us vs. them&quot; thinking, and the general tradition of viewing threats as coming from outside a state's own borders, are, in this instance, also likely to direct attention away from one's own contributions to environmental problems.&quot; Finally, there is the more political warning that the concept of security is basically defensive in nature, a status quo concept defending that which is, even though it does not necessarily deserve to be protected. In a paradoxical way, this politically conservative bias has also led to warnings by some that the concept of environmental security could become a dangerous tool of the &quot;totalitarian left,&quot; which might attempt to relaunch itself on the basis of envi¬ronmental collectivism.&quot; Certainly, there is some risk that the logic of ecol¬ogy, with its religious potentials and references to holistic categories, survival and the linked significance of everything, might easily lend itself to totali¬tarian projects, where also the science of ecology has focused largely on how to constrain, limit, and control activities in the name of the environment.50 </span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>Environmental management diminishes being and makes extinction through nuclear war and environmental destruction inevitable</strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>McWhorter, 92</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">(Ladelle, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Northeast Missouri State University Heidegger and the Earth, ed. by Ladelle McWhorter)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">What is most illustrative is often also what is most common. Today, on all sides of ecological debate we hear, with greater and greater frequency, the word management. On the one hand, business people want to manage natural resources so as to keep up profits. On the other hand, conservationists want to manage natural resources so that there will be plenty of coal and oil and recreational facilities for future generations. These groups and factions within them debate vociferously over which management policies are the best, that is, the most efficient and manageable. Radical envi-ronmentalists damn both groups and claim it is human population growth and rising expectations that are in need of management. But wherever we look, wherever we listen, we see and hear the term management. We are living in a veritable age of management. Before a middle class child graduates from high school she or he is already preliminarily trained in the arts of weight management, stress management, and time management, to name just a few. As we approach middle age we continue to practice these essential arts, refining and adapting our regulatory regimes as the pressures of life increase and the body begins to break down. We have become a society of managers - of our homes, careers, portfolios, estates, even of our own bodies - so is it surprising that we set ourselves up as the managers of the earth itself? And yet, as thoughtful earth-dwellers we must ask, what does this signify? In numerous essays - in particular the beautiful 1953 essay, &quot;The Question Concerning Technology&quot; - Heidegger speaks of what he sees as the danger of dangers in this, our age. This danger is a kind of forgetfulness, a forgetfulness that Heidegger thought could result not only in nuclear disaster or environmental catastrophe, but in the loss of what makes us the kind of beings we are, beings who can think and who can stand in thoughtful relationship to things. This forgetfulness is not a forgetting of facts and their relationships; it is a forgetfulness of something far more important and far more fundamental than that. He called it forgetfulness of 'the mystery'. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Our usual response to such prophecies of doom is to ignore them or, when we cannot do that, to scramble to find some way to manage our problems, some quick solution, some technological fix. But over and over again new resource management techniques, new solutions, new technologies disrupt delicate systems even further, doing still more damage to a planet already dangerously out of ecological balance. Our ceaseless interventions seem only to make things worse, to perpetuate a cycle of human activity followed by, ecological disaster followed by human intervention followed by a new disaster of another kind. In fact, it would appear that our trying to do things, change things, fix things cannot be the solution, because it is part of the problem itself. But, if we cannot act to solve our problems, what should we do? Heidegger's work is a call to reflect to think in some way other than calculatively, technologically, pragmatically. Once we begin to move with and into Heidegger's call, and begin to see our trying to seize control and solve problems as itself a problematic approach if we still believe that thinking's only real purpose is to function as a prelude to action, we who attempt to think will twist within the agonizing grip of paradox, feeling nothing but frustration, unable to conceive of ourselves as anything but paralyzed. However, as so many peoples before us have known, paradox is not only a trap; it is also a scattering point and passageway. Paradox invites examination of its own constitution (hence of the patterns of thinking within which it occurs) and thereby breaks a way of thinking open, revealing the configurations of power that propel it and hold it on track. And thus it makes possible the dissipation of that power and the deflection of thinking into new paths and new possibilities. Heidegger frustrates us. At a time when the stakes are so very high and decisive action is so loudly and urgently called for, Heidegger apparently calls us to do- nothing. If we get beyond the revulsion and anger that such a call initially inspires and actually examine the feasibility of response, we begin to undergo the frustration attendant upon paradox: how is it possible, we ask, to choose, to will, to do nothing? The call itself places in question the bimodal logic of activity and passivity; it points up the paradoxical nature of our passion for action, of our passion for maintaining control. The call itself suggests that our drive for acting decisively and forcefully is part of what must be thought through, that the narrow option of will versus surrender is one of the power configurations of current thinking that must be allowed to dissipate.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Access to the most appropriate radio frequencies and orbital locations in outer space is essentially based on a first-come, first-served practice, which has been a major concern to a large number of countries, especially in the third world. Countries such as India and Indonesia, the first of the developing countries that attempted to use GEO, faced undue difficulties in securing access for their earlier satellites. The legal principles and rules that regulate access to and use of radio frequencies and orbital positions have been adopted through international conferences organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the oldest specialized agency of the UN. Article 44 (2) of the ITU Constitution recognizes that radio frequencies and orbital positions are limited international resources, and imposes an obligation on ITU member States to use them efficiently and economically in order to ensure equitable access by all countries. 126 While no definition of “equitable access” is found in the ITU Constitution, some of the provisions make the meaning of this term clear: (a) the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries must be taken into account while making use of the radio frequencies and orbital positions, and (b) countries may have equitable access and tedious process, equitable access has been effected, so far, only to a limited extent and through two allotment plans for (a) the Broadcasting Satellite Service operating in 12 GHz band and associated feeder links, and (b) the Fixed Satellite Service operating in 6/4 GHz and 14/11 GHz bands. The rarity of such plans can be attributed to the unwillingness of some powerful member States of ITU to accept restrictions on their freedom of action in the use of radio frequencies and orbital positions. Consequently, the practice of first-come, first-served continues to apply to all frequency bands for satellite telecommunication services, except those mentioned above. A serious problem in access to radio frequencies and orbital positions has arisen, particularly with respect to the geostationary orbit, not only because the GEO is limited, but also because several countries, mainly the developed ones, started registering so-called ‘paper satellites’ with the ITU. According to an ITU paper titled Paper Tigers: The Scramble for Space Spectrum, some States reserve orbital “positions and frequency bands for possible future use, or for commercial resale to another user at a later date.”127 In 1998, INTELSAT presented the data about the most used C and Ku bands according to which INTELSAT had registered 25 slots but was actually using only 19. Similarly, the number for the U.S. was 74 registered and 36 actually occupied slots, and Russia had registered 58 orbital positions when it using only 25. In view of such an apparent practice of hoarding orbital positions and radio frequencies, INTELSAT announced its intention of “deregistering” eight orbital slot registrations with the ITU in order to “set an example [for] efficient use of scarce orbital resources.” 128 These slots had been registered by INTELSAT and never used. Although INTELSAT claimed this was motivated by an effort to improve orbit utilization, the reactions from outsiders were quite different. For example, an American private satellite company, PamAmSat, declared that the returned slots were anyway completely unusable. 129 It should be noted that it is not the actual satellite in orbit but early registration of that satellite with the ITU that blocks the placing of other satellites in the same location in the GEO. only in conformity with the ITU Radio Regulations. Since modifying these Regulations is a long The “paper satellite” problem has been real and wide spread.130 According to ITU, in 2002 the backlog of satellite systems awaiting full registration stood at around 1200 when ITU was regularly receiving between 400-500 requests for new systems each year, only around one tenth of which would ever be launched.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The pressures on the space frontier are enormous -- from both an economic and a military perspective. Looked at in isolation, each of these pressures is severe enough to create conflict. In combination, they create the risk that future space conflicts could result in war -- either on earth, in space, or both. On the economic front, conflict has already occurred because of crowding in GEO orbits and through saturation of the available radio spectrum. On the military front, conflict has been avoided because the United States, in recent years, has retained an effective monopoly on the use of space during conflict. Conflicts involving the commercial use of space will continue to increase as crowding increases. There are limited unoccupied slots at GEO and a limited spectrum remaining to be allocated. On the military side, one cannot imagine the United States allowing an enemy to either threaten U.S. space capabilities or use space systems to their advantage, putting the U.S. at risk. Conflict involving space systems could be a significant part of the next major theater war involving the United States. </span><br />
