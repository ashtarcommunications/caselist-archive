In contrast to biological materials for weapons, fresh (unirradiated) uranium material can be handled unshielded without protective measures. HEU thus provides a convenient material for weapons production for groups with limited resources and no access to advanced laboratories. Uranium was indeed the material of choice for both the Hiroshima bomb and the South African nuclear weapons program. “Little Boy,” the HEU bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, was triggered by a simple “gun” mechanism. A small, slug shaped piece of uranium was fired down a barrel into a larger, cup-shaped piece of heu. This elementary design generated a destructive force of about 15 kilotons (kt)—the equivalent of 15,000 tons of TNT. South Africa produced six nuclear devices based on the simple uranium gun-type principle while under the constraints of an international embargo, and thus having to rely on its own resources.

Likewise, within the information swamp of the internet, potential nuclear weapons producers can find some useful sites.

 <span class="StyleStyleBold12pt"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Ayson 10</span></span> (Robert, Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand at the Victoria University of Wellington,“After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects,” Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism, Volume 33, Issue 7, July, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via InformaWorld) <br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in response by the country attacked in the first place, would not necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds imaginable. Indeed, there are reasons to wonder whether nuclear terrorism should ever be regarded as belonging in the category of truly existential threats. A contrast can be drawn here with the global catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear exchange between two or more of the sovereign states that possess these weapons in significant numbers. Even the worst terrorism that the twenty-first century might bring would fade into insignificance alongside considerations of what a general nuclear war would have wrought in the Cold War period. And it must be admitted that as long as the major nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even thousands of nuclear weapons at their disposal, there is always the possibility of a truly awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated entirely by state possessors themselves. But these two nuclear worlds—a non-state actor nuclear attack and a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange—are not necessarily separable. It is just possible that </span>some sort of terrorist attack, and especially <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">an act of nuclear terrorism, could precipitate a chain of events leading to a massive exchange of nuclear weapon</span>s</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">between two or more of the states that </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">possess them. In this context, today’s and tomorrow’s terrorist groups might assume the place allotted during the early Cold War years to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals who were seen as raising the risks of a catalytic nuclear war between the superpowers started by third parties. These risks were considered in the late 1950s and early 1960s as concerns grew about nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem. It may require a considerable amount of imagination to depict an especially plausible situation where an act of nuclear terrorism could lead to such a massive inter-state nuclear war. For example, in the event of a terrorist nuclear attack on the United States, it might well be wondered just how Russia and/or China could plausibly be brought into the picture, not least because they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious state sponsors or encouragers of terrorist groups. They would seem far too responsible to be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist behavior that could just as easily threaten them as well. Some possibilities, however remote, do suggest</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> themselves. For example, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">how might the United States react if it was thought or discovered that the fissile material used in the act of nuclear terrorism had come from Russian stocks</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">,40 and if for some reason Moscow denied any responsibility for nuclear laxity? </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> correct </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">attribution of that nuclear material to a particular country might not be a case of science fiction</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> given the observation by Michael May et al. that while the debris resulting from a nuclear explosion would be “spread over a wide area in tiny fragments, its radioactivity makes it detectable, identifiable and collectable, and a wealth of information can be obtained from its analysis: the efficiency of the explosion, the materials used and, most important … some indication of where the nuclear material came from.”41 Alternatively, if the act of nuclear terrorism came as a complete surprise, and American officials refused to believe that a terrorist group was fully responsible (or responsible at </span>all)<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> suspicion would shift immediately to state possessors.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Ruling out Western ally countries like the United Kingdom and France, and probably Israel and India as well, authorities in Washington would be left with a very short list consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran if its program continues, and possibly Pakistan. But at what stage would Russia and China be definitely ruled out in this high stakes game of nuclear Cluedo? In particular, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">if the act of nuclear terrorism occurred against a backdrop of existing tension in Washington’s relations with Russia and/or China</span>,</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and at a time when threats had already been traded between these major powers, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would officials and political leaders not be tempted to assume the worst? Of course</span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">,</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> the chances of this occurring would only seem to increase if the United States was already involved in some sort of limited armed conflict with Russia and/or China, or if they were confronting each other from a distance in a proxy war, as unlikely as these developments may seem at the present time. The reverse might well apply too: </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">should a nuclear terrorist attack occur in Russia or China during a period of</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> heightened tension or </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">even limited conflict with the United States</span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">,</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> could Moscow and Beijing resist the pressures that might rise domestically to consider the United States as a possible perpetrator or encourager of the attack? Washington’s early response to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own soil might also raise the possibility of an unwanted (and nuclear aided) confrontation with Russia and/or China. For example, in the noise and confusion during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist nuclear attack, the U.S. president might be expected to place the country’s armed forces, including its nuclear arsenal, on a higher stage of alert. In such a tense environment, when careful planning runs up against the friction of reality, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> just </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">possible that Moscow and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S. intentions to use force</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> (and possibly nuclear force) </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">against them</span></span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> In that situation</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the temptations to preempt such actions might grow</span></span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">,</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> although it must be admitted that any preemption would probably still meet with a </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">devastating response. As part of its initial response to the act of nuclear terrorism (as discussed earlier) Washington might decide to order a significant conventional (or nuclear) retaliatory or disarming attack against the leadership of the terrorist group and/or states seen to support that group. Depending on the identity and especially the location of these targets, Russia and/or China might interpret such action as being far too close for their comfort, and potentially as an infringement on their spheres of influence and even on their sovereignty. One far-fetched but perhaps not impossible scenario might stem from a judgment in Washington that some of the main aiders and abetters of the terrorist action resided somewhere such as Chechnya, perhaps in connection with what Allison claims is the “Chechen insurgents’ … long-standing interest in all things nuclear.”42 American pressure on that part of the world would almost certainly raise alarms in Moscow that might require a degree of advanced consultation from Washington that the latter found itself unable or unwilling to provide. There is also the question of how other nuclear-armed states respond to the act of nuclear terrorism on another member of that special club. It could reasonably be expected that following a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States, both Russia and China would extend immediate sympathy and support to Washington and would work alongside the United States in the Security Council. But there is just a chance, albeit a slim one, where the support of Russia and/or China is less automatic in some cases than in others. For example, what would happen if the United States wished to discuss its right to retaliate against groups based in their territory? If, for some reason, Washington found the responses of Russia and China deeply underwhelming, (neither “for us or against us”) might it also suspect that they secretly were in cahoots with the group, increasing (again perhaps ever so slightly) the chances of a major exchange. If the terrorist group had some connections to groups in Russia and China, or existed in areas of the world over which Russia and China held sway, and if Washington felt that Moscow or Beijing were placing a curiously modest level of pressure on them, what conclusions might it then draw about their culpability? If Washington decided to use, or decided to threaten the use of, nuclear weapons, the responses of Russia and China would be crucial to the chances of avoiding a more serious nuclear exchange. They might surmise, for example, that while the act of nuclear terrorism was especially heinous and demanded a strong response, the response simply had to remain below the nuclear threshold. It would be one thing for a non-state actor to have broken the nuclear use taboo, but an entirely different thing for a state actor, and indeed the leading state in the international system, to do so. If Russia and China felt sufficiently strongly about that prospect, there is then the question of what options would lie open to them to dissuade the United States from such action: and as has been seen over the last several decades, the central dissuader of the use of nuclear weapons by states has been the threat of nuclear retaliation. If some readers find this simply too fanciful, and perhaps even offensive to contemplate, it may be informative to reverse the tables. Russia, which possesses an arsenal of thousands of nuclear warheads and that has been one of the two most important trustees of the non-use taboo, is subjected to an attack of nuclear terrorism. In response, Moscow places its nuclear forces very visibly on a higher state of alert and declares that it is considering the use of nuclear retaliation against the group and any of its state supporters. How would Washington view such a possibility? Would it really be keen to support Russia’s use of nuclear weapons, including outside Russia’s traditional sphere of influence? And if not, which seems quite plausible, what options would Washington have to communicate that displeasure? If China had been the victim of the nuclear terrorism and</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> seemed likely to retaliate in kind, would the United States and Russia be happy to sit back and let this occur? </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In the charged atmosphere immediately after a nuclear terrorist attack,</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">how would the attacked country respond to pressure from other major nuclear powers not to respond in kind? The phrase “how dare they tell us what to do” immediately springs to mind. Some might even go so far as to interpret this concern as a tacit form of sympathy or support for the terrorists. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This might not help the chances of nuclear restraint.</span> <br />

Both were created by modifying the H5N1 Bird Flu virus in the laboratory. These scientists were apparently planning to publish their research openly soon after Clinton's address.¶ </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> US government's </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> (NSABB), a division of the National Institute of Health (NIH) </span><em><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">requested they not publish the details</span></em><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The NSABB has no legal authority, and is only an advisory organization. The authors disagreed with the decision but agreed to adhere to it. All the authors had already received funding from the NIH and it might be presumed they would continue to receive funding... unless they did not follow the request.¶ After also being contacted by the NSABB, the two scientific journals, Nature and Science (two highly established journals), still planned to publish the two papers minus some of the details. The journal Science stated it would agree with the NSABB to refrain from publishing the details only if the government created a system whereby scientists worldwide could access the details if they had a legitimate need to know the information. However, at least one of the scientists had already presented his work at a major conference.SciAm-Albert¶ Indeed, the editor of Science Magazine said &quot;“This finding shows it’s much easier to evolve this virus to an extremely dangerous state where it can be transmitted in aerosols [i.e., by coughing or sneezing] than anybody had recognized.” NYTimes-1220¶ In 2011, folks. Imagine, as this news spreads around, and as technology advances even further, what the world will be like in 2020. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Scientists are already saying it's not a matter of &quot;if&quot; but one of &quot;when&quot;</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.¶ These kinds of things cannot be kept secret. They will spread. Indeed, such news announcements stimulate interest. You can be sure that the news media will broadcast such gains very prominently, because it sells their service and makes them money, and can selfishly rationalize away the greater interests of our species.¶ Keeping this kind of research secret is difficult.¶ Pharmaceutical companies pay scientists for information and cooperation all the time. Others can pay scientists as well. There are still many scientists who rationalize their research as &quot;not that dangerous&quot; and/or is important for &quot;defensive&quot; purposes (kind've like other arms races) in order to promote their paid work, and when money is offered, many people can rationalize even more. It may not matter whether the money is offered by a pharmaceutical company or just a visiting consultant.¶ It could even be an undercover agents posing as pharmaceutical company staff, either a front company or faked, or even a plant into a legitimate company, university, computer center, or other organization. Indeed, what percentage of people really verify an identity on a business card, and check with the boss of the person?¶ Beyond that, people just talk, out of ego, curiosity, open scientific dialogue, or soliciting work. Graduate students and other young people often brag about their knowledge in casual conversations, or job interviews. It's easy to find out what research people are doing, and people and places can be targeted undercover.¶ University laboratories, offices, and homes are often not locked or secured well. If necessary, most locks can be picked easily by somebody trained in standard locksmith skills. Most trash isn't shredded. Hired thieves don't even need to know what they're stealing and can be told a ruse, but money talks. And many victim companies and laboratories would cover up a break-in or leak, out of fear it would tarnish their reputation and reduce funding, as well as threaten individual jobs and well being. This kind of espionage has been going on for decades by professionals, normally undetected. It's just becoming much more deadly and easier for an individual or a small group to do on a shoestring budget.¶ This is not news, but has been known for decades by a tiny percentage of people. What is lacking is broader recognition, acceptance, and interest in bioweapons.¶ PERMANENT was created in 1985 while I was working for the Pentagon in advanced planning in space &quot;defense&quot; systems.

Fear </span><em><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">extinct</span></em><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> -- before our own technological advances destroy us -- usually got a reinforced brushoff and often snide remarks. I mainly stuck to the engineering and scientific studies relevant to PERMANENT, with a general theme of space industrialization for sustainable profits, and space colonization following that.¶ The hottest topics were related to space tourism whereby we could go to space for selfish reasons for a vacation, such as private earth launchers. Advocates of private earth launch stated that we needed to get the cost of launch down via their private projects before space resources would become economical. (Baloney, as I discuss elsewhere on this website.)¶ When writing the PERMANENT book, I buried the biotechnology / supervirus / extinction threats in the Introduction (see, for example, page iii, under the section title Why. (That was published in 1998.)¶ At the turn of the millenium, I was actually out of money, due to spending my savings to write the PERMANENT book and website for outreach, as well as the expenses of ordering scientific publications and other important basic items, plus mailing copies of the book to wealthy people (at our expense, and we had to find them first) ... all while forgoing many opportunities to go out and make money instead for myself. While the website attracted huge numbers of visitors and a whole lot of traffic, not many people were willing to make any financial donation, and the overall support was very disappointing. My dot com bubble burst.¶ So, hardly able to survive, many years of working on PERMANENT website ground to a crawl, and the rest of PERMANENT was frozen for the most part, except for Sam Fraser's volunteer artistic overhaul in 2001. I had to go out and make money in the usual ordinary ways in the world.¶ Some time before this, in the year 2000, I moved the extinction risk and the responsibility of our generation up to the very top of the home page. &quot;In all geologic time, our generation will be the one to get mankind off our lonely planetary cradle.

Maritime Critical Infrastructure Protection (MCIP) presents many challenges in an asymmetric environment. Previous models of maritime defense have focused on protecting ships from traditional naval attack; even when ports and supporting infrastructure have been considered targets, emphasis was on defense against a military threat. The Global War On Terror (GWOT) has created a number of heretofore unconsidered vulnerabilities in this traditional outlook. Many targets that would not be considered legitimate (economic, symbolic, etc.) in a conventional war must now be considered in strategic defensive planning. </span><u>In conducting these attacks the unimpeded use of the sea is a force multiplier for an enemy dedicated to striking a wide range of potential targets. Possible threats from the sea are wide-ranging</u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and diverse, relying on a combination of asymmetric offensive tactics while exploiting the variety of the littoral. This asymmetric nature of GWOT requires a multi-agency approach to devise effective command and control for modern port defense. The Coast Guard and Navy have made important strides in this area by devising experimental Joint Harbor Operations Centers (JHOCs) as a component of maritime anti-terrorist force protection. The expansion of this concept into multi-agency maritime homeland security is a logical next step in the evolving problem of port security and defense. </span><u>This is made evident by examining likely terrorist threats to ports and studying the lessons of the past that apply in this environment which can be used to expand the current command and control system to meet the new threat</u> <span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">NEW THREAT MATRIX: PORTS AS TARGETS The GWOT threat to ports is a relatively new element in the spectrum of naval warfare. This is largely due to the evolving nature of the shipping industry and the nation’s growing reliance on sea power. Historically, a nation’s maritime strength has been measured by the size and capability of its merchant fleet and Navy; attacks against a nation’s sea power meant the physical destruction of these ships. Ports, until quite recently, were composed of infrastructure that was relatively easy to replace or replicate, making them relatively low priority targets for an enemy dedicated to striking at maritime strength. This has changed in the modern era of containerization and the increased size and technical nature of ships. </span><u>In modern times ports have become centers of highly technical, well-integrated infrastructure designed for the rapid loading and unloading of cargo, an evolution that has become highly complex in the era of containerization.</u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Commercially efficient, </span><u>port cargo operations are also highly dependent on networked operations, making the disruption of the process far simpler for a potential attacker</u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Additionally, the complexity of this evolution, combined with the increasing size of seagoing merchant vessels (and warships), has greatly reduced the number of commercial ports available for use by global shipping. </span><u>This has the duel effect of making major ports more important</u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> economically and strategically </span><u>while simultaneously making them more attractive targets for offensive action. The attractiveness of ports as targets for terrorists can be summarized as follows</u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: </span><u>A. Economic Impact</u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: An unprecedented amount of trade — both imports and exports — relies on shipment by sea. </span><u>A successful attack on maritime infrastructure would affect this trade in far greater proportion than the actual damage</u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. It is likely that an attack on one port would have a cascade effect on others as increased security measures are applied nationwide. The recent impact of the London bombings can be seen as illustrative of this effect; although there was no indication of additional terrorist activity, security measures were increased at transportation hubs worldwide. Increasing security alerts at a train station is one thing; closing a huge economic entity such as a port is quite another. Delay of shipping in loading and offloading cargo is one of the most costly elements of the shipping process. </span><u>We must also consider the impact to the shipping industry itself.</u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> During the Persian Gulf re-flagging operations of the late 1980s, for example, analysis showed the greatest impact to the shipping of oil was not the damage to tankers inflicted by the warring Iraqis and Iranians (which was, in fact, minimal), but the increased insurance costs of operating in that area. 3 An attack on a U.S. port could have a similar, if not larger, effect. </span><u>B. High visibility/High Casualties</u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: Ports are not isolated areas, but rather major centers of commerce, usually surrounded by large cities and economic centers. An attack on a port could be highly visible and potentially the scene of mass conflagration. As a result of urban development, most major ports are no longer confined to strictly industrial areas, but rather have become well-developed centers of commerce and entertainment, surrounded by built up waterside areas dedicated to tourism and recreation. Many of these facilities are located next to volatile maritime infrastructure (fuel tanks, docks, etc.) that could create mass conflagration if attacked through large explosive force. Sympathetic detonation, fires, and other catastrophic effects would certainly create mass casualties. </span><u>C. Ease of attack: Commercial ports are not fortresses.</u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> The ocean itself presents a number of distinct advantages to a dedicated attacker, especially when employing maritime suicide terrorism or means to rapidly deliver large explosive force. Water is not only a tremendously efficient transport medium (allowing for rapid transit), but the large amount of legitimate commercial and recreational traffic in ports allows for an enemy to mask movements prior to an attack, making effective defense difficult. </span><u><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-highlight: yellow;">Given the importance ofports</span> to our</u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> economy and </span><u>military power, the potential for creating mass casualties, and the ease by which an enemy can attack, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a strong case can be made that ports will become a target for future terrorist attacks</span></u><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">.</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> If this is the case, we can apply the military planning process to meeting this threat. The first step in this process is looking for lessons learned that could be used in the current scenario: have we faced this threat before, and if so, what can we learn from the experience?  </span><br />

At that time, I asserted that “the economic and societal disruption created by the September 11 attacks has opened Pandora’s box.</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt;"> Future terrorists bent on challenging U.S. power </span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">will draw inspiration from the seeming ease at which America could be attacked and they</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt;"> will be encouraged by the mounting costs to the U.S. economy </span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">and the public psyche associated with the ad-hoc efforts to restore security following that attack.” A year later I joined with former senators Warren Rudman and Gary Hart in preparing our report, “America: Still Unprepared—Still In Danger.” We observed that “nineteen men wielding box-cutters forced the United States to do to itself what no adversary could ever accomplish: a successful blockade of the U.S. economy.</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"> If a surprise terrorist attack were to happen tomorrow involving the sea</span></span><u><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">,</span></u><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">rail, or truck, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">transportation systems that carry millions of tons of trade to the U</span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">nited</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"> S</span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">tates each day, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">t</span></span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">he response would</span> </span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">likely</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"> be </span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">the same—</span><em><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">a self-imposed global embargo</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt;">.”</span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> Based on that analysis, we identified as second of the six critical mandates that deserve the nation’s immediate attention: “Make trade security a global priority; the system for moving goods affordably and reliably around the world is ripe for exploitation and vulnerable to mass disruption by terrorists.” This is why the topic of today’s hearing is so important. The stakes are enormous.</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">U.S. prosperity</span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt;">—</span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">and much of its power</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt;">—<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">relies on its</span> </span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">ready</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"> access to global markets</span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. Both the scale and pace at which goods move between markets has exploded in recent years thanks in no small part to the invention and proliferation of the intermodal container. These ubiquitous boxes—most come in the 40’x8’x8’ size—have transformed the transfer of cargo from a truck, train, and ship into the transportation equivalent of connecting Lego blocks. The result has been to increasingly diminish the role of distance for a supplier or a consumer as a constraint in the world marketplace. Ninety percent of the world’s freight now moves in a container. Companies like Wal-Mart and General Motors move up to 30 tons of merchandise or parts across the vast Pacific Ocean from Asia to the West Coast for about $1600. The transatlantic trip runs just over a $1000—which makes the postage stamp seem a bit overpriced. But the system that underpins the incredibly efficient, reliable, and affordable movement of global freight has one glaring shortcoming in the post-9-11 world—it was built without credible safeguards to prevent it from being exploited or targeted by terrorists and criminals. Prior to September 11, 2001, virtually anyone in the world could arrange with an international shipper or carrier to have an empty intermodal container delivered to their home or workplace. They then could load it with tons of material, declare in only the most general terms what the contents were, “seal” it with a 50-cent lead tag, and send it on its way to any city and town in the United States. The job of transportation providers was to move the box as expeditiously as possible. Exercising any care to ensure that the integrity of a container’s contents was not compromised may have been a commercial practice, but it was not a requirement. The responsibility for making sure that goods loaded in a box were legitimate and authorized was shouldered almost exclusively by the importing jurisdiction. But as the volume of containerized cargo grew exponentially, the number of agents assigned to police that cargo stayed flat or even declined among most trading nations. The rule of thumb in the inspection business is that it takes five agents three hours to conduct a thorough physical examination of a single full intermodal container. Last year nearly 20 million containers washed across America’s borders via a ship, train, and truck. Frontline agencies had only enough inspectors and equipment to examine between 1-2 percent of that cargo. Thus, for would-be terrorists, the global intermodal container system that is responsible for moving the overwhelming majority of the world’s freight satisfies the age-old criteria of opportunity and motive. “Opportunity” flows from (1) the almost complete absence of any security oversight in the loading and transporting of a box from its point of origin to its final destination, and (2) the fact that growing volume and velocity at which containers move around the planet create a daunting “needle-in-the-haystack” problem for inspectors. “Motive” is derived from the role that the container now plays in underpinning global supply chains and the likely response by the U.S. government to an attack involving a container.Based on statements by the key officials at U.S. Customs, the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Transportation, should a container be used as a “poor man’s missile,” </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">the shipment of all containerized cargo into our ports and across our borders </span></span><em><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">would be halted</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt;">. </span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">As a consequence</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt;">, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a modest investment by a terrorist could </span></span></span><em><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">yield billions of dollars in losses to the U.S. economy</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt;"> by shutting down</span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">—even temporarily—the system that moves “just-in-time” shipments of parts and goods. Given the current state of container security, it is hard to imagine how a post-event lock-down on container shipments could be either prevented or short-lived. One thing we should have learned from the 9-11 attacks involving passenger airliners, the follow-on anthrax attacks, and even last fall Washington sniper spree is that terrorist incidents pose a special challenge for public officials. In the case of most disasters, the reaction by the general public is almost always to assume the event is an isolated one. Even if the post-mortem provides evidence of a systemic vulnerability, it often takes a good deal of effort to mobilize a public policy response to redress it. But just the opposite happens in the event of a terrorist attack—especially one involving catastrophic consequences. When these attacks take place, the assumption by the general public is almost always to presume a general vulnerability unless there is proof to the contrary. Government officials have to confront head-on this loss of public confidence by ahnonng evidence that they have a credible means to manage the risk highlighted by the terrorist incident. In the interim as recent events have shown, people will refuse to fly, open their mail, or even leave their homes. If a terrorist were to use a container as a weapon-delivery devise, the easiest choice would be high-explosives such as those used in the attack on the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Some form of chemical weapon, perhaps even involving hazardous materials, is another likely scenario. A bio-weapon is a less attractive choice for a terrorist because of the challenge of dispersing the agent in a sufficiently concentrated form beyond the area where the explosive devise goes off. A “dirty bomb” is the more likely threat vs. a nuclear weapon, but all these scenarios are conceivable since the choice of a weapon would not be constrained by any security measures currently in place in our seaports or within the intermodal transportation industry. This is why a terrorist attack involving a cargo container could cause such profound economic disruption.An incident triggered by even a conventional weapon going off in a box could result in a substantial loss of life</span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt;">.</span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> In the immediate aftermath, the general public will want reassurance that one of the many other thousands of containers arriving on any given day will not pose a similar risk. The President of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other keys officials responsible for the security of the nation would have to stand before a traumatized and likely skeptical American people and outline the measures they have in place to prevent another such attack. In the absence of a convincing security framework to manage the risk of another incident,</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"> the public would likely insist that all containerized cargo </span></span><em><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">be stopped</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt;">until </span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">adequate</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt;"> safeguards are in place<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">.</span> </span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Even with the most focused effort, constructing that framework from scratch </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">could take</span> </span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">months—even</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 12.0pt;"> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">years</span>. </span></span><span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Yet, within three weeks, the entire worldwide intermodal transportation industry would effectively be brought to its knees—as would much of the freight movements that make up international trade. </span></span><br />

 <span class="StyleStyleBold12pt"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Royal 10</span></span> — Jedidiah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, M.Phil. Candidate at the University of New South Wales, 2010 (“Economic Integration, Economic Signalling and the Problem of Economic Crises,” <em>Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives</em>, Edited by Ben Goldsmith and Jurgen Brauer, Published by Emerald Group Publishing, ISBN 0857240048, p. 213-215) <br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Less intuitive is how periods of </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Political science </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> of economic decline and the security </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and defence behaviour of interdependent states.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski and Thompson's (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> from one pre-eminent leader to the next. As such, exogenous shocks such as </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> (see also Gilpin. 1981) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">increasing the risk of miscalculation</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> (Feaver, 1995). Alternatively, even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately, Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland's (1996, 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">'future expectation of trade' is a significant variable</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour of states. He argues that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> However, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">if the expectations of future trade decline</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, particularly for difficult [end page 213] to replace items such as energy resources, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the likelihood for conflict increases</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. Crises could potentially be the trigger for decreased trade expectations either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Third, others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level. Blomberg and Hess (2002) find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn. They write,</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> The linkages between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover, the presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other. (Blomberg &amp; Hess, 2002. p. 89) </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Economic decline has also been linked with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism (Blomberg, Hess, &amp; Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">“Diversionary theory&quot; suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> to create a 'rally around the flag' effect. Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995). and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force are at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999), and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that the tendency towards diversionary tactics are greater for democratic states than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that periods of weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force. </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">In summary, recent economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels.5 This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention. </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">This observation is not contradictory to other perspectives that link economic interdependence with a decrease in the likelihood of external conflict, such as those mentioned in the first paragraph of this chapter. [end page 214] Those studies tend to focus on dyadic interdependence instead of global interdependence and do not specifically consider the occurrence of and conditions created by economic crises. As such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The country needs to become more export-oriented for the future health of the economy. But </span><u>right now there's no way to make sure that the nation's ports</u><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, border crossings and roadways </span><u>are set up to accomplish that goal.</u> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">For one thing, </span><u>there's far too little attention paid to making sure that traffic at border crossings moves swiftly</u><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Our crossings into Mexico and Canada are routinely clogged, interrupting the flow of trade. Consider the challenges facing Detroit—part of the largest binational trading corridor on the planet, linking the U.S. and Canadian auto industries and other sectors with highly integrated, transport-dependent, &quot;just in time&quot; supply chains and their smaller, more frequent shipments. Canada is our nation's largest trading partner, and Detroit's Ambassador Bridge is the No. 1 border point for commerce between the two countries. It's a crucial corridor—but there are relatively few border crossings because of the Great Lakes. So traffic piles up at bridges and tunnels, with freight competing with passenger cars to get through tightened security checkpoints. Trucks also clog the roads of Detroit as they shuttle freight between ports and large distribution centers and warehouses. </span><u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The export problem isn't just a matter of insufficient infrastructure. States and cities routinely compete against one another for shipping activity instead of coming up with joint efforts that might benefit all the terminals in the region. Without an overall strategy, there's a duplication of efforts and a duplication of subsidies that hurts the economy</span>, given scarce resources. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Collaboration is needed—between the federal government, states, metro areas, freight industry and shippers</span>. We need to come up with a comprehensive plan</u><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> that identifies the best ways to help the flow of freight. </span><u>The plan might identify the most important corridors for freight, for instance, and then target investments to improve safety, relieve bottlenecks and provide better access to ports</u><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. That might mean new roads leading to ports or, in some instances, truck-only lanes on existing roads. Similarly, the U.S., Canada, and Mexico should also come together to study infrastructure needs at the land borders and along the corridors that link the two borders together. For now, </span><u>some states are coming up with innovative solutions on their own—solutions that could and should become widespread under a national transportation policy</u><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Back in Detroit, for instance, the national governments of the U.S. and Canada, along with lawmakers in Michigan and Ontario, are trying to build a new bridge across the Detroit River to help keep trade flowing—a plan that's awaiting final legislative approval. Meanwhile, the World Trade Bridge in Laredo, Texas, has introduced tags for electronic toll collection to speed traffic and reduce wait times. Then, of course, </span><u>there's the issue of competition between ports for shipping business. One way to ease that problem: Tell states their ports won't get any federal aid unless they work with their neighbors to boost business in the whole region</u><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. And </span><u>those agreements need to be carefully structured and policed to make sure they don't collapse—which happens all too easily</u><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><u>Consider the current mess involving</u><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Jasper Ocean Terminal on the Savannah River, </span><u>the border between South Carolina and Georgia. In 2007, the two states agreed to develop the terminal together</u><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, and create a special entity to own and operate it. That's good. But what came later wasn't. </span><u>After the governors who signed the deal left office, the terminal became a point of contention between the states.</u><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> What happened</span><u>? Georgia decided it wanted to deepen another one of its own harbors, a move that South Carolina sees as a challenge to its own facilities.</u> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">So, South </span><u>Carolina has stopped funding the Jasper facility unless the Georgia dredging plan is scrapped</u><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.

LaHood said DOT was providing documents this week to &quot;clarify MAP-21’s innovative project delivery methods and important changes to funding programs.&quot; &quot;Additional information addresses the many changes in the new law from MAP-21’s predecessor,&quot; he added in a reference to the 2005 Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) bill, which expired in 2009 and was temporarily extended until 2012. There hasn't been much talk about the forthcoming highway bill in political campaigns this year, though one incumbent running for reelection, Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown (R) has touted his vote for the measure. </span><br />

 <span class="StyleStyleBold12pt"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Flynn 6</span></span>(Stephen, President of the Center for National Policy and CISAC Consulting Professor at Stanford, “Port Security Is Still a House of Cards” 3/9/2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/port-security/continued-vulnerability-global-maritime-transportation-system/p10074" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/port-security/continued-vulnerability-global-maritime-transportation-system/p10074</a>) <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">When it comes to port security, the buck essentially stops outside Washington, DC. Since seaports in the United States are locally run operations where port authorities typically play the role of landlord, issuing long-term leases to private companies; it falls largely to those companies to provide for the security of the property they lease. In the case of Los Angeles, this translates into the security of 7500 acres of facilities that run along 49 miles of waterfront, being provided for by minimum-wage private security guards, and a tiny port police force of under 100 officers. The situation in Long Beach is even worse with only 12 full-time police officers assigned to its 3000 acres of facilities and a small cadre of private guards provided by the port authority and its tenants. The command and control equipment to support a new joint operations center for the few local, state, and federal law enforcement authorities that are assigned to the port will not be in place until 2008. Up to 11,000 independent truck operators have access to the port terminals yet there still is no credentialing system in place to confirm the backgrounds of the drivers. West Coast terminal operators have no way of identifying who is in their facilities at any given moment. In the four years since September 11, 2001, the two cities have received less than $40 million in federal grants to improve the port’s physical security measures. That amount is equivalent to what American taxpayers spend in a single day on domestic airport security. But </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the fallout from a terrorist attack on any one of the nation’s major</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> commercial </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">seaports would hardly be a local matter.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> For instance, should al Qaeda or one of its imitator organizations succeed in sinking a large ship in the Long Beach channel, the auto-dependent southern California will literally run out of gas within two weeks. This is because, as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita highlighted, US petroleum refineries are operating at full throttle and their products are consumed almost as quickly as they are made. If the crude oil shipments stop, so too do the refineries and there is no excess capacity or refined fuels to cope with a long term disruption. But </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the most serious consequence of a major terrorist attack on America’s waterfront is if it involved a w</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">eapon of </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">m</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">ass </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">d</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">estruction </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">smuggled into</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> one of the over nine million 40’ </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">cargo containers</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> that entered US seaports in 2005. The September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, the March 11, 2004 attacks on Madrid, and the July 7, 2005 attacks on London highlight </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that transport systems have become</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> among </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the most favored targets for terrorist organizations.Cargo</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> containers have long been exploited to smuggle narcotics, migrants, and stolen property including luxury automobiles. Their </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">vulnerability is highlighted by the billions of dollars in cargo losses derived from theft each year</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. A typical cargo container that is shipped from Asia will pass through over a dozen transportation waypoints before it is loaded on a ship destined for the United States. Most are “secured” only with a fifty-cent lead seal passed through the pad-eyes on the container doors. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It is just a question of time before terrorists with</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> potentially </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">more destructive weapons breach</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> the superficial </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">security</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> measures that have been put in place to protect the ports, the ships, and the millions of intermodal containers that link global producers to consumers. Should that breach involve a “dirty bomb,” the United States and other states will likely raise the port security alert system to its highest level while investigators sort out what happened and establish whether or not a follow-on attack is likely. Multiple port closures in the United States and elsewhere would quickly throw this system into chaos. Container ships already destined for the United States would be stuck in anchorages unable to unload their cargo. Ships would be delayed in overseas loading ports as the maritime industry and their customers try to sort out how to redirect cargo. Marine terminals would have to close their gates to all incoming containers since they would have no place to store them. Trucks and trains would be stuck outside the terminal with no place to go. If they are carrying perishable goods, the cargo would perish. Also, the trucks and trains would not be able to re-circulate to pick up new shipments until they could get rid of the old ones. Goods for export would pile at factory loading docks with no place to go. Imports to support “just-in-time” deliveries would be no shows and soon factories would be idled and retailers’ shelves would go bare. In short, a catastrophic terrorist event involving the intermodal transportation system could well lead to unprecedented disruption to the global trade system. In economic terms, the costs associated with managing the attack’s aftermath will substantially dwarf the actual destruction from the terrorist event itself. Those costs will be borne internationally which is why transportation and trade security must be not only a U.S. Homeland Security priority, but an urgent global priority. As grave as this threat is, in our fifth year since the 9/11 attacks, there still are no minimum federal standards for access control, perimeter control, electronic surveillance, guards, and communications. State and local port authorities have not been able to make any significant progress towards improving the state of security within their ports. This is largely because ports face a competitive environment where they must make significant capital investments to improve the commercial operations in order to retain or attract shipping lines. It they divert funds away from capital improvements to pay for added security they may face a decline in vessel traffic that reduces their revenues. If they try to pass along increased security costs to their private tenets, those tenets may decide to move to a lower cost neighboring port. In short, in the absence of a level national playing field, U.S. port authorities have been reluctant to make major new investments in security.  </span><br />
