**__Observation 1 is Inherency:__**
1. The U.S. is bound by both policy and international law to deflect an asteroid no matter where it would strike.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Koplow 5</span> (Justin, JD Candidate – Georgetown University Law Center, Georgetown International Environmental Law Review, Lexis)

2. An estimated 400 global destruction causing asteroids have yet to be recorded, as well as more than a million asteroids with the potential to wreak havoc.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Popular Science 03</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Gregory Mone, __Popular Science__, //Incoming!//, August 6, 2003, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/article/2003-08/incoming]]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, znf)</span>


<span style="font-size: 12pt;">3. Current government policy relating to asteroids requires too much information to act efficiently. The B612 foundation has a plan to demonstrate efficient asteroid deflection by 2015, but requires the technology developed in NASA’s Prometheus Program</span>.

4. The only detection available for [Potentially Hazard Objects] PHOs is radar telescopes that can see a shallow distance from Earth’s surface. More power is needed.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bucknam and Gold in 08</span><span class="cardChar">[Mark and Robert “Survival” (00396338); Oct/Nov2008, Vol. 50 Issue 5, p141-156, 16p PN] [PHO - potentially hazardous object]</span>

5. All deflection methods require decades to effectively deflect an asteroid, but current detection is slow, and only identifies threatening Near Earth Objects [NEOs] months before an impact.
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">NRC 10</span><span class="cardChar">(National Research Council Committee to Review Near-Earth Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation Strategies, “Defending Planet Earth: Near-Earth Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation Strategies,” http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12842)</span>


Thus, the plan:
The United States federal government should fully fund and implement a space based infrared sensor in a Venus-like orbit for the purposes of asteroid detection and deflection. We reserve the right to clarify.


**__Advantage1 is Miscalculation:__**
__Scenario 1 is India and Pakistan:__
1. Current systems of asteroid detection are inadequate for preventing an accidental launch. India and Pakistan cannot distinguish asteroids from attacks.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Selinger ’02</span>. (writer “Asteroid Imact Set of Hiroshima-Sized Air Blast on June 6: Early Warning Center For Asteroids Needed Says USAF” __Aerospace Daily__ 7/11/02, [[http://www.rense.com/general27/asteroidimpactsetoff.htm]], AG)


2. Indo-Pak conflict will result in nuclear war.

Scenario 2 is Russia and the U.S.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. An unexpected asteroid could trigger U.S. or Russia early warning systems—leading to an accidental launch.</span>

__**Advantage 2 is the Asteroid Strike:**__

2. Small asteroids risk nuclear winter, crop failure and extinction

3. The impact is extinction --- high magnitude and aperiodic strikes shatter traditional considerations of “timeframe” and mean we should treat NEO threats as immanent, they are a threat to our very existence
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Brownfield 4</span> (Roger, Gaishiled Project, “A Million Miles a Day”, Presentation at the Planetary Defense Conference: Protecting Earth From Asteroids, 2-26, http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&gTable= Paper&g ID=17092)

4. Reducing existential risk __by even a tiny amount__ outweighs __every other impact__ — the math is conclusively on our side.

5. Policymakers should adopt the __Maxipok principle__ and __prioritize the reduction of existential risk__.

Scenario 2 is the Ocean:

**__Solvency:__**
1. Putting an infrared sensor in a Venus-like orbit would increase detection methods by 180% and could detect threatening PHOs much better than ground based telescopes.

2. The telescope technology exists.

4. Only an asteroid tug caused by using a gravity tractor can solve—the land and push theory is superior to any other deflection method.

**__Inherency__**
1. Detection efforts are incomplete the Earth killer has yet to be found

Thus The Plan

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">The United States federal government should fully fund and implement a space based infrared sensor in a Venus-like orbit for the purposes of asteroid detection, and make a promise to not deflect the ‘killer asteroid’ once it is found. We reserve the right to clarify.</span>
**__Technological Thought__**
<span class="Author-Date">1. The Earth has become Enframed as nothing other than a recourse by the conquest of technological thought. This is Heidegger’s concept of standing reserve.</span>

<span class="cite">2. Reducing the world to “Standing Reserve” removes our possibility to an authentic being.</span>

3. Technological thought can only confront its inherent limitations via the manufacture of catastrophe and violence.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Swazo 02 </span>– Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alaska (Norman K., __Crisis Theory and World Order: Heideggerian Reflections__, p. 157-60)

4. Loss of Being obliterates the value to life and is a fate worse than nuclear annihilation
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zimmerman 94</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Michael, Prof of Philosophy @ Tulane, __Contesting Earth’s Future__, p.119-120)</span>


**__Ontology__**
1. Ontology must come first: only by becoming explorers of what we accept as reality can we truly explore reality. Questioning what we accept as truth is the only way to be fully human.
Jerome 92 [Miller, Professor of Philosophy at Salisbury State University in Maryland, __In the Throe of Wonder: Intimations of the Sacred in a Post-Modern World__ pg. 197-198, 1992, SM, Accessed: 7/1/11]

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">2. Considering the relationship with “Being” is a prerequisite to solving any relationships between human beings.</span>

3. We have to understand ontology in the context of space because the drive for space exploration is a byproduct of how we come to imagine ourselves as a nation – this process of identity construction shapes our actions and truths.

4. The only option is to Do Nothing in the Face of the asteroid. Only Through Passivity can we Escape the Cycle of Control Created by Technological Thought.

5. Resisting our desire to protect ourselves from annihilation means rethinking our very selves and controlling our egos, solving our technological relation to the environment.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">McWhorter 92 (Ladelle, Heidegger and the Earth Essays in Environmental Philosophy, Thomas Jefferson University Press, pgs. vii-viii)</span>

6. By embracing the will of nature and not trying to create the false hierarchy of “man over nature” we can solve the problem of enframing. only through complete liberation from the brutal cycle of technological exploitation can we avoid destruction

7. Heidegger doesn’t reject the use of technology. Only through a revolution in our relationship with technology, not a severing, can we avoid destruction

8. The affs respect of the outer special body creates a cosmocentric ethic towards space which solves for the technological nature of space exploration

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">9. Letting the Earth be acts as a radical rejection of technological enframing, opening possibilities for new modes of dwelling in the world.</span>
