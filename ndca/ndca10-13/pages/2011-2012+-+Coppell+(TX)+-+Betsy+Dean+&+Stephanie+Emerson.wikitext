<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">In our view, even with adequate reform in its governance model, NASA is not a rightful institution to lead or manage the nation's business in Space Development projects.

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">An apostrophe (’) indicates that one or more letters have been omitted from a word in a contraction (“do not” becomes “don’t”; “he is” becomes “he’s”).

Generally you need worry only about possessives, since contractions are not acceptable in formal prose; but if you do have occasion to use the contraction “it’s” (for “it is”), do not confuse it with the possessive form of the pronoun, “its” (no apostrophe). Never leave out the apostrophe in a possessive noun (not “Herbs dog” but “Herb’s dog”). In making plural nouns possessive, use the apostrophe alone</span></span>
