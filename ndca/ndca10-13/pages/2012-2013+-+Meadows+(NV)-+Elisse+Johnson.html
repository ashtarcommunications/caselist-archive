<span class="Underline"><strong>Contention 1: Util</strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>The resolution asks a question about what &quot;the United States&quot; ought do, therefore we are here to discuss state policy. State policy must be guided by unique moral considerations that necessitate utilitarianism - 5 reasons</strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>1. Policy makers act under conditions of uncertainty-this demands an aggregate decision making model</strong></span><br />
<strong>Gooden, 1995 (</strong><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Robert, philsopher at the Research School of the Social Sciences, </span><u>Utilitarianism as Public Philosophy</u><span style="font-size: 3pt;">. P. 62-63)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Consider, first, the argument from necessity. </span><u>Public officials are obliged to make their choices under uncertainty,</u> <span style="font-size: 3pt;">and uncertainty of a very special sort at that. </span><u>All choices—public and private alike—are made under some degree of uncertainty,</u><span style="font-size: 3pt;"> of course. </span><u>But in the nature of things, private individuals will usually have more complete information</u><u>on the peculiarities of their own circumstances</u><span style="font-size: 3pt;"> and on the ramifications that alternative possible choices might have on them. </span><u>Public officials, in contrast, are relatively poorly informed as to the effects that their choices will have on individuals, one by one. What they typically do know are generalities: averages and aggregates. They know what will happen most often to most people as a result of their various possible choices</u><span style="font-size: 3pt;">. But that is all. </span><u>That is enough to allow public policy-makers to use the utilitarian calculus</u><span style="font-size: 3pt;">—if they want to use it at all—</span><u>to choose general rules of conduct. Knowing aggregates and averages, they can proceed to calculate the utility payoffs from adopting each alternative possible general rules.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>2. In the context of state policy making &quot;ought&quot; relates to protecting national security- 3 reasons</strong><br />
<strong>A. Social contract- the creation of a sovereign nation is explicitly designed to protect the material well being of its citizens, this obligation is the defining feature of statehood</strong><br />
<strong>B. Agency- states are not individual moral agents, they are a collective decision making process- unique features of individual moral agency are not present and thus states are not bound by them</strong><br />
<strong>C. Wrong forum- states interact in an anarchic international arena- individual moral theories govern the behavior of rational individual agents with one another- this sort of reasoning doesn't exist in agreed upon form in IR</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 4pt;">George </span><strong>Kennan 85</strong><span style="font-size: 4pt;">. [He is Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.]“Morality and Foreign Policy” Foreign Affairs, Vol. 64, No. 2 1985. pp. 205-218 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 4pt;">Certain distinctions should be made before one wanders farther into this thicket of problems. First of all, the conduct of diplomacy is the responsibility of governments. For purely practical reasons, this is unavoidable and inalterable. This responsibility is not diminished by the fact that government, in formulating foreign policy, may choose to be influenced by private opinion. </span><u>What we are talking about,</u><span style="font-size: 4pt;"> therefore, </span><u>when we attempt to relate moral considerations to foreign policy, is the behavior of governments, not</u><span style="font-size: 4pt;"> of </span><u>individuals</u><span style="font-size: 4pt;"> or entire peoples. Second, let us recognize that </span><u>the</u> <span style="font-size: 4pt;">functions, commitments and </span><u>moral obligations of governments are not the same as those of the individual</u><span style="font-size: 4pt;">. </span><u>Government is an agent, not a principal</u><span style="font-size: 4pt;">. </span><u>Its primary obligation is to the interests of the national society it represents, not to the moral impulses that individual elements of that society may experience.</u> <span style="font-size: 4pt;">No more than the attorney visàvis the client, nor the doctor vis-à-vis the </span><span style="font-size: 1pt;">patient, can government attempt to insert itself into the consciences of those whose interests it represents. Let me explain. </span><u>The interests of the national society for which government has to concern itself are basically those of its military security</u><span style="font-size: 1pt;">, the integrity of its political life and the well-being of its people. </span><u>These needs</u><span style="font-size: 1pt;"> have no moral quality. They </span><u>arise from the very existence of the national state in question and from the status of national sovereignty</u><span style="font-size: 1pt;"> it enjoys. They are the unavoidable necessities of a national existence and therefore not subject to classification as either &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; </span><u>They may be questioned from a detached philosophic point of view. But the government of the sovereign state cannot make such judgments.</u><u>When it accepts the responsibilities of governing, implicit in that acceptance is the assumption that it is right that the state should be sovereign, that the integrity of its political life should be assured, that its people should enjoy the blessings of military security</u><span style="font-size: 1pt;">, material prosperity and a reasonable opportunity for, as the Declaration of Independence put it, the pursuit of happiness. </span><u>For these assumptions the government needs no moral justification,</u><span style="font-size: 1pt;"> nor need it accept any moral reproach for acting on the basis of them. This assertion assumes, however, that the concept of national security taken as the basis for governmental concern is one reasonably, not extravagantly, conceived. In an age of nuclear striking power, national security can never be more than relative; and to the extent that it can be assured at all, it must find its sanction in the intentions of rival powers as well as in their capabilities. A concept of national security that ignores this reality and, above all, one that fails to concede the same legitimacy to the security needs of others that it claims for its own, lays itself open to the same moral reproach from which, in normal circumstances, it would be immune. Whoever looks thoughtfully at the present situation of the United States in particular will have to agree that to assure these blessings to the American people is a task of such dimensions that the government attempting to meet it successfully will have very little, if any, energy and attention left to devote to other undertakings, including those suggested by the moral impulses of these or those of its citizens. Finally, let us note that </span><u>there are no internationally accepted standards of morality to which the U.S. government could appeal if it wished to act in the name of moral principles.</u><span style="font-size: 4pt;"> It is true that there are certain words and phrases sufficiently highsounding the world over so that most governments, when asked to declare themselves for or against, will cheerfully subscribe to them, considering that such is their vagueness that the mere act of subscribing to them carries with it no danger of having one's freedom of action significantly impaired. To this category of pronouncements belong such documents as the KelloggBriand Pact, the Atlantic Charter, the Yalta Declaration on Liberated Europe, and the prologues of innumerable other international agreements. </span><br />
<br />
<strong>3. The act/omission distinction doesn't exist for governments</strong> <br />
<strong>Sunstein and Vermuele 05</strong><span style="font-size: 4pt;">, Cass Sunstein [Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at Harvard Law School] and Adrian Vermuele [Harvard professor of law], “Is Capital Punishment Morally Required? The Relevance of Life-Life Tradeoffs,” Chicago Public Law &amp; Legal Theory Working Paper No. 85 (March 2005), p. 17. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 4pt;"> In our view, </span><u>any effort to distinguish between acts and omissions goes wrong by overlooking the distinctive features of government</u><span style="font-size: 4pt;"> as a moral agent. If correct, </span><u>this point has broad implications</u><span style="font-size: 4pt;"> for criminal and civil law. Whatever the general status of the act/omission distinction as a matter of moral philosophy, 59 the distinction is least impressive when applied to government, because the most plausible underlying considerations do not apply to official actors. 60 The most fundamental point is that, </span><u>unlike individuals, governments always and necessarily face a choice between or among possible policies for regulating third parties.</u><u>The distinction between acts and omissions may not be intelligible in this context</u><span style="font-size: 4pt;">, </span><u>and</u><span style="font-size: 4pt;"> even if it is, the distinction </span><u>does not make a morally relevant difference.</u><span style="font-size: 4pt;"> Most generally, government is in the business of creating permissions and prohibitions. When it explicitly or implicitly authorizes private action, it is not omitting to do anything or refusing to act. 61 Moreover, the distinction between authorized and unauthorized private action—for example, private killing— becomes obscure when the government formally forbids private action but chooses a set of policy instruments that do not adequately or fully discourage it. </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>4. Intent based moral theories fail the test of political responsibility- only consequential reasoning allows decision makers to fulfill their obligations</strong></span><br />
<strong>Issac, professor of political science at Indiana University, 2002 (Jeffrey, Dissent, Spring, ebsco)</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah Arendt have taught, </span><u>an unyielding concern with moral goodness undercuts political responsibility</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The concern may be morally laudable, reflecting a kind of personal integrity, but </span><u>it suffers from three fatal flaws: (1) It fails to see that the purity of one’s intention does not ensure the achievement of what one intends</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Abjuring violence or refusing to make common cause with morally compromised parties may seem like the right thing; but </span><u>if such tactics entail impotence, then it is hard to view them as serving any moral good beyond the clean conscience of their supporters; (2) it fails to see that in a world of real violence and injustice, moral purity is not simply a form of powerlessness; it is often a form of complicity in injustice</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. This is why, from the standpoint of politics—as opposed to religion—pacifism is always a potentially immoral stand. In categorically repudiating violence, it refuses in principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any effect; </span><u>and (3) it fails to see that politics is as much about unintended consequences as it is about intentions; it is the effects of action, rather than the motives of action, that is most significant.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Just as the alignment with “good” may engender impotence, </span><u>it is often the pursuit of “good” that generates evil</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. This is the lesson of communism in the twentieth century: it is not enough that one’s goals be sincere or idealistic; it is equally important, always, to ask about the effects of pursuing these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic and historically contextualized ways.</span> <u>Moral absolutism</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">inhibits this judgment. It alienates those who are not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it </span><u>undermines political effectiveness</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>5. Only utility can navigate between conflicting non consequential moral systems</strong> </span><br />
<strong>Ratner, 1984</strong> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">(Leonard, professor of law at USC, Hofstra Law Journal, Spring, lexis)</span><br />
<u>A monstrous policy can be categorically rejected by an a priori morality, but proponents of the policy can defend it with a contrary a priori morality</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><u>Only a utilitarian evaluation can resolve the a priori impasse</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Such an evaluation may, in part, underlie the objection of nonutilitarians to monstrous behavior, because </span><strong><u>all human choice</u></strong> <u>reflects the needs and wants of the chooser and those needs and wants reflect the chooser's perceptions of the needs and wants of others.</u><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Contention 2: The Quirin Preceent</strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Ex Parte Quirin is a Supreme court case from World War 2 that ruled that foreign citizens weren't entitled to due process protections under international or domestic law. Post 9-11 it was cited by the Bush administration as the legal foundation of the suspension of habeas corpus rights in the war on terror. It is the reason accused terrorists do not receive due process protections.</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<strong>1. The Quirin precedent is the foundation of the executive’s power in the war on terror, guaranteeing extreme judicial deference and unlimited presidential authority.</strong> <br />

<span style="font-size: 3pt;">For decades after the Quirin decision (and long before the disclosure of the Court's shameful internal conduct), scholars questioned it, as well as the Korematsu decision, on any number of grounds. Even Frankfurter would belatedly speak of the case as &quot;not a happy precedent,&quot; and Justice Douglas singled it out, causing the entire Court to regret its actions. Judicial clerks serving the Court during the Quirin decision were especially scathing, insisting that the decision was made without legal authority and adding that it constituted a mockery of justice. In law school classrooms, professors would routinely suggest that Korematsu and Quirin may be legal relics of the period with more historical than precedential value.</span> <u>It was a considerable surprise</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, therefore, </span><u>to find Quirin embraced</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> almost </span><u>immediately after September 11</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, 2001, </span><u>as <strong>the very foundation for the administration's authority</strong></u><u>in the war on terror</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. President </span><u>Bush</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Attorney General John Ashcroft, White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, and others</span> <u>repeatedly cited the case as a <strong>virtual blank check for</strong></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> both </span><strong><u>military tribunals and the enemy combatant policy</u></strong><u>.</u> <span style="font-size: 3pt;">The impressionistic opinion lent itself to the most extreme interpretations. President Bush promulgated tribunal rules modeled on the Roosevelt orders, including his own outcome-determinative rules of evidence and standards of proof. In federal court, the Justice Department insisted that federal judges had no constitutional role beyond confirming that the government had declared an individual to be an enemy combatant. It simply submitted declarations filled with conclusory statements that individuals like Padilla and Hamdi were enemy combatants - with no underlying support for the assertions. And it barred those prisoners from access to counsel. When pressed in court, the government insisted that revealing details or allowing the individuals access to counsel would present grave dangers to the nation's security.</span> <u>Padilla and Hamdi were</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> perhaps </span><strong><u>inevitable consequences of Quirin</u></strong><u>. Once a precedent was given such <strong>unbridled authority</strong> over a citizen and the Court exercised such <strong>limited review</strong>, it was all but certain that a future president would push</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> his</span> <u><strong>power to its limit</strong></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">That point came when Jose Padilla, an American citizen arrested at O'Hare International Airport, was stripped of his constitutional rights, including access to counsel, on the basis of a conclusory declaration. The government’s legal position was denounced widely in both the United States and abroad. Lower court judges rejected the authority claimed in both Hamdi and Padilla, although the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals would later rule in favor of the government in the Hamdi case.81</span><br />

<strong>2. The lack of a bright-line rule in favor of allowing habeas corpus petitions creates a slippery slope for lower court divergence and executive circumvention</strong><br />
<strong>Perkins</strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span><strong>2005</strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> [Jared, “Note and Comment: Habeas Corpus in the War Against Terrorism: Hamdi v. Rumsfeld and Citizen Enemy Combatants,” 19 BYU J. Pub. L. 437, Lexis]</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Finally, </span><u>the need for a bright-line rule also derives from</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">core ideals sought after in the law: </span><u>uniformity and predictability. The Hamdi decision creates no predictability for detainees, nor uniformity for government actors.</u><u>Already the executive has treated two detainees from</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> [*469] factually similar, if not </span><u>identical, situations in drastically different ways</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 3pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.lexis-nexis.com.proxy.library.emory.edu/universe/document?_m=405024a1c6dcf16c55cb9418dc436553&amp;_docnum=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkVA&amp;_md5=b00e8e92975f802e4fba6878285347b7#n191" rel="nofollow">191</a></span><span style="font-size: 3pt;"> an aberration not corrected by Hamdi. Although Hamdi created some limitations on the power that the executive had enjoyed since 2001, the decision does not establish much set procedure that the government is required to follow. Thus, the executive is still allowed to pursue the course of action most advantageous to its policies without regard for the implications those acts have on the individual liberty interests of detained American citizens. As a result, Mr. Lindh, captured in Afghanistan, was given counsel, and prosecuted criminally, whereas Mr. Hamdi, also captured in Afghanistan, was held incommunicado indefinitely. Likewise, Mr. Padilla, captured in a U.S. airport, was also held incommunicado indefinitely. Unlike Lindh and Hamdi, Mr. Padilla was not captured in a foreign combat zone in possession of weapons, but, like Milligan, was captured on U.S. territory at a time when the civilian courts were open and habeas corpus had not been suspended. Before Hamdi the executive claimed complete discretion to treat these citizen detainees as it wished - clearly a circumstance the Constitution was designed to prevent. Hamdi does little to remedy this for a detainee appearing in a court that tends to favor heavily the government's security interests, like the Fourth Circuit. </span> <u>Further evidence of this flaw is found in the considerably divergent lower federal court rulings</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">on Mr. Hamdi's petition, </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 6pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.lexis-nexis.com.proxy.library.emory.edu/universe/document?_m=405024a1c6dcf16c55cb9418dc436553&amp;_docnum=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkVA&amp;_md5=b00e8e92975f802e4fba6878285347b7#n192" rel="nofollow">192</a></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and </span><u>in other enemy combatant cases in which conflicting constitutional interpretations have led to very different results.</u> <span style="color: black; font-size: 6pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.lexis-nexis.com.proxy.library.emory.edu/universe/document?_m=405024a1c6dcf16c55cb9418dc436553&amp;_docnum=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkVA&amp;_md5=b00e8e92975f802e4fba6878285347b7#n193" rel="nofollow">193</a></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> The Mathews balancing test does nothing to cure these disparate outcomes. Consequently, </span><u>two habeas petitioners in the same situation, making the same arguments, are likely to face very different outcomes depending on how their respective courts employ the Mathews test</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Disparate outcomes are certainly possible with any subjective test that is applied differently by different courts. However, the freedom from unjustified and indefinite detention that is so fundamental to our liberal tradition cannot be served [*470] by such a test.</span><strong><u>Habeas corpus requires bright-line rules</u></strong><span style="font-size: 3pt;">and their strict application as advocated, for example, by Justice Scalia's dissent. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 3pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.lexis-nexis.com.proxy.library.emory.edu/universe/document?_m=405024a1c6dcf16c55cb9418dc436553&amp;_docnum=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkVA&amp;_md5=b00e8e92975f802e4fba6878285347b7#n194" rel="nofollow">194</a></span><span style="font-size: 3pt;"> The disparity between outcomes for similar petitioners that results from the differing rules of men is what the rule of law has always sought to avoid. Professor Brooks observed: Legal rules that were designed to protect basic rights and vulnerable groups have lost much of their analytical force, and thus, too often, their practical force. </span><u>The erosion of clear boundaries in some areas of the law also leads to a slippery slope, allowing the disingenuous to assert that there is also blurriness even in areas of the law that remain both relevant and clear</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Thus, lawyers for the Bush administration went from the legitimate conclusion that the Geneva Conventions cannot easily be applied to many modern conflicts, to the disingenuous and flawed conclusion that there were therefore no legal constraints at all on U.S. interrogation practices. In fact, regardless of whether or not the Geneva Conventions apply to a given conflict, and regardless of whether or not a particular detainee is entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions, international law and U.S. treaty commitments prohibit the use of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees - and there can be little doubt that many of the interrogation practices authorized by the Pentagon constitute torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. In practice, then,</span><u>the breakdown of clear boundaries in some areas of the law also dangerously undermines the efficacy of other legal rules.</u><span style="color: black; font-size: 6pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.lexis-nexis.com.proxy.library.emory.edu/universe/document?_m=405024a1c6dcf16c55cb9418dc436553&amp;_docnum=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkVA&amp;_md5=b00e8e92975f802e4fba6878285347b7#n195" rel="nofollow">195</a></span><br />

<strong>1. Unfettered executive discretion over detention will expand the war power generally</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">We turn now to our own analysis of how the competing considerations of due process and the war power should be applied in the unique and present circumstances of the &quot;war on terror.&quot; Our conclusion, in agreement with the Second Circuit's but for somewhat different reasons, is that </span><u>the Constitution does not permit the President</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">unilaterally, without congressional authorization, </span><u>to effect indefinite and incommunicado detentions of suspected terrorists</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> seized in the United States. n59 </span><u>The serious negative consequences of recognizing such an executive power--damaging the rule of law in ways <strong>not easily confined to terrorism</strong>, opening the door to other abuses of due process,</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and offering an invitation by example to repressive regimes around the globe</span><u>--strongly supports not giving the war power such an expansive reading</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (see pp. 103-112, below). [*103] The limited war power jurisprudence does not justify indefinite detentions in this country of either citizens, as the Second Circuit has now held, or non-citizens (see pp. 112-130, below), at least until and unless Congress addresses and affirms the President's claim that the national security requires such extraordinary departures from long accepted due process standards (see pp. 130-136, below).</span><br />
<br />
<strong>2. The lack of review means that nobody in the executive branch will be accountable and like-minded people derive decisions through group-think</strong><br />
<strong>Sunstein, 04</strong> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">(Cass, professor of law at the University of Chicago, “Minimalism at War”, </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 6pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/80-crs-war.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/80-crs-war.pdf</a></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">1. Internal dynamics, unitariness, and group polarization. </span><u>Internal dynamics present a serious problem, precisely because the executive branch is designed so as to be neither diverse nor deliberative</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, certainly as compared with the national legislature. As Justice Thomas emphasized in Hamdi, </span><u>the executive branch is “unitary” in principle</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">101; </span><u>it is run by a single person</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, and he is constitutionally entitled to fill his branch </span><u>with like-minded people.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> And here is a real difficulty. </span><u>One of the most robust findings in modern social science is that after deliberation, like-minded people tend to end up thinking a more extreme version of what they thought before deliberation began</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.102 </span><u>Ordinary processes within the executive branch are all too likely to produce not careful investigation of alternatives</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 1pt;">but a heightened version of what executive branch officials believed in advance.103 As a result, liberty might well be at risk.104 Of course a presidential disposition in favor of liberty over security105 can alter this dynamic. Suppose, for example, that the President and his advisers believe that some national security risk is trivial while a small group within the administration disagrees. It is predictable that precautionary steps will not be taken even though they are justified.106 Deliberative processes among like-minded people can produce excessive rather than insufficient concern for liberty.107 In addition, a system of internal checks and balances can alter the dynamic by which groups end up amplifying their antecedent tendencies.108 Different agencies and departments often have different agendas and interests; consider the notorious fact that the Department of State and the Department of Defense often disagree on issues of both law and policy. A President can certainly take steps to ensure a diversity of views; it is possible to structure executive branch processes so as to create internal safeguards.109 My only suggestion here is that there can be no assurance that the executive branch, consisting of people who work under a single president and usually seeking internal consensus, will consider the relevant factors in a way that produces sensible outcomes</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><u>If the outlook of the President and his closest advisers includes a predisposition toward aggressive steps to counteract national security risks</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, even at the expense of liberty, </span><u>the executive branch is likely to blunder. History offers countless illustrations</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.110 As an example of a failure of deliberation within the executive branch, consider the account in the 2004 report of </span><u>the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, which </span><u>explicitly accused the</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Central Intelligence Agency (</span><u>CIA) of groupthink, in which the agency’s predisposition to find a serious threat from Iraq led it to fail to explore alternative possibilities or to obtain and use the information that it actually held</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">111 In the Committee’s view, the CIA “demonstrated several aspects of group think: examining few alternatives, selective gathering of information, pressure to conform within the group or withhold criticism, and collective rationalization.”112 Thus the agency showed a “tendency to reject information that contradicted the presumption” that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.113 Because of that presumption, the agency failed to use its own formalized methods “to challenge assumptions and ‘group think,’ such as ‘red teams,’ ‘devil’s advocacy,’ and other types of alternative or competitive analysis.”114 Above all, the Committee’s conclusions emphasize the CIA’s failure to elicit and aggregate information. Through processes of this sort, it is easy to imagine that liberty could be sacrificed in favor of national security, even if there is no adequate justification for the sacrifice. </span><br />
<br />
<strong>3. Most prior foreign policy disasters were a result of groupthink—our argument is empirically true</strong><br />
<strong>Jervis, 04</strong> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">(Robert, political science and international politics professor at Columbia University and a consultant to the CIA, The Record, 7/14, lexis)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">But was that indeed what happened? </span><u>&quot;Groupthink&quot;</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">- identified in the early 1970s by the late Yale psychologist Irving Janis - </span><u>refers to a process by which conformity grows out of deliberations in small groups. It can indeed be quite powerful</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The way Janis explained it, groupthink operates when individuals work closely together over a sustained period. It isn't merely that members of the group come to think alike but that they come to overvalue the harmonious functioning of the group. In their eagerness to reach consensus, they become inhibited from questioning established assumptions or from raising questions that might disturb their colleagues and friends. </span><u>A vicious circle begins as the group feels good about itself because it has discovered the truth, and this truth is accepted by each person because it is believed by the others.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> In this way, </span><u>a group of intelligent individuals can confidently arrive at conclusions that are wildly removed from reality</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><u>Most social scientists agree that groupthink has contributed to many disastrous decisions in</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> business, families, and </span><u>foreign policy.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> President </span><u>Kennedy and his top advisers, for instance, fell into a groupthink trap, believing that the landings of the Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in April 1961 </span><u>might overthrow</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Fidel </span><u>Castro.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Intense face-to-face meetings among the president's top foreign policy planners formed strong bonds that no one wanted to loosen. </span><u>In hindsight, their plans were so badly flawed that it is hard to understand how such world-wise leaders could have endorsed them. But apparently each individual grew confident because the others were - each was reassured because the group was functioning so well and without discord</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">; no one felt the need, or had the nerve, to insist they consider the possibility that the group was on the totally wrong track. Richard </span><u>Nixon's Watergate cover-up was in part maintained by the same dynamic</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. To many outsiders even at the time, it was obvious that the only way for Nixon to survive was to air the full truth early on. But the Nixon White House was a small group, closed-mouthed and predisposed to keeping everything secret.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>4. Unaccountable decisionmaking will create new foreign policy disasters, risking nuclear conflict</strong><br />
<strong>Adler, 1996</strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (David, professor of political science at Idaho State, </span><u>The Constitution and Conduct of American Foreign Policy</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, p. 23-25)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 1pt;">The structure of shared powers in foreign relations serves to deter the abuse of power, misguided policies, irrational action, and unaccountable behavior. As a fundamental structural matter, the emphasis on joint policymaking permits the airing of sundry political, social, and economic values and concerns. In any event, the structure wisely ensures that the ultimate policies will not reflect merely the private preferences or the short-term political interests of the president. Of course this arrangement has come under fire in the postwar period on a number of policy grounds. Some critics have argued, for example, that fundamental political and technological changes in the character of international relations and the position of the United States in the world have rendered obsolete an eighteenth-century document designed for a peripheral, small state in the European system of diplomatic relations. Moreover, it has been asserted that quick action and a single, authoritative voice are necessary to deal with an increasingly complex, interdependent, and technologically linked world capable of massive destruction in a very short period of time. Extollers of presidential dominance have also contended that only the president has the qualitative information, the expertise, and the capacity to act with the necessary dispatch to conduct U.S. foreign policy. These policy arguments have been reviewed, and discredited, elsewhere; space limitations here permit only a brief commentary. Above all else, the implications of U.S. power and action in the twentieth century have brought about an even greater need for institutional accountability and collective judgement that existed 200 years ago</span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">.</span> <u>The devastating, incomprehensible destruction of nuclear war and the possible extermination of the human race demonstrate the need for joint participation, as opposed to the opinion of one person</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 1pt;">in the decision to initiate war. Moreover, most of the disputes at stake between the exective and legislative branches in foreign affairs, including the issues discussed in this chapter, have virtually nothing to do with the need for rapid response to crisis. Rather, they are concerned only with routine policy formulation and execution, a classic example of the authority exercised under the separation of powers doctrine</span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">. But</span><u>these functions have been fused by the executive branch and have become increasingly unilateral, secretive, insulated from public debate, and hence unaccountable. In the wake of Vietnam, Watergate, and the Iran-Contra scandal, unilateral executive behavior has become even more difficult to defend. Scholarly appraisals have exploded arguments about intrinsic executive expertise and wisdom on foreign affairs and the alleged superiority of information available to the president</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Moreover, </span><u>the inattententiveness of presidents to important details and the effects of “group-think” that have dramatized and exacerbated the relative inexperience of various presidents in international relations have also devalued the extollers’ arguments</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Finally, foreign policies, like domestic policies, are a reflection of values. Against the strength of democratic principles, recent occupants of the White House have failed to demonstrate the superiority of their values in comparison to those of the American people and their representatives in Congress.</span><br />

<strong>Contention 4: Solvency</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>1. A strong judicial repudiation of Congressional power to restrict habeas corpus is a vital symbol that can control the mob mentality of groupthink</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The Associated Press reported that on Tuesday, &quot;</span><u>A federal appeals court ruled that foreign-born prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held in Guantanamo Bay may not challenge their detention in U.S. courts</u><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot;</span></u><span style="font-size: 3pt;"> This is the issue of Habeas Corpus -- the natural right of an accused person to have a court available to consider a challenge or appeal to their arrest and detention. Richard Epstein was right: </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 3pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://action.downsizedc.org/wyc.php?cid=58" rel="nofollow">&quot;Truth must count. Innocence must matter.&quot;</a></span><span style="font-size: 3pt;"> This right is so basic, so fundamental that &quot;we find ourselves pained to explain and defend it. Truth and Innocence were the values of our America, taught and, apparently, mythologized in school rooms for generations. America was the idea of a nation built on ideals; not race, ethnicity, or conquest. People came to the United States regardless of race or ethnicity, and often to escape conquest. As the Emma Lazarus poem on the Statue of Liberty explains, the &quot;teeming refuse&quot; was welcome here. But now, if foreign born and captured by the military, the United States government says you don't necessarily have those natural, God-given rights. And how much longer before the United States government starts holding Americans indefinitely? Haven't they already tried that even before they passed the Military Commissions Act in the case of Jose Padilla? </span><u>Congress passed the Military Commissions Act at the behest of the President.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Their justification was, predictably, terrorism. Neither end of Pennsylvania Ave wants anyone accused of the very non-specific crime of terrorism, or even some dim relation to a terrorist, to be able to appeal their detention on the grounds of pesky things like truth and innocence. Our security (allegedly) matters more. Which brings us to the reasoning of the judges in this case: It doesn't sit well with us. The judge’s rationale shouldn't sit well with any American. </span><u>Judge</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> A. Raymond </span><u>Randolph wrote in his decision, &quot;To accept</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> them [referring to </span><u>the Constitutional arguments of the detainees] would be to defy the will of Congress.&quot;</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">So what? </span><u>Aren't courts supposed to defy the will of Congress when an action by that body is contrary to the letter and spirit of</u><u>our founding charter? Does the Constitution even suggest that complying with the will of Congress is the Court's duty? And if so, why do we have courts?</u> <span style="font-size: 3pt;">What a tangled web this administration, with the active complicity of Congress, has woven in support of a war on a tactic (terrorism) that doesn't seem to be anywhere near as popular (or powerful) as they'd have us believe. Our entire value system and unique way of life has been sacrificed since 2001 by a group of politicians out to scare us to death. * Rights have been thrown overboard. * Presumption of innocence is now no more than a relic of a more &quot;innocent&quot; time. &quot;Truth must count. Innocence must matter.&quot; That's the name of our campaign at DownsizeDC.org. Since the will of Congress matters so damned much, tell Congress to </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 3pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://action.downsizedc.org/wyc.php?cid=58" rel="nofollow">repeal the Military Commissions Act.</a></span><span style="font-size: 3pt;"> The White House deputy press secretary said the Military Commissions Act provides &quot;sufficient and fair access to courts for these detainees.&quot; It's amazing what they'll say with a straight face! Sufficient? Fair? By who's standard? The administration's standards? Henry Ford was once asked when colors would be available to his Model T customers. He is alleged to have replied, &quot;The customer can have whatever color he wants, so long as it's black.&quot; Now this administration is saying, &quot;You can have any version of sufficient and fair access you want, so long as that doesn't mean access to civilian courts.&quot; You see, under the Military Commissions Act, your government may detain, indefinitely, foreigners who have been deemed &quot;enemy combatants.&quot; And, after reading this heinous law for ourselves, we can envision an ambitious prosecutor, perhaps from a future administration, finding a way to apply it to Americans. And</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span><u>under the Military Commissions Act, the military personnel who serve as judges are chosen by the Secretary of Defense. In other words, the judges may not necessarily be independent, but instead be a part of the chain of command with all that entails</u><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 3pt;"> (Some will object to that last statement, but there's a reason judges are appointed for life and are very difficult to remove. And if you really disagree, then ask yourself, &quot;If I were a prosecutor, would I prefer to take my case before a civilian court or military tribunal?&quot;) But to make matters worse, the Military Commissions Act authorizes the CIA (an agency with a colorful past) to use (and here's how the Associated Press euphemistically described it), &quot;aggressive but undefined interrogation tactics.&quot; Let's call it what it is: TORTURE! Now how un-American is that? How can we retain our place as the, &quot;shining city on a hill,&quot; as the nation at whose door Lady Liberty lifts her inviting &quot;golden lamp,&quot; if denying Habeas Corpus and permitting torture is allowed? Welcome to your waterboard, Mr. Teeming Refuse. Must we become what it is we are fighting? Must we sink that low? Even assuming that we're in as much danger as the politicians want us to believe we are -- a dubious proposition, by the way -- is our security worth losing our national dignity and sacrificing our moral character? This case will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court. One can only hope and pray that they will rip this law out by its' roots and leave it to die in the hot Sun.</span><u>The Supreme Court should, &quot;defy the will of Congress.&quot;</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">We are not a government of solons (a congress). We are not even a government of a supreme leader (a president). We have a Constitution! So </span><u>when the mob mentality in Congress fails us, the courts are supposed to stand up and say, &quot;No: This practice is unconstitutional and therefore, null and void</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>2. Judicial oversight increases executive accountability and reduces psychological error in foreign policy decision-making</strong><br />
<strong>Wells, 04</strong> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">(Christina, professor of law at University of Missouri-Columbia, 69 Mo. L. Rev. 903, Fall, lexis)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">This discussion has substantial implications for the judicial deference debate. Both sides of the debate argue from fundamental assumptions about various decision makers' capabilities, and the historical pattern above sheds light on some of those assumptions. First, that pattern casts doubt on judicial deference proponents' claim that executive officials are particularly adept at [*936] making decisions involving threats to national security</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><u>People generally are not adept at assessing risk in times of great fear, and history shows executive officials are no different</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, at least when national security decisions affect civil liberties at home. Moreover, </span><u>reputational concerns may pressure officials into catering to public hysteria.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Worse, executive officials are sometimes willing to act as availability entrepreneurs, instigating public hysteria for political ends. Second, </span><u>this historical pattern also suggests that proponents of judicial deference <strong>overstate their case</strong> in claiming executive officials have learned from past &quot;tragic mistakes.&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> While skewed risk assessment does not necessarily occur in any given crisis, we know that it can occur and, further, we know the mechanism by which it usually does occur. Thus far, </span><u>little has been done to counteract the elements</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">-- e.g., vivid images, fear or anxiety, substantial media coverage, reputational pressures to conform -- </span><u>that lead to skewed assessments</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Given that conditions in national security crises typically involve such elements, there is reason to believe that skewed assessments will again be the basis for unwarranted infringements on civil liberties in similar crises. Government actions and public attitudes after September 11th support this proposition. n182 </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">A. Accountability as a Mechanism for Improving Decision Making </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Can anything be done to improve executive officials' decision making and to avoid the civil liberties debacles of past crises? Psychological research on &quot;accountability&quot; offers some general answers and further provides support for the argument that rigorous judicial review can deter skewed risk assessment. As with the general dictionary definition of accountability, n183 psychologists [*937] typically define that term to mean &quot;the implicit or explicit expectation that one may be called on to justify one's beliefs, feelings, and actions to others.&quot; n184 That term &quot;also usually implies that people who do not provide a satisfactory justification for their own actions will suffer negative consequences . . . . [and that] people who do provide compelling justifications will experience positive consequences.&quot; n185 By serving as a constraint on behavior, &quot;accountability is a critical norm-enforcement mechanism -- the social psychological link between individual decision makers on the one hand and social systems on the other.&quot; n186 </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Research shows that accountability can improve judgment and decision making. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">This improvement comes about because people subject to account want to avoid embarrassment in front of their audience. n187 According to a [*938] comprehensive review of accountability research performed by Jennifer Lerner and Philip Tetlock, such motivation causes decision makers to prepare themselves by engaging in an effortful and self-critical search for reasons to justify their actions. This search leads participants to (a) survey a wider range of conceivably relevant cues; (b) pay greater attention to the cues they use; (c) anticipate counter arguments, weigh their merits relatively impartially, and factor those that pass some threshold of plausibility into their overall opinion or assessment of the situation; and (d) gain greater awareness of their cognitive processes by regularly monitoring the cues that are allowed to influence judgment and choice. n188 Because accountability is a complex phenomenon dependent on many factors, one cannot assert that it necessarily alleviates all decision-making errors or biases. n189 However, specific studies show that accountability can attenuate many of the errors and biases apparently involved in the skewed risk assessment described above. Thus, </span><u>research shows that accountability can cause decision makers to be more self-critical, more willing to consider alternative points of view, and more willing to anticipate possible objections to proposed courses of actions.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> n190 Accountability also can attenuate biases related to the availability heuristic n191 and the overconfidence bias. n192 Further, </span><u>requiring a group to account for its decisions can mitigate some of the reputational influences that result in groupthink by decreasing mindless attempts at</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">[*939] </span><u>uniformity and the influence of a partial leader</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">n193 Finally, while accountability can exacerbate individuals' tendency to seek out confirmatory evidence to the exclusion of disconfirmatory evidence, explicit instructions to consider alternatives urge individuals to correct for this bias. n194 </span><u>These findings suggest that accountability may deter government decisions based upon skewed risk assessment in times of crisis. To the extent that executive officials themselves overestimate a potential threat, requiring them to account for their decision in a formal way -- by identifying the alleged threat and explaining why that threat is substantial and the government's action necessary -- could lead to improved initial decision making</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Accountability, by reducing pressure toward uniformity, may also enable public officials to resist reputational pressures causing them to bow to public hysteria. n195 Furthermore, accountability may rein in government officials who act as availability entrepreneurs because such officials, presumably desiring to avoid embarrassment, would more carefully evaluate the wisdom of purely political actions. n196 </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">B. Judicial Review as a Mechanism of Accountability One can make a strong argument that </span><u>judicial review is generally a viable mechanism for executive branch accountability during national security crises.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> n197 </span><u>The judicial forum, with its fact-finding capabilities, requirements of proof, and requirement that the government justify incursions on civil liberties, fits well within the general definition of accountability as requiring a specific, public accounting of one's decisions</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Consistent with the psychological definition, positive or negative consequences attach to executive officials' [*940] accounting of their behavior in the form of a judicial ruling for or against the government.</span><br />

<strong>3. Judicial review of enemy combatant status increases the quality of intelligence processing and overall decision-making in the war on terror</strong><br />
<strong>Foley, 05</strong> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">(Brian, professor of law at Florida Coastal School of Law, Counterpunch, 11/17, </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 6pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://counterpunch.com/foley11172005.html" rel="nofollow">http://counterpunch.com/foley11172005.html</a></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">What 84 Senators apparently don't understand is that </span><u>using rigorous legal process at GTMO to determine whether a prisoner is an &quot;enemy combatant</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">,&quot; or whether he is guilty of particular crimes, </span><u>is an important weapon in the &quot;war on terror.&quot; When our military and intelligence know that only solid evidence -- instead of hearsay, coerced confessions,</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and evidence kept secret from the accused </span><u>-- can be used</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> to support detentions, </span><u>and that a federal judge will review the proceedings, they will investigate more thoroughly</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. We will be far more certain that we're holding the right people, instead of, for example, mere dupes that the real terrorists have handed over, or innocent people captured by mistake. Imprisoning innocent people can spur others to violence against us. Shoddy investigations and kangaroo courts merely endanger the public. On the other hand, requiring our officials to roll up their sleeves and ferret out reliable evidence would protect the public, by </span><u>sharpening our investigators' skills and building knowledge about terrorists and their networks</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. In the long run, </span><u>such seasoned and nuanced intelligence will protect us far more than convictions based on beatings and hearsay. Rigorous process also provides a check on Executive power. Without it, we can't know if our leaders are telling us the truth when they say they're making progress and capturing dangerous terrorists ­ our leaders can't even be certain themselves.</u><br />

<strong>4. Judicial action to mandate habeas review is a vital symbol to restore U.S. international leadership without undermining military effectiveness.</strong><br />
<strong>Hecht, 05</strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (Daryl, Judge for the Iowa Court of Appeals, 50 S.D. L. REV. 78, lexis)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Americans proclaim with some justification that liberty and human rights are among the crown jewels of their national identity. Claiming the status of human rights watchdogs around the globe, representatives of the United States government commonly criticize human rights failures of other nations. If such criticism is to be taken seriously and carry force abroad when well-founded, the United States government must heed its own admonitions. It should accord due process not only to all persons detained within its borders but also to those it imprisons offshore at locations under the exclusive control of the United States. </span><u>Affirmation by federal courts of the liberty interests of alien prisoners</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> imprisoned on Guantanamo </span><u>would give important symbolic assurance to</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> citizens of the United States, </span><u>foreign nationals, friends, and foes that liberty is a cherished universal human right</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">that does not persist or perish according to technicalities such as geographic boundaries. As they clarify the nature and extent of process due the Guantanamo prisoners, federal courts will consider the Eisentrager Court's concerns about the prospect that thorough judicial review might disrupt war efforts. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 6pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=938acabc8d208f2c7d5fa60db492ee72&amp;docnum=98&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=51&amp;wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&amp;_md5=eeae0c139818f7b3acae88f6aed6f150&amp;focBudTerms=supreme%20court%20should%20w/30%20guantanamo%20and%20deference%20and%20date%3E2001&amp;focBudSel=all#n288" rel="nofollow">288</a></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> The realities [*111] of war may justify reasonable restriction of the process available to prisoners of war during times of armed conflict and justify some judicial deference allowing the executive to conduct military campaigns with a minimum of distraction. However, </span><u>the risk that the war effort will be disrupted by judicial</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> or administrative </span><u>review</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of the grounds for detention </span><u>are diminished</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in these cases </span><u>because</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the prison is distant from the present theaters of war. </span><u>Modern technology will facilitate the presentation of evidence at remote sites</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in ways not contemplated by the Court in the Eisentrager era </span><u>and will render unpersuasive many of the Executive's war-powers arguments</u> <span style="font-size: 3pt;">against meaningful judicial review. The recent commencement of administrative hearings conducted by the Combatant Status Review Tribunals and the discharge of some of the Guantanamo prisoners are positive developments. It remains to be seen whether federal courts will conclude these administrative tribunals within the Executive branch allow for meaningful review of the prisoners' status. Although passage of the Military Tribunals Act of 2003 would, especially with suggested amendments, alleviate many of the most egregious legal infirmities associated with the ongoing detention of uncharged prisoners, a timely legislative solution to the problem through the action of the political branches of government is unlikely. The best and perhaps only prospect for meaningful protection of the uncharged detainees' rights against indefinite imprisonment lies in the litigation pending in federal courts. The remaining uncharged prisoners have languished too long in prison without charge or access to counsel, and the courts must be vigilant to prevent the continuation of arbitrary detentions in violation of international humanitarian and human rights principles. Alien prisoners ought not be disqualified from fundamental constitutional protections solely as a consequence of the government's choice of an off-shore location for their confinement. If deprivation of aliens' property interests may legally be imposed within the United States only in conformity with due process principles, the liberty interests of aliens held on Guantanamo should receive no less protection against state action. It should be understood that arguments in favor of meaningful review of the status of the Guantanamo prisoners is not an argument for the immediate release of all aliens imprisoned on Guantanamo. The evidence presented in habeas proceedings or in fair administrative tribunal hearings may establish reasonable grounds to believe some petitioners are properly designated and detained as enemy combatants. Under international humanitarian law, they may be detained during the conflict, but it seems evident that the GPW did not contemplate perpetual imprisonment without charge during an interminable war. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 3pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=938acabc8d208f2c7d5fa60db492ee72&amp;docnum=98&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=51&amp;wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&amp;_md5=eeae0c139818f7b3acae88f6aed6f150&amp;focBudTerms=supreme%20court%20should%20w/30%20guantanamo%20and%20deference%20and%20date%3E2001&amp;focBudSel=all#n289" rel="nofollow">289</a></span><span style="font-size: 3pt;"> The [*112] evidence offered in a meaningful review process may support war crimes charges against some of the prisoners who will be tried before military commissions under the regulations adopted by the Department of Defense.

<strong>Civil liberties reforms cause terror suspects to be rendered outside the country</strong> <br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Umansky – 6-17-2005</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> [Eric, columnist for Slate, “Closing Guantanamo prison may not be the best option,” Athens Banner-Herald, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:763:http://onlineathens.com/stories/061805/opi_20050618001.shtml --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://onlineathens.com/stories/061805/opi_20050618001.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://onlineathens.com/stories/061805/opi_20050618001.shtml</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:763 -->]</span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Closing the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay has suddenly become a hot topic</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Since Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., broached the idea, the notion has been gaining steam. Last weekend, Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla., added the first Republican voice to the chorus, and there were Senate hearings Wednesday on detainee issues. Even President Bush seems to be hinting that he's game. Asked during a television interview whether Gitmo should be shut, the president said, &quot;We're exploring all alternatives as to how best to do the main objective, which is to protect America.&quot; Gitmo has come to represent the lack of accountability and the extralegal aspects of the war on terrorism. Shuttering it would be a grand gesture. The symbolism would be important and could help improve the U.S. image. But if that is all that is done, a closure risks obscuring a more important issue and could even be counterproductive: If the U.S. is to really regain its standing as a defender of human rights, it needs to do more than mothball a single jail; it needs to change its policies</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If the prison were to close, what would happen to the detainees? Most of them were judged by former commanders at Guantanamo to be merely Taliban foot soldiers. Some, presumably, would simply be released. Others might face military tribunals, and some would most likely be shipped off, to be held by other countries. The last two possibilities are not a welcome scenario from either a moral or public relations perspective</span></u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Consider the tribunals. Heavily stacked against defendants, they've been condemned by such groups as the American Bar Association and military defense lawyers, who actually sued the government over the lack of prisoners' rights</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. <u>Shipping terror suspects to other countries, even their own countries, could be worse</u>. <u>The U.S. has been practicing</u> </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">a form of this:</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <u>&quot;extraordinary rendition,&quot; in which prisoners are picked up in one locale - &quot;snatched&quot; in CIA parlance - and find themselves incarcerated elsewhere, in countries such as Syria or Uzbekistan</u></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. A United States military boat patrols in front of Camp Delta in this 2002 file photo, in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The legal process in such cases isn't just flawed, it doesn't exist. Detainees get no trials or hearings before a judge</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. <u>The U.S. gets pro forma promises that prisoners won't be tortured, but there is no known monitoring. And Uzbekistan, for instance, has gained some renown for reports of political prisoners being boiled alive</u></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Rendition hasn't generated the headlines or the level of outrage as Guantanamo Bay. But</span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">stories from rendered detainees have made it out, and they do little for the U.S. image. One Australian citizen who was rendered to Egypt was reportedly hung from a wall and given electric shock. In something of a reprieve, he was transferred to Guantanamo Bay. He arrived without most of his fingernails</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">There's also a perverse possibility intrinsic in</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">closing Gitmo</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">: It <strong><u>could end up making the U.S. less accountable. With the visible symbol of unfair treatment swept away, pressure for wider change might dissipate.</u></strong> <u>It's important to remember that Gitmo is only one of a group of U.S. prisons around the globe set up to hold &quot;enemy combatants&quot; captured in the war on terrorism. Far less is known about the other jails</u></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">which are reportedly run by the CIA. There's one at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, called the Salt Pits. As The New York Times reported, two detainees have been killed at Bagram. More obscure is the reported facility at a base in Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Unlike at Guantanamo Bay, no reporters have been allowed to visit these jails.</span></u><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">After 9/11, it became apparent</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">from certain news articles and other sources that</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">they had a new practice called &quot;extraordinary rendition</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">It meant two things: </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;" class="underline">They</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> were going to</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">do this on a broad basis to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">pick up people</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">all over the world, essentially “disappeared” them from their homes, their communities or their countries -- or from whatever country they were in --</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="underline">and take them to places where they would be subjected to interrogation through torture</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The places they would take them to would be Egypt, Morocco; in the case we represent, Maher Arar, (is) a man taken to Syria, and some other countries. And they did that I think partly for two reasons: One is they claimed that there were techniques they didn't want to use on people which were torture, and that somehow that would be legal if other countries did it and they didn't. Of course, that's not a good legal excuse, that's aiding and abetting -- and secondly what's interesting, of course, is the U.S. wound up engaging in torture anyway. The first person we got that gave us a glimpse into it was a man named Maher Arar, he was coming back from Tunisia, a Canadian citizen on a transit flight at Kennedy airport. (He was) picked up at Kennedy, claimed to be a terrorist by the government of the United States, sent to Syria in one of those private Citation jets, which is what they do to deliver people all over the world, and tortured in Syria. Eventually because he was Canadian, because we knew he was there, because he was able to call his wife from Kennedy before he got taken out, we got him out after 10 months and 10 days from an underground prison cell. Since then, there's been more and more documents of this practice. And the practice is not only nasty in the sense that it of course violates borders and is kidnapping, but</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">it's actually disappearing people</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">and</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">in many cases</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">I think disappearing them</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">for torture, and maybe never to be heard from again.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> For </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">example, I don't think people expected Arar, the man in Syria, ever to be heard from again. So it's a major practice going on now.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ourcountry has its hands really up to its elbows</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">if not higher, in this practice. Between The Lines: What is being done by human rights groups and your organization to challenge this practice? </span><br />

<strong>Rendition undermines egyptian democracy causing terrorism</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">We can only hope that prominent Democratic senators and liberal columnists will be ready to say about American aid to Cairo, after Mubarak cheats in the upcoming presidential elections, &quot;Just shut it down.&quot;</span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The generation of bin Ladenism is specifically connected to dictatorship in Egypt</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">,</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">where the regime's convoluted double game of simultaneously supporting and suppressing Islamic fundamentalism has succeeded in gutting what was once the most vibrant, talented, and hopeful society in the Muslim Middle East</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The U.S. policy of rendition undermines the cause of democracy in Egypt even as it binds us to the regime's most benighted side.

 <strong>Currently terror suspects will be tried in military tribunals which is key to the war on terror</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">NYT – 7-16-2005</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> (Neil A. Lewis, “Ruling Lets U.S. Restart Trials at Guantanamo,” p.A6)</span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A federal appeals court ruled unanimously on Friday that the military could resume war crimes trials of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, Cuba, which were suspended last year. The decision, by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, reversed a lower court's ruling that abruptly halted the first war crimes trials conducted by the United States since the aftermath of World War II. The appeals judges said the <u>Bush administration's plan to try some detainees before military commissions did not violate the Constitution, international law or American military law.</u> <u>Their ruling</u>, in the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a driver for Osama bin Laden, <u>was a significant legal victory for the administration</u>, which has found itself engaged in several court battles over tools that officials say they need to fight terrorist groups. <u>''The president's authority under the laws of our nation to try enemy combatants is a vital part of the global war on terror,''</u> Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales said on Friday, ''and today's decision reaffirms this critical authority.''</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Due process protections will make military tribunals unusable</strong> <br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dorf – 2-23-2002</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> (Michael C., Vice Dean and Professor of Law at Columbia University, “What is an ‘Unlawful Combatant,’ And Why It Matters: The Status of Detained Al Qaeda and Taliban Fighters,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:765:http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dorf/20020123.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dorf/20020123.html" rel="nofollow">http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dorf/20020123.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:765 -->)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">A Consequence of POW Status: No Tribunal Trials Even if not technically prisoners of war, al Qaeda and Taliban captives still qualify for &quot;humane treatment&quot; under the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1988. Moreover, one might wonder, what is the harm in affording the captives somewhat better treatment than they are entitled to under international law? After all, the Geneva Convention hardly requires that prisoners of war be housed in four-star hotels. <u>The Administration's objection to affording al Qaeda and Taliban captives prisoner-of-war status probably has less to do with the conditions in which the captives are held than with what the Administration plans to do with them in the long term. Under President Bush's military order of November 13, al Qaeda members and those who harbored them can be tried by military tribunals.</u> The Supreme Court approved the use of such tribunals for unlawful combatants in the 1942 case of Ex Parte Quirin. Most of the public discussion of the President's order and the Quirin case has centered on the question of when a defendant can be subject to the jurisdiction of a military tribunal rather than a civilian court. But whatever the answer to that question, <u>Quirin takes for granted that only unlawful combatants can be tried by the sort of irregular tribunals at issue in that case and contemplated by the President's order. Lawful combatants - that is, prisoners of war - are entitled to substantive and procedural protections <strong>not contemplated by Bush's order.</strong> Accordingly, the question of whether al Qaeda and Taliban fighters are prisoners of war or unlawful combatants turns out to matter a great deal</u>, at least potentially. </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Military tribunals are the only way to stop terrorism and preserve US military power</strong> <br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Bialke, 2004</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> (Joseph, Lieutenant Colonel Staff Judge Advocate at the Pacific Air Forces-Australia, The Air Force Law Review, “Al-Qaeda &amp; Taliban Unlawful Combatant Detainees, Unlawful Belligerency, and the International Laws of Armed Conflict,” 55 A.F. L. Rev. 1, Lexis Nexis Universe)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">C. U.S. Military Commissions: Appropriate Security Measures and Evidence Procedures <u>A military commission</u> convened in the course of ongoing hostilities <u>can provide better security and protection to the accused, judges, prosecutors, juries, witnesses, defense counsel, court-room observers and other participants</u> n75 <u>than could a parallel civilian criminal justice forum. Given that any courtroom in which an unlawful combatant is tried could itself become a terrorist target, additional security may be provided</u> and the risk to the physical safety of court participants minimized <u>when a U.S. military commission is convened on a U.S. military installation with sophisticated security measures, limited access, and one that is isolated from major civilian population centers. Additionally, a U.S. military commission would be better able to protect the identities of court participants in order to reduce the potential of post-trial Taliban and al-Qaeda retaliation. Similarly, when necessary, a U.S. military commission can more adequately protect classified evidence involving on-going military operations and investigations which involve continuing threats to U.S. national security, and can better protect classified U.S. intelligence communications, sources, identities, capabilities, and gathering methods. U.S. military personnel are well trained in protecting such sensitive operational information from compromise.</u> Additionally, U.S. military commission members and other commission participants would already have undergone extensive background security investigations and, as a result, possess the applicable information security clearances, to include Secret, Top Secret, and, if necessary, higher clearances. <u>The safeguarding of sensitive information received gratuitously from foreign intelligence agencies of allied countries (including intelligence agencies of mideastern allied countries), as well as the protection of the</u> [*74] <u>identities of foreign intelligence sources, is indispensable if the U.S. wishes to rely on their continued cooperation. The protection of such information from enemy espionage and other enemy strategic intelligence collection efforts would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, in an &quot;open and public&quot; civilian criminal trial. Safeguarding and preserving such highly sensitive information from compromise,</u> and ensuring that unlawful combatants cannot abuse the criminal justice system evidence discovery process for illicit purposes, <u>are imperatives to U.S. national security.</u> This is because <u>al-Qaeda followers still at large could possibly exploit such classified information to adapt their methods, protect themselves from capture, attack the U.S. and its allies, retaliate against court/commission participants, or carry out additional acts of terrorism against protected civilians.</u> n76 The rules of evidence in a U.S. military commission also address the practicality that standard common law evidence procedures and principles cannot be applied strictly to. crimes that are alleged to have occurred in a zone of active combat. Accordingly<u>, U.S. military commission rules of evidence, in limited circumstances, are crafted with more flexibility and less procedural formality.</u> They are somewhat similar to the models of European civil law jurisdictions, and UN-sponsored war crimes tribunals such as the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the Special Tribunal for Cambodia, as well as the recently established International Criminal Court. n77 [*75] Hence, <u>in reaching an informed and just verdict, members of a U.S. military commission may admit and consider a broader range of probative evidence and give such evidence whatever weight is appropriate.</u> n78 A U.S. military commission's latitude to admit and consider a more comprehensive gamut of both prosecutorial and defense evidence, that being evidence that has probative value to a reasonable person, is in practical acknowledgement of the character of war. The U.S. military commission &quot;probative to a reasonable person&quot; standard of evidence applies equally to both the prosecution and to the defense. The military commission evidence standard and rules pragmatically take into consideration that acquiring evidence in the battlefield environment is completely different from traditional peacetime law enforcement evidence gathering. <u>More specifically, the military commission evidence standard and rules recognize the diaspora, deaths, or incapacitation of material witnesses, the destruction or loss of evidence buried under rubble on the field of battle, the distinction that military intelligence is gathered primarily to aid the current war effort rather than for any conjectural subsequent use as prosecutorial evidence, the availability of military-affiliated witnesses who are still engaged in</u> [*77] <u>ongoing combat operations, the high operational tempo and speed of maneuver in modern warfare, the constant flux and changing of battle lines and positions, and the location of relevant evidence in distant battlefields halfway around the globe. The difficulty in evidence retrieval, maintenance of a proper chain-of-custody, the continued safeguarding during ongoing military operations, and the general chaos and mayhem associated with international armed conflict and the battlefield amplify the problem.</u></span><br />
