==Deterrence CP== 
===1NC=== 
**The United States federal government should declare that its nuclear weapons are purely defensive instruments of last resort whose sole purpose is to deter the use of nuclear weapons and to deter [Middle Eastern war] or if the US is attacked.**
**The United States federal government should make a classified, internal policy decision to not retaliate in the instance that U.S. is attacked.**

**And – Iraq proves that the government has the ability to make internal decisions that circumvent traditional policymaking channels**
Kassop, 2003 (Nancy, Professor at the State University of New York New Paltz, “The War Power and its Limits”, Presidential Studies Quarterly, Volume 33, Issue 3, September)

Kessler writes that “the previously undisclosed Iraq directive is characteristic of an internal decision AND their cause to the war on terrorism.” (Kessler 2003, A01).

**And – the counterplan’s declaration effectively deters attacks**
Perry and Schlesinger et al, 2009 (William J., Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and the Michael and Barbara Berberian Professor at Stanford University, James R., Former Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Energy, “America’s Strategic Posture: The Final Report of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States”, U.S. Institute of Peace)

Declaratory policy is a signal of U.S. intent. As such,AND United States would avoid pushing a confrontation to the point of nuclear exchange.

===2NC=== 

**The declatory policy would signal intent to Allies and even potential enemies**
Perry and Schlesinger et al, 2009 (William J., Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and the Michael and Barbara Berberian Professor at Stanford University, James R., Former Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Energy, “America’s Strategic Posture: The Final Report of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States”, U.S. Institute of Peace)

On declaratory policy: Declaratory policy is a signal of U.S. intent AND weapons only for the protection of itself and its allies in extreme circumstances.

**The counterplan wouldn’t affect warfighting capabilities and solve all deterrence arguments**
Tertrais, 2009 (Bruno, Senior Research Fellow at the Foundation pourla Recherche and Strategique, “The Trouble With No First Use”, in The Case for No First Use: An Exchange, Survival, Vol. 51 No. 5, October/November, http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/22680/51-5_04_NFU_Forum_Proof.pdf)

A no-first-use policy might also have security costs beyond deterrence. AND costs, if any, because it would not change the doctrine itself.

==Loan Garuntees CP== 
===1NC=== 
Replace funding mech with loan garuntees

===2NC Solvency=== 

**Loan garuntees solves government inefficiency and maximizes value**
Brandao and Saraiva 10 (Luiz and Eduardo, Journal of Construction Management and Economics: vol.26, issue 11, “The option value of government guarantees in infrastructure projects,” September 2010, [[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01446190802428051]])

The presence of the government as a risk reduction agent may be necessary since it AND investigate the optimal timing of investment for a high speed rail project.

===2NC AT: Default=== 

**Solves high-risk projects – caps and market parameters**
**Brandao and Saraiva 10** (Luiz and Eduardo, Journal of Construction Management and Economics: vol.26, issue 11, “The option value of government guarantees in infrastructure projects,” September 2010, [[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01446190802428051]])

We analysed the problem of private investment in public infrastructure and concluded that for some AND be a solution to attract private investment to higher risk public infrastructure projects.

==Privatization CP== 
===1NC=== 

**Text: The United States Federal Government should devolve all authority over <<PLAN>> to the private sector and the United States Federal Government should encourage whole sale privatization of transportation infrastructure assets as per our Lord evidence.**

**Solves the aff and is popular with the public.**
**Lord 2010** (Nick, financial journalist, commentator and analyst, “Privatization: The road to wiping out the US deficit,” April 2012,[[http://go.galegroup.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?action=interpret&id=GALE%7CA225551392&v=2.1&u=lom_umichanna&it=r&p=ITOF&sw=w&authCount=1]])

One idea that financiers are now openly discussing as the government's only way out of AND There has never been more capital available for these assets," he says.

===2NC Solves Georeferencing=== 

**Specifically- this is true for SATELLITE AND SURVEILLANCE OPERATIONS - Solves better and avoids politics link**

In recent years, advances in commercially available technology have allowed private companies to develop AND about 90 percent of what the military needs can be solved with commercial.”

**Private firms develop military satellite systems better-prefer our comparative evidence**
**Clark 2011** (Stephen, staff writer- Spaceflight Now, “U.S Military Turns To Private Sector For SATCOM Capacity, "http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1102/17milsatcom/, 2-17)

"The commercial marketplace for procuring commercial satellite technologies is maturing very rapidly, and AND what I used to think I knew. Commercial is here to stay."

**Solves and encourages private financing**
**Roth 2010** (Gabriel, civil engineer and transportation economist @ the CATO Institute as well as the Independent Institute. Previously worked 20 years at the World Bank for transportation projects across the globe. “Federal Government Should Leave Transportation Infrastructure to The States” [[http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/transportation/highway-funding]])

For two principal reasons, the federal government should fund no transportation infrastructure at all AND and successful reforms pioneered by some states could quickly be replicated in others.

==Consult the Natives CP== 
===**1NC**=== 
**Text: the United States federal government should substantially increase its investment in the Guam Road Network if and only if such investment is agreeable to local communities in Guam through the process of binding consultation.**

**We have a solvency advocate – the aff is a function of military colonialism that erases local opinion**
**Gonzales 09** (Juan, DEMOCRACY NOW!, “US Colonialism Continues on Guam: Residents Organize Against US Plans for $15B Military Buildup”, http://www.mediafreedominternational.org/2010/04/05/us-colonialism-continues-on-guam-residents-organize-against-us-plans-for-15b-military-buildup/)

The Pacific island of Guam, the United States is planning an enormous military buildup AND for twelve years resulting in long term radioactive exposures to the Chamoru population.

**The first net-benefit is community-military relations –**

**Current levels of negotiation are controlled by military leadership – the CP revives that by creating an open and cooperation relationship**
**Boccuti, Faul, and Gray 12** (Amanda, analyst for Marstel-Day, LLC, providing analysis and GIS support for U.S. Marine Corps projects, Lauren, analyst for Marstel-Day, LLC, specializing in Strategic Communications, and Lauren, researcher at Marstel-Day, LLC, offering research and analysis of environmental issues for encroachment control plans and communications, outreach and engagement strategies for the U.S. Marine Corps, “Establishing Creative Strategies for Effective Engagement between Military Installations & Communities,” Engaging Cities, 5-12, http://engagingcities.com/article/establishing-creative-strategies-effective-engagement-between-military-installations-communi)

Throughout the Nation’s history, military installations and ranges were historically established in undeveloped areas AND open, strong relationship in which those nexuses can be explored is key.

**Locals will say yes, but absent consultation, civilian populations will fear military encroachment – that destroys military readiness and causes base closing TURNS THE CASE**
**Savage 10** (Melissa, tracks military base issues for NCSL, “Lawmakers are looking for ways to resolve land-use conflicts between civilian communities and military bases,” National Conference of State Legislatures, March, http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/env-res/making-peace-article.aspx)

**Second Net Benefit – Colonialism**

**Sovreignty should be axiomatic—selectively ignoring natives enables nuclear colonialism**
**Endres 2009** - Assistant Professor of Communication at the University of Utah (Danielle, “The Rhetoric of Nuclear Colonialism: Rhetorical Exclusion of American Indian Arguments in the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Siting Decision,” Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies. Vol. 6, No. 1, March 2009, pp. 39_60)

Nuclear Colonialism as a Discursive Phenomenon Although the material implications of nuclear colonialism are AND to colonization through a constitutive redefinition of sovereignty that supersedes the political definition.

===2NC Net Benefit Overview=== 

**Specifically US gets kicked out of guam**
**Natividad 10** (Lisa Linda, Assistant Professor with the Division of Social Work at the University of Guam and President of the Guahan Coalition for Peace and Justice, “The Explosive Growth of U.S. Military Power on Guam Confronts People Power: Experience of an island people under Spanish, Japanese and American colonial rule,” Asia-Pacific Journal, 49(3), 12-6, http://www.japanfocus.org/-Victoria_Lola_Leon-Guerrero/3454)

While the Department of Defense had been orchestrating the build-up for years, AND to read 11,000 pages spread across nine volumes and provide comments.

**Guam is a critical starting point for rejecting imperialism**
**Campaign for Liberty, 10** ("Guam Resisting American Imperialism," March 22, http://www.campaignforliberty.com/blog.php?view=33850)

"Guam was not consulted in the decision to move 8,000 Marines -- AND or occupations in any foreign nation or territory. Bring our troops Home!



==Cost Control CP== 
===1NC=== 

**Text: If and only if the program cost of <Program> does not exceed initial cost estimates by 10 percent or more before completion of investment, the United States federal government should <PLAN>. The United States federal government should require a specific program guideline based on benefit /cost analysis of funding priorities from grant recipients. If the recipients do not comply, or the program exceeds cost estimates < the program> should be terminated.**

**Cost threshold needs to be established BEFORE implementation. Prior Key.**
**Puentes 08** (Robert, Senior Fellow Brookings Institute, “A Bridge to Somewhere Rethinking American Transportation For The 21st Century,” [[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2008/6/transportation%20puentes/06_transportation_puentes_report.pdf]])

Lostin the dominant discussion about how much money we are spending on the federal AND meaningful process and direct loss of federal funds should be a genuine consequence.

**Absent CP – Cost overruns and waste is inevitable**
**De Rugy and Mitchell 11** (Veronique de Rugy, Senior Research Fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, former resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, policy analyst at the Cato Institute, and research fellow at the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, holds an M.A. in Economics from the University of Paris IX-Dauphine and a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Paris Pantheon-Sorbonne, and Matthew Mitchell, Senior Research Fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, holds an M.A. and Ph.D. in Economics from George Mason University, 2011 “Would More Infrastructure Spending Stimulate the Economy?,” Mercatus Center Working Paper Number 11-36, September, http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/publication/infrastructure_deRugy_WP_9-12-11.pdf, p. 6)

In response, the president has announced a plan for yet more deficit-financed AND -term gamble with near-certain negative consequences in the long term.

**Collapses competitiveness**
**Puentes 08** (Robert, Senior Fellow Brookings Institute, “A Bridge to Somewhere Rethinking American Transportation For The 21st Century,” [[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2008/6/transportation%20puentes/06_transportation_puentes_report.pdf]])

Right now, federal transportation decisionmaking is misaligned with the geographic realities of travel patterns AND the U.S. economy, our cities, and our families.

**Great Power War**
**Baru 09** Sanjaya is a Visiting Professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore Geopolitical Implications of the Current Global Financial Crisis, Strategic Analysis, Volume 33, Issue 2 March 2009 , pages 163 – 168

Hence, economic policies and performance do have strategic consequences.2 In the modern AND they will do so once again in today's America remains to be seen.

===2NC Overview=== 

**That results in lack of accountability and partner pullout which we all know is terrible ZING – collapses the investment.**
**Flyvbjerg 10** (Bent, Professor of Major Programme Management at [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University|Oxford University]]'s [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%C3%AFd_Business_School|Saïd Business School]] and is Founding Director of the University's BT Centre for Major Programme Management.

In the introduction to this article, I mentioned that current spending on infrastructure constitutes AND began reducing its infrastructure portfolio in 2009, moving into energy instead.

====**2NC Theory**==== 

**Circle, Star, Flag this card—the process matters more than the product**
**Puentes 08** (Robert, Senior Fellow Brookings Institute, “A Bridge to Somewhere Rethinking American Transportation For The 21st Century,” [[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2008/6/transportation%20puentes/06_transportation_puentes_report.pdf]])

4. FUNDING FOR THE FEDERAL PROGRAM— BOTH FUNDING LEVELS AND SOURCES— SHOULD (AND) the three-pronged strategy to lead, empower, and maximize performance.

**Lit base checks abuse—proves the counterplan is predictable and core of the topic. Proves there’s no unique DA to the CP – core of the topic**
**Watts 99** Ronald, Principal Emeritus and Professor Emeritus of Political Studies and Fellow of the Institute of Intergovernmental Relations at Queen's University, “The Spending in Federal Systems: A Comparative Study”, [[http://www.queensu.ca/iigr/pub/archive/books/Thefederalspendingpower-acomparativestudy-Watts.pdf]]

Nature and extent of the use of the federal spending power. The federal government AND have been directed at the states and local governments as recipients.1*


==Disability Conditions CP== 

===1NC=== 

**Text: The United States federal government should provide substantial transportation infrastructure investment in the United States if and only if it provides accessible mobility.**

**This obsession with mobility within transportation infrastructure is uniquely entrenched in ableism that causes social exclusion**
**Imrie 2k** (Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London Rob Disability and discourses of mobility and movement Environment and Planning volume 32 http://www.environmentandplanning.com/epa/fulltext/a32/a331.pdf)

Barnes et al (1999, page 121), for instance, note that UK AND of mobility as ``a messy, unpredictable, diverse and changeable reality''.

**The impact is Eugenic Violence**
**Elden, 2002** (Stuart, Professor of Politics at the University Warwick, Boundary 2, 29.2)

The reverse side is the power to allow death. State racism is a recoding AND men to be killed. (VS, 180; WK, 136)


===2NC=== 
====Overview==== 

**Removed disabled populations from society by denying them of their mobility**
**AAPD, 2012** (The American Association of People With Disabilities, “Equity in Transportation for People with Disabilities”, May 23, http://www.infrastructureusa.org/equity-in-transportation-for-people-with-disabilities/)

Transportation and mobility play key roles in the struggle for civil rights and equal opportunity AND on accessible taxis, a lack of requirements has meant very uneven progress.

**Their entire strategy is based on an overly rational bureaucracy that enables mass violence against disabled populations in the first place**
**Hughes, 2002** (Bill, Glasgow Caledonian University, School of Social Science, Bauman's Strangers, Disability & Society, Vol. 17 No. 5, p. 571-584, EBSCO)

Bureaucracy is ultra-rational, driven to embrace the abnormally normal. It makes AND ferocity of an ultimate recalcitrance to … violent “utopian” solutions.’

**Phyiscal obstacles are the most important thing**
**Imrie 2k** (Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London Rob Disability and discourses of mobility and movement Environment and Planning volume 32 http://www.environmentandplanning.com/epa/fulltext/a32/a331.pdf)

Mobility and movement are core to people's identities, life experiences, and opportunities. AND for challenging the hegemonic discourses of the body, mobility, and movement.

====CP Prior==== 

**Aesthetic judgments against PWDs order and give meaning to our understanding of class, race, and sex – CP is a pre-requisite to the plan**
**Siebers 10** - (Disability Aesthetics” Tom Siebers, Tobin, Prof of Literary and Cultural Criticism at the U of Michigan, 2010)

Oppression is the systematic victimization of one group by another. It is a form AND Disability represents at this moment in time the final frontier of justifiable human inferiority

====Competition==== 

**If we win our CP solves, it access their moral framework. That means you default to cost-benefit analysis—even prominent deontologists concede this**
**Finnish 80** (John Finnis, deontologist, teaches jurisprudence and constitutional Law. He has been Professor of Law & Legal Philosophy since 1989,1980, Natural Law and Natural Rights, pg. 111-2 )

The sixth requirement has obvious connections with the fifth, but introduces a new range AND or society to seek o maximize the satisfaction of those preferences or wants.

**Ethics are inherently situational. We are forced to make hard choices because we have finite resources and political capabilities. Ethics makes us push the blame onto others to maintain the purity of our intentions instead of taking responsibility**
**Chandler 01** – Policy Research Institute @ Leeds Metropolitan University (David, Human Rights Quarterly 23, “The Road to Military Humanitarianism”)

When intervening for ethical ends there is little pressure to account for final policy outcomes AND view of intervention in the face of exaggerated fears of non-intervention.


==Occularcentrism PIC== 
===1NC=== 

**The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States through passive radio-frequency identification for integrated in-transit openness.**

**Visual metaphors are ableist and should be rejected**
**Hibbits 94** Professor Bernard J. Hibbitts, professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, 1994 Making Sense of Metaphors Visuality, Aurality, And The Reconfiguration of American Legal Discourse http://faculty.law.pitt.edu/hibbitts/meta_p2.htm

Visuality penetrates our very language. We routinely rely on visual metaphors to communicate understanding AND such as the deaf)69 whose identities have been less visually defined.

**The impact is eugenics**
**Wilson, 2006** (Daniel J., Cultural Locations of Disability, October 8)

In two chapters on the eugenics movement, Snyder and Mitchell ‘analyze eugenics is AND medicine have considered disability as abnormal and in need of repair or elimination.
