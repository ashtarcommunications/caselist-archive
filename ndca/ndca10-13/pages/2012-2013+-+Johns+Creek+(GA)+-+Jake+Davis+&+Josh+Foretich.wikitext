<span class="Heading3CharCharChar">Their depiction of United States “benevolent hegemony” is massively ignorant of history and legitimizes the third American holocaust. Extension of hegemony promotes a framework of American universal history which terminates the being of all others. </span>

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">AND - There are two models for public intellectuals: We can either emulate expert pundits like Kagan who aim their advice at centers of power or we can be intellectuals like Chomsky- exposing lies and providing the toolkit needed to mobilize for change – this is the role of the ballot</span>

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Our alternative is not a fiated advocacy to be implemented by policy elites, but a way to lay bare the lies and propaganda advanced by the 1ac, which is an ethically superior approach that provides ordinary citizens with the agency to pursue alternatives.</span>
