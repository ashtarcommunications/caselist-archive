**Security discourse is performative, not natural. The rhetoric of impending risk is used to ensure astonishing violence – whole populations are eliminated in the name of stability**
David <span style="font-size: 16px;">Campbell</span>**,** professor of international politics at the University of Newcastle. Writing Security, 19<span style="font-size: 16px;">98</span>, p. 199 – 202
<span class="DebateUnderline">Security and subjectivity are intrinsically linked</span>, even....: "The police's true object is man."

**Militarism fundamentally shifted with the development of open ended wars with nuclear weapons- the drive towards war as a natural extension of policy is an outdated mode of thought that can only end in extinction**
Istavan <span style="font-size: 16px;">Mezaros</span>, not a fan of capitalism, 20<span style="font-size: 16px;">03</span>, “Militarism and the coming wars”
It is not for the first time in....Hitler's irrationality look like the model of rationality.

**Alternative: Reject the affirmative's construction of space development**

**This is critical to challenge violent outer space politics**
<span style="font-size: 16px;">MacDonald 2007 </span>Fraser MacDonald Lecturer in Human Geography at U of Melbourne 2007 Fraser Progress in Human Geography [[http://www.landfood.unimelb.edu.au/rmg/geography/papers/anti-outerspace.pdf]]
Astrography and astropolitics, like geography and geopolitics....state and to the lives of its citizenry.

**The threat of asteroids gives privilege to the military-science complex that places it in the role of unquestionable hero. This applies militaristic spatialization to the galaxy in an attempt to control the uncontrollable. This sparks a disciplinary attempt to control the global population in the name of planetary survival.**
Felicity <span style="font-size: 16px;">Mellor</span>, Lecturer in Science Communication at Imperial College London, research interests include the popularization of physics, the representation of science in the media, and the role of narrative within science, 20<span style="font-size: 16px;">07</span>, “Colliding Worlds : Asteroid Research and the Legitimization of War in Space” Social Studies of Science 2007 37: 499, sagepub
//The asteroid impact threat was thus articulated within....into ploughshares’ (quoted in Matthews, 1997).//

//**The aff creates fear of militarized asteroids to justify continued development of space based weapons**//

The asteroid impact threat offered a scientifically validated....now at the centre of US defense policy.

===Observation 1NC=== 
**The plan establishes a regime of biopolitical control- The military and surveillance applications rooted in the affirmative turn the population in to passive conformists**
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Dickens and Omrod ’07</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"> (Peter Dickens, Fellow of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, University of Cambridge, UK and Visiting Professor of Sociology, University of Essex, UK, and James S.

<span style="font-size: 16px;">There are two mechanisms through which the majority ....explosion, play on this kind of sentiment.</span>

**This extension of state control over individual life legitimizes racism and the annihilation of entire populations with mass genocides and nuclear weapons**
Mitchell <span style="font-size: 16px;">Dean</span>, 200<span style="font-size: 16px;">1</span> (Professor of Sociology at Macquarie University, “Demonic Societies: Liberalism, Biopolitics, and Sovereignty”, Ethnographic Explorations of the Postcolonial State, p. 55-58)
Consider again the contrastive terms in which it <span class="UnderlineChar">....the functioning of the modern state</span> (232).

**Our alternative is to assume the role of specific intellectuals within the round by rejecting the notion of disciplinary power. Only by constant problematization of the way the affirmative harnesses governmentality can we open up a new space of contestation.**
David <span style="font-size: 16px;">Owen</span>, 19<span style="font-size: 16px;">94</span> (Professor of Social and Political Philosophy at University of Southampton, Morality and Modernity, p. 208-210)
The ‘universal’ intellectual, on Foucault’s account....the contestation of determinations of who we are.

**<span style="color: #000000;">Not engaging the underlying problematizations behind their assumptions makes serial policy failure inevitable</span>**
