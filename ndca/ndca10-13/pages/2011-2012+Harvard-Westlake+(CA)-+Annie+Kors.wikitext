**OBSERVATION ONE:** I will defend the resolution as a general principle, but I am open to alternate interpretations. If the NEG would like me to defend something else, they can ask me to do so in CX.

**OBSERVATION TWO IS FRAMEWORK:** <span style="color: #000000;">I value **justice.** T</span>he nature of our relationships with and obligations towards others form the basis of the requirements of justice.

<span style="color: #000000;">Previous philosophical theories try to distill justice into a single principle that is to be applied to all situations. For example, Kantian ethics establishes human dignity or reflective practical reason as the basis for all ethical reasoning. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Other agents cease to be unique entities that exist independently of ourselves because all knowledge is said to stem from //our// systemic procedures for ethics. </span>

**<span style="color: #000000;">However,</span>**<span style="color: #000000;"> a sound basis for ethics requires a coherent understanding of the other. Failure to recognize and identify with that which is not us prevents us from constructing ourselves as autonomous beings.</span>

**<span style="color: #000000;">Thus</span>**<span style="color: #000000;">, our self-awareness can only arise through our encounter with the Other. Without the capacity to distinguish that which is in our control from that which is not, the external world would appear to be governed by our will so we could not distinguish our own autonomous action from the decisions of the other. This makes it impossible to concpetualize our autonomy. </span>

Thus we must respect the other.

**<span style="color: #000000;">First</span>**<span style="color: #000000;">, any coherent conception of ethics arises out of respect for the other. Discussion that precedes a response to the other is internally self-defeating because it tries to attribute characteristics to the other before encountering the other,s. This also allows us to exclude anything outside of our defined interpretation of what the other is. </span>

**<span style="color: #000000;">Second</span>**<span style="color: #000000;">, ethics must accept others because we can never fully understand them. When we encounter the other, it has an independent perspective that eludes my understanding so we have no choice but to respect its otherness</span>

====<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 1.066em;">Genocide AC</span>==== 



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The value is **morality** as implied by the resolution.</span>







<span style="color: black; display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">Moral statements are simply an expression of a state of mind and cannot amount to any more than that</span>
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">. </span>****<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Gibbard[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn1|[1]]] </span>**</span>






<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Such an analysis might be called "expressivistic." ….to accept permits.</span>







<span style="font-family: Calibri;">This means that </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">the function of</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> moral statements is not meant to express true or false claims, but instead serve the purpose of expressing our preferences and providing a medium through which to reconcile them. </span>**<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">Blackburn</span>**<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn2|[2]]]</span>







<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7.5pt;">Obviously many …</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;"> propositional judgment is //for//. </span>





<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Prefer</span>**</span>
<span style="display: block; font-family: Calibri; text-align: justify;">this ethical interpretation for three reasons.</span>




**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">First,</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> all other accounts of ethics are subject to infinitely regressive justification. I can always ask why is this system of ethics is good or why one metaethic should be preferred over another. Only characterizing our moral judgments in terms of expressing our beliefs can we escape it. </span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Railton et al[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn3|[3]]]</span>**



<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Moore had discovered ….</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> R really is good. </span>__**



**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Railton et al.</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> continues on how characterizing morality in terms of simply an expression of attitude we can escape this issue because this system of ethics does not require this demand.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Wittgenstein, for one, …presence of conflicting interests.</span>



**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Second</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">, there is no faculty which perceives moral facts in the physical world. **Mackie[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn4|[4]]]**</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Even more important, however, …. objectivist is compelled to resort.</span>





**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Indeed,</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> the idea that something could ‘exist’ in a non-physical sense is absurd. </span>**<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">Ayer</span>**<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn5|[5]]]</span>







<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">A similar mistake has been … exposed in the same way.</span>







**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">Third, </span>**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">we cannot rationally justify all of our beliefs. Asking us to do so is an impossible demand and asks the wrong question. **Keller[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn6|[6]]]** explains that strong rationalism fails both because it undermines its own legitimacy and requires a “view from no-where” to objectively determine facts.</span>







<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Is there anything …</span>**__<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;"> would have to bow to.</span>__**







**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">Therefore,</span>**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;"> the affirmative advocacy is that </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">there are expressed norms that individuals ought to take action to prevent genocide and assist those in danger of genocide. </span>







<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thus,</span><span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;"> Genocide is recognized as an international evil that must prevented at all costs. </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Even the word genocide was created to signal a new evil that transcends all other forms of evil. **Power[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn7|[7]]]**</span>



**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">In 1948 …</span>__****__<span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Calibri;"> "hierarchy of horribles.”</span>__**



**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">And,</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> citizens of the United States uniquely have an obligation to prevent and fight genocide as there is cultural revulsion to genocide. **Power 2[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn8|[8]]]**</span>



**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The United States </span>__**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">…</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Clinton said it. </span>__**



**<span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Calibri;">Indeed,</span>**<span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Calibri;"> we should not mistake inaction for compliancy with genocide. Most people would have preferred that America had taken action against Genocide.</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Power 3[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn9|[9]]]</span>**



<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">But this does not explain …</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">in both places. </span>__**

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">I </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">value **morality** as implied by the resolution</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Morality must be based in humanity’s conception of moral personhood. Without doing so, we could never bridge the ought-ought gap, meaning that people don’t have a reason that they ought to do what they are compelled to do by morality. **Strom[[home#_ftn1|**[1]**]]**</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Now, the ―ought-ought… about good people.</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Just because people act as though they ought to be selfish, or ought to harm others doesn’t meant this fulfills the ought-ought gap. </span>**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">CS Lewis[[home#_ftn2|**[2]**]]</span>**
**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">If you take a</span>__**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">…</span>**__<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;"> to behave differently.</span>__**

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Instead, **Velleman**</span>[[home#_ftn3|****[3]****]]<span style="font-family: Calibri;">explains how people act in accordance with the way they perceive themselves. </span>

**__<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">A human</span>__**<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">being</span>**__<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">’s</span>__****__<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">…</span>__**<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">label “act identification.”</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Humans derive their reasons for acting from their unique perspective and their ability to separate their instincts from reason. **Korsgaard[[home#_ftn4|**[4]**]]**</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">But </span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">the human …</span>__**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;"> it cannot commit itself or go forward.</span>

**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">And, Velleman 2[[home#_ftn5|**[5]**]]</span>**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;"> explains why questioning the authority of reasons just purports its own significance.</span>

<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">As we have seen, … a reason to act for reasons. </span>

**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">And,</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> as rational agents, which seek justification for all actions, the moral rules we determine for ourselves are universal. **Engstrom[[home#_ftn6|**[6]**]]**</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">As we saw,</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">rational …</span>__**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;"> of the //we// of practical knowledge. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thus the standard is **consistency with universal maxims**</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">All humans set ends for themselves, as the very nature of being a person requires us to seek out certain end states. **Engstrom 2[[home#_ftn7|**[7]**]]**</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Is there anything … out through its specification.</span>
**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thus,</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> since we all have our own ends and desires, willing that people help you achieve those ends means that you necessarily must also help others achieve their own ends. **Engstrom 3[[home#_ftn8|**[8]**]]**</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Kant explains how …would need assistance. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thus, willing that others will help you means that you must necessarily help others. If I only helped others when it was beneficial to me, then this would contradict the universal maxim that people help me whenever I need help.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Engstrom 4[[home#_ftn9|**[9]**]] </span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">continues how living in pursuit of your own happiness ultimately leads to a contradiction in universal maxim, even if pursuing your own happiness is bound by not harming others.</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">With these …</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> but not his. </span>__**
**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Indeed, </span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">rational agents cannot will a maxim of non-beneficence because we all require assistance. However, this duty is not couched in any pity or compassion felt for the other person, the duty is based on simply a contradiction in universal maxim regardless of emotions. **Wood[[home#_ftn10|**[10]**]]**</span>

<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">The value is morality as implied by the resolution.</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The only place in which a moral obligation could actually be derived from is reason.

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">C1. Kantianism does not derive rights or moral laws because it relies on morality being self-legislating. This type of ethics relies on us giving reasons to ourselves for our moral rules. **However,** self-legislation cannot actually provide moral rules as there is no absolute authority in giving a law to oneself.**Ridely and Alvarez[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn2|[2]]]**</span>

**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Black’s law</span>****<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> dictionary[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn1|[1]]] </span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">defines permissible as:</span>


**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Allowed; … may be done</span>__**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">. </span>




<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The US Model Penal Code[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn2|[2]]] defines deadly force as:</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">"**__Force that the …serious bodily injury.__**" </span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Morality is characterized by the social contract. Moral uncertainty and moral disagreement lead to violence within the state of nature, which is irresolvable.</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Renzo[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn3|[3]]]</span>**



<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">As Gregory Kavka has persuasively …</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">the state of nature.</span>__**

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thus, to escape this violence in the state of nature, we form a social contract to protect ourselves and everyone must give power to a centralized government. **Hobbes[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn4|[4]]]**</span>

<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Lastly**__,__**</span>**__<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;"> the agreement …</span>__**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">besides, his SUBJECT.</span>



**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">However, </span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">the agreed upon social norms cannot apply in all situations. The government does not have the ability to respond to all situations. Such imminent situations call for self-defense. **Gauthier[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn5|[5]]]**</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Now I think Fletcher …</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">protection of the law.</span>__**


**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Indeed,</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> an individual may never give up the means to self-preservation as it is the very foundation of the social contract in the first place. **Hobbes**</span>



**__<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">Not All Rights …</span>__**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">were to be interpreted.</span>



**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thus, </span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">the affirmative burden is to prove that domestic violence is immanent while the negative must prove that it is not.</span>



**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Further, prefer this ethical interpretation for two more reasons</span>**



**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">First,</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> Only a system of ethics which correlates to the desires of actual people has legitimacy since having a reason necessarily entails that you have a concern or desire relating to that reason in the first place. **Goldman[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn6|[6]]]**</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">All internalists about</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">…</span>__**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">defense it can offer.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Second</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">, only a system in which actors come together and agree upon a social contract makes sense. Actors need to be motivated themselves to form maxims, they cannot just conform to the moral law that exists independent of the agreements they make. **<span style="color: black;">Zupančič[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn7|[7]]]</span>**</span>



<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">What is inadmissible is ….achieves its determination</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">. </span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The my sole contention is that victims of domestic abuse have no other option than resorting to deadly force.</span>



<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">A) **Domestic Violence is not effectively prevented by the state**</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The government is ineffective at protecting victims from their abusers. Even if the victim manages to secure a restraining order their safety is far from certain. **Burke**</span>[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn8|**[8]**]]**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">:</span>**



<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Even if someone does …</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> no safe options.</span>__**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">249</span>



<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">This belief is supported empirically. Victims who try to leave their abusers are much more likely to be murdered. </span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Buel</span>**[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn9|**[9]**]]**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">:</span>**

<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">B) **Psychological barriers**</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The psychological violence done against spouses creates an image of themselves in which they have nowhere to run. It seems violence could erupt again at any moment. **The Supreme Court of Kansas in State v. Hundley[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn10|[10]]]**</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Wife beating is steeped …</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> from the torture.</span>__**

<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">Victims often believe their abuser when they promise that they will change.

===<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 9pt;">Evolution AC</span>=== 


<span style="font-family: Calibri;">value is morality</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Inquiring about the nature of the good life for the moral subject is the only way to circumvent the is-ought fallacy that plagues rationalistic moral theory. Alasdair MacIntyre:</span>



Alasdair MacIntyre [Emeritus Prof. of Philosophy, University of Notre Dame], After Virtue, 3rd Edition, Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press (2007), p. 56-59



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Some later moral… a functional concept.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thus the resolution asks what principle is most salient to our moral identities.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">This means the only constant about what constitutes a “good” human is one that seeks self-preservation. West</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">http://www.discovery.org/a/9541. Discovery Institute — Center for Science and Culture. “DOES DARWINISM SUPPORT TRADITIONAL MORALITY?.” May 1, 2009.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">However, before one…. as morally blameworthy.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">My only burden is to demonstrate that deadly force is justified as self-defense against repeated abuse.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">self-preservation is the basis of ethics.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">First, there is no faculty that perceives moral facts in the physical world. Mackie</span>



<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">J.L Mackie. Ethics Inventing Right and Wrong Chapter 1 “The subjectivity of Values”. Page 38.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Even more important… compelled to resort.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">All ethical codes and systems can be explained by evolutionary mechanism. Rauscher</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">“How a Kantian Can Accept Evolutionary Metaethics.” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.springerlink.com/content/?Author=FREDERICK+RAUSCHER|FREDERICK RAUSCHER]]</span>. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.springerlink.com/content/0169-3867/|BIOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY]]</span>. 1996. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.springerlink.com/content/0169-3867/12/3/|Volume 12, Number 3]]</span>, 303-326.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The fourth application… mechanisms and behaviors.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">This means that the only reason that humans make arguments for ethics and believe them is because evolution has caused them to and ethics does not exist independent of that.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Second, only evolutionary theory explains the structure of justifications.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ratner explains how all justification traces back to evolutionary theory and analyzes the structure of human justification.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Leonard G. Ratner, “THE UTILITARIAN IMPERATIVE: AUTONOMY, RECIPROCITY, AND EVOLUTION,” Hofstra Law Review (Spring, 1984)--Legion Lex Professor of Law, University of Southern California Law Center.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The process thus… or future survival.</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">I contend that using deadly force best solves for domestic violence and promotes the survival of the victim.</span>



<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">A) Risk Of Death: </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Silent Witness National Initiative provides statistics on the number of victims killed by domestic abuse.</span>


<span style="font-family: Calibri;">http://www.silentwitness.net/sub/violences.htm. 2006.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Female murder victims… and aggravated assaults.</span>


<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">B) Domestic Violence is not effectively prevented by the state</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Cohen provides 5 warrants for why the criminal justice system fails to stop domestic violence</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Jane Maslow Cohen [Professor of Law, Boston University School of Law].</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">It is not difficult… means of escape.</span>



<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">C) Running away does not solve the problem. This belief is supported empirically. Victims who try to leave their abusers are much more likely to be murdered. </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Buel</span>



<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">Sarah M. Buel [co-founder of the University of Texas Voices Against Violence co-founded the interdisciplinary University of Texas Institute on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. She is the faculty supervisor for the Survivor Support Network (SSN) and the student group, Society Encouraging Excellence Through Diversity (SEED)</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">, American Attorney</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">] “Fifty Obstacles to Leaving, a.k.a., Why Abuse Victims Stay” AK</span>



<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">The victim be- lieves… tensive safety planning</span>



<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Johnson further supports Buel with multiple other studies and provides analytic warrants.</span>

===NET BENEFITS AC=== 

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">I affirm and value **morality** as implied by the resolution.</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">I will defend the resolution as a general principle, but if the neg wants a different interpretation they can ask in CX and I will either concede to the interpretation or concede to the Violation on T.</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">We cannot use rationality to justify all of our beliefs. Asking us to do so is an impossible demand and asks the wrong question. **Keller[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn1|[1]]]** explains that strong rationalism fails both because it undermines its own legitimacy and requires a “view from no-where” to objectively determine facts.</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Is there anything wrong …have to</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> bow to.</span>__</span>**



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Indeed, </span></span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">to argue that justifications for ethics ought to be based upon rationality or emotions or intuitions is regressive. </span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">In the wake of the Holocaust, “never again” serves as a rallying cry, which should pervade our moral theories. **Glover**[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn2|[2]]]</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Not all sceptics about … pattern of failure.</span>



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Therefore,</span></span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;"> only a system of net benefits can condemn the actions of those who commit atrocities, and allow for action to prevent these atrocities. </span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Thus the standard is **net benefits.**</span>



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Contention 1 </span></span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">is the direct impact of domestic violence on victims.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">A) is death- The Silent Witness National Initiative[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn3|[3]]]</span></span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;"> provides statistics on the number of victims killed by domestic abuse.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Further,</span></span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;"> harms to the victim outweigh harms to the abuser. </span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Herman[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn4|[4]]] </span></span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">warrants that killing someone who intends to harm simply reaffirms human-worth.</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">This same fact blocks …</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">of self-respect.</span>__</span>**



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">B)</span></span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;"> Victims are subject to constant abuse and fear of violence in abusive relationships. Women describe the psychological abuse of domestic violence to be worse than the physical abuse that they endure. </span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Leonard[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn5|[5]]]</span></span>**



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Even more hidden than …. crime under current statutes.</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">This dehumanization outweighs any other impact. **Butler**[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn6|[6]]]:</span>


<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Lives are supported …. a life that qualifies for recognition.</span>


<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Deadly force can be used as a last option for victims. Victims can try all the options that the neg wants to bring up and then use deadly force; it is still a permissible option. I dare you to run a counterplan; I will perm it. My advantages are not based on deadly force being the only option.</span>



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Contention 2</span></span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;"> is patriarchy.</span>


<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Patriarchy and societal subjugation of women is the cause of crimes against women. **MacKinnon[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn7|[7]]]**</span>




<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">So what is meant by treatment “…the name of a way of being human.”</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Further, </span>**</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">patriarchy and such conceptions of women perpetuate domestic violence. **Johnson[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn8|[8]]]**</span>


<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">Another indicator …</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> to gender attitudes</span>__</span>**



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">However,</span></span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">domestic violence victims who kill their abusers are acting to defy those who define them into specific gender roles. **Taylor**[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn9|[9]]]</span>



<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Homicides by women</span>__**</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">, …..: the right to physical safety.</span>



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">AND,</span></span>**



<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">Making deadly force morally permissible uproots such norms meaning affirming stops one of the root causes of domestic violence. </span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ayyildiz[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn10|[10]]]</span></span>**





<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt;">BWS is but one moderate ….</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">__<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> and empowerment.</span>__</span>**



**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Contention 3 </span></span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Calibri;">is long term prevention of domestic violence. Making deadly force permissible deters abusers from attacking victims. **Zipursky[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn11|[11]]]** </span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">I negate</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The resolution asks if the use of deadly force is morally permissible. This is a question about the legitimacy of an action not about the responsibility of the actor. </span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">I value **morality** as implied by the resolution. </span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Value judgments of an action cannot be separated from the subjective perspective from which it is taken. **Nagel**[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn1|[1]]] </span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thus we must maintain a consistency between our objective and subjective perspectives on the world in order to have a consistent and logically sound perspective.
