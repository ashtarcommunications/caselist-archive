__**Affirmative**__ - India-Cooperation

**The history of American space exploration is filled with fiery political rhetoric that calls on our ‘frontiersman’ roots to promote feelings of adventurism in the name of getting there first. Since Kennedy, we’ve called on our nationalistic roots to restore American confidence; beating the enemy to space, comprehending, mastering it first. This Cold War era mentality has far from left us and we still view space exploration through a lens of the ‘new sea’ and just like that frontier, it must be mastered**

**This American, ‘frontier’ mentality has divided the world into the sacred and the profane, the Good and the Evil.

**Thus, we affirm the resolution from a different standpoint. Our affirmation that the United States federal government should substantially increase its exploration of space beyond the Earth’s mesosphere comes from not a collective national identity, but from a collection of counter-memories.
