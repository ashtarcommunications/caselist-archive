__A Demand by a Host Nation for the Withdrawal of US Nuclear Forces__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is possible that </span>__a NATO host nation might demand the withdrawal of the US nuclear forces stationed on its territory__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The Greek precedent would prevent other NATO members from asserting that</span> __such a withdrawal would__ <span style="font-size: 6pt;">necessarily</span> __lead to an unravelling of the whole nuclear-sharing arrangement__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__Such a demand would in all likelihood be 95 driven by domestic political and “sovereignty” considerations__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. (Some </span>__European political leaders have called for the withdrawal of US weapons in recent years, and public opinion in host countries tends to have negative views of this nuclear presence.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span>__) The deployment of missile defences in Europe__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> may be </span>__used as an argument to claim that such a presence is no longer necessary__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__In such a scenario, **NATO would**have to **consider that there could then be a “domino effect” and that other nations would follow suit –** especially if the initial demand was made publicly, as it probably would be if it was driven by domestic political considerations.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is also the possibility that one or several NATO nations might refuse to give a nuclear role to the</span>__Eurofighter (Typhoon) aircraft, which is due to be the successor to the F-16 in several NATO nations. **This might be for such countries a “soft” way to put an end to their nuclearsharing role,** even though US nuclear forces could remain on the territory of some European countries for US use.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (</span>__NATO is believed to currently maintain[ing] US nuclear weapons dedicated to US use in__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">four countries: </span>__Germany____,__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Italy,</span>__Turkey__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">and the United Kingdom.

The bulk of the (still very small) arsenals of the latter two consist of short and intermediate range weapons, which are apparently not permanently equipped with nuclear warheads.

//<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Some analysts view this outcome as necessary, because Russia possesses so many more of these weapons than the United States, but</span> __Russia__ __may be unwilling to agree to such limits without similar restraints on U.S. weapons.

//__As part of the current NATO deliberation, there have been proposals to increase the number of U.S. nuclear weapons stored in Turkey__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as part of an alliance-wide consolidation of NATO’s TNW arsenal. Some</span>__proponents of retaining NATO’s nuclear-sharing arrangements favor removing them from those European countries that no longer want them on their soil and relocating them into__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">those countries that do, which might only include</span>__Turkey__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">and perhaps Italy</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 4pt;">If NATO withdrew U.S. TNW from all other European countries, the Turkish government could find it uncomfortable remaining the only NATO nuclear-hosting state, and might request their removal from its territory as well. But then Turkey might proceed to develop an independent nuclear deterrent in any case for the reasons described above. CONCLUSIONS: The Obama administration’s decision to deploy U.S. missile defenses more closely to Turkey—and thereby ensure its protection from an Iranian nuclear attack—should help assuage Turkish concerns. But the most profitable non-proliferation tool in Turkey’s case would be to assure Turks that they will play an essential role in NATO’s security policies and that their preferences will have a major impact in shaping the alliance’s nuclear policies. Insofar as some</span> __members of Turkey’s security community are still concerned by Russia’s__ <span style="font-size: 6pt;">nearby nuclear and conventional security forces</span>__, then NATO initiatives aimed at linking any withdrawal of U.S. TNW from Turkey would__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">presumably</span> __be welcome in Ankara. The recently concluded New START Treaty does not address TNWs__, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">but negotiations between Russia and NATO might be warranted, with some level of Turkish participation.</span>//

//<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In Europe,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> __after__ </span>__the accession to NATO of the Baltic States, the problem of tactical nuclear weapons control became__ __more acute__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The buffer that separated Russia from NATO disappeared;</span>__territories of NATO member-states surrounded the Kaliningrad region__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">. __Also, the Baltic States are located in close proximity to both Russian capita__ls, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Moscow and, in particular, St. Petersburg</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span>__The narrow depth of defence, an extremely short missile__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">and strike aircraft</span>__flight time__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, if they are placed in Latvia and Estonia,</span>**__and a__** **__most serious overall imbalance benefiting NATO in terms of conventional arms and forces, cannot but attract Russia’s attention to tactical nuclear weapons as a means for neutralising Western superiority__****__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">,</span>__**<span style="font-size: 6pt;">both quantitative and operational. It must however be emphasised that so far, </span>__the NATO__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">eastward </span>__enlargement__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">has not been accompanied by the deployment of nuclear weapons and their most destabilising delivery means to the territories of new member states of the Alliance. So far Brussels has on the whole observed </span>**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">the provision of the Russia–NATO Founding Act, signed in 1997, which contains a clear obligation in the provision that the Alliance does not intend to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of the new member countries. This his</span>****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">document is not legally binding but its political importance makes obvious violation of its provisions difficult. However, in 2006 the Bush Administration</span>****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">announced its plans for deploying</span>__****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">by 2011 its</span>****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">third missile defense area</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">in Poland and the Czech Republic</span>__****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">. </span>****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">That means the relocation of the anti-missile detection radar from Kwajalein to the territory of the</span>****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">Czech</span>****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> Republic</span>****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;"> and also construction of anti-missile silos in Poland, just a few kilometers from the border of the Russian Federation.

The Russian President did not say whether these missiles will be of the nuclear or nonnuclear type.</span>****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;"> Thus, </span>****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the absence of</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">legally-binding </span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">agreements on TNW in Europe</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">, alongside erosion of other international legal regimes for arms limitation, has brought about a real danger of the revival of a nuclear standoff on the European continent as early as the beginning of the next decade. </span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Such developments can be forestalled</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;"> not only by political dialogue about missile defense, but also </span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">thorough control over tactical nuclear weapons</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">.</span>__****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">In the middle of the 1990’s, </span>****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">the USA made it known that, under certain conditions, it was ready to accept legal obligations regarding non-deployment of nuclear weapons on the territory of new NATO member countries</span>__****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">, </span>****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">if Russia agreed to some limitations in turn. In 1997, in the Helsinki Declaration of the results of the Russian–American summit, the parties managed to place on record a provision regarding the start of consultations on limiting tactical nuclear weapons. However, later disagreements over the ABM Treaty did not allow Russia and the USA to make progress in this area. In addition to the Founding Act, deployment of nuclear weapons by the USA in Central and Eastern Europe is made difficult by the PNI and the INF Treaty.

**Scenario 1:**
**TNWs create a use it or lose it mentality --- massively heightens the risk of nuclear war**

**Perkovich 09**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(George, Ph.D., vice president for studies and director of the Nonproliferation Program at the Carnegie Endowment, May 2009, Paper commissioned by the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, Extended Deterrence on the Way to a Nuclear-Free World, p. www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Perkovich_Deterrence.pdf) </span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The discussion thus far relates to visibility and the credibility of extended nuclear deterrence. Stability is another important factor in assessing extended deterrence. Whether in Europe or in East Asia, the argument can be made that</span>__visible deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons on the territory of other states__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">might actually</span>__exacerbate instability in crises. Such forward deployed weapons__ could __provide incentives____(or pressure) for an adversary to strike these weapons early in a conflict to prevent their first use on the adversary__. __This is especially true for land-based nuclear weapons that can be identified and targeted by an adversary. Russia__ presumably __knows the locations of the bunkers that store U.S. bombs dedicated to NATO, as well as the airfields hosting the designated delivery aircraft__. __If and when war appeared imminent or was already underway, Russia could feel pressure to destroy these weapons before they could be used__. __The U.S. and NATO states could correspondingly feel pressure to use these weapons rather than risk losing them__.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This would simultaneously exacerbate crisis instability and debate within NATO which, depending on how it was managed, could enhance or weaken deterrence of escalation</span>. **__The greater the incentives to target such nuclear weapons and/or to use them rather than lose them, the greater the risks of nuclear conflict__**. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yet, the greater risk of nuclear conflict could inspire caution and efforts to end or at least de-escalate the crisis or war. On one hand,</span>__it could be rational early in a conflict for the U.S. to remove vulnerable nuclear weapons to avoid the use them-or-lose them dilemma__. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">But this could weaken deterrence even as it reassured allied states and Russia that nuclear war would not ensue. On</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the other hand, to show resolve and strengthen deterrence, the weapons could be left vulnerable in theater as a trip-wire meant to demonstrate resolve and credibility of nuclear deterrence. Such dilemmas point to the inherent ambiguity and dilemmas of extended nuclear deterrence. In today’s world, where the probabilities are low of large-scale Russian aggression or Iranian nuclear attack against NATO states, or Chinese invasion of Japan or Taiwan</span>__, it is unreasonable not to focus on abating underlying security dilemmas and reducing threats rather than concentrating on strengthening nuclear deterrence.__ If __removal of visible__ and vulnerable __nuclear weapons could contribute to__ broader __improvements in security relations, including arms control and confidence building measures__, relying on invulnerable U.S. strategic submarines for ongoing nuclear deterrence would seem wise. __Broadening the framework of analysis and international dialogue this way deserves greater consideration.__

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">While these actions helped the nuclear superpowers back away from using weapons of mass destruction at a precarious time, it's sobering to note that</span>__the U.S. and Russia are still courting nuclear disaster____<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Despite no longer being strategic foes,</span> __they still maintain thousands of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert--poised for a quick launch.__ __This is a threat that no missile defense system will ever be able to protect us from.

The political scientist told the BNS that with regards to the reasoning afloat from Russia about potential deployment of a nuclear weapon in its Kaliningrad enclave – neighbouring Lithuania and Poland – that “such proposals coming from the experts of cold war are beyond all sensible limits”. The BNS reminded that the</span>__chief of Russian Armed Forces’__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Main Directorate for Combat Training and Service, Vladimir Shamanov </span>__mentioned__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">on 30 January that the Defence Ministry, in view of US plans to create an anti-missile defence system (ADS) in Europe,</span>__plans to adjust the deployment of military blocs in Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave’s special district__.<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Furthermore, Leonid Ivasov, President of the Academy of Geopolitical Issues, appended this statement with a comment to Russia’s news agency Interfax, saying that should the US go through with its plans</span>__, Russia would deploy Iskander operational-tactical missile complexes (OTMC) and a tactical nuclear weapon in Kaliningrad__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">to suit. “If this was a fact,</span>__the Lithuanian state would__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">have to</span>__respond accordingly__,<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> prepare for hazards and at least cut off military provisions to Kaliningrad, which currently have to pass through Lithuanian territory”, said Lopata in an interview to BNS, adding that it is still unknown whether the nuclear weapon that was previously deployed in Kaliningrad has in fact been lifted from there. In the opinion of the political scientist, Russia’s decision to deploy a nuclear weapon in the enclave bordering with Lithuania and Poland would be a completely inadequate reaction on Russia’s part to US plans to deploy an anti-missile radar and a missile silo in Poland. Lopata notes that it is no secret that the US system is not pointed against Russia.

Such a withdrawal could be accompanied by the destruction of relevant storage facilities. But these measures should only be seen as steps toward the total elimination of these types of weapons.

One thing is absolutely clear: The time has come to cover sub-strategic nuclear weapons with an arms control regime, which would look like the one that was established long ago for strategic arms. We still face security challenges in the Europe of today and tomorrow, but from whichever angle you look, there is no role for the use of nuclear weapons in resolving these challenges.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For many years</span> __Moscow____'s position on nonstrategic nuclear weapons has been inflexible and stagnant. And its agreement to begin negotiations__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">on them</span> __has been linked to U.S. acceptance of the idea that nuclear weapons should only be based in national territories--i.e., the withdrawal of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons from Europe__. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Effectively,</span> __Russia__ __is betting that NATO__, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">which is the custodian of the U.S. nuclear weapons stationed in Europe</span>__, will refuse to accept that principle__, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and</span> __therefore__, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">it will</span> __not have to take meaningful measures to address its own nonstrategic weapons. Calling Moscow's bluff could be the key to meaningful progress. If U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons are withdrawn from Europe, it would be hard for Russia to continue stonewalling__. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">While such a step is bound to generate controversy in </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the United States and</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> NATO, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">especially in Eastern Europe, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">it is likely to have little impact on U.S. and alliance security, despite assertions to the contrary. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is little evidence, for example, that Washington would resort to nuclear weapons use, much less nuclear weapons of a tactical variety, if an attack were to occur. Furthermore, nonstrategic nuclear weapons are no longer frontline weapons. In fact, they currently can reach only a few targets in Russia and relocation further east would violate the 1997 NATO-Russia Charter. More importantly, the presence (or absence) of a limited number of U.S. nuclear bombs in Europe can hardly influence the Russian perception of the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence. And if need be, Washington has many other tools of reassurance it can employ--e.g., new missile defenses and extended air patrols, not to mention its vast strategic nuclear arsenal. Ultimately, the question is about the political will of U.S. leaders, not about specific assets. Lastly,</span> __the window of opportunity__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">for using nonstrategic weapons in Europe as a lever</span> __to induce change in the Russian position is narrow.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The dual-capable aircraft that are intended to deliver nonstrategic nuclear weapons are nearing the end of their lifetime. If these systems are allowed to expire, NATO would lose the lever; if they are replaced at high cost, then trading them away would be politically complicated, at best. To</span>__utilize this opportunity, Washington could__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> put forward a statement on its own, or on behalf of NATO</span>, __in conjunction with unilateral nonstrategic weapon withdrawal__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">in which it would disclose basic information about its total nonstrategic stockpiles (including those on U.S. territory)</span> __and invite Russia to respond in kind__. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Moscow also could be encouraged to respond by redeploying its nonstrategic nuclear weapons to bases that are geographically further removed from Europe. There is no guarantee, of course, that unilateral withdrawal of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons from Europe would lead Russia to change its position. </span>It would<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span>make it <span style="font-size: 8pt;">more politically costly, if not </span>__impossible, for Moscow____<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> continue to __stall__. </span>If implemented against the background of positive movement in other areas such as strategic arms reduction, __this tactic has a good chance of succeeding__. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">After all, something must be done--and soon.</span> __The continuing stalemate over nonstrategic nuclear weapons is unacceptable and represents a needless threat to__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">transatlantic</span> __security__ and <span style="font-size: 8pt;">President Barack Obama's vision of a nuclear-weapon-free world.</span>

<span class="cite">**Rajaraman 02**</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">(R, Apr 22, “Ban battlefield nuclear weapons”, Professor of Theoretical Physics, JNU, [[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2002/04/22/stories/2002042200431000.htm]])</span>
__But there are very sound reasons for vigilantly opposing these battlefield nuclear weapons which pose a grave danger of a different sort, no matter how low their yield. That danger stems from__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> opening, after a very long gap, the nuclear Pandora's box. It should be remembered that subsequent to the two atom bombs dropped on Japan in rapid succession at the end of World War II, </span>__there has been no known incidence of nuclear weapon usage except for tests.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">This despite the fact that the nuclear arsenals have grown from a handful of weapons in the hands of the Americans to tens of thousands of far more powerful bombs spread among a half a dozen countries. </span>__It is not as if there has been a shortage of major conflicts involving countries possessing nuclear weapons.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> We have had, among others, the Korean War, the Vietnam war, the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the Iraqi war, the Sino-Soviet border skirmishes and most pertinently for us, the Kargil conflict. Some of these were long drawn out wars with heavy casualties. The U.S. in Vietnam and the Soviets in Afghanistan had to bear the ignominy of losing the wars to smaller and technologically less developed antagonists. One might have imagined that under such severe circumstances nations would employ all available weapons in their power to turn defeat into victory. </span>__Yet, none of these countries used a nuclear bomb even once.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> There were a variety of different reasons behind each of these examples of abstinence from using nuclear weapons. But one </span>__major common factor contributing to all of them has been an ingrained terror of nuclear devastatio__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">n. The well documented images </span>__of Hiroshima and Nagasak<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">i, the awesome photographs of giant mushroom clouds emerging from nuclear tests in the Pacific and the numerous movies based on nuclear Armageddon </span>scenarios have all contributed to building up a deep rooted fear of nuclear weapons. This is not limited just to the abhorrence felt by anti-nuclear activists__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It permeates to one extent or another the psyche of all but the most pathological of fanatics. It colours the calculations, even if not decisively, of the most hardened of military strategists. </span>__The unacceptability of nuclear devastation is the backbone of all deterrence strategies. There is not just a fear of being attacked oneself, but also a strong mental barrier against actually initiating nuclear attacks on enemy populations, no matter how much they may be contemplated in war games__
__and strategies__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As a result </span>__a taboo has tacitly evolved over the decades preventing nations__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, at least so far, </span>__from actually pressing the nuclear button even in the face of serious military crises__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is </span>__this taboo__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">which</span> __will be broken if battlefield nuclear weapons__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however small, begin to be used. Once the line dividing nuclear weapons and conventional bombs is crossed</span>__, it will become acceptable to use "baby nukes" and the radiation deaths that go with it.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> A gradual erosion of the feeling of abhorrence against nuclear weapons is bound to occur. The </span>__use of a sub-kiloton artillery shell in battle by one country will elicit a similar response with possibly a heavier yield weapon,__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if not in the same war, somewhere else. The ante will keep going up till eventually the use of bigger multi-kiloton and megaton weapons would be contemplated more seriously as realistic military alternatives. The single largest universal deterrent against nuclear holocaust will be lost forever.</span>

**Withdrawal solves the thinkability of ‘tactical use’—making nuclear war irrelevant solving their use**

__The only technical factors that can greatly alter credibility and the firebreak are those that are responsible for the doomsday machine__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: (1) the fragility of nuclear command and control and (2) </span>__the **presence of nuclear** **weapons** at the front lines **in Europe**__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,</span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Korea, and the Middle East, at sea, and elsewhere. As we have seen, </span>__not much can be done about the fragility of command and control.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As Ball's painstaking study concludes, "Command-and-control systems are inherently relatively vulnerable…. The allocation of further resources to improving the survivability and endurance of the strategic command-and-control capabilities cannot substantially alter this situation…. The capability to exercise strict control and co-ordination would inevitably be lost relatively early in a nuclear exchange." In Europe, another group of experts adds that "conditions … are not congenial to major improvements in C3 I."[23] And whatever can be done has less to do with the race to build or control weapons—the focus of the nuclear debate—than with the organization of the command system. For example, NATO presumably could make it much more difficult for field commanders to obtain the authority and technical ability needed to detonate nuclear warheads in the event of a war in Europe. </span>__Much more can be done about the way nuclear weapons systems are scattered around the globe. Although modest changes would not make much difference, radical changes could. If NATO__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">units guarding </span>__the central Europe__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">an front </span>__did not have nuclear weapons, then their involvement in conventional battles could not erupt__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">spontaneously</span> __into nuclear war__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If American aircraft carriers were not dual-capable, or if they were not sent into war zones, their commanders could not ignite a cataclysm. </span>**__A thorough removal of tactical nuclear weapons from flash points for conventional war could significantly widen the nuclear firebreak__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, though possibly at the expense of credibility. Ironically, </span>__this one aspect of superpower arms control that bears directly on the risk of global holocaust has received almost no attention during the public debate in the United States.__

**Fear of the bomb is key to prevent global war and chaos**
<span class="cite">**Mearsheimer 01**</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 9pt;">(John, Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, The Tragedy of Great Power Politics)</span>
__The possible consequences of falling victim to aggression further amplify the importance of fear as a motivating force in world politics.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Great powers do not compete with each other as if international politics were merely an economic marketplace.</span> __Political competition among states is a much more dangerous business__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">than mere economic intercourse; the former can read to war, and</span> __war often means mass killing__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">on the battlefield </span>__as well a mass murder of civilians.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In extreme cases, war can even lead to the destruction of states. The horrible consequences of war sometimes cause states to view each other not just as competitors, but as potentially deadly enemies. Political antagonism, in short, tends to be intense, because the stakes are great.</span> __States in the international system also aim to guarantee their own survival.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Because other states are potential threats, and because there is no higher authority to come to their rescue when they dial 911, states can’t just depend on others for their own security. Each state tends to see itself as vulnerable and alone, and therefore it aims to provide for its own survival. In international politics, God helps those who help themselves.</span>

All the allies are putting a brave face on their collective engagement in Afghanistan, but they will have trouble reaching agreement on a broader range of longer-running issues, such as: The limits of future military actions Relations with Russia The role of non-military instruments of power and influence A plan for breaking down the barriers between NATO and the European Union. To deal with these genuinely strategic challenges, the transatlantic nations really need more than just a concept: they need a new transatlantic “grand bargain,” based on the common interests of the U.S. and the European allies__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">and setting a course to meet, together, the real challenges of the next decade. The due date for NATO to adopt its new Strategic Concept is November 19-20 at a NATO summit meeting in Lisbon. It is a major exercise to draft, consider, and adopt a new plan designed to guide the Alliance thorough the years ahead.</span>//

//<span class="DebateUnderline">__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The urgency of these threats combines with three other trends--the failure of past policy, the development of a strategic alternative, and the near simultaneous emergence of new leaders in the major nations--that together create a rare policy moment in which **dramatic global shifts**</span>__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">--such as that envisioned by President Obama--</span><span class="DebateUnderline">**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">are</span>__**</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">not just possible, but </span><span class="DebateUnderline">**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">probable</span>__**</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The first trend is the widespread recognition that the Bush Doctrine failed. The policies of the last US administration not only did not make the United States safer, but they made the world's nuclear threats worse. The Bush policy posited that the greatest danger came from the nexus of terrorists, outlaw states and weapons of mass destruction. The solution was said to lie in direct military action to overthrow rogue regimes. Iraq was the first implementation of the policy. The war's architects expected regime change in Iraq to lead to regime change in Syria, Iran, North Korea, and other states. The opposite occurred. North Korea and Iran accelerated their nuclear programs, making more progress in the past five years than they had in the previous ten. US legitimacy and credibility in the world weakened as political, financial, and human resources drained into the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Meanwhile, relations with Russia, whose cooperation is necessary for resolution of many of these issues, deteriorated. While the terrorist threat increased, programs to secure global stockpiles of nuclear weapon materials languished.

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 5pt;">The presence of nuclear weapons makes war less likely. __One may__ nevertheless __oppose the spread of nuclear weapons on the ground that they would make war__, however unlikely, __unbearably intense__ should it occur. Nuclear weapons have not been fired in anger in a world in which more than one country has them. We have enjoyed half a century of nuclear peace, but we can never have a guarantee. We may be grateful for decades of nuclear peace and for the discouragement of conventional war among those who have nuclear weapons. Yet the fear is widespread that if they ever go off, we may all be dead. People as varied as the scholar Richard Smoke, the arms controller Paul Warnke, and the former defense secretary Harold Brown have all believed that if any nuclear weapons go off, many will. Although this seems the least likely of all the unlikely possibilities, it is not impossible. What makes it so unlikely is that, if a few warheads are fired, all of the countries involved will want to get out of the mess they are in. McNamara asked himself what fractions of the Soviet Union's population and industry the United States should be able to destroy to deter it. This was the wrong question. States are not deterred because they expect to suffer a certain amount of damage but because they cannot know how much damage they will suffer. Near the dawn of the nuclear age, Bernard Brodie put the matter simply, "The prediction is more important than the fact." 35 Potential attacks are deterred by the knowledge that attacking the vital interests of a country having nuclear weapons may bring the attacker untold losses. As Patrick Morgan put it later, "To attempt to compute the cost of a nuclear war is to miss the point." 36 States are deterred by the prospect of suffering severe damage and by their inability to do much to limit it. Deterrence works because nuclear weapons enable one state to punish another state severely without first defeating it. "Victory" in Thomas Schelling's words, "is no longer a prerequisite for hurting the enemy." 37 Countries armed only with conventional weapons can hope that their military forces will be able to limit the damage an attacker can do. Among countries armed with strategic nuclear forces, the hope of avoiding heavy damage depends mainly on the attacker's restraint and little on one's own efforts. Those who compared expected deaths through strategic exchanges of nuclear warheads with casualties suffered by the Soviet Union in World War II overlooked the fundamental difference between conventional and nuclear worlds. 35 Deterrence rests on what countries can do to each other with strategic nuclear weapons. From this statement, one can easily leap to the wrong conclusion: that deterrent strategies, if they have to be carried through, will produce a catastrophe. That countries are able to annihilate each other means neither that deterrence depends on their threatening to do so nor that they will necessarily do so if deterrence fails. Because countries heavily armed with strategic nuclear weapons can carry war to its ultimate intensity, the control of force becomes the primary objective.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> __If deterrence fails, leaders will have **the strongest incentives** to keep force under control and limit__ </span>__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">damag</span>____<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">e </span>__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 5pt;">rather than launching genocidal attacks. If the Soviet Union had attacked Western Europe, NATO's objectives would have been to halt the attack and end the war. The United States had the ability to place thousands of warheads precisely on targets in the Soviet Union. Surely we would have struck military targets before striking industrial targets and industrial targets before striking cities. The intent to hit military targets first was sometimes confused with a war-fighting strategy, but it was not one. It would not have significantly reduced the Soviet Union's ability to hurt us. Whatever American military leaders thought, our strategy rested on the threat to punish. The threat, if it failed to deter, would have been followed not by spasms of violence but by punishment administered in ways that conveyed threats of more to come. A war between the United States and the Soviet Union that got out of control would have been catastrophic. If they had set out to destroy each other, they would have greatly reduced the world's store of developed resources while killing millions outside of their own borders through fallout. Even while destroying themselves, __states with few weapons would do less damage to others.__ As ever, the biggest international dangers come from the strongest states__.__ Fearing the world's destruction, one may prefer a world of conventional great powers having a higher probability of fighting less- destructive wars to a world of nuclear great powers having a lower probability of fighting more-destructive wars. But that choice effectively disappeared with the production of atomic bombs by the United States during World War II. Does the spread of nuclear weapons threaten to make wars more intense at regional levels, where wars of high intensity have been possible for many years? If weaker countries are unable to defend at lesser levels of violence, might they destroy themselves through resorting to nuclear weapons? Lesser nuclear states live in fear of this possibility. But this is not different from the fear under which the United States and the Soviet Union lived for years. Small nuclear states may experience a keen sense of desperation because of vulnerability to conventional as well as to nuclear attack, but, again, in desperate situations what all parties become most desperate to avoid is the use of strategic nuclear weapons. Still, however improbable the event, lesser states may one day fire some of their weapons. Are minor nuclear states more or less likely to do so than major ones? The answer to this question is vitally important because the existence of some states would be at stake even if the damage done were regionally confined. For a number of reasons</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">, **__deterrent strategies promise less damage than war-fighting strategies__.** First, __deterrent strategies induce caution__ all around __and__ thus __reduce the incidence of war. Second, wars fought in the face of__ strategic __nuclear weapons must be carefully limited__ </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">because a country having them may retaliate if its vital interests are threatened. Third, prospective punishment need only be proportionate to an adversary's expected gains in war after those gains are discounted for the many uncertainties of war. Fourth,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> __should deterrence fail, a few judiciously delivered warheads__ are likely to __produce sobriety in the leaders__ of all of the countries __involved and thus **bring rapid deescalation.**__ </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">Finally, war-fighting strategies offer no clear place to stop short of victory for some and defeat for others. Deterrent strategies do, and that place is where one country threatens another's vital interests. Deterrent strategies lower the probability that wars will begin. If wars start nevertheless, deterrent strategies lower the probability that they will be carried very far. In a conventional world, to deter an attacker a status quo country must threaten a lot of force. It must do so to overcome doubts about the credibility of conventional threats and uncertainty about the effectiveness of conventional blows. In a nuclear world to deter one need threaten only a little force because so much more can easily be added. Limiting wars in a conventional world has proved difficult. In a nuclear world, only limited wars can be fought. In a conventional world, states are tempted to strike first to gain an initial advantage and set the course of the war. In a nuclear world, to strike first is pointless because no advantage can be gained against invulnerable forces. In a conventional world, combatants use their best, i.e. their most destructive, weapons. Although overlooked, this explains our use of atomic bombs in the Second World War. From Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima to Okinawa to the fire-bombing of Tokyo, America applied force on an ever- increasing scale. In the context of a conventional war, A- bombs looked simply like bigger and better weapons. The aim in a conventional war is to escalate to a higher level of force than your opponent can reach. In a nuclear world, no one can escalate to a level of force anywhere near the top without risking its own destruction. Deterrence in World War II worked only where combatants shared the ability to use a horrible weapon, poison gas. All of the major combatants were capable of using it. None did. On all of the above counts, nuclear weapons reverse the logic of war that operates in conventional worlds. </span>**__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Nuclear weapons lessen the intensity as well as the frequency of war among their possessor</span>__****__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">s</span>__**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">. __For fear of escalation, nuclear states do not want to fight__ long and __hard over important interests__—indeed, they do not want to fight at all. Minor nuclear states have even better reasons than major ones to accommodate one another and to avoid fighting. __Worries about the intensity of war among nuclear states have to be viewed__ in this context and __against a world in which **conventional weapons have become ever costlier and more destructive**__.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A single illustration of the lethality of biological weapons will clarify why the U.S. capability to deter regional challengers is of paramount importance: a single undeterred attacker employing as little as 20 kilograms of dispersed anthrax drifting downwind could, under the proper conditions, cause the deaths of 50 percent of the unprotected population in an area of more than 150 square miles. Such a biological attack against the unprotected populations of ten large U.S. urban areas could kill on the order of 20 million Americans. To risk understatement, deterrence is not less important in this post-Cold War period</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. __In the absence of a revived great power competition__, the most taxing likely role for U.S. deterrence policy will be __deterring the use of WMD by hostile regional powers__. What __is the future role for nuclear weapons in regional deterrence__</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">? There are numerous recent confident assertions by prominent persons that U.S. conventional forces can reliably replace nuclear forces for deterrence of all but nuclear threats. Consequently, they conclude that nuclear weapons are largely unnecessary for regional deterrence. Such assertions ring hollow; they are speculative and unsupported by actual evidence. The evidence that does exist, including recent history, suggests strongly that when a challenger is highly motivated, and cost- and risk- tolerant,</span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">nuclear weapons can be essential to deterring </span>__
__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">WMD attacks</span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">. What, for example, was the value of nuclear weapons for deterrence </span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">in the Gulf War?</span>____<span style="font-size: 10pt;">By Iraqi accounts</span>____<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, nuclear deterrence prevented Iraq's use of chemical and biological weapons</span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">(CBW__) that could have inflicted horrendous civilian and military casualties__on us and our allies. </span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Senior Iraqi wartime leaders have explained that while U.S. conventional threats were insufficient to deter, implicit U.S. nuclear threats did deter</span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Saddam Hussein's </span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">use of chemical and biological weapons.</span>__<span style="font-size: 4pt;">As the then-head of Iraqi military intelligence, Gen. Waffic al Sammarai, has stated, Saddam Hussein did not use chemical or biological weapons during the war, "because the warning was quite severe, and quite effective. The allied troops were certain to use nuclear arms and the price will be too dear and too high." Immediately following the Gulf War many prominent U.S. military commentators, such as former Secretary of Defense McNamara, claimed that nuclear weapons were "incredible" and therefore "irrelevant" to the war.1 This assessment-that U.S. nuclear weapons are irrelevant to regional challengers-is at the heart of the various nuclear disarmament proposals; it also is gravely mistaken. The continuing proliferation of CBW can only increase our need for nuclear deterrence. The United States has given up chemical and biological weapons, and has thus given up the option of deterring chemical and biological threats with like capabilities. In some tough cases conventional forces alone are likely to be inadequate to deter CBW threats. Consequently,</span>__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">as CBW proliferates our nuclear capabilities become more, not less important for regional deterrence.</span>__

**That causes extinction**
**Ochs****2002** - <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Richard, Chemical Weapons Working Group Member, [“Biological Weapons must be Abolished Immediately,” June 9, http://www.freefromterror.net/other_articles/abolish.html]</span>

<span style="font-size: 4pt;">Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a "nuclear winter," resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> __forever. Potentially worse than that, bio-engineered agents by the hundreds with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation. AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE.__ </span>

After Ankara’s contacts with Iranian officials, on January 8, Tehran apologized for “the inconvenience” and resumed pumping gas, claiming that a newly-established Iranian refinery had resolved the issue.[</span><span style="color: #003366; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">[[http://www.nps.edu/Academics/centers/ccc/publications/OnlineJournal/2009/Apr/marashiApr09.html#references|53]]</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">] Based on these developments, Turkish Ministry of Energy decided to accelerate the nuclear plant project. __The proposa__l to build one of Turkey’s three planned nuclear power reactors in Sinop, for example, a scenic town on the Black Sea, </span>__<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">has elicited strong opposition from Turkish environmentalists,</span>__<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> as well from the opposition party in the Turkish parliament, which opposes the efforts of the governing Justice and Development Party </span>//

Otherwise, Iran’s nuclear ambitions may trigger young Turks to think nuclear more seriously.” It is important to examine Turkey’s nuclear activities in order to determine future capabilities and assess whether Turkey might become another nuclear proliferator in the case that “young Turks” start to consider nuclear options in the face of security challenges. </span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">It’s important to highlight that currently there are no nuclear power reactors in Turkey other than two small researchreactors</span>____<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">,</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">but in the shadows of energy shortfalls, building a nuclear power station has become a highly debated issue. Turkey’s nuclear power research started with the establishment of the Cekmece Nuclear Research and Training Center (CNRTC) with a one megawatt thermal pool type research reactor in 1962. Later in 1966 the Nuclear Research and Training Center (ANRTC) was established for planning and utilizing Turkey’s natural uranium reserves. Feasibility studies were conducted for the construction of a 300- to 400- megawatt reactor; however, economic and political crises halted the project. Later similar research was conducted in 1972 to install a 600-megawatt reactor, but again the project was interrupted by military intervention in 1980. Too many attempts and failures, on the other hand, supplied Turkey with a well-educated cadre of Turkish scientists, scholars, and technicians in the fields of nuclear engineering and nuclear physics. Turkey can be argued to have a nuclear weapon production capability, as Bowen and Kidd highlight in their article. However, common wisdom depending on open sources</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">suggests that __a nuclear-capable-Turkey is unlikely, given the openness of Turkey’s nuclear research program, small uranium reserves, lack of enrichment__ </span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">and reprocessing</span>____<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">capabilities, and especially international pressure. In this regard, it is difficult to believe that Ankara could develop a weapons program in the near future</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">as long as Turkish leaders keep their rationality in governing the country.</span></span><span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">1AR Ev -</span>**</span>

The Turkish Prime Minister goes further by arguing that “those who speak to this issue should eliminate nuclear weapons from their own country.” The political and economic élite think that Turkey should not sever ties with its neighbors with whom it has several trade relations. Iran is the second main supplier of natural gas, on which Turkey is highly dependent, thus good neighborly relations are essential for economic and regional stability.__

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The specific objections of France need to be addressed if there is going to be any policy change. It is worrying that during our interviews, no delegation presented a plan for how to ‘deal with France’. Many seem to think that – once the other obstacles are cleared – </span>__pressure will make France cave in and accept a change to nuclear sharing policy, albeit begrudgingly. “Arm twisting France into accepting the inevitable”,__ <span style="font-size: 6pt;">is how one delegate worded it.</span> __Peer pressure may indeed work.__ <span style="font-size: 6pt;">As the current U.S. Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder pointed out in a 2008 Foreign Affairs article: “...</span>__As other nuclear powers move in a different direction, Paris’ ability to remain a holdout will diminish – as became clear in the 1990s when France finally decided to sign the NPT and, once again after two last series of nuclear tests, when it signed on to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. A democracy like France can remain an international outlier only for so long__.<span style="font-size: 6pt;">”55 Given the concern about Alliance cohesion however, it may prove more prudent – and certainly more elegant – to thoroughly investigate the specific concerns of France, and see to what extent NATO, as an Alliance can accommodate her wishes and demands so that France feels sufficiently reassured to support a decision to end TNW deployment, rather than solely succumbing to overwhelming peer pressure and having to swallow it. It is of course up to France to formulate its own demands and proposals, but following closely the input of France in recent disarmament and security debates gives a rough idea of the direction thinking is going in Paris. First and foremost, </span>__France__ __seems preoccupied with wanting to maintain its favourable position in international relations, and within NATO, as a nuclear power.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Additional </span>__assurance that removal of TNW will not in any way affect the French independent nuclear capacity may be half the solution.__ <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Secondly, the interviews with French diplomats showed that France has a real concern that ‘inside NATO’, the bigger picture should not be lost. Again, the Defence and Deterrence Posture Review process seems the pivotal moment to provide reassurance on that front. When embedded in a comprehensive reassessment of European and NATO deterrence and defence needs,</span> __France__ __may eventually become a reluctant proponent of ending TNW deployment, rather than a defiant opponent__.

1-The CP competes by severing out of the immediacy of plan action-the aff must defend plan implementation as immediate; that’s key to neg ground and strategy because we can only cut brinks for disads that assume the status quo not future implementation

2-The CP severs out of the certainty of plan action-defending plan implementation as certain is the basis of a stable advocacy; that’s key to clash because we can’t debate a moving target

Text: The President of the United States should issue an executive order to

Contention 1: Solvency

Executive orders effectively implement policy with the force of law.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mayer 01</span> [Kenneth, Professor of Political Science @ University of Wisconsin – Madison, //With the Stroke of a Pen]//
These chronicles of presidential decisiveness and unilateral action are at odds with the prevailing scholarly view of presidential power. Among political scientists the conventional wisdom is that the president is weak, hobbled by the separation of powers and the short reach of his formal legal authority. <span class="underline">Presidential power, far from being a matter of prerogative or legal rule, “is the power to persuade,” </span>wrote Richard Neustadt in the single most influential statement about the office in the past fifty years.6 <span class="underline">Yet </span>throughout U.S. history presidents have relied on their executive authority to make unilateral policy<span class="underline"> without interference from either Congress </span>or the courts. In this book, I investigate how <span class="underline">presidents have used </span>a tool of executive power—<span class="underline">the executive order—to wield their inherent legal authority. Executive orders are,</span> loosely speaking, <span class="underline">presidential directives that require or authorize some action within the executive branch </span>(though they often extend far beyond the government).They are <span class="underline">presidential edicts, legal instruments that create or modify laws, procedures, and </span>policy by fiat.Working from their position as chief executive and commander in chief<span class="underline">, </span>presidents have used executive orders to make momentous policy choices, creating and abolishing executive branch agencies, reorganizing administrative and regulatory processes, determining how legislation is implemented, and taking whatever action is permitted within the boundaries of their constitutional or statutory authority. __<span class="underline">Even within the confines of their executive powers, </span>presidents have been able to “legislate” in the sense of making policy that goes well beyond simple administrative activity.__Y ale Law School professor E. Donald Elliot has argued that many of the thousands of executive orders “plainly ‘make law’ in every sense,”7 and Louis Fisher finds that despite the fact that the Constitution unambiguously vests the legislative function in Congress, “the President’s lawmaking role is substantial, persistent, and in many cases disturbing.”8
Contention 2: Presidential Powers net benefit

Pres powers on the brink – Obama has little presidential influence – Cowed by conservatives, supports those who backstab him, and betrays campaign promises
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Agonist, 7/6/10 </span>(Aurelius, Freelance writer, “The CV Is Hardening: Obama is Weak”, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://agonist.org/aurelius/20100706/the_cv_is_hardening_obama_is_weak]]</span>)
"Weak," "wimp," "soft." This is a <span class="underline">uniquely </span>dangerous way to find oneself labeled when in a position where people are looking to you for leadership--just ask former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter. It is the reason the Right has used everything from national security to crime to welfare to define Democrats as such at least since the days when Joseph McCarthy <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=260|referred to Harry S. Truman's patrician Secretary of State Dean Acheson]]</span>--a defender of the right-wing ridiculed policy of containment--as "this pompous diplomat in striped pants, with the phony British accent." The problem is that <span class="underline">President </span>Obama has <span class="underline">continually </span>given both his enemies and the <span class="underline">mainstream </span>media <span class="underline">plenty of </span>ammunition for this charge, and, sadly, while it may be a bit hyperbolic, that doesn't mean there is not some truth to it. Whether it is our President <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/10/senate-passes-obamas-econ_n_165647.html|caving to Sens.

Or his ridiculously naive calls for bipartisanship as an end in and of itself, while being labeled a socialist or accused of being born in Kenya by those with which he would seek common ground. Or backing off on beliefs once they are criticized by the Family Cheney and its ilk, like <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/04/911-trial-reversal-obama-_n_486758.html|holding trials for 9/11 murderers in New York]]</span> or <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/111965?RS_show_page=1|drilling for oil offshore]]</span>. Or the time it takes for him to make up his mind and take control of events that seem to, in fact, take control of him, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/07/31/mccain_ads_go_negative_early_on_obama/|from attacks by McCain during the 2008 campaign]]</span>to the aforementioned health care fiasco. Or the fact that he actively defends and endorses those who stab him in the back, such as <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0610/38901_Page2.html|members of the Blue Dog caucus in the House]]</span> or the loathsome Blanche Lincoln and Joe Lieberman in the Senate. I could go on, but I think you get the point. He has shown himself to be easily cowed by conservatives, ready to betray campaign promises and his allies at the slightest hint of resistance, afraid of a fight, and often simply unable to act. The result, especially recently, has been to create a perception of weakness that may just haunt the rest of his presidency. The examples are everywhere. Our own Mr. Sean Paul Kelley asked in a recent post <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://agonist.org/sean_paul_kelley/20100614/is_obama_getting_carterized|"Is Obama Getting Carterized,"]]</span> because the Washington Post chose to use the word <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/12/AR2010061204152_pf.html|"pleads"]]</span> in its headline when introducing a request Obama made of Congress. As in "Obama pleads for $50 billion in state, local aid." Just last week, Kathleen Parker of the Washington Post wrote a piece <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/30/is-obama-a-woman-or-a-hum_n_630800.html|calling him]]</span>"our first female president." Now, I often think she's wrong, and here I think she's being sexist, but this is about perception and how it shapes reality. And the reality that is inevitably created <span class="underline">**when a leader shows again and again that he is not up to leading, fighting for what he believes in, or punishing those**</span>--especially <span class="underline">**within his own party**</span>--<span class="underline">who betray him</span>, is that nobody thinks twice about sticking a knife in their back at the first opportune moment.And if you don't want to believe Parker, look at what onetime allies are saying.

There is no point in saying what Obama "should" do. Because people have been saying that for 18 months now and nothing has changed.

So lets not fool ourselves. You fight with the President you have, not the one you wish you had, to paraphrase a certain jackass of a Defense Secretary. We either accept that this is as good as its going to get, and apply an upper cut when he forgets his campaign promises.

Executive orders are key to presidential powers – they control policies and set agendas.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mayer 01</span> [Kenneth, Professor in the Department of Poli Sci @ University of Wisconsin-Madison, //Executive Orders and Presidential Power//, pg. 28-29]

This theoretical perspective offered by the new institutional economics literature provides a way of making sense of the wide range of executive orders issued over the years, and is the centerpiece of my approach. The common theme I find in significant executive orders is control; executive orders are an instrument of executive power <span class="underline">that presidents have used to control policy,</span> establish and maintain institutions, <span class="underline">shape agendas</span>, manage constituent relationships, <span class="underline">and keep control of their political fate</span> generally. Within the boundaries set by statute of the Constitution, presidents have <span class="underline">consistently </span>used their executive power <span class="underline">– often </span>manifested in executive orders<span class="underline"> – to shape the institutional and political context in which they sit.</span> There are, to be sure, limits on what presidents can do relying solely on executive orders and executive power, and presidents who push too far will find that Congress and the courts will push back. Yet the president retains significant <span class="underline">legal, institutional, and political </span>advantages that make executive authority <span class="underline">a </span>more powerful <span class="underline">tool </span>than scholars havethus far recognized. This emphasis on control allows for a longer-term view than that generally taken by informal approaches to presidential leadership. I conclude <span class="underline">that presidents have used executive orders to alter the institutional and political context in which they operate.</span> The effects of any one effort in this regard may not be immediately apparent, and in many cases presidents succeed only after following up on what their predecessors have done. In this respect I view presidential leadership as both strategic and dynamic, a perspective that brings into sharper relief the utility of executive power to the presidency. I also differ with Neustadt on this score, as he looks at how presidents can be tactically effective within a particular structure context over which they have no control.
Executive Orders don’t sap political capital
Bryan W. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Marshall</span>, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Miami University, Richard L. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Pacelle</span> Jr., Professor and the Chair of Political Science at Georgia Southern University, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2005</span>, American Politics Research, Revisiting the Two Presidencies: The Strategic Use of Executive Order

There are two important theoretical explanations in the literature regarding the role of legislative success and executive orders (Krause & Cohen, 1997, pp. 461-462). First, presidents__may be inclined to use executive orders as a substitute for legislating__(Light, 1982). The normal legislative route can__quickly diminisha president’s political capital, so he uses executive orderswhen the going gets tough in Congress.__ Moreover, __the depletion of political capital is much more likely in the area of domestic policy, where the potential for conflict with Congress is greater due to disparate and intense constituency interests.__ So we expect that an inverse relationship should exist between the president’s domestic policy success and the issuance of executive orders. In contrast, some scholars have claimed that executive orders are a way to reinforce legislation that the president concurs with (Gleiber & Shull, 1992; Shull, 1997). But because presidents are granted more latitude and are less likely to expend their political capital as quickly on foreign policy, we expect presidents will be inclined to press their powers more with executive orders when they are enjoying high levels of foreign policy success in the legislative arena. This suggests that a president’s foreign policy success in Congress should be positively related to executive orders.

Presidential power is key to stopping nuclear terrorism.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Taylor and Thomas, </span>writers for Newsweek Magazine, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2009</span>
Stuart Taylor Jr and Evan Thomas, Writers for Newsweek Magazine, “Obama’s Cheney Dilemma” 1-10-09, http://www.newsweek.com/id/178855
In times of war <span class="underline">and crisis, as presidents such as Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt discovered, </span>the nation needs a strong chief executive. <span class="underline">The flaw of the Bush-Cheney administration may have been less in what it did than in the way it did it—flaunting executive power, ignoring Congress, showing scorn for anyone who waved the banner of civil liberties</span>. Arguably, there has been an overreaction to the alleged arrogance and heedlessness of Bush and Cheney—especially Cheney, who almost seemed to take a grim satisfaction in his Darth Vader-esque image. The courts, at first slow to respond to arrogations of executive power after September 11, have pushed back.<span class="underline">Many federal officials have grown risk-averse, fearing that they will be prosecuted or dragged before a congressional committee for fighting too hard against terrorism</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span>(A growing number of CIA officials buy insurance policies to cover legal fees.) Obama, who has been receiving intelligence briefings for weeks, already knows what a scary world it is out there. It is unlikely he will <span class="underline">wildly </span>overcorrect for the Bush administration's abuses. A very senior incoming official, who refused to be quoted discussing internal policy debates, indicated that the new administration will try to find a middle road that will protect civil liberties without leaving the nation defenseless. But Obama's team has some strong critics of the old order, including his choice for director of the CIA, Leon Panetta, who has spoken out strongly against coercive interrogation methods. <span class="underline">In Obama's spirit of nonpartisanship, the new crowd would do well to listen to Jack Goldsmith, formerly a Bush Justice Department official, now a Harvard Law School professor. At Justice, Goldsmith was the head of an obscure but critically important unit called the Office of Legal Counsel.</span>OLC acts as a kind of lawyer for the executive branch, offering opinions—close to binding—on what the executive branch can and cannot do. It was an OLC lawyer, John Yoo, who in 2001 and 2002 drafted many of the memos that first gave the Cheneyites permission to do pretty much whatever they wanted in the way of interrogating and detaining suspected terrorists (and eavesdropping on Americans to catch terrorists). Goldsmith, who became head of OLC in 2003, quietly began to revoke some of these permissions as illegal or unconstitutional. The revolt of Goldsmith and some other principled Justice lawyers was a heroic story, kept secret at the time. Now Goldsmith worries about the pendulum swinging too far, as it often does in American democracy<span class="underline">. "</span>The presidency <span class="underline">has already been diminished in ways that would be hard to reverse" and </span>may be losing its capability to fight terrorism<span class="underline">, he says. He argues that </span>Americans should <span class="underline">now </span>be "less worried about an out-of-control presidency than an enfeebled one."

Nuclear terrorism crushes human rights and leads to global nuclear war.

<span class="underline">What would be </span>the consequences of a nuclear attack by terrorists? Even if it fails, it would further exacerbate the negative features of the new and frightening world <span class="underline">in which we are now living. Societies would close in on themselves, </span>police measures would be stepped up at the expense of human rights, tensions between civilisations and religions would rise and ethnic conflicts would proliferate. <span class="underline">It would also speed up the arms race and develop the awareness that a different type of world order is imperative if humankind is to survive. But the still more critical scenario is </span>if the attack succeeds. This could lead to a third world war<span class="underline">, from which no one will emerge victorious. Unlike a conventional war which ends when one side triumphs over another, this war will be without winners and losers. </span>When nuclear pollution infects the whole planet, we will all be losers.


Presidential power prevents India-Pakistan war.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">South China Morning Post 00</span>, 12-11-00, p. L/N
<span class="underline">A weak president with an unclear mandate is bad news for the rest of the world. For better or worse, the person who rules the United States influences events far beyond the shores of his own country. Both the global economy and international politics will feel the effect of political instability in the US. The first impact will be on American financial markets, which will have a ripple effect on markets and growth across the world. </span>A weakened US presidency will also be felt in global hotspots across the world.<span class="underline"> The Middle East, </span>the conflict between India and Pakistan, <span class="underline">peace on the Korean peninsula, and even the way relations between China and Taiwan play out, </span>will be influenced by <span class="underline">the authority </span>the <span class="underline">next </span>US president <span class="underline">brings to his job. There are those who would welcome a weakening of US global influence. Many Palestinians, for example, feel they would benefit from a less interventionist American policy in the Middle East. Even within the Western alliance, there are those who would probably see opportunities in a weakened US presidency. France, for example, might feel that a less assertive US might force the European Union to be more outward looking. But the dangers of </span>having a weak, <span class="underline">insecure US </span>presidency outweigh any benefits <span class="underline">that it might bring. US global economic and military power cannot be wished away. </span>A president with a shaky mandate will<span class="underline"> still command great power and influence, only he will </span>be constrained by his domestic weakness <span class="underline">and less certain about how to use his authority. </span>This brings with it the risks of miscalculation and the use of US power in a way that heightens conflict. <span class="underline">There are very few conflicts in the world today which can be solved without US influence. The rest of the world needs the United States to use its power deftly and decisively. </span>

Obama uniquely influences India’s non-proliferation agenda – only sustainable presidential power will encourage India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty with Pakistan.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Jaishankar 08 </span>(Dhruv, Young Professionals for Foreign Policy, “Obama for India”, http://www.ypfp.org/obama_for_india)
<span class="underline">With a civilian nuclear deal hanging in the balance, </span>a depressing forecast for the global economy and the spectre of Islamic extremism continuing to haunt the subcontinent,<span class="underline"> the US presidential elections are of special interest in India. </span>From the Indian perspective, Barack Obama, who, regardless of the results of Tuesday’s Pennsylvania primary, remains favoured to win the Democratic Party’s nomination for president, cuts an enigmatic figure. <span class="underline">Obama voted for the Hyde Act in 2006, but famously introduced an amendment that threatened fuel supply assurances to India. He also voted in favour of so-called ‘killer amendments’ which would have made the deal impossible from India’s vantage point. Obama has spoken out against outsourcing and in favour of more rigorous international measures to combat climate change, but has also taken a less lenient position on military aid to Pakistan</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">He has frequently positioned himself to the left of rival Hillary Clinton, but has often spoken of reaching across the political aisle to work with Republicans. Given his increasingly bitter competition with Clinton for the nomination, it is surprising that Obama’s foreign policy advisory team is led by several former officials from her husband’s administration — his National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, the former Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Susan Rice, ex-Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig, and Greg Craig, who was Director of Policy Planning in the State Department and who defended Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial in 1999 — as well as former Senate staffer Denis McDonough. Starting in 2006, these core advisers began to bring together teams of experts on international affairs to advise the campaign on specific issues. Now numbering well over a hundred, these experts have varying degrees of involvement in the campaign</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>A number of radical changes can be expected from an Obama foreign policy, some of which will directly affect India.<span class="underline"> Obama and his foreign policy advisers will almost certainly emphasise a renewal of the non-proliferation agenda. Although the exact shape and scope of their policies is uncertain, it would likely involve a revival of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty</span>, especially if the Democrats were to win at least 60 seats in the Senate. It may <span class="underline">also </span>mean altering <span class="underline">or amending</span>aspects of the civilian nuclear deal with India<span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">“The Democrats are much more likely to want to revisit the nuclear proliferation implications [of the nuclear deal],” says Bruce Riedel, the former National Security Council Senior Director for Near East and South Asian Affairs, who is among Obama’s advisers. “That would complicate the relationship with New Delhi.” However, Obama and his fellow Democrats’ emphasis on a stringent climate regime to succeed the Kyoto Protocol may be at odds with the non-proliferation agenda, as civilian nuclear energy begins to be viewed more widely as a clean alternative to fossil fuels. “This gets into priorities,” says Riedel. “Once there’s a new president there’ll be a jockeying for what the priority will be.” Regardless of the nuclear dimensions of the relationship, there is a feeling that an Obama presidency would continue emphasising the importance of a growing India. “There’s talk of a strategic partnership with India. The Obama campaign buys into that,” says Riedel. “As president, he will place the same priority on India as Bush did, and Clinton did before him.” Philip Gordon, another Obama adviser who was Director for European Affairs in Clinton’s National Security Council, agrees. “India is an increasingly important country,” he says. “It’s a recognition of reality.” The widespread speculation that Obama will include leading Republicans in his administration may also assuage fears in New Delhi of a significant break from Bush’s policies towards India. “Obama has a big theme of bringing people together,” says Gordon. “It’s an obvious way of manifesting his interest in working across party lines.” The crucial issue in the region, however, is the United States’ continuing involvement in Afghanistan and, in that context, its relationship with Pakistan. Obama would likely favour the retention of a military presence in Afghanistan under a NATO banner. “Obama has repeatedly stated that not enough attention has been paid to Afghanistan and Pakistan,” says Gordon. Riedel agrees that there will be a renewed focus on Afghanistan and Pakistan under an Obama presidency. “Obama is determined to put a lot more resources into the war in Afghanistan — and it’s overlapped into Pakistan — than either a McCain presidency would or the Bush administration did.” He adds that Obama sees Afghanistan and Pakistan as “the central front of the war against al Qaeda and the war against extremism.” While Obama may take a tougher line with Pakistan, and make military aid conditional upon Pakistan’s performance in combating the Taliban and al Qaeda, Riedel disagrees with the view, prevalent in Pakistan, that Obama dislikes that country. Instead, he says that Obama is a strong critic of the “Musharraf-centric Pakistan policy” being pursued by the Bush Administration. He believes that Obama is likely to be supportive of the present PPP-led government, unless it were to engage the Taliban, a move which would prove extremely unpopular in the United States. Obama’s advisers say the candidate’s background and personal experiences are what ultimately set him apart from the other contenders for the presidency. “He looks at the world a different way from a typical American president,” says Gordon. Obama, whose father was from Kenya, lived for four years as a child in Indonesia. His campaign also recently revealed that he had visited Karachi and Hyderabad as a college student, although they did not specify whether the latter was the Indian or Pakistani city. </span>

**The affirmatives construction of a strategic withdrawal in presence covers up US imperialism and capitalist influence worldwide masking the motives of capitalist imperialism which leaves it to remain undetected**

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">It is unnecessary to go on. The point is not, as is often made out, whether the persistence of underdevelopment is because of imperialism or because of internal contradictions in the third world (which in any case represents an ill-formulated counterposing of the two); the point is not whether capitalism can survive without imperialism (a speculative question foreign to the Marxist method); the point is not even whether this ot that theoritician of imperialism was correct (that is hagiography, not analysis). The point is the paradox that while the system of relations covered under the rubric of imperialism has hardly changed over the last decade and a half, fundamental questions are discussed today, even among Marxists, without any reference to it. Yesterday's Marxists in Eastern Europe may have stopped talking about imperialism today for a variety of reasons. Mr. Gorbachev may have written a whole book called Perestroika without a single reference to imperialism. But why should American Marxists, who are under no constraints to emulate their Soviet and Eastern European counterparts, fall into the same deafening silence on the question? The reason, one is tempted to speculate, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">lies precisely in the very strengthening </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">a</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">nd consolidation of imperialism. Vietnam was a crisis for imperialism. The fact that the United States had to send half a million troops to attempt to subdue a tiny country was itself an expression of a failure to "manage" things there</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">; the fact that it lost the war only underscored that failure. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Since then, however, there has been no comparable crisis.Imperialism has learned to "manage" things better; </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">the very price the people of Vietnam had to pay to win the war has perhaps had a subduing influence on other third world countries. They have also learned that the odds are heavily against them in other ways as well. The emancipation of the third world, as almost everybody, whether in the first or the third world, now realizes, resembles an obstacle race where the horse must fall at one of the obstacles. First, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the coming to power of a revolutionary government is itself blocked in several ways; if perchance it does come to power, an economic blackade is imposed upon it; the disaffection generated by social reforms and economic hardships, which are inevitable, is then utilized to foment a civil war, unable to rebuild its shattered economy with the meager resources at its command, it must go abroad for loans, at which point agencies like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank come in, demanding a reversal of the reforms</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. While some years ago, there were dreams all over the third world of socialism of all kinds, not just Marxian socialism, but Nehruvian socialism, Nyerere's socialism, Jagan's socialism, and the like; today we find the drab grey of IMF "conditionalities" painted all over the third world (and even in the erstwhile socialist world). Many, of course, would say that this is because of the "follies" of the post-liberation regimes in the third world. This argument, to use our ealier analogy, amounts to saying that if the horse could not clear all the obstacles, then it is the horse's fault. Maybe, but I would like to believe that the horse, if it is well-trained and intelligent, can clear all these obstacles. The point is a different one: </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">we should not, in our enthusiasm for blaming the horse, become blind to the obstacles.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> And </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the very fact that imperialism has been so successful in putting up obstacles, has been so adept at "managing" potential challenges to its hegemony, has made us indifferent to its ubiquitous presence</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Imperialism has learned that half a million troops do not have to be despatched everywhere; and unless there are half a million troops despatched somewhere, moral indignation is not widespread, and the reality of imperialism goes unrecognized</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">It is an irony of history that coercion which is so effective that it can afford to be silent is scarcely recognized as such</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">it is only on occasions when its effectiveness is diminished to a point where it has to come out in the ugliest of colors that its reality becomes appare</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">nt. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The deafening silence about imperialism in the current Marxist discourse, especially in this country, is thus a reflection of the extraordinary strength and vigor it is displaying at present.</span>



**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Capitalist logic justifies global expansion promoting instability resulting in nuclear war, environmental destruction, and planetary collapse</span>**

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">From the longer view offered by a historical-materialist critique of capitalism, the direction that would be taken by U.S. imperialism following the fall of the Soviet Union was never in doubt. **__Capitalism by its very logic is a globally expansive system.__** The contradiction between its transnational economic aspirations and the fact that politically it remains rooted in particular nation states is insurmountable for the system. Yet, ill-fated attempts by individual states to overcome this contradiction are just as much a part of its fundamental logic. In present world circumstances, **__when one capitalist state has a virtual monopoly of the means of destruction, the temptation for that state to attempt to seize full-spectrum dominance and to transform itself into the de facto global state governing the world economy is irresistible.__** As the noted Marxian philosopher István Mészáros observed in Socialism or Barbarism? (2001)—written, significantly, before George W. Bush became president: “What is at stake today is not the control of a particular part of the planet—no matter how large—putting at a disadvantage but still tolerating the independent actions of some rivals, but __**the control of its totality by one hegemonic economic and military superpower, with all means—even the most extreme authoritarian and, if needed, violent military ones—at its disposal.”The unprecedented dangers of this new global disorder are revealed in the twin cataclysms to which the world is heading at present**__: nuclear proliferation and hence increased chances of the outbreak of __**nuclear war, and planetary ecological destruction.**__ These are symbolized by the Bush administration’s refusal to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to limit nuclear weapons development and by its failure to sign the Kyoto Protocol as a first step in controlling global warming. As former U.S. Secretary of Defense (in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations) Robert McNamara stated in an article entitled “Apocalypse Soon” in the May–June 2005 issue of Foreign Policy: __“__The United States has never endorsed the policy of ‘no first use,’ not during my seven years as secretary or since. We have been and remain prepared to initiate the use of nuclear weapons—by the decision of one person, the president—against either a nuclear or nonnuclear enemy __whenever__ we believe it is in our interest to do so.” __**The nation with the greatest conventional military force and the willingness to use it unilaterally to enlarge its global power is also the nation with the greatest nuclear force and the readiness to use it whenever it sees fit—setting the whole world on edge. The nation that contributes more to carbon dioxide emissions leading to global warming than any other**__ (representing approximately a quarter of the world’s total) __**has become the greatest obstacle to addressing global warming and the world’s growing environmental problems—raising the possibility of the collapse of civilization itself**__ if present trends continue. **__The United States is seeking to exercise sovereign authority over the planet during a time of widening global crisis: economic stagnation, increasing polarization between the global rich and the global poor, weakening U.S. economic hegemony, growing nuclear threats, and deepening ecological decline. The result is a heightening of international instability.__**Other potential forces are emerging in the world, such as the European Community and China, that could eventually challenge U.S. power, regionally and even globally. Third world revolutions, far from ceasing, are beginning to gain momentum again, symbolized by Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution under Hugo Chávez. __**U.S. attempts to tighten its imperial grip on the Middle East and its oil have had to cope with a fierce, seemingly unstoppable, Iraqi resistance, generating conditions of imperial overstretch.**__ With the United States brandishing its nuclear arsenal and refusing to support international agreements on the control of such weapons**,** __**nuclear proliferation is continuing. New nations, such as North Korea, are entering**__ or can be expected soon to enter __**the “nuclear club.” Terrorist blowback from imperialist wars in the third world is now a well-recognized reality**__, generating rising fear of further terrorist attacks in New York, London, and elsewhere. __**Such vast and overlapping historical contradictions, rooted in the combined and uneven development of the global capitalist economy along with the U.S. drive for planetary domination, foreshadow what is potentially the most dangerous period in the history of imperialism.**__</span>



**The alternative is to use the ballot as an opportunity to criticize the system of capitalism as good and here to stay.

The present chapter is the most practical and yet also the most speculative of this work. Beaten down by the great defeats of Utopian and socialist ideals, few today even bother to think about the kinds of society that could replace the present with one of ecological rationality, and most of that speculation is within a green paradigm limited by an insufficient appreciation of the regime of capital and of the depths needed for real change. Instead, Greens tend to imagine an orderly extension of community, accompanied by the use of instruments that have been specifically created to keep the present system going, such as parliamentary elections and various tax policies.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> **__Such measures make transformative sense, however, only if seen as prefigurations of something more radical - something by definition not immediately on the horizon.

However uncertain the end point</span>**__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, the first two steps on the path are clearly laid out, and are within the reach of every conscintious person. These are that people ruthlessly criticize the capitalist system ‘from top to bottom’, and that they include in this a consistent attack on the widespread belief that there can be no alternative to it. If one believes that capital is not only basically unjust but radically unsustainable as well, the prime obligation is to spread the news</span>__**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">just as one should feel obliged to tell the inhabitants of a structurally unsound house doomed to collapse of what awaits them unless they take drastic measures. </span>**__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">To continue the analogy for the critique to matter it needs to be combined with an attack on the false idea that we are, so to speak, trapped in this house, with no hope of fixing it or getting out. </span>__****__<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The belief that there can be no alternative to capital is ubiquitous and no wonder, given how wonderfully convenient the idea is to the ruling ideology. That, however, does not keep it from being nonsense</span>__**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, and a failure of vision and political will. </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Whether or not the vision of ecosocialism offered here has merit, the notion that there is no other way of organizing an advanced society other than capital does not follow. Nothing lasts forever, and what is humanly made can theoretically be unmade. Of course it could be the case that the job of changing it is too hard and capital is as far as humanity can go, in which instance we must simply accept our fate stoically and try to palliate the results. But we don’t know this and cannot know this. There is no proving it one way or the other, and only inertia, fear of change or opportunism can explain the belief in so shabby an idea as that there can be no alternative to capital for organizing society. Logic alone neither persuades nor gives hope; something more solid and material is required, a combination of the dawning insight of just how incapable capital is of resolving the crisis, along with some spark that breaks through the crust of inert despair and cynicism by means of which we have adapted to the system. At some point it has to happen if capital is the efficient cause -</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> **__the realization will dawn that all the sound ideas for__**, say, regulating the chemical industries, or preserving forest ecosystems, or **__doing something serious about species-extinctions, or global warming__**, or whatever point of ecosystemic disintegration is of concern, **__are not going to be realized by appealing to local changes in themselves, or the Democratic Party, or the Environmental Protection Agency__** or the courts, or the foundations, or ecophilosophies. or changes in consciousness **__for the overriding reason that we are living under a regime that controls the state and the economy, and will have to be overcome at its root if we are to save the future.

Its effects are dynamic, not incremental, and like all genuine insights it changes the balance of forces and can propagate very swiftly Thus the release from inertia can trigger a rapid cascade of changes, so that it could be said that the forces pressing towards radical change need not be linear and incremental, but can be exponential in character. In this way, conscientious and radical criticism of the given, even in advance of having blueprints for an alternative, can be a material force, because it can seize the mind of the masses of people.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> **__There is no greater responsibility for intellectuals__**. </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">In what follows, there will be neither blueprints nor omniscience, although I will be laying out certain hypothetical situations as a way of framing ideas. The overall task can be stated simply enough: if an ecological mode of production is the goal, what sort of practical steps can be defined to get us there? What might an ecosocialist society look like? How are the grand but abstract terms of basic change to be expressed as functions of lived life? And how can the path towards an ecosocialism that is not sharply defined incorporate the goal towards which it moves? </span>

**Representations of war only value state-to-state conflict, invoking images of the American people and the dangerous world “outside”. This upholds a unitary identity that is the foundation for violence**
**Shapiro in 97** (Michael, Prof. of PoliSci @ Hawaii, __Violent Cartographies__, Pg. 29-30)
The omission of native peoples from the discourse on war is evident in a recent mapping of contemporary armed struggles. Bernard Nietschmann demonstrates that __although in recent years there has been relatively little warfare between sovereign states, there continue to be enormous casualties and forced dislocations in the struggles between states and various indigenous nations (as well as between states and stateless peoples).__ __Identifying 120 “wars____” in 1987__, Nietschmann found __only 4__ that __involved conflict between two sovereign states, while 100 of the wars were accounted__ __for by struggles in which states were at war with insurgencies and indigenous nations. These struggles have received little attention__, for “media and academia are anchored in the state. Their tendency is to consider struggles against the state to be illegitimate or invisible. . . . They are hidden from view because the fighting is against peoples and countries that are often not even on the map.” Nietschmann’s mapping practice is extraordinary because __the dominant war cartography has opposed state to state. This dominance in representation is matched by a characteristic of narratives of warfare, “histories” that represent only interstate antagonisms__. __At the same time that European states were subjugating the peoples in the peripheral trade zones during the seventeenth century, their rulers “managed to shift the balance decisively against both individual citizens and rival power holders within their own states__.” __This led__, as Charles Tilly has noted, __to the disarmament of the civilian population while the state’s “own armed force began to overshadow the weaponry available to any of its domestic rivals__. __The most important result__, from the point of view of narratives of warfare, __is that whereas the distinction between internal and external politics previously had been unclear, it became mare distinct in terms of both power and representation. The state’s domination of both coercion and its representation resulted in a discourse on war that trivializes what is “inside,” representing within-state violence in terms of law enforcement, the maintenance of domestic security, and so on. By ignoring various forms of disorder within the national imaginary__—that is, perpetuating the fantasy of an untroubled and unitary order— __practices of violence maintain their ontological function. They operate to protect boundaries between the “American people” and a dangerous world “out side’ while the inside is depluralized as a unitary citizen body__.

<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">California’s Proposition 187 was an attempt to build ‘safe homes’ for Californians, not for all of them of course. The political abuse of the image of home as a sheltered and safe place drew upon an ‘exclusionary, territorializing, xenophobic, premodern and patriarchal cult of home’ (Antonopoulos, 1994: 57). It was an elaborate fixing of boundaries, making California a safe home for its ‘legal’ residents based on the exclusionary politics of home. </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">Boundaries</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">,</span><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;"> evidently, not only </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">evoke</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;"> the idea of hospitality, but of hostility and </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">racism</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;"> as well.12 It is important to remember, however, that it is not only the situation of the guest but also the host that needs to be reconsidered since, in the case of </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">immigration, for example</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">, it is ‘both receiving populations and immigrants [that] . . . risk mutual transformation, [that] . . . engage and attenuate their home-yearning for each other’s sakes and for the sake of their political life together’ (Honig, 1999: 203). The point, therefore, is about openings, about ‘keeping open the question of who “the people” (the demos) is’, since the question of democracy ‘always arises at the limit of the demos . . . wherein native, subject, citizen, or people receives its designation as such from the way the human encounter with the stranger and the strange is assumed’ (Dillon, 1999: 120 and 96). </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">There is a need to reconsider the boundary</span>____<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">, not only as a separator but as a connector</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;"> as well, where hospitality comes into play pointing beyond the boundaries. There is a need, perhaps, to reflect on what the title words, in Greek, of this text suggest: Pera – peras – poros: the other side/beyond – limit – passage; ‘beyond the limits that interdict passage’ (Baptist, 1999: 102). There is a need, more importantly, if a cosmopolitan approach is to be assumed, to think about hospitality ‘that would be more than cosmopolitical, that would go beyond strictly cosmopolitical conditions’, that would go beyond the interests, authority, and legislation of the state (Derrida, 1999a: 43). To conclude, </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">there is no way</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">, I would argue, </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">to escape the advent of the stranger</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">, to avoid questions and questionings that tremble, if not stir, the socio-political order that once appeared, perhaps, as a safe home. Nor is there a way to avoid the production of others. </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">What is</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;"> more </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">important</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">, instead of reflecting on the ways by which no other would be produced, </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">is to be able to resist processes that produce and reproduce others</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">; __processes__ </span><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">that stabilize themselves, that close spaces, and </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">that derive their sustainability from the very process of othering</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;"> itself. Again, what is more important, </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">rather than reflecting on the ways by which to avoid the ‘disturbance’ of the stranger, is to be able to provide for the</span>____<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"> social, cultural, institutional, ethical and political spaces where we could learn to engage with and learn from each other</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 6pt;">, while being able to constitute our subjectivities free from subordination, in democratic ways.

**Racism imposed by the west is the root cause of violence**
**Foucault in'76**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">[Michel, Society Must be Defended: Lectures at the College de France, 1975-1976, p. 254-257 Trans. David Macey] </span>
__<span style="font-size: 9pt;">What in fact is racism? It is primarily a way of introducing a break into the domain of life that is under power's control: the break between what must live and what must die</span>__<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. The </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">appearance within the biological continuum of the human race of races, the distinction among races, the hierarchy of races, the fact that certain races are described as good and that others, in contrast, are described as inferior: all this is a way of fragmenting the field of the biological that power controls. It is a way of separating out the groups that exist within a population. It is, in short, a way of establishing a biological type caesura within a population that appears to be a biological domain. This will allow power to treat that population as a mixture of races, or to be more accurate, to treat the species, to subdivide the species it controls, into the subspecies known, precisely, as races. That is the first function of racism: to fragment, to create caesuras within the biological continuum addressed by biopower. Racism also has a second function. Its role is, if you like, to allow the establishment of a positive relation of this type: "The more you kill, the more deaths you will cause" or "The very fact that you let more die will allow you to live more." I would say that this relation ("If you want to live, you must take lives, you must be able to kill") was not invented by either racism or the modern State. It is the relationship of war: "In order to live, you must destroy your enemies." But racism does make the relationship of war-"If you want to live, the other must die" - function in a way that is completely new and that is quite compatible with the exercise </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">of biopower. On the one hand</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, </span>__<span style="font-size: 14pt;">racism makes it possible to establish a relationship betwee</span>____<span style="font-size: 9pt;">n</span>____<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> my </span>____<span style="font-size: 14pt;">life and the death of the other</span>__<span style="font-size: 9pt;">that is not a military or warlike relationship of confrontation, but a biological-type relationship: "</span>__<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The more</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">inferior species die out, the more</span>__<span style="font-size: 14pt;">abnormal individuals are eliminated, the fewer degenerates there will be in the species as a whole</span>__<span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and the more Ias</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">species rather than individual-can live, the stronger I will be, the more vigorous I will be. I will be able to proliferate." The fact that the other dies does not mean simply that I live in the sense that his death guarantees my safety; the death of the other, the death of the bad race, of the inferior race (or the degenerate, or the abnormal) is something that will make life in general healthier: healthier and purer. This is not, then, a military, warlike, or political relationship, but a biological relationship. And the reason this mechanism can come into play is that the enemies who have to be done away with are not adversaries in the political sense of the term; they are threats, either external or internal, to the population and for the population. In the biopower system, in other words, killing or the imperative to kill is acceptable only if it results not in a victory over political adversaries, but in the elimination of the biological threat to and the improvement of the species or race. There is a direct connection between the two. In a normalizing </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">society, __race or__ </span>__<span style="font-size: 14pt;">racism is the precondition that makes killing acceptable</span>__<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">When you have a normalizing society, you have a power which is, at least superficially, in the first instance, or in the first line a biopower, and </span>__<span style="font-size: 14pt;">racism is the indispensable precondition that allow</span>____<span style="font-size: 9pt;">s</span>__<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> someone to be killed, that allows __others to be killed__. Once the State </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">functions in the biopower mode, racism alone can justify the murderous function of the State. So you can understand the importance-I almost said the vital importance-of racism to the exercise of such a power: it is the precondition for exercising the right to kill. If the power of normalization wished to exercise the old sovereign right to kill, it must become racist. And if, conversely, a power of sovereignty, or in other words, a power that has the right of life and death, wishes to work with the instruments, mechanisms, and technology of normalization, it too must become racist. When I say "killing," I obviously do not mean simply murder as such, but also every form of indirect murder: the fact of exposing someone to death, increasing the risk of death for some people, or, quite simply, political death, expulsion, rejection, and so on. I think that we are now in a position to understand a number of things. We can understand, first of all, the link that was quickly-I almost said immediately-established between nineteenth-century biological theory and the discourse of power. Basically, evolutionism, understood in the broad sense-or in other words, not so much Darwin's theory itself as a set, a bundle, of notions (such as: the hierarchy of species that grow from a common evolutionary tree, the struggle for existence among species, the selection that eliminates the less fit) naturally became within a few years during the nineteenth century not simply a way of transcribing a political discourse into biological terms, and not simply a way of dressing up a political discourse in scientific clothing, but a real way of thinking about the relations between colonization, the necessity for wars, criminality, the phenomena of madness and mental illness, the history of societies with their different classes, and so on. Whenever, in other words, there was a confrontation, a killing or the risk of death, the nineteenth century was quite literally obliged to think about them in the form of evolutionism. And we can also understand why racism should have developed in modern societies that function in the biopower mode; we can understand why racism broke out at a number of .privileged moments, and why they were precisely the moments when the right to take life was imperative</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. __Racism first develops with__ colonization, or in other words, with __colonizing__ </span>__<span style="font-size: 14pt;">genocide</span>__<span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">If you are functioning in the biopower mode, how can you justify the need to kill people, to kill populations, and to kill civilizations? By using the themes of evolutionism, by appealing to a racism. War</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. __How can one not only wage war on one's adversaries but also expose one's own citizens to war, and let them be killed by the million__</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">(and this is precisely what has been going on since the nineteenth century, or since the second half of the nineteenth century), </span>__<span style="font-size: 14pt;">except by activating the theme of racism</span>____<span style="font-size: 9pt;">?</span>__<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> From this </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">point onward, war is about two things: it is not simply a matter of destroying a political adversary, but of destroying the enemy race, of destroying that [sort] of biological threat that those people over there represent to our race. In one sense, this is of course no more than a biological extrapolation from the theme of the political enemy. But there is more to it than that. In the nineteenth century-and this is completely new-war will be seen not only as a way of improving one's own race by eliminating the enemy race (in accordance with the themes of natural selection and the struggle for existence), but also as a way of regenerating one's own race. As more and more of our number die, the race to which we belong will become all the purer. </span>

During the "stating" of Australia,89 when the European spatial imaginary was imposed, those on the other side of the frontier, the Aborigines, were given no place in a conversation about boundaries.</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"> __Carter suggests what amounts to a Levinasian ethical frame for treating boundaries. The boundary could be seen as "a corridor of legitimate communication, a place of dialogue, where differences could be negotiated."

To the extent that community, society, and nation fail to reflect the otherness within, we have a cartographic unconscious, an ethics of ethics that establishes a set of exclusionary practices that are represented in the seemingly innocent designations of people and place.

==Taoism 1nc== 
**Death and misfortune are inevitable. The joy of life comes in accepting things //as they are//. Plans to fix the world only destroy us spiritually**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Slabbert</span>**, Taoist teacher and philosopher, **<span style="font-size: 12pt;">2001</span>**
(Jos, “Tao Te Ching: How to Deal With Suffering,” http://www.taoism.net/theway/suffer.htm)

//__If you open yourself to loss__, you are at one with loss and __you can accept it completely__.//

This __openness__, a willingness __and courage to face reality__, __is the only way to deal with suffering__, particularly inescapable suffering. But the openness the poet is describing is more than just facing reality. It is facing reality in total harmony with the Tao:

//If you open yourself to the Tao, you are at one with the Tao and you can embody it completely.//

It is only when you "embody" the Tao that you can face suffering with true equanimity. You will then have the openness that insight into your own nature and the natural way of Tao brings you. __The right approach to suffering is only possible when you have reduced your ego to a minimum__. The less ego you have, the less you suffer. __Facing death with unresolved agendas is a terrible form of suffering__. You will have to let go of selfish interests and futile aims to concentrate on dealing with the moment.

__It is the **acceptance of the inevitable that makes suffering bearable**__.

//On his death bed,//
//his family mourning,//
//he is serene,//
//for he knows//
//__Death__,//
//__like__//
//__Life__,//
//__is an illusion__://
//__there is no beginning and no end__.//

//__There is only the endless flow of Tao__.//

//__The man of Tao has no fear,__//
//__for he walks with Tao.__//

(The Tao is Tao, 154)

Agendas

//__A good traveler has no fixed plans__ and is not intent upon arriving.//

(Chapter 27)

__Plans__, __aims__, __objectives and agendas have become the routes of suffering for so many__ people, and not only the ambitious. __Agendas__ often **__take spontaneity and joy out of life__**. __In the process, many people have become bad travelers, concentrating only on their objectives, and arriving at their destinations only to find that even their destinations are not really worth the trouble.__

Having no fixed plans? This does not sound like survival in a modern technological environment, does it? I mean, who but the extremely fortunate have the luxury of not having agendas running their lives? In most cases, one could justifiably point out, agendas are forced on you by your professional and familial obligations. You do not really have a choice, do you?

How could one then become a good traveler through life in this modern world? I think the key lies in the second line of the quotation. One should not be "intent upon arriving". __You should adopt an attitude of detachment__. The moment your aims become egocentric, your suffering increases. The less your own ego is involved, __the less seriously you__will __take life__, and __the more you will enjoy the journey__. It is easier said than done, though, particularly when the job you are doing seems to be devoid of meaning, and the activities on your agenda tedious. They might even go against what you truly believe.

It is clear. __To become a good traveler in the modern world__ often entails more than just a change of attitude. It could also mean changing your life style, even your profession. It __could mean taking risks__ in the process. __But liberation has always been__ a __risky__ undertaking, hasn’t it? People are willing to take risks for the most mundane things like profit and possession. __Why not take__a few __risks when your spiritual progress is at stake__? Truly good travelers often leave the beaten track and become masters of their own far more adventurous journeys.

Tampering with the world

//__Do you want to improve the world__? __I don't think it can be done__. The world is sacred. It can't be improved. __If you tamper with it__, __you'll ruin it__. __If you treat it like an object__, __you'll lose it__.//

(Chapter 29)

If anything, __the Twentieth Century will be called the century of social engineering__. Simplistic __ideologies__, __like fascism__, __were used to try to change the world__, __with terrible consequences inducing suffering on a scale never seen before__ in the history of the human being. A savage economic system based on greed - capitalism - has ravaged the world.

__Yet__, __the human being has not learnt__ from this. Still, politicians show their ignorance by tampering with the sacred. __It is the age of management__, that euphemistic word for manipulating society. It is still happening. __What else are__many __political programs but tampering with the sacred and ruining it in the process__? __It is the source of endless suffering__.

Forcing issues

//Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men doesn't try to force issues or defeat enemies by force of arms. **__For every force there is a counterforce__**. Violence, even well intentioned, always rebounds upon oneself. __The Master__does his job and then stops. He __understands that **the universe is forever out of control**__, **__and__** that **__trying to dominate events goes against the current of the Tao__**.//

(Chapter 30)

__Understanding that the universe is out of control is the key to wisdom and patience__. __No amount of tampering__ with the universe __will change this__. In fact, __the more we tamper__with it, __the more damage we will do__.

**Take no action to create desired ends—**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kirkland</span>**, professor of Asian religions and Taoism at the University of Georgia, **<span style="font-size: 12pt;">1996</span>**
(Russell, “The Book of the Way,” //Great Literature of the Eastern World//, http://kirkland.myweb.uga.edu/rk/pdf/pubs/DAODE.pdf)
Specifically, __the Tao is humble__, __yielding__, __and non-assertive__. Like a mother, it benefits others selflessly: it gives us all life and guides us safely through it, asking nothing in return. This altruistic emphasis of the Daode jing has seldom been noticed, but it is one of the most important lessons that it draws from the observation of the natural world. __Water__, for instance, __is the gentlest and most yielding of all things__, __yet it__ can overcome the strongest substances, and __cannot__itself __be destroyed__. More importantly, however, water lives for others: it provides the basis of life for all things, and asks nothing in return. __If we__ learn to __live like water does__, __we will be living in accord with the Tao__, and its Power (De) will carry us safely through life. __Such a way of life is called wuwei__, usually __translated as__ "__non-action__." __Wuwei means **foregoing all activity intended to effect desired ends**__. __Instead__, __one should follow one's natural course and allow all other things to do likewise__, __lest our willful interference disrupt things' proper flow__. __Few modern readers have ever grasped the full radicality of the ideal of wuwei__. **__Many of us__** today (like the ancient Chinese Confucians and Mohists) **__look at the world and see things that we think need correcting__**. __The Daode jing would__ actually __have us **do nothing whatsoever about them**__. The repeated phrase "__do nothing__, __and nothing will be undone__" __admonishes us to trust the Tao__ -- __the natural working of things__ -- __and never to do anything about anything__. Actually, __such is the most that anyone can do__, __because the Tao__ -- __as imperceptible as it is__ -- __is the most powerful force in existence__, __and nothing can thwart its unceasing operation__.

**Refuse the harms 1ac presented, don’t let it dampen your spirit, leading to a world of more suffering, they will never find meaning or happiness unless they accept the world as it is, nonaction solves the entirety of the aff better than their political action could**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But is this a form of suffering? Many would argue it is not. It is in fact the spice of life, they would claim. It gives life meaning, they would insist. They would argue that there must be a reason why consumerism has become such an obsession in the modern world. Do not be fooled by this. This preoccupation with possession, manipulation and exploitation is a symptom of spiritual confusion, in fact an acute form of suffering. Like hungry ghosts, people are trying to satisfy the insatiable.</span> __They are driven by their greed, and can never be satisfied, and they never find rest. They are like creatures trying to quench their thirst with salt water. The more they drink, the thirstier they become. Their suffering is acute, no matter how happy they pretend to be. There is a solution to this. Cease being run by your discriminatory faculties. Only then will the essential tolerance on a spiritual level be possible.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Quite simply</span> __accept life as it is. Be like a child. The world is the way you see it. If you see it as full of innocence and beauty, it will be full of innocence and beauty.__ __It does not mean that you deny the presence of ugliness and evil in the world. No, you just **refuse to focus** mainly **on the gloomy side and do not give it a chance to change your perspectives and darken your own spirit. You do not have to search for meaning. Just get rid of your negative thoughts. The meaning of life is life itself. Live it. In this way, you will fill the world with beauty and meaning. It is more powerful than any political program.**__

**The 1ac is an act of masturbation, the affirmative locks themselves inside an ivory tower of academics, and for the price of only one ballot will wish away all the ugliness of the world - we must realize this type of normative thinking does nothing productive, and only leads to more suffering**

__Stop thinking, and end your problems__. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">What difference between yes and no? What difference between success and failure? </span>__Must you value what others value, avoid what others avoid? How ridiculous__!
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Chapter 20)</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The poet’s advice here must be quite</span> __shocking__ __to__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">most </span>__people who have been taught that the solution to our problems should be solved by thinking about them__. __The poet advises us in this poem to stop thinking__.
__Of course, he is not telling us to live like idiots and to abandon the rational in a rational world. That would be disastrous, for in a rational world we have no choice but to use our reason to survive. No, the poet is advising us to stop brooding over problems that cannot be solved by thinking. There are forms of suffering that cannot be solved by thinking about them. They can only be solved by__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">some form of action, or even</span> __non-action__. __These problems fall in the spiritual sphere.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The poet makes clear what he means.</span> __Many__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">mental </span>__problems are__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">problems </span>__related to__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">our dependency on others’ opinions, and</span> __our dedication to our own egos__. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">We tend to give our own status, as well as success and failure, too much weight. We are led by others’ values and prejudices. These are all symptoms of being run by our own egos and our corresponding fear of society’s opinion. We have lost contact with our own selves. We are blown about like leaves in the wind. Isn’t </span>__this a terrible, ridiculous form of suffering? No amount of thinking can relieve you of this suffering. You will have to turn towards your true self again, and find harmony with the Tao. It is a personal, spiritual act of liberation.__

**We must realize death is simply another part of life, all things change no matter how much we don’t want them to, clinging onto life ushers in a sick depressive tone of suffering, all for the fear of death**

//Clinging to life//
__If you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold on to. If you aren't afraid of dying, there is nothing you can't achieve. Trying to control the future is like trying to take the master carpenter's place. When you handle the master carpenter's tools, chances are that you'll cut your hand.__
//(Chapter 74)//
//__Clinging to life is__ indeed __a form of suffering common to most people. It is a form of fear: the fear of dying.__ As the poet clearly says in this poem, it is the most difficult fear to overcome. __Once you have managed to conquer this fear, "there is nothing you can’t achieve."__//
//__Being ruled by this fear shifts your focus from the present to the future, which you will then try to control, but the only thing that will happen__, the poet emphasizes, __is that you will harm yourself.__//
//In fact, what becomes clear is that i__t is essential that you accept "that all things change." Once you have accepted this on a spiritual level, "there is nothing you will try to hold on to". Only when you do not cling to life, will you be able to live a life free from fear, and will you have the courage to accept all stages of life, and will you be able to face life and death with equanimity.__//

Hope and fear are both phantoms that arise from thinking of the self. When we don't see the self as self, what do we have to fear?
(Chapter 11)
__Many people live in fear. Not only fear, but angst. If fear is the fear of something specific, angst is the fear of something overwhelmingly vague and indefinable. It is the feeling of dread and foreboding so many people walk around with daily. Living in fear or angst is a terrible form of suffering, the source of many mental and physical illnesses.__ This text is unequivocal in its analysis. Fear, it says, comes from thinking too much of the self. It is the flip side of hope, which is also part of suffering. __It is only when you realize that the false self, which you fear for, does not exist, that you can be liberated from this fear and hope.__ To be without hope does not mean to be hopeless, but it means not to be trapped by the hope that comes from too high expectations.
__It is only when you have exposed the false self for what it is - an illusion created by yourself - that you will become truly free from fear. Your fear__, this text clearly shows, is self-inflicted, __and your liberation from it is an act of self-liberation.__
