Space exploration may be defined as the investigation, by means of spacecraft, of all the reaches of the universe beyond the atmosphere of the Earth. Spacecraft, vehicles that operate above the Earth's atmosphere, include sounding rockets, Earth satellites, and lunar, planetary, and deep space probes.<br />

In truth, the ambiguity of the term ‘‘exploration’’ has certain advantages, particularly from the perspective of funding and policy making. Because funding of NASA budgets requires broad agreement in Congress, the fuzziness of exploration often avoids triggering debates that would weaken political support. ‘‘In the political realm, it’s not desirable to have too precise a definition’’, according to Scott Hubbard, Stanford Professor of Engineering and Former Director of NASA Ames Research Center, with respect to exploration. Within this environment, explains Hubbard, defining exploration too narrowly ‘‘is not without some peril’’. Ian Pryke, Senior Fellow at George Mason University and Former Head of the European Space Agency’s Washington Office, speaks in similar terms about the word. ‘‘A little bit of constructive ambiguity never hurts.’’ [19]. <br />

Outer space development means different things to different people, and this changes over time. It can mean:<br />
    space exploration, studying planets, moons and stars, and entering into outer space through either robotic or manned (human) missions<br />
    advancements in biological and other sciences and technology, and discoveries and spin off benefits<br />
    satellite telecommunications – cell phones, the  Internet and cable television<br />
    remote sensing, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), visual imagery, mapping or meteorology satellites<br />
    space transportation vehicles, spaceports, launch services and old versus new space vehicles<br />
    space tourism, adventure travel, joyrides, parabolic flights, suborbital flights, short stays in low earth or geostationary orbit in orbital hotels<br />
    space settlement, space colonization, long stays in artificial, closed-ecology human space habitats in free orbit powered by solar power<br />
    mining and extracting minerals from asteroids, The Moon and Mars such as gold, platinum, magnesium, calcium, iron and many others<br />
    The search, discovery and communication with extraterrestrial intelligence <br />

Unfortunately, as of late, the launch  rate for sounding rockets in all disciplines, astrophysics (Fig. 2), heliophysics, and space plasma physics,  has fallen to pre-1960s rates because  of the reduced number of launch  groups that NASA has been able to  support.  Consequently, the pipeline  of science, technology, and workforce  development required in the long term  to maintain a competitive spacefaring  community is at risk (c.f. the National Academies Press Report entitled,  “Rising Above the Gathering Storm:  Energizing and Employing America  for a Brighter Economic Future,” by  Augustine et al.).  The reductions have been brought on in  part by the extreme expense of launching risk-intolerant orbital missions.<br />

The official title of the Outer Space Treaty (‘OST’) mentions both exploration and use of outer space as the two ‘activities of States’ which one has to take into account and which are therefore covered by the Outer Space Treaty. The same pair of terms appears again in the Preamble as well as further articles such as Article I and Article III of the Treaty. Other articles and other space treaties either take up only one of these two terms or use a general terms such as ‘activities in outer space’ (Art. VI, OST) or generally deal with ‘objects launched into outer space’ (Art. VII, Art. VIII, OST and the Registration Convention) or ‘space objects’ (Liability Convention) or finally ‘activities of States on the Moon and other celestial bodies’ (Moon Treaty). At first sight the distinction between exploration and use may seem sufficiently clear. Indeed in connection with most space activities there may be little doubt which of these two terms is applicable. First doubts appear, however, because the Outer Space Treaty speaks of exploration ‘of outer space’. This wording could be interpreted to mean that space must be the object of exploration. The consequence would be that the great part of research which has to take place ‘in space’ in view of the specific physical conditions there, but which has as its object specific materials, would not be covered and might only be considered as ‘use’ of space.<br />

The word ‘‘exploration’’ threads its way through every discussion of human space flight and often headlines national policy statements about the US space agency. Yet this concept, so rooted in our culture, remains remarkably ill-defined. In this paper, we examine various presumptions implicit in the term and its ramifications for federally supported space endeavors. We argue that historical examples of exploration, widely used by policy makers, often make poor models for contemporary space travel. In particular, historical precedents of exploration set up a land-biased view of discovery, a restriction which impedes full expression of the Vision for Space Exploration and its possible scientific returns. These same precedents also set up a view of discovery that is biased toward in situ human presence, a view that modern technology is rendering increasingly absurd.<br />

The Administration has requested a 40% increase in Exim’s borrowing authority. This would keep Exim afloat until 2015. The Republicans, led by Eric Cantor, have made a counter proposal to increase the debt limit by only $13 Billion. Cantor’s plan would have Exim run out of money in less than one year. So there is a fight brewing on this issue. It is the same fight that has been going on over every economic issue. Conservatives want to cut back on big programs, liberals want to expand them as fast as possible. Some on the Pro side include the Administration, big exporters like Boeing, liberals and their press: There are many voices on the Con side: Central to the issues at Exim is Boeing. From 2005 to 2010 Exim financed 634 Boeing aircraft. In 2011 it lent foreign airlines another $11.4B. This lending has surely helped Boeing, but it’s killing the domestic air carriers which have to compete on overseas routes. Delta Airlines has sued Exim over its lending to Air India. The lawsuit has to be resolved as part of the extension of the debt limit. Liberal guys, like Chuck Schumer have been talking to Delta. The proposal is to offset the competitive disadvantage that Exim creates, with new subsidies for the airlines. Subsidies that create inequities that are fixed with more subsidies is bad government. I can’t see the Delta Airlines “fix” getting inked without a large price tag. That cost will be the Republicans insisting that any subsidies be “paid” for with other cuts. A pissing match appears to be in the offing. When S&amp;P downgraded the USA, it pointed at political gridlock and the inability of D.C. to agree to confront issues as the principal reason for the downgrade. The fight over Exim is a good example of that gridlock.<br />

The United States Navy currently operates eleven aircraft carriers. The oldest and least capable is faster, one third larger, and carries three times the aircraft of Admiral Kuznetsov, the largest carrier in the Russian Navy. Unlike China’s only aircraft carrier, the former Russian Varyag, American carriers have engines and are capable of self-propulsion. The only carrier in Indian service is fifty years old and a quarter the size of its American counterparts. No navy besides the United States' has more than one aircraft carrier capable of flying modern fixed wing aircraft. The United States enjoyssimilar dominance in surface combat vessels and submarines, operating twenty-two cruisers, fifty destroyers, fifty-five nuclear attack submarines, and ten amphibious assault ships (vessels roughly equivalent to most foreign aircraft carriers). In every category the U.S. Navy combines presumptive numerical superiority with a significant ship-to-ship advantage over any foreign navy. This situation is unlikely to change anytime soon.The French Navy and the Royal Navy will each expand to two aircraft carriers over the next decade. The most ambitious plans ascribed to the People’s Liberation Army Navy call for no more than three aircraft carriers by 2020, and even that strains credulity, given China’s inexperience with carrier operations and the construction of large military vessels. While a crash construction program might conceivably give the Chinese the ability to achieve local dominance (at great cost and for a short time), the United States Navy will continue to dominate the world’s oceans and littorals for at least the next fifty years.<br />

Cernan 11 – Commander US Navy<br />
“Testimony by Eugene Cernan: &quot;NASA Human Space Flight Past, Present, and Future: Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1191:http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=38492 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=38492" rel="nofollow">http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=38492</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1191 --><br />
As a result of these factors, uncertainty and instability abound. Among the thousands of highly educated workers with unique skills developed over generations, once we lose the older, wiser, mature and experienced folks to retirement, who spent in some cases over five decades learning &quot;what they didn't know they didn't know&quot;, along with those inspired and enthusiastic young minds of today's generation to other endeavors, inertia takes hold of the downward trend and it is difficult, costly and near impossible to reverse. And those young high school and college students whose dreams were to take their generation back to the moon and beyond are now questioning their plans to seek studies in science, engineering and math in the future. And for those fortunate few still at work within NASA or its contracting team, without a goal or mission, their future is bleak. Under this cloud of uncertainty most are seeking stability for themselves and their families by going elsewhere with their talents. I believe therein is the ongoing risk and challenge this country faces in any potential future development of human space systems. It's important to remember that &quot;technology makes it possible, but people make it happen.&quot; Testimony of May 26, 2010: Very little if anything has changed my assessment of the Administration's space policy since my testimony before this Committee over a year ago. I recounted the words of my colleagues and myself in describing the Administration's plan for the future of Space Exploration - &quot;Devastating&quot;, &quot;Slide to mediocrity&quot;, &quot;Third-rate stature&quot;, &quot;Mission to nowhere.&quot; Although with the SLS System we will provide the foundation for designing &quot;missions to somewhere&quot; - they have yet to be defined. So today I stand behind my testimony and convictions of sixteen months ago. Nowhere did I find then nor do I find today one penny in the FY2011 budget proposal in support of Space Exploration. Although I do believe and hope that someday they will succeed, I still assess that those entrepreneurs in the world of commercial space who continue their claims of being able to put humans in space in little more than three years for something less than $5 billion, today still &quot;don't yet know what they don't know.&quot; My statement that &quot;the sole reliance on the Commercial Sector without a concurrent or back-up approach could very well lead to the abandonment of our $100 billion, 25 year investment in the ISS&quot; is now more prophetic than ever. &quot;The space program has never been an entitlement, it's an investment in the future - an investment in technology, jobs, international respect and geo-political leadership, and perhaps most importantly in the inspiration and education of our youth. Those best and brightest minds at NASA and throughout the multitudes of private contractors, large and small, did not join the team to design windmills or redesign gas pedals, but to live their dreams of once again taking us where no man has gone before. If this Administration's agenda continues to override the mandates of Congress, these technicians, engineers, scientists, a generation removed from Apollo, yet re-inspired by the prospect of going back to the moon and on the Mars, will be gone - where I don't know - but gone.&quot; Sixteen months later, the absence of a well-defined NASA program has already resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs throughout the aerospace industry. &quot;America's human space flight program has for a half century risen above partisan differences from Eisenhower to Kennedy to the present day. The challenges and accomplishments of the past were those of a nation - never of a political party or of any individual agenda.&quot; Proven to be true today by the overwhelming Congressional support and mandates to NASA in support of future space developments. &quot;We are at a cross road. If we abdicate our leadership in space today, not only is human spaceflight and space exploration at risk, but I believe the future of this country and thus the future of our children and grandchildren as well. Now is the time for wiser heads in the Congress of the United States to prevail. Now is the time to overrule this Administration's pledge to mediocrity. Now is the time to be bold, innovative and wise in how we invest in the future of America. Now is the time to re-establish our nation's commitment to excellence.&quot;<br />

International cooperation in human spaceflight may be facing its toughest test since the cold war. The immediate concern: Will US astronauts be able to ride Russian rockets between 2010, when the last shuttle is retired, and 2015, when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration expects to launch a replacement? Russian spacecraft are how NASA plans to send its astronauts to the International Space Station. But with tensions rising over Russia’s invasion of Georgia and a US-Polish missile deal, some lawmakers and space-policy analysts worry that the US Congress – or Russia itself – could scuttle the plan. If tensions fail to ease over the longer term, the space station could shift from an orbiting laboratory to a geopolitical bargaining chip. The possibility that international tensions could limit US access to the space station for at least five years “is a real concern,” says Ray Williamson, an analyst with the Secure World Foundation, a space-policy think tank in Superior, Colo. But the notion that the US needs an alternative right away is a bit premature, he adds. Proposals range from extending the shuttle program beyond 2010 to cutting a deal with China, which is ramping up its own human spaceflight effort. Each option faces big budgetary or political challenges. Already, Bush administration officials reportedly have suggested that the full range of US-Russian ties need to be reviewed in light of Moscow’s actions in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. Those tensions appeared to have risen another notch Wednesday when US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski inked a deal under which the US would install antiballistic missiles in northeastern Poland. For the US, the challenge lies in the way the Bush administration crafted its 2004 vision for space exploration. It called for an end to the shuttle program in 2010 and the launch of a replacement, the Ares I and its Orion capsule, by 2015. NASA is working on the Ares I system, along with other major components of its Constellation program, with that deadline firmly in mind. Constellation aims to return humans to the moon by 2020. But that schedule leaves at least a five-year gap with no homegrown way to send astronauts to the space station. The US endured a nearly six-year gap in human spaceflight between the Apollo and shuttle programs. But this time around, the US has a destination in orbit that it has paid big money to build and maintain. NASA Administrator Michael Griffin has called the gap and the need for Russia’s help “unseemly.” To try to narrow the gap, the agency initially set an internal target for launching Ares 1 with its Orion crew capsule in September 2013. But with more-refined cost estimates in hand, and based on an assumption of no new money likely from Congress to support a 2013 deadline, the agency has moved that internal date to September 2014. “The space community has been trying to yell about this for years, but people didn’t pay a lot of attention,” says George Whitesides, executive director of the National Space Society, a space-exploration advocacy group in Washington. “The biggest lesson we should have learned” from the shift from Apollo to the shuttle “is the need to think through the transition between vehicles without gaps.” The first signals about the future may well come from Congress, which is weighing whether to grant NASA a waiver this year from the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Non-Proliferation Act. It did so in 2005 so that NASA could buy astronaut launch services from Russia through 2011. NASA officials have said they need to place their order soon given the lead time the Russians say they to build the new Soyuz capsules NASA would need. Short of holding its nose and granting the waiver, Congress appears to have few options. The US could try to play a China card, notes Vincent Sabathier, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and a former official with the French space agency CNES. In an online commentary last week, he noted that China doesn’t represent an immediate solution. But Chinese space officials have expressed an interest in participating in the space-station program, he notes. And tighter links between the US and Chinese space programs could represent important confidence-building measures affecting other areas of US-Chinese ties. But such a move would require a profound change in US policy that would be a tough sell, especially at this point in the US political cycle, according to Joan Johnson-Freese, a specialist in international space policy who heads the department of national-security studies at the US Naval War College in Newport, R.I. Thus, if Congress turns its back on a waiver for NASA , “that leaves us in a situation of keeping the shuttle on line,” she says. “Then we’re eating our seed corn once again.” The reason: Unless a new president and Congress give NASA enough money to extend the shuttle program – which already is winding down and likely would require a costly recertification of the remaining shuttles – cash to keep the shuttles running probably would come from money NASA plans to spend on the Constellation program. At the end of the day, “Congress will act pragmatically” and grant the waiver, predicts Peggy Finarelli, a senior fellow at the Center for Aerospace Policy Research at George Mason University in Fairfax., Va. While US-Russian relations appear to be growing more rocky, she doesn’t anticipate the space station becoming a bargaining chip for either country. Hearkening back to the Carter administration’s response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and its cancellation of science and technology exchanges in protest, she says that the White House could make that move then because “there was nothing there where you had multibillion-dollar programs where you had invested a lot of your future.” Moreover, over the past 10 to 15 years, the two countries’ space programs and even their space-launch industries have become tightly intertwined. “These relations are not so easy to damage,” says Mr. Whitesides. That, he says, gives some cause for hope that the space station will remain a symbol of international cooperation in space, despite sometimes rocky relations between partners on Earth. <br />

WASHINGTON — When President Obama got on the telephone with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia last month, he was under the impression that they were finally close to wrapping up a long-delayed arms control treaty that he had originally expected to sign in December. Related Times Topic: Russia But to Mr. Obama’s surprise, Mr. Medvedev was not ready to sign off on a deal and raised issues that required more discussion, American officials said. As he hung up, the officials said, a frustrated Mr. Obama realized that the two sides were not as close as he had thought and sent negotiators back to the table. The fitful effort to fashion a treaty that would be a signature achievement of his presidency has demonstrated the hurdles Mr. Obama faces in his drive to reset relations with Russia after years of tension. After months of delay and discord, administration officials said, they have learned that when it comes to deal-making with Moscow, nothing is done until it is done, and rarely will it go as smoothly as anticipated. Negotiators are making a fresh effort this week to break the logjam and finish by the end of the month, so they can showcase the new treaty at an international summit meeting on nuclear nonproliferation that Mr. Obama will host in Washington in April. Underscoring his determination to seal the deal, he sent Ellen Tauscher, the under secretary of state for arms control, to Geneva to help resolve remaining differences, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to travel to Moscow next week. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, predicted Tuesday that the treaty could be finished by the end of the month. “We would push for a conclusion in two to three weeks,” Mr. Lavrov said, according to Russian news agencies. “For this, there is every chance.” The White House also expressed cautious optimism as negotiators went back to work in Geneva. “They are working on the last few remaining issues to a new treaty,” said Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary. “We are certainly hopeful that that can get done in short order.” But Mr. Gibbs added that the administration would not rush a bad deal just to get it done before the summit meeting, scheduled for April 12-13. “If it takes, quite frankly, many more weeks past April to get something that we believe is in our best interest,” he said, then the United States would take the extra time. The arms control treaty is part of a complicated diplomatic effort to forge a new relationship with Russia, interlinked with issues like Iran, missile defense and Afghanistan. Mr. Obama had hoped to restore ties with some relatively easier deals that could lead to more trust and deeper cooperation in areas that have long divided the former adversaries. But even the supposedly easy agreements have been hard. The new arms pact was supposed to be a relatively straightforward replacement of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 1991, known as Start. The administration hoped that a successful negotiation would be a catalyst to a broader and more ambitious round of disarmament talks. Yet when the Start treaty expired in December, the new treaty was still not ready. “This is a marginal no-brainer, and it takes forever and will be a semidifficult ratification fight,” said George Perkovich, a specialist on nonproliferation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a research institute in Washington. “This is complicated stuff.” Some administration officials said both sides had been overly optimistic about how quickly they could transform a relationship that had more baggage than they initially figured. “It’s hard for us to learn how to dance together again,” said a senior administration official, who like others was not authorized to speak on the record in the middle of a delicate negotiation. The American officials said the answer might be persistence and patience. One example is an agreement that Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev reached in Moscow in July to allow American troops and weapons to fly through Russian airspace en route to Afghanistan. Months later, virtually no flights had flown amid bureaucratic delays.<br />

The U.S.-Russia relationship certainly has been in the news lately with the one year anniversary of the “reset” upon us, likelihood of a new START Treaty, and the recent, highly publicized visit by President Medvedev to the United States. Riding on a surge of good will, the U.S.-Russia relationship was put to the test in July by a spy scandal that had potential to derail this progress. In my mind, the quickness with which this potential setback was resolved affirmed both countries’ commitment to the “reset” in our bilateral relationship. For those of us who care about the U.S. relationship with Russia, this is encouraging. Throughout the last 20+ years it is clear that continuing to develop a strong and durable partnership between Russia and the United States was, and is, important to our mutual long-term regional and global strategic interests.<br />

The entire space industrial base is currently being downsized with no net gain of jobs. At the same time we are totally unclear as to what might be the correct levels needed to support the government. Designing, developing, testing, and manufacturing the hardware and software to explore space requires highly skilled people with unique knowledge and technical expertise which takes decades to develop. These technical experts cannot be grown overnight, and once they leave the industry, they rarely return. If the U.S. develops a tremendous vision for space exploration five years from now, but the people with these critical skills have not been preserved and developed, that vision will disappear. We need that vision, that commitment, that certainty right now, not five or ten years from now, if we are going to have a credible chance of bringing it to fruition. In addition to difficulties in retaining our current workforce, the uncertainty facing the U.S. space program is already having a negative impact on our industry’s ability to attract new talent from critical science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Young graduates who may have been inspired to follow STEM education plans because of their interest in space and space exploration look at the industry now and see no clear future. This will have implications on the space industrial base for years to come.<br />

Unfortunately, as of late, the launch rate for sounding rockets in all disciplines, astrophysics (Fig. 2), heliophysics, and space plasma physics, has fallen to pre-1960s rates because  of the reduced number of launch  groups that NASA has been able to  support.  Consequently, the pipeline of science, technology, and workforce development required in the long term  to maintain a competitive spacefaring  community is at risk (c.f. the National Academies Press Report entitled,  “Rising Above the Gathering Storm:  Energizing and Employing America  for a Brighter Economic Future,” by  Augustine et al.).   The reductions have been brought on in part by the extreme expense of launching risk-intolerant orbital missions.<br />

The SRP uses surplus military motors in the rocket stacks wherever possible, reducing the cost. These decommissioned military motors cannot be sold, but are available at no charge to other government agencies. With appropriate inspection, refurbishment, and outfitting these motors are usable for sounding rockets and have a demonstrated high success rate (&gt;97 percent). The SRP is required to procure commercial rocket motors for the upper stages of some rockets, as no option for utilizing government surplus currently exists.<br />

In addition to Kepler and Chandra — which the committee recommended NASA keep in service through 2016 — the other astrophysics missions that have been cleared for continued operations are:<br />
 •the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, launched in 2008.<br />
 •the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), launched in 1990 but last refurbished in 2009.<br />
 •Planck, a European satellite launched in 2009.<br />
 •Suzaku, a Japanese X-ray astronomy satellite launched in 2005.<br />
 •Swift Gamma-ray Burst Mission, launched in 2004.<br />
 •the Warm Spitzer Space Telescope Mission, which has been operating since 2009 without the coolant that kept its infrared instruments chilled for its first five-and-a-half years in orbit.<br />
 •XMM-Newton, a European X-ray observatory launched in 1999.<br />
&quot;These nine missions comprise an extremely strong ensemble to enter the Senior Review process and we find that all are making very significant scientific contributions,&quot; wrote the 12-member committee that conducted the 2012 Senior Review of Operating Missions in the NASA Astrophysics Division.<br />

No internal link—commercial crew would be cut<br />
Space News 3-29<br />
(Leone, Dan, March 29, 2012, “Sen. Mikulski Questions NASA Commercial Crew Priority”, Space News, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1199:http://www.spacenews.com/policy/120329-mikulski-questions-commercial-priority.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spacenews.com/policy/120329-mikulski-questions-commercial-priority.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spacenews.com/policy/120329-mikulski-questions-commercial-priority.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1199 -->)<br />
Hutchison, who led the effort to have part of the ISS designated as a U.S. national laboratory, told Bolden that NASA was asking too much money for the Commercial Crew Program and that the agency should shrink the program. <br />
“NASA is continuing to throw money at too many companies with a hope of flying astronauts,” Hutchison said. “Members of Congress are already coalescing around NASA choosing no more than two companies … If you adhere to three or four, you’re going to go over the budget.” <br />
NASA wants to spend $830 million annually on the Commercial Crew Program from 2013 through 2017, according to the White House budget request released in February. Proposals were due March 23 for the next phase of the program, which is meant to keep at least two competing systems on track for a crewed orbital demonstration in 2017. <br />
Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) blasted NASA’s commercial crew partners as “the future Solyndras of the space industry,” a reference to a solar panel company that went bankrupt last year after receiving a half-billion dollars in U.S. government backing <br />
“When is this administration going to get the message that the Congress, I believe, is not willing to subsidize so-called commercial vendors at the expense of NASA’s core mission of engineering and exploration?” Shelby asked Bolden. <br />
Shelby, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, is a strong supporter of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., where the next government-owned heavy-lift rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), is being developed. <br />
Shelby, like Hutchison, has criticized NASA for seeking a big increase for commercial crew while slowing spending on SLS and its companion deep-space crew capsule, the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. <br />
Hutchison, among the most vocal supporters of SLS and Orion in all of Congress, appeared tired of wrangling with Bolden over that issue. <br />

Non-unique: new budget and sequestration doom NASA funding<br />
Space News 3-29<br />

Mikulski Questions NASA Commercial Crew Priority”, Space News, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1200:http://www.spacenews.com/policy/120329-mikulski-questions-commercial-priority.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spacenews.com/policy/120329-mikulski-questions-commercial-priority.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spacenews.com/policy/120329-mikulski-questions-commercial-priority.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1200 -->)<br />
 Besides scrutinizing the Commercial Crew Program, Mikulski also asked Bolden whether NASA was formulating a plan to deal with further budget cuts in the form of sequestration — automatic cuts to federal discretionary spending that would take effect in 2013 unless Congress enacts a new deficit-reduction plan. She said NASA’s budget would be cut a further 8 percent if sequestration takes effect. As it stands, the White House is proposing to cut NASA’s nearly $17.8 billion budget by roughly $60 million next year. <br />
