**The Aff justifies space exploration through a politics of fear – this is ideologically biased and causes militarization**
**Mellor 7**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Felicity, Lecturer in Science Communication – Imperial College (UK), “Colliding Worlds: Asteroid Research and the Legitimization of War in Space”, Social Studies of Science, 37(4), August, p. 499-502)</span>

**This quest for security in an inherently chaotic and insecure world guarantees extinction**

**Thus the alternative—reject the affirmative to refuse the logic of security entrenched in the 1AC. Refusing security entails challenging the politics of knowledge that allow its claim to dominance.**
**Burke, IR prof, 2—**<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Lecturer of IR at U New South Wales (Anthony, “Aporias of security,” January-March 2002, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3225/is_1_27/ai_n28906090/pg_1?tag=content;col1, AMiles) </span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Security is a psychological construct—the aff’s scenarios for conflict are products of paranoia that project our violent impulses onto the other </span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Mack 91</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">– Doctor of Psychiatry and a professor at Harvard University (John, “The Enemy System” http://www.johnemackinstitute.org/eJournal/article.asp?id=23 *Gender modified)</span>

The mass media, taking their cues from the leadership, contribute powerfully to the process.</span>
**Their paranoid projections guarantee extinction—it’s try or die** 
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hollander 3</span> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">– professor of Latin American history and women's studies at California State University (Nancy, "A Psychoanalytic Perspective on the Politics of Terror:In the Aftermath of 9/11" www.estadosgerais.org/mundial_rj/download/FLeitor_NHollander_ingl.pdf)</span>

**Vote negative to interrogate cycles of enemy creation—this can create a fissure in dominant narratives that make war inevitable**
