=Affirmative= 
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Contention 1 is Abjection</span>
====So, what //is// abjection?==== 
====Each individual will face events in their life that threaten their identity or subjecthood. At these times when something disturbs his or her identity a person feels as though the threatening //__thing__// contaminates him or her//.// The Subject therefore attempts to create a border that keeps this disturbing //__thing__//away. The //__thing__//is thus cast away and expelled. This is abjection.====

__As Kristeva herself ...__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> keep them apart</span>

====Abjection is the expulsion of this previously mentioned //__thing__//signified by the abject. The abject is that creepy phenomenon we separate from ourselves. This inner experience is an inherently indeterminable process, since it focuses on the liminal – or utterly ambiguous – phenomenon that produces affective connections to the subject. The occurrence that disturbs a subject’s identity provokes the experience of abjection.====

====Corpses and blood represent abjects. Society determines that they must be cast away because they are tenebrous and therefore understood as gross. Each superego is relegated an abject because the superego chooses to abhor and reject a given object.====

__Abjection is ...__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> contour through disgust. </span>

====Abjection is a repressive process in which the self is forced to repress phenomena because they are quote-on-quote “dangerous”. This puts one into a constant state of defense. The world cannot just be. But, rather, must be cleansed of all abjects. Therefore, we engage in a constant attempt to actualize a fantasy in which there are no abjects. But abjects are inevitable. Attempting to escape this both creates violent lash outs against any perceived abject, and destroys any hope of worthwhile existence for the abjecting individual creating a constant feeling of dejection.==== 

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sjoholm 5</span>(Cecilia, Senior Lecturer at the University of Sotodern in Comparative Literature, __Kristeva and the Political,__ 2005)

__Abjection__ __is the ... self and other.__
====Furthermore, this politics of lashing out at the abject has historically been the progenitor of all forms of xenophobia – when the Europeans saw the Africans, their identity was disturbed by the shock of the existence of another sentient being who appeared so radically different from their Selves. Thus, they cast away the black body and stripped its possessor of his or her subjecthood, so that they could continue feeling safe within their own pipedream of a white world.====

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Contention 2 is the topic</span>
====<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 14pt;">This year we are posed the question whether United States Federal Government should invest in transportation infrastructure. Traditionally, an affirmative team will investigate a concrete policy to alter transportation infrastructure. However, we choose to confront the abjects inherent in the resolution. </span>==== 
====<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 14pt;">This mode of interrogation makes it immediately clear that there is an integral connection between the resolution, individuation, and abjection. The resolution provides several liminal spaces that can disrupt an individual’s identity – these liminal spaces are abjected. That is, no one reads affirmatives surrounding the affective connections to identity that these forms of transportation infrastructure provide. </span>==== 
====<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 14pt;">So, we isolate three liminal spaces and choose to confront, and affirm, them. In so affirming, we are able to negate abjection in the context of the resolution, and the debate sphere. Thus, we encounter the pleasure of our organic mind, less the superego, through the ballot.</span>==== 

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Thus the liminal spaces:</span>
====First is the road. The road functions as an intermediary zone that bridges childhood and adulthood. While the street provides the chance for the child to feel free, to play football, or to run around; it also provides the adult the feeling of freedom because driving invokes an explicitly joyous reaction, since it is the act of enjoying on one’s own. Further, it provokes a malaise concerning the dangers of the road. The road is a sphere where the subject achieves a new form of agency that abandons the age-concerned superego, and rather creates an entropic identity. This conjures an experience that rejects the superego. Society therefore abjects it.==== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Christensen and O’Brien 3</span>(Pia and Margaret, Senior Researcher at the National Institute of Public Health, Copenhagen, Denmark and professor of psychosocial studies at the University of East Anglia, __Children in the City: Home, Neighborhood, and Community__, 2003)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">She describes how ...</span>__demolishing of structures.”__

====Second is the airport. The airport is another scape of abjection that subverts the repressive superego. It is a zone that exists between two places – the earth and the sky. For this reason, it is ambiguous. It is a place where the subject temporarily waits. However, it is a non-place in because it has no use other than to be a distracton. The airport borders both anxiety and pleasure and in this way is subjectively disturbing.====

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This pleasurable postfunctionalism ...</span> __“increasing per-passenger dwelltime”__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Chandler, 2002, p. 2).</span>

====Third is the urban, the suburban, and the journey between the two. The urban and suburban correspond to the masculine-feminine dichotomy, respectively, and in both locations these two phenomena externally impose an identity on the subject. The journey between the two is ambiguous in terms of identity because it is neither masculine nor feminine, but is affected by both. Not only is the subject’s identity externally imposed on them but it is an unknown external imposition and is therefore abjected because the superego fears subsumption.==== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Brooks 98</span>(Brooks, Karen. "Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection And Subjectivity In Australian 'Grunge' Fiction." Australian Literary Studies 18.4 (1998): 87. Academic Search Complete.Web. 21 Dec. 2012.)

__The construction of ... adjectives like 'suburban'.__


====<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 14pt;">Hence, Kushal and I advocate that United States Federal Government should substantially increase its investment in transportation infrastructure in the United States. </span>==== 
====<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 14pt;">We choose to interrogate the resolution and affirm the abject by confronting and embracing the liminal spaces intrinsic to the resolution. We advocate a holistic investment in transportation infrastructure because the liminal spaces we have isolated are abjects and we choose to dismantle the constant process of abjection by affirming those abjects. We will holistically defend these spaces and transportation infrastructure however we do not defend fiat and will not defend against disads premised on fiat.</span>==== 


**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 14pt;">Our argument is simple. There are abjects in the resolution that are avoided. These are what we claim are liminal spaces, that is the road, the airport, and urban/suburban infrastructure. The road is a liminal space in terms of identity because the subject can take on a hybrid identity of adult and child in which their existence is multiple yet non-existent. The airport is a liminal space because it is the intermediary zone between destinations in which anxiety is amplified by waiting. This is where our understanding of anxiety is heightened and we therefore try to avoid thinking about it. The urban/suburban infrastructure is liminal because they correspond to the masculine-feminine dichotomy and the person traveling between the two therefore is affected abjectly in the context of this infrastructure. Our argument is that abjection, or the process of casting out because something is disturbing, is bad because we are trapped in a constant attempt to rid the world of these abjects. However, the abject is an inevitable condition of life and the gap between the fantasy we aim for and the reality creates a feeling of dejection within us in which we can't experience the organic enjoyment of life. So, to stop this form of dejection and abjection, we say to affirm the abjects in the resolution.</span>**
