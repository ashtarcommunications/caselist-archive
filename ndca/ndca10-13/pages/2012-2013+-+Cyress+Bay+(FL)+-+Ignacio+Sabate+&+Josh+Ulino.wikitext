====Current funding for transportation infrastructure has alienated people with disabilities from society by robbing them of their mobility==== 
//AAPD, 2012//<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> (The American Association of People With Disabilities, “Equity in Transportation for People with Disabilities”, May 23, http://www.infrastructureusa.org/equity-in-transportation-for-people-with-disabilities/)</span>

====Thus the plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its investment in universally designed transportation infrastructure in the United States.==== 
==<span style="font-size: 16pt;">Advantage 1: Automobility</span>==

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Car culture results in millions of deaths and injuries per year: it ensures both the production of impairments and continued exclusion of people with disabilities, ensuring shorten life spans for countless individuals.</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Aldred and Woodcock 08</span>**



====And – The eugenic gaze cast by our relationship to disability culminates in the genocidal impulse – the institutional spaces of exclusion epitomized by transportation policies legitimize state-sponsored violence====

===Adv 2: Stigma=== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Current transportation infrastructure relies on segregated services for people with disabilities, enforcing a naturalized binary between abled and disabled stigmatizing these bodies with their association with second class services.</span>
//Silvers 1996//<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> (Anita, professor and chair of the Philosophy Department, San Francisco State University, Disability, Discrimination, and Difference, pg 23-26)</span>


====Segregated systems ensure that people with disabilities will remain invisible and excluded from political and public spaces of interaction. This creates a central dependency of people with disability on charitable welfare services while ensuring that their voices are never heard.==== 
//Sinyo 2011//<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> (Josephine, first blind woman lawyer in Kenya.

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The segregation of people with disabilities underlies able-nationalism, where the national body is purified of abnormal bodies, discourses, and activities. </span>

====Exclusion of disabled bodies underlies all forms of oppression and mass death; All oppressive systems operate by isolating and eliminating people with traits deemed inferior and deviant. Only by reconceiving how disabled bodies appear can we begin to undo the underlying justification for all forms of violence against disqualified populations.====
