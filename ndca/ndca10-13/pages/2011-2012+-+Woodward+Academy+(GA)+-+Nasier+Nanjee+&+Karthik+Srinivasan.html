Paul Kennedy was probably right: the US will go the way of all great powers — down. The individual dramas of the past decade — the September 2001 terrorist attacks, prolonged wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis — have delivered the world a message: US primacy is in decline. This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline, but it encompasses a trend that appears to be negative and perhaps alarming. Although the US still possesses incomparable military prowess and its economy remains the world’s largest, the once seemingly indomitable chasm that separated America from anyone else is narrowing. Thus, the global distribution of power is shifting, and the inevitable result will be a world that is less peaceful, liberal and prosperous, burdened by a dearth of effective conflict regulation. Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts. However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid. As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves.’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law. Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that America’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes$A world without American hegemony is one where great power wars re-emerge, the liberal international system is supplanted by an authoritarian one, and trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy.<br />

<strong>Hegemony creates structural disincentives for war—theoretical and empirical evidence</strong><br />
<strong>Wohlforth 9</strong> — William C. Wohlforth, Daniel Webster Professor of Government at Dartmouth College, holds an M.Phil. and Ph.D. in Political Science from Yale University, 2009 (“Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War,” World Politics, Volume 61, Number 1, January, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Project MUSE, p. 29-31)<br />
The upshot is a near scholarly consensus that unpolarity’s consequences for great power conflict are indeterminate and that a power shift resulting in a return to bipolarity or multipolarity will not raise the specter of great power war. This article questions the consensus on two counts. First, I show that it depends crucially on a dubious assumption about human motivation. Prominent theories of war are based on the assumption that people are mainly motivated by the instrumental pursuit of tangible ends such as physical security and material prosperity. This is why such theories seem irrelevant to interactions among great powers in an international environment that diminishes the utility of war for the pursuit of such ends. Yet we know that people are motivated by a great many noninstrumental motives, not least by concerns regarding their social status. 3 As John Harsanyi noted, “Apart from economic payoffs, social status (social rank) seems to be the most important incentive and motivating force of social behavior.”4 This proposition rests on much firmer scientific ground now than when Harsanyi expressed it a generation ago, as cumulating research shows that humans appear to be hardwired for sensitivity to status and that relative standing is a powerful and independent motivator of behavior.5 [end page 29] Second, I question the dominant view that status quo evaluations are relatively independent of the distribution of capabilities. If the status of states depends in some measure on their relative capabilities, and if states derive utility from status, then different distributions of capabilities may affect levels of satisfaction, just as different income distributions may affect levels of status competition in domestic settings. 6 Building on research in psychology and sociology, I argue that even capabilities distributions among major powers foster ambiguous status hierarchies, which generate more dissatisfaction and clashes over the status quo. And the more stratified the distribution of capabilities, the less likely such status competition is. Unipolarity thus generates far fewer incentives than either bipolarity or multipolarity for direct great power positional competition over status. Elites in the other major powers continue to prefer higher status, but in a unipolar system they face comparatively weak incentives to translate that preference into costly action. And the absence of such incentives matters because social status is a positional good—something whose value depends on how much one has in relation to others.7 “If everyone has high status,” Randall Schweller notes, “no one does.”8 While one actor might increase its status, all cannot simultaneously do so. High status is thus inherently scarce, and competitions for status tend to be zero sum.9 I begin by describing the puzzles facing predominant theories that status competition might solve. Building on recent research on social identity and status seeking, I then show that under certain conditions the ways decision makers identify with the states they represent may prompt them to frame issues as positional disputes over status in a social hierarchy. I develop hypotheses that tailor this scholarship to the domain of great power politics, showing how the probability of status competition is likely to be linked to polarity. The rest of the article investigates whether there is sufficient evidence for these hypotheses to warrant further refinement and testing. I pursue this in three ways: by showing that the theory advanced here is consistent with what we know about large-scale patterns of great power conflict through history; by [end page 30] demonstrating that the causal mechanisms it identifies did drive relatively secure major powers to military conflict in the past (and therefore that they might do so again if the world were bipolar or multipolar); and by showing that observable evidence concerning the major powers’ identity politics and grand strategies under unipolarity are consistent with the theory’s expectations.<br />

<strong>Hegemonic decline causes transition wars</strong><br />
<strong>Goldstein 7— A</strong>very Goldstein, David M. Knott Professor of Global Politics and International Relations at the University of Pennsylvania, Associate Director of the Christopher H. Browne Center for International Politics, Senior Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, holds a Ph.D. from the University of California-Berkeley, 2007 (“Power transitions, institutions, and China's rise in East Asia: Theoretical expectations and evidence,” Journal of Strategic Studies, Volume 30, Number 4-5, August-October, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Taylor &amp; Francis Online, p. 647-648)<br />
Two closely related, though distinct, theoretical arguments focus explicitly on the consequences for international politics of a shift in power between a dominant state and a rising power. In War and Change in World Politics, Robert Gilpin suggested that peace prevails when a dominant state’s capabilities enable it to ‘govern’ an international order that it has shaped. Over time, however, as economic and technological diffusion proceeds during eras of peace and development, other states are empowered. Moreover, the burdens of international governance drain and distract the reigning hegemon, and challengers eventually emerge who seek to rewrite the rules of governance. As the power advantage of the erstwhile hegemon ebbs, it may become desperate enough to resort to the ultima ratio of international politics, force, to forestall the increasingly urgent demands of a rising challenger. Or as the power of the challenger rises, it may be tempted to press its case with threats to use force. It is the rise and fall of the great powers that creates the circumstances under which major wars, what Gilpin labels ‘hegemonic wars’, break out.13<br />
Gilpin’s argument logically encourages pessimism about the implications of a rising China. It leads to the expectation that international trade, investment, and technology transfer will result in a steady diffusion of American economic power, benefiting the rapidly developing states of the world, including China. As the US simultaneously scurries to put out the many brushfires that threaten its far-flung global interests (i.e., the classic problem of overextension), it will be unable to devote sufficient resources to maintain or restore its former advantage over emerging competitors like China. While the erosion of the once clear American advantage plays itself out, the US will find it ever more difficult to preserve the order in Asia that it created during its era of preponderance. The expectation is an increase in the likelihood for the use of force – either by a Chinese challenger able to field a stronger military in support of its demands for greater influence over international arrangements in Asia, or by a besieged American hegemon desperate to head off further decline. Among the trends that alarm [end page 647] those who would look at Asia through the lens of Gilpin’s theory are China’s expanding share of world trade and wealth (much of it resulting from the gains made possible by the international economic order a dominant US established); its acquisition of technology in key sectors that have both civilian and military applications (e.g., information, communications, and electronics linked with the ‘revolution in military affairs’); and an expanding military burden for the US (as it copes with the challenges of its global war on terrorism and especially its struggle in Iraq) that limits the resources it can devote to preserving its interests in East Asia.14<br />
Although similar to Gilpin’s work insofar as it emphasizes the importance of shifts in the capabilities of a dominant state and a rising challenger, the power-transition theory A. F. K. Organski and Jacek Kugler present in The War Ledger focuses more closely on the allegedly dangerous phenomenon of ‘crossover’– the point at which a dissatisfied challenger is about to overtake the established leading state.15 In such cases, when the power gap narrows, the dominant state becomes increasingly desperate to forestall, and the challenger becomes increasingly determined to realize the transition to a new international order whose contours it will define.<br />

<strong>The pursuit of hegemony is inevitable—the only question is effectiveness</strong><br />

This hegemony is by no means fated to end any time soon, however, given that the United States remains predominant by most conventional indicators of national power. The character of the United States’ hegemonic behavior in the future will thus remain an issue of concern both within the domestic polity and internationally. Yet the juvenescence of the United State’s “unipolar moment,” combined with the disorientation produced by the September 11 attacks, ought to restrain any premature generalization that the imperial activism begun by the Clinton administration, and which the Bush administration took to its most spirited apotheosis, would in some way come to define the permanent norm of US behavior in the global system. In all probability, it is much more likely that the limitations on US [end page 54] power witnessed in Afghanistan and Iraq will produce a more phlegmatic and accommodating United States over the longer term, despite the fact that the traditional US pursuit of dominance — understood as the quest to maintain a preponderance of power, neutralize threatening challengers, and protect freedom of action, goals that go back to the foundations of the republic — is unlikely to be extinguished any time soon.<br />
Precisely because the desire for dominance is likely to remain a permanent feature of US geopolitical ambitions — even though how it is exercised will certainly change in comparison to the Bush years — the central task facing the next administration will still pertain fundamentally to the issue of US power. This concern manifests itself through the triune challenges of: redefining the United States’ role in the world, renewing the foundations of US strength, and recovering the legitimacy of US actions. In other words, the next administration faces the central task of clarifying the character of US hegemony, reinvigorating the material foundations of its power, and securing international support for its policies.<br />

<strong>Information dominance is key to deterrence and hegemony</strong><br />

Introducing <u><a class="wiki_link" href="/home">language</a></u> that would later find its way to doctrine, the report asserted, “information dominance could well be the sine qua non for effective military operations in future conflicts” 112 and “information superiority could be the decisive operation in future conflicts.” 113 Furthermore, the report speculated that, since belligerents also understand the decisive nature of information dominance – especially after witnessing the Gulf War -- a zero-sum-game phenomenon would likely ensue. To allow enemy exploitation of information networks during peacetime would risk enemy information dominance, “which would quickly lead to the progressive inability of friendly forces to execute the highly integrated, information-intensive military operations that will be crucial to success in war.” 114 The report asserted that during war the United States would likely achieve information dominance through a “full-dimensional operation.” In essence, if the United States failed to maintain continuous information dominance, it would lose the deterrent and coercive power of its military force.<br />

<strong>We’ll isolate three scenarios</strong><br />
<strong>First is Jamming—</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Current U.S. satellites are vulnerable to jamming</strong><br />

Space-based threats proliferate as a result of the ever-growing global availability of technology and <u><a class="wiki_link" href="/home">access</a></u> to the space domain. There are huge incentives for states to invest in and use space, and the spread of space technologies has occurred. States with sufficient resources can now reach out to space and ‘‘touch’’ satellites through a variety of means, and achieve one and even more of the five Ds. Spacecraft are vulnerable to direct ascent weapons as demonstrated by the Chinese ASAT test, and to a variety of other groundbased, airborne, and space-based ASAT technologies. Direct-ascent launched, or orbit-based nuclear devices, can be detonated, generating radiation and other lethal effects to destroy unshielded electronics over a wide lethal range. Co-orbital ASATs could be employed, comparable to the old Soviet system that was tested extensively in the 1970s and early 80s. In a less likely scenario, space-borne mines can also be deployed in close proximity to spacecraft, or exploded to generate debris clouds that destructively engage whole classes of satellites in the same orbital plane or in crossing orbits. Ground, space-based, or airborne lasers could be used by adversaries to wreak havoc. Blinding operations could be executed and inflict effects ranging from temporary ‘‘dazzling’’ to permanent burnout of optical or other sensors with intense energy bursts. Ground systems, supporting communications, and their nodes, are vulnerable to diverse land, sea, or air kinetic attacks, including sabotage. Unprotected systems are also susceptible to electronic attack through jamming and electromagnetic deception techniques. Jammers emit signals that mask or prevent reception of desired signals; these methods can disrupt uplinks, downlinks, and even cross-links. By disabling the means of command and control, and data communications, jammers render satellites inoperable or unavailable. Electromagnetic deception techniques can be employed to confuse systems; this could include sending false, but deceptively plausible, commands that cause spacecraft to perform damaging or wasteful maneuvers, modify databases or execute configuration changes, or otherwise destroy it. Similarly, supporting terrestrial ground stations, computer networks, and links are vulnerable to information operation and cyber attacks. These attacks could involve directing global denial of service tasks, injecting fake commands, malicious software and viruses into the space system, performing unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of sensitive information (data interception), and causing unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of network information, services, and databases.<br />

<strong>Satellite vulnerabilities collapse hegemony—causes Taiwan War—most likely scenario for conflict</strong><br />

One senior Air Force officer said that thanks to satellite technology the U.S. no longer fights in the fog of war, but in a “huge cloud of electrons.” However, because four-fifths of America’s military data is transmitted through unhardened commercial satellites, and a single Global Hawk unmanned surveillance drone flying over the Middle East can consume several times more bandwidth than was used in the whole of the 1991 war against Iraq, Air Force officers commonly describe space as being America’s “Achilles Heel.” 34 Referring to China’s January 11, 2007 direct-ascent ASAT test, General Hamel of the Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center said “if they take our asymmetric advantage in space, we go from an information age war machine to an industrial age war machine…shifting the balance; the edge will go to the adversary.” 35 Many specialists also argue that aside from the U.S. military dependency on orbital space, the U.S. economy, and in turn, much of the world economy, is also rapidly becoming dependent on space-based systems. They posit that, in effect, the U.S. is now a “space faring” nation whose very way of life is tied to the myriad capabilities provided by the orbital space medium. War games conducted as part of U.S. national security protocols, such as the Army-After-Next, Navy Global and Air Force Global Engagement series, Space Game 2 and Schriever 1 &amp; 2, as well as the privately conducted “DEADSATS” war games, conducted from the late 1990s and the early 2000s, confirm this view. According to some space experts who were intimately involved with the war games, the exercises exposed “a critical national Achilles heel that politicians, economists and corporate CEOs have largely ignored…losses in space can quickly affect the economic, social, and national security fabric not only of the United States, but of the entire world.” These experts further speculate that “large military powers,” such as the United States, could “be held hostage by the unknowns inherent in a new kind of war.” 36 These concerns are directly linked with China’s ASAT weapons and their potential applicability in any future U.S.-Sino conflict. A more recent war game, “Pacific Vision,” conducted by Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) underscored the vulnerability of the unprotected commercial communication satellite channels on which the Air Force relies, as well as its cyber and radar vulnerabilities to Chinese attack. 37 Any possible U.S. military contingency around the Taiwan Strait would require secure satellites as the U.S. becomes ever more reliant upon its space systems. Moreover, reconnaissance satellites are thought to limit the risk inherent in the build-up of forces that both the PRC and the U.S. could be expected to deploy to the region in the event of a crisis. However, if the U.S. was blinded as the result of a preemptive Chinese ASAT attack, the conflict could quickly escalate to a dangerous level. According to two experts on the subject, “if there is a great-power war in the twenty-first century, our crystal ball says that it will be between the United States and China over Taiwan, with a very serious potential for a horrible escalatory process.” 38 This underscores the gravity of the topic as well as the negative impact the Chinese shift towards fielding ASAT weapons could have.<br />

<strong>US-China War over Taiwan goes nuclear—rapid escalation—only information solves</strong><br />

Bush, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and director of its Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, Michael O'Hanlon, senior fellow in Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution, where he specializes in U.S. defense strategy (“A War Like No Other: The Truth About China's Challenge to America”, p. 186, google books)<br />
If war resulted, escalation pressures would be enormous. It would be the first significant war between nuclear weapons states in world history. And the nuclear arsenals of the two sides could, as unreasonable and illogical as it sounds, come into play. Nuclear exchanges could even result. At a time when the threat of superpower nuclear war has become much less vivid in the public eye due to the end of the Cold War, a Taiwan crisis could—ironically enough—quickly create the most serious nuclear risk since the Cuban Missile Crisis. The conclusion is not intended to be melodramatic. Even in the event of war, the risk of nuclear conflagration would be be much less than fifty-fifty, since both sides would surely recognize the dangers. But crises have dynamics all their own. What neither side would see as desirable could nonetheless occur as the fog of war impeded accurate and timely information flows and clouded leaders’ judgments—and as the loss of lives raised the stakes to the point where neither Beijing nor Washington could easily back down. In addition, the war plans of the two sides could create momentum of their own. Although details are classified (and always changing in any even), in the past these war plans apparently have called for hastier escalation than political leaders generally appreciate. This may have changed of late, and certainly recent American commanders in the region have been sensitive to the need to build positive relationships with China and to avoid assuming that conflict would quickly escalate. But predisposition to restraint may not easily survive direct combat with a major military power; arguments in favor of rapid escalation will be powerful, whether or not the carry the day. Leaders in Taiwan, China, and the United States need to think these issues through thoroughly in advance—for the sake of their war plans, their diplomacy, and their politics. They must figure out how to avoid escalation in any serious crisis or war that beings—for once the three parties get to that point, avoiding all-out U.S.-China war is more important than other realistic concerns. Indeed, it is so paramount in importance that Taipei, Beijing, and Washington must avoid the temptation to manufacture crises or play politics with the independence of sovereignty issues.<br />

<strong>Second is Net-Centric Warfare—</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Net-Centric warfare increases the effectiveness of military operations—situational awareness</strong><br />
<strong>Garstka 03</strong>, assistant director for concepts and operations in the Office of Force Transformation, Office of the Secretary of Defense, he has spoken and written extensively on the topic of warfare in the information age (John, May 2003, “Network-Centric Warfare Offers Warfighting Advantage,” Signal Online, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2713:http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=235&amp;zoneid=62 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=235&amp;zoneid=62" rel="nofollow">http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=235&amp;zoneid=62</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2713 -->)<br />
The advantages network-centric warfare brings to the battlespace are particularly relevant to the tactical and operational levels of war, but they impact all levels of military activity from the tactical to the strategic. Although the construct of an information advantage may seem somewhat intangible, it can be measured, and its impact on military operations can be evaluated in terms of mission effectiveness, survivability and lethality—coins of the realm used by warfighters across the ages. Evidence of the power of network-centric warfare accumulated from a wide range of activities, including combat operations, training events, exercises and demonstrations, continues to strengthen and reinforce its existing tenets. A U.S. Defense Department 2001 report to Congress about network-centric warfare enumerates several specific points: A robustly networked force improves information sharing; information sharing and collaboration enhances the quality of information and shared situational awareness; shared situational awareness enables collaboration and self-synchronization and enhances sustainability and speed of command; and these in turn dramatically increase mission effectiveness. Although the margin of victory has varied across mission areas, the outcome has consistently been decisive in favor of forces that are robustly networked. In some tactical engagements, superior platforms were decisively defeated by less capable platforms that leveraged the order of magnitude improvement in information sharing that networking enables. In other engagements, digitized and networked ground forces with a reduced number of platforms were able to substitute information for mass and outperform units that had fought with a larger number of platforms not similarly digitized and networked. Even more impressive, the combination of networked and digitized ground and air forces was able to defeat an opposition force decisively with unprecedented lethality by creating and leveraging an information advantage. Most recently, military operations in support of operation Enduring Freedom highlighted the emergence of near-real-time information sharing as a source of warfighting advantage. The source of power was not new platforms, but rather the networking of the legacy platforms with special operations forces (SOF). The extent to which ground-based SOF were able to share precision information with command and control aircraft and fighter, bomber and attack aircraft was unprecedented in military operations. It represented an order of magnitude increase in information sharing over what had been previously demonstrated anywhere in the world in combat operations. Two of the more noteworthy and documented examples of the power of network-centric warfare are drawn from the air-to-air mission. In this mission area, a major contributor to enhanced survivability and lethality is an increase in shared situational awareness and enhanced situational understanding. With audio-only communications, pilots and controllers must share information generated by onboard sensors about opposing forces as well as their own position and status via voice. Communicating the minimum essential information required to take offensive or defensive actions takes time, and the resulting situational awareness can often differ significantly from reality. In contrast, when datalinks are employed on fighter aircraft, digital information on blue and red forces is shared instantaneously, enabling all participants to share a common tactical picture. This improved information position constitutes a significant information advantage vis-à-vis an adversary fighting with voice-only communications. This information advantage in turn enables a cognitive advantage in the form of dramatically increased shared situational awareness and enhanced situational understanding. The result is that pilots flying datalink-equipped aircraft can achieve much higher levels of shared situational awareness and understanding on a timeline previously unachievable with voice-only communications. They can translate these advantages into increased survivability and lethality.<br />

<strong>NCW prevents nuclear war—pursuing NCW first solves hegemony</strong><br />

Almost 20 years ago, I began a debate about networks that blossomed into an unlikely friendship with Vice Adm. Art Cebrowski, the modern strategic thinker most likely to be as well remembered as Alfred Thayer Mahan, the great American apostle of sea power. He was the first in the Pentagon power structure to warm to my notions of developing fighting networks, embracing the idea of opening lots of lateral communications links between “sensors and shooters.” We disagreed, however, about the potential of networks. Cebrowski thought that “network-centric warfare” could be used to improve the performance of existing tools— including aircraft carriers — for some time to come. I thought that networking implied a wholly new kind of navy, one made up of small, swift vessels, many of them remotely operated. Cebrowski, who passed away in late 2005, clearly won this debate, as the U.S. Navy remains heavily invested in being a “few-large” force — if one that is increasingly networked. In an implicit nod to David Ronfeldt’s and my ideas, the Navy even has a Netwar Command now. Swarming has also gained some adherents. The most notable has been Marine Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper, who famously used swarm tactics in the last great Pentagon war game, “Millennium Challenge 2002,” to sink several aircraft carriers at the outset of the imagined conflict. But rather than accept that something quite radical was going on, the referees were instructed to “refloat” the carriers, and the costly game — its price tag ran in the few hundred millions — continued. Van Riper walked out. Today, some in the U.S. military still pursue the idea of swarming, mostly in hopes of employing large numbers of small unmanned aerial vehicles in combat. But military habits of mind and institutional interests continue to reflect a greater audience for surges than swarms. What if senior military leaders wake up and decide to take networks and swarming absolutely seriously? If they ever do, it is likely that the scourges of terrorism and aggression will become less a part of the world system. Such a military would be smaller but quicker to respond, less costly but more lethal. The world system would become far less prone to many of the kinds of violence that have plagued it. Networking and swarming are the organizational and doctrinal keys, respectively, to the strategic puzzle that has been waiting to be solved in our time. A networked U.S. military that knows how to swarm would have much smaller active manpower — easily two-thirds less than the more than 2 million serving today — but would be organized in hundreds more little units of mixed forces. The model for military intervention would be the 200 Special Forces “horse soldiers” who beat the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan late in 2001. Such teams would deploy quickly and lethally, with ample reserves for relieving “first waves” and dealing with other crises. At sea, instead of concentrating firepower in a handful of large, increasingly vulnerable supercarriers, the U.S. Navy would distribute its capabilities across many hundreds of small craft armed with very smart weapons. Given their stealth and multiple uses, submarines would stay while carriers would go. And in the air, the “wings” would reduce in size but increase in overall number, with mere handfuls of aircraft in each. Needless to say, networking means that these small pieces would still be able to join together to swarm enemies, large or small. Is such a shift feasible? Absolutely. Big reductions in the U.S. military are nothing new. The massive demobilization after World War II aside, active forces were reduced 40 percent in the few years after the Vietnam War and by another third right after the end of the Cold War. But the key is not so much in cutting as it is in redesigning and rethinking. But what happens if the status quo prevails and the potential of this new round of changes in strategic affairs is ignored or misinterpreted? Failure awaits, at ruinous cost. The most likely form catastrophe could take is that terrorist networks would stay on their feet long enough to acquire nuclear weapons. Even a handful of warheads in Osama bin Laden’s hands would give him great coercive power, as a network cannot be targeted for retaliation the same way a country can. Deterrence will lie in tatters. If there is ever to be a nuclear Napoleon, he will come from a terrorist network. Within the U.S. military, the danger is that senior commanders will fall back on a fatalism driven by their belief that both congressional and industrial leaders will thwart any effort at radical change. I have heard this objection countless times since the early 1990s, repeated mantra-like, all the way up to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thus the mighty U.S. war machine is like a Gulliver trussed up by Lilliputian politicians and businessmen. The irony, however, is that the U.S. military has never been in a better position to gain acceptance for truly transformational change. Neither party in Congress can afford to be portrayed as standing in the way of strategic progress, and so, whatever the Pentagon asks for, it gets. As for defense contractors, far from driving the agenda, they are much too willing to give their military customers exactly what they demand (rather than, perhaps, something better). If the U.S. armed forces call for smaller, smarter weapons and systems to support swarming, they will get them. Beyond the United States, other countries' security forces are beginning to think along the lines of &quot;many and small,&quot; are crafting better ways to &quot;find,&quot; and are learning to swarm. Chinese naval thought today is clearly moving in this direction. Russian ground forces are, too. Needless to say, terrorist networks are still in the lead, and not just al Qaeda. Hezbollah gave quite a demonstration of all three of the new rules of war in its summer 2006 conflict with Israel, a virtual laboratory test of nation versus network -- in which the network more than held its own. For the U.S. military, failing a great leap forward in self-awareness of the need for radical change, a downward budgetary nudge is probably the best approach -- despite President Barack Obama's unwillingness to extend his fiscal austerity program to security-related expenditures. This could take the form of a freeze on defense spending levels, to be followed by several years of, say, 10 percent annual reductions. To focus the redesign effort, a moratorium would be declared on all legacy-like systems (think aircraft carriers, other big ships, advanced fighters, tanks, etc.) while they are subjected to searching review. It should not be assumed that the huge sums invested in national defense have been wisely spent. To most Americans who think that being strong on defense means devoting more resources and building bigger systems, this suggestion to cut spending will sound outrageous. But being smarter about defense might lower costs even as effectiveness improves. This pattern has held throughout the transformations of the last few decades, whether in farming or in industry. Why should the military be exempt? There's real urgency to this debate. Not only has history not ended with the Cold War and the advent of commerce-driven globalization, but conflict and violence have persisted -- even grown -- into a new postmodern scourge. Indeed, it is ironic that, in an era in which the attraction to persuasive &quot;soft power&quot; has grown dramatically, coercive &quot;hard power&quot; continues to dominate in world affairs. This is no surprise in the case of rogue nations hellbent on developing nuclear arsenals to ensure their security, nor when it comes to terrorist networks that think their essential nature is revealed in and sustained by violent acts. But this primary reliance on coercive capabilities is also on display across a range of countries great and small, most notably the United States, whose defense policy has over the past decade largely become its foreign policy. From the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to simmering crises with North Korea and Iran, and on to longer-range strategic concerns about East Asian and Central European security, the United States today is heavily invested in hard-power solutions. And it will continue to be. But if the radical adjustments in strategy, organization, and doctrine implied by the new rules of war are ignored, Americans will go on spending more and getting less when it comes to national defense. Networks will persist until they have the capability to land nuclear blows. Other countries will leapfrog ahead of the United States militarily, and concepts like &quot;deterrence&quot; and &quot;containment&quot; of aggression will blow away like leaves in the wind. So it has always been. Every era of technological change has resulted in profound shifts in military and strategic affairs. History tells us that these developments were inevitable, but soldiers and statesmen were almost always too late in embracing them -- and tragedies upon tragedies ensued. There is still time to be counted among the exceptions, like the Byzantines who, after the fall of Rome, radically redesigned their military and preserved their empire for another thousand years. The U.S. goal should be to join the ranks of those who, in their eras, caught glimpses of the future and acted in time to shape it, saving the world from darkness.<br />

<strong>NCW prevents all future conflicts—disorientation and deterrence</strong><br />

By contrast with the LPP, the relocation of the 2 nd Infantry Division to the OsanPyeongtaek area has more to do with a fundamental change in the Pentagon’s global strategy. The foremost locomotive behind the structural realignment of the USFK comes from Secretary Rumsfeld’s military transformation initiative, which gained more salience in the Pentagon’s war on terrorism after the September 11 attacks. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld strongly argues that the U.S. military should adapt to new threats coming from terrorist groups who might use weapons of mass destruction. He believes that the old-fashioned basing of the U.S. forces during the Cold War-era has now become obsolete and can no longer help defend American interests from attacks in unexpected times and places. He contends, “The Pentagon decided to move away from the old ‘threat-based’ strategy that had dominated our country’s defense planning for the early half a century and adopt a new ‘capabilities-based’ approach -- one that focuses less on who might threaten us, or where, and more on how we might be threatened and what is needed to deter and defend against such threats.” 4 The disastrous damage inflicted on Americans by the unprecedented attacks of September 11 awakened the American military thinkers to devise genuinely new ways of thinking. The White House hinted that America now needs a so-called third round of transformation in constructing its national security strategy -- as it did after the British invasion of the early 19 th century and at the advent of the Cold War. 5 The U.S. military now needs to reconfigure its military machine to be able to deal with elusive enemies whose activities are small in size, transnational and ubiquitous. The proponents of Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) in the American military provided a timely solution for adapting to the new types of threats. Notably, the RMA refers to a fundamental transformation in military strategy and operations that transpired in the process of amplifying combat effectiveness by linking Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Precision Guided Munitions (PGMS) with highly sophisticated C4I (Command and Control, Communication, Computer and Intelligence). This network-centric system-of-systems, which gathers accurate information through sophisticated battlefield awareness capabilities, relaying it to the shooter, has been proving its effectiveness in the most recent U.S.-led wars. Arthur Cebrowski, a retired admiral and a former Director of the Office of Force Transformation in the Pentagon, came up with the new concept of “Network-Centric Warfare (NCW).” Cebrowski’s men suggested a network-centric warfare for dramatically amplified war fighting effectiveness, which could be applied to suffocating by maximum vigilance of the terrorist groups to neutralization. A global network of real-time sensor-shooter linkage supported by agile and mobile forces dispersed around key nodes would successfully discourage any country to allow a haven for terrorist groups. “Network-centric warfare is characterized by the ability of geographically dispersed forces to attain a high level of shared battle-space awareness that is exploited to achieve massed effects swiftly without the physical massing of forces required in the past.” 6 This global rapid response system necessitates the reduction and relocation of forces still surrounding the Russian Federation following the old containment strategy. The Pentagon needed to find relevant force projection space to replace that of the past in its reconfiguration of the U.S. ground forces stationed around the globe. In the eyes of the Pentagon’s transformation planners, large contingents of U.S. ground forces on the Korean peninsula, equipped with heavily armored vehicles, impeding mobility, look somewhat outdated and less adaptable to the requirements of new missions in America’s war on terrorism. Other encouraging changes include enhanced lift capabilities and improved deployability of Rapid Deployment Forces (RDF). Transport aircraft like the C-17 now allow for rapid airlift of soldiers and even armored vehicles, reducing the need for advance deployment of large-scale ground forces. The Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT), a crucial component of the Army’s multifunctional Unit of Action (UA) under future chain of command such as UEx and UEy, will replace the army brigades. The future combat team of light infantry troops can be dispatched together with light armored vehicles to any part of the world. This attests to the desire of the U.S. Department of Defense for a global basing system that would reshape U.S. troops overseas to be smaller, modular, mobile, and thus adaptable to carrying out network-centric warfare against scattered and invisible enemies. Rumsfeld has specially emphasized speed, noting that, “In order to defend the American cities, allies, and deployed forces the United States is required to have rapidly deployable, fully-integrated, forces capable of reaching distant theaters quickly and working with air and sea forces to strike adversaries swiftly and with devastating effect.” 7 Accordingly, the Pentagon’s Office of Force Transformation laid out their requirements in the Global Defense Posture Review (GPR), noting that only forces oriented around “speed” are able to define or alter the initial conditions on terms favorable to the U.S. interests, effectively dissuading and defeating asymmetric threats of non-state adversaries. 8 Their report again proudly states, “The U.S. military is developing an enhanced forward deterrent posture through the integration of new combinations of immediately employable, forward stationed and deployed forces; globally available reconnaissance, strike, and command and control (C2) assets; information operations capabilities; and rapidly deployable, highly lethal, and sustainable forces that may come from outside a theater of operations.” 9 According to the transformation research team, ubiquitous, seamlessly joint, and virtually omniscient forces with capabilities for overcoming distance are expected to effectively break the will or otherwise shape the behavior of the elusive enemy. 10 Allowing no safe, hardened sanctuary anywhere in the globe, the potential adversary would no longer retain the will to fight, or would be so disoriented that they can no longer fight or react coherently. 11<br />

Now that the literature review is complete, it is possible to investigate the potential of NCW. This author has not found any proponents of NCW touting that this concept is the “Silver Bullet” to solve all the problems of future warfare. Many of the same problems that have plagued warfighters in the past exist today and will exist in the future: fog and friction, competing advances in technologies, the unpredictable nature of human behavior on the battlefield, and asymmetric warfare to name only a few. The issue isn’t the existence of these challenges to modern warfare but how one exploits the advantages of information to mitigate risk and take advantage of strengths in the force to achieve objectives. 35 Are the potential benefits of NCW worth the opportunity costs associated with aggressively moving forward with the implementation of this new concept? The concept of Network Centric Warfare has already moved beyond the “bumper sticker” stage. NCW is not a fad that will go quietly into the night. There is little doubt that DOD is spending significant finite resources to pursue NCW capabilities. DOD costs in the area of military electronics, aircraft avionics, vetronics, and missile guidance, communications, electro-optics is approaching $99.57 billion in the 2010. 36 There may be changes to terminology, shifts in policy, and alterations in implementation plans. However, the core concepts that relate to leveraging the power of information will remain. The DOD and senior military leaders have been consistent yet cautious in their support of a networked force. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld concisely stated the importance a fully networked force in the Transformation Planning Guidance, “We must achieve: fundamentally joint, network-centric, distributed forces capable of rapid decision superiority and massed effects across the operational environment. Realizing these capabilities will require transforming our people, processes, and military forces.” 37 ADM Giambastiani, former Commander U.S. Joint Forces Command stated, “A fully collaborative and networked force is an imperative, not a luxury.” 38 The former Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, General Michael Haggee said, “The capability to connect disparate units spread over the battlefield will help to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance to commanders who can then call in fire support…Information Technology (IT) will also be critical to Sea Basing, a key component of the Navy’s Sea Power 21 Concept.” 39 Vice Chief of Staff, U.S. Army Gen. Peter Chiarelli recently stated, “Access to information can mean the difference between living and dying.” 40 General William Wallace, USA (Ret.) goes on to caution that “despite the enormous benefits of using a network, it would be folly to lose sight of the fact that it is still merely a tool to aid the commander in understanding and decision making.” 41 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates wrote in his recent Foreign Affairs article, We should be modest about what military force can accomplish and what technology can accomplish. The advances in precision, sensor, information, and satellite technologies have led to extraordinary gains in what the U.S. military can do. The Taliban were dispatched within three months; Saddam’s regime was toppled in three weeks. A button can be pushed in Nevada, and seconds later a pickup truck will explode in Mosul. A bomb dropped from the sky can destroy a targeted house while leaving the one next to it intact. But no one should ever neglect the psychological, cultural, political, and human dimensions of warfare. 42 The question is not if DOD will proceed with NCW, but how.<br />

<strong>Third is Naval Power—</strong><br />

The expected growth of unmanned systems at sea is raising concerns that the Navy’s networks are ill prepared to handle the commensurate flood of data that the sensors will produce. &quot;The Navy’s architecture is not designed to address the influx of sensors that is coming on,” said Chris Miller, executive director of the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic. The Navy’s maritime intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance roadmap indicates that officials intend to field a fleet of unmanned undersea vehicles by the end of the decade along with a squadron of unmanned carrier-launched aircraft by 2018. The fleet already is operating several robotic helicopters to support ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Somalia, and those systems are producing a lot of data, officials said at a recent naval IT conference in Vienna, Va. “Information is exploding and much of it is coming from the sea,” said David Weddel, assistant deputy chief of naval operations for information dominance. As the Navy fields unmanned systems, the demandfor bandwidth and data is going to increase by more than 1,000 percent, he said. “In the past, we always received more information [at sea] than we ever had to push back,” he said. “That equation has changed.” The MQ-8 Fire Scout, a vertical take-off and landing unmanned aerial vehicle, or VTUAV, is producing a fair amount of data and that number is only going to increase as more systems hit the fleet, Weddel said. There are two VTUAVs operating from frigates sailing off the coast of Somalia conducting anti-piracy operations and supporting special operations forces ashore. One was reportedly shot down in June over Libya, where it had been diverted to support NATO forces. Three more Fire Scouts are supporting troops in Afghanistan. Weddel said the Navy has plans to develop a follow-on to those aircraft. The medium-range maritime unmanned air system will carry heavier payloads and have longer endurance, he added. Beneath the ocean, sailors are operating unmanned undersea vehicles called littoral battle space gliders that sense water temperature and salinity. The submersible robots are producing large amounts of data because they capture pictures of the ocean battle space, said Weddel. Three of them deployed last year to the Gulf of Mexico to support government officials during the BP oil spill crisis. They were employed to help track the location and depth of the oil. These semi-autonomous vehicles and drones — in conjunction with other manned naval systems such as the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft — are expected to carry sophisticated sensors and other equipment to quickly provide sailors with pertinent battle information. “We’re all in on sensors,” said Miller. “But what we haven’t done is balance out the equation and make sure I’ve got the bandwidth coming to my ships to make sure I can get that data off the ship,” he said. Industry will offer solutions to speed up data and processing on the network, he added. While that is helpful, “my argument is, we need a bigger systems of systems architecture and discussion about what we need to go do,” he said. And it is not only the drones and underwater robots driving up the demand for bandwidth and network capability. Ships themselves will too, officials said. The Navy’s newest class of surface combatants, the littoral combat ship, will become increasingly dependent on Defense Department networks for reach back capability to attain operational support and intelligence from shore-based systems. The ship was designed to operate with a small onboard crew of about 40 sailors and a support team ashore to take care of administrative duties, including maintenance and supply. As a result, communications from the ship back to shore is critical. “So here you have a platform that moves at high speeds from hotspot to hotspot,” said Rear Adm. Edward “Ned” Deets III, commander of the Naval Network Warfare Command. “How do you prepare the [commanding officer] and crew with the level of information and capability that they need for the next threat which, at the speed of operation of this ship, is in many cases simply three to four to five hours away?” The challenge this presents to the Navy is the capacity to move information— whether it’s satellite-based, line of sight-based, or within networks aboard ships — and to analyze the data. “An awful lot of data is going to fall on the cutting room floor if we can’t figure out how we can automate the data processing and data analysis,” said Weddel. There also needs to be a discussion about how much information is stored aboard a ship and how much of it can be posted to a site or uploaded to another repository where it is retrievable via Defense Department networks. “It could be the marines on the beach, or maybe the SOF we’re supporting in the Horn of Africa. It’s not just about the Navy,” Weddel said. Whatever network supports this must be able to form and reform very quickly, especially when it comes to data links between ships and the unmanned systems, he added. Data links are the “pipes” that systems use to communicate. Many data links are proprietary and limit the ability to share information among multiple sensors and networks. “There’s nothing common about common data links, and it’s killing me,” said Weddel. There are at least 11 different common data link programs and three additional ones for the Marine Corps, he pointed out. “It has to stop. I don’t have enough antennas onboard ship to do it, and it’s hurting our war fighting capability,” he said. The Navy is making plans to pursue a true common system beginning in 2013, he added. The other challenge to consider is the Navy’s reliance upon satellites to transmit its communications globally. “Bandwidth for the time being is adequate. But what happens when the bandwidth becomes limited or adversaries start jamming satellites?” Weddel said. Potential enemies have realized how much the Defense Department depends upon space-based systems to conduct its business. The ability to jam satellites is available, he pointed out. “So the question becomes, ‘How does the Navy maintain connectivity within the battle group?’” he said. The department is conducting a study for a joint airborne layer network that could substitute for jammed satellite networks. Officials intend to budget for the system in 2014. Industry can help solve the Navy’s network challenge by automating some of the processes, designing common antennas and conforming to standard waveforms and capability. It can also address human factor issues, such as making the networked information easier for young sailors to manipulate and digest. Another challenge is information assurance — securing the information once it enters Navy networks. A large part of that is imbuing into the Navy culture the idea that IT networks are combat systems, and that they need to be treated as such, said Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jonathan Greenert, who has been tapped to replace Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead, who is retiring.<br />

This strategy reaffirms the use of seapower to influence actions and activities at sea and ashore. The expeditionary character and versatility of maritime forces provide the U.S. the asymmetric advantage of enlarging or contracting its military footprint in areas where access is denied or limited. Permanent or prolonged basing of our military forces overseas often has unintended economic, social or political repercussions. The sea is a vast maneuver space, where the presence of maritime forces can be adjusted as conditions dictate to enable flexible approaches to escalation, de-escalation and deterrence of conflicts. The speed, flexibility, agility and scalability of maritime forces provide joint or combined force commanders a range of options for responding to crises. Additionally, integrated maritime operations, either within formal alliance structures (such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) or more informal arrangements (such as the Global Maritime Partnership initiative), send powerful messages to would-be aggressors that we will act with others to ensure collective security and prosperity. United States seapower will be globally postured to secure our homeland and citizens from direct attack and to advance our interests around the world. As our security and prosperity are inextricably linked with those of others, U.S. maritime forces will be deployed to protect and sustain the peaceful global system comprised of interdependent networks of trade, finance, information, law, people and governance. We will employ the global reach, persistent presence, and operational flexibility inherent in U.S. seapower to accomplish six key tasks, or strategic imperatives. Where tensions are high or where we wish to demonstrate to our friends and allies our commitment to security and stability, U.S. maritime forces will be characterized by regionally concentrated, forward-deployed task forces with the combat power to limit regional conflict, deter major power war, and should deterrence fail, win our Nation’s wars as part of a joint or combined campaign. In addition, persistent, mission-tailored maritime forces will be globally distributed in order to contribute to homeland defense-in-depth, foster and sustain cooperative relationships with an expanding set of international partners, and prevent or mitigate disruptions and crises. Credible combat power will be continuously postured in the Western Pacific and the Arabian Gulf/Indian Ocean to protect our vital interests, assure our friends and allies of our continuing commitment to regional security, and deter and dissuade potential adversaries and peer competitors. This combat power can be selectively and rapidly repositioned to meet contingencies that may arise elsewhere. These forces will be sized and postured to fulfill the following strategic imperatives: Limit regional conflict with forward deployed, decisive maritime power. Today regional conflict has ramifications far beyond the area of conflict. Humanitarian crises, violence spreading across borders, pandemics, and the interruption of vital resources are all possible when regional crises erupt. While this strategy advocates a wide dispersal of networked maritime forces, we cannot be everywhere, and we cannot act to mitigate all regional conflict. Where conflict threatens the global system and our national interests, maritime forces will be ready to respond alongside other elements of national and multi-national power, to give political leaders a range of options for deterrence, escalation and de-escalation. Maritime forces that are persistently present and combat-ready provide the Nation’s primary forcible entry option in an era of declining access, even as they provide the means for this Nation to respond quickly to other crises. Whether over the horizon or powerfully arrayed in plain sight, maritime forces can deter the ambitions of regional aggressors, assure friends and allies, gain and maintain access, and protect our citizens while working to sustain the global order. Critical to this notion is the maintenance of a powerful fleet—ships, aircraft, Marine forces, and shore-based fleet activities—capable of selectively controlling the seas, projecting power ashore, and protecting friendly forces and civilian populations from attack.<br />

The Secretary of Defense should direct full funding for the key programs, TSAT and JTRS in particular, and push for their earliest possible deployments. This should be done concurrent with critical reviews of continuing legacy systems procurements since these may not be able to provide the required net-centric capabilities. Both GAO and independent assessments have determined that the technologies necessary for TSAT development are mature. History tells us that funding inadequacy and uncertainty inevitably lead to cost and schedule increases, and that operational users are reluctant to transition away from a legacy system to one whose future is uncertain. Fully funding and aggressively executing the TSAT program is therefore essential. Accordingly, the USAF should be directed to establish a firm cost, schedule, and performance baseline and aggressively execute it, and should adequately and fully fund full scale development of the TSAT system.<br />

Significant problems derive from limitations on the dissemination of collected data. Currently, meta-data are not consistently applied and tags are not consistent from agency to agency. Military commanders demand much larger quantities and more sophisticated types of intelligence (especially tactical imagery), but in many cases are unaware of and incapable of accessing data available throughout the intelligence community. “The number of images and signal intercepts are well beyond the capacity of the existing analyst community so there are huge backlogs for translators and image interpreters and much of the collected data are never reviewed. Further, decision makers and intelligence analyst have difficulty knowing what information is available.” Although an enormous number of full-motion video missions in support of tactical commanders has been conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan, the task force suggested that surveillance has often been episodic and continuing coverage of a given region had not always been possible. The task force report emphasized that the ISR concept encompasses more than platforms for collection. It noted that DOD has developed the Global Information Grid which includes a high-speed communications network of various ground, air and space components. There is a need, according to the task force, for better ways for tactical commanders to access this information “on the move” and thus it emphasized the advantages of assured and accessible communications as would be made available by the redundant and complementary communications capabilities terrestrial fiber, government and civilian communications satellites, networks built and maintained by specific agencies. (The task force advocated the Transformational Satellite System (TSAT) to provide links to the fiber network to mobile and fixed theater commands. TSAT was subsequently killed by DOD because it was considered duplicative.) A key goal should be, according to the Task Force, to ensure that future communications systems adhere to interoperability standards to ensure that they can support joint and international operations as well as “reach back” to U.S. agencies for analytical support. The essential concern of the task force was to ensure that the ongoing proliferation of platforms and sensors be matched by sufficient communications capabilities to enable their use. Currently, they found that “Our rapidly growing airborne ISR collection capabilities are not in balance with supporting communications.”<br />

By all accounts, the success of the Pentagon’s ambitious plan to transform the U.S. military into a network-centric force is riding on the transformational satellite communications system (T-Sat) now in development. Defense planners are convinced that full-scale military transformation and network-centric operations will be impossible to achieve without the spaceborne communications that the revolutionary T-Sat constellation would provide. The military has begun its transition to highly mobile, fast-reaction, quick-strike, netcentric forces that include increasing numbers of autonomous or semiautonomous systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It therefore requires ultrareliable, superswift communications among all sorts of sensor systems, weapons platforms, and command posts in the air, on land, and at sea around the globe. T-Sats will be the space element, and the sine qua non, of the military’s planned GIG (global information grid)—its “Internet in the sky.” Thus the T-Sat system is seen as “the cornerstone of [the Defense Dept.’s] future information operations,” the “centerpiece of our future global communications network,” and “the heart of the DOD net-centric operations environment concept essential to all future operations,” a Pentagon document proclaims.<br />

The T-Sat system is the heart of the Pentagon’s transformational communications architecture (TCA), devised by defense scientists in 2004 under the direction of Peter Teets, former undersecretary of the Air Force. The TCA resulted from the transformational communications study (TCS) undertaken by the Defense Dept. in 2002. The architecture addresses, among other things, wideband space-to-space and space-to-high-altitude airborne communications using a common standard for laser communication; communications and relay satellites; ground terminals; operational management systems; and communications interfaces. The TCA makes sure that new, transformational satcom systems will be able to connect with existing, or legacy, systems in space. The Air Force-managed T-Sat/T-MOS system is being developed to do just that. Meink explains that T-Sat will be “the means of removing communications constraints in terms of capacity, control, adaptability, responsiveness, and coverage,” and of meeting global U.S. requirements for communications across the defense, intelligence, and civil communities, including NASA. “T-Sat would be a key enabler of our forces whether or not they go to this idealized net-centric warfare,” Meink says. “T-Sat would be critical to what our forces are capable of doing right now, not just to what they’ll be capable of doing in the future. We’re trying to do as much as we can with what we have right now.”<br />

At risk also is the development of the Transformational Satellite Communications program, or TSAT, an Air Force project that is supposed to work with Future Combat Systems. The Defense Department is planning to cut about $4 billion of the TSAT budget over the next five years, partly because of congressional concerns about an expensive and technical project that already has been cut, delayed and restructured. The Air Force has yet to select a contractor for the project, though Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the two leading contenders, have both been working on development contracts. TSAT would be about 100 times faster than military satellites in orbit now, Air Force officials say. That's to an extent because the satellites would take advantage of the latest Internet technology to reroute communications traffic more efficiently, they say. TSAT is expected to also provide more securely encrypted communications for Future Combat Systems to prevent enemies from intercepting or jamming signals. Until recently, military officials said the program would launch its first satellite in 2016, though now they say the schedule is uncertain. According to a 2006 report, the GAO said TSAT began without sufficiently mature technology, noting that costs have increased and the timetable has been delayed. Before the latest cutbacks, according to the Air Force, the program had increased by about $8 billion, or 50 percent, to $24 billion, including inflation. The new cutbacks will defer work, delaying the timetable and adding to the program's overall expense because of &quot;the costs associated with extending the contract to perform necessary work,&quot; the military said. But Richard Pino, the Air Force's TSAT program director, said &quot;the technologies are all at the right levels of maturity.&quot; Boeing's Muilenburg said the prospect of additional cuts should not pose a problem for Future Combat Systems. In lieu of TSAT, he said that the Army program could use current military and commercial satellites. Loren B. Thompson, a defense consultant at the Lexington Institute, a public policy think tank, said, however, that TSAT &quot;is crucial to the secure networking capabilities that underpin&quot; Future Combat Systems. Given the cutbacks, he said, &quot;If TSAT collapses, which looks like a distinct possibility, soldiers may have to rely on links that are harder to access on the move, more vulnerable to jamming and interceptions, and offer nowhere near as much bandwidth.&quot; Cristina Chaplain, who oversees the GAO's review of space systems, also said that &quot;TSAT was being designed to support communications on the move, whereas other programs don't do that to the extent that's needed by&quot; Future Combat Systems.<br />

An evolution of the shore architecture will be necessary to align with the joint Future DISN and TSAT systems. The preliminary design will consist of a separate frequency router connecting to the ADNS policy router. The ADNS policy router will then forward packets to the proper encryption devices (e.g., HAIPE). The Navy Shore Network Architecture in the TSAT timeframe will depend heavily on the evolution of direct routing within the GIG black core. It is expected that by TSAT Initial Operation Capability (IOC) the traditional DISN services of SIPRNET and NIPRNET will have converged to the common black carrier network and that DISA will offer black network connections to users. It is likely that a &quot;red gateway&quot; will be maintained at the NAVY-DISN interface until the functions currently performed at these gateways are resolved in the black core architecture. Once the Navy network is directly connected (without gateways) to the GIG black core, it is feasible that Navy traffic will be routed directly at teleports and will no longer be backhauled as circuits to a shore ADNS policy router. No red gateway is planned between ADNS and TSAT and traffic entering the TSAT system is expected to be directly routed to the end-user, regardless of the service or organizational affiliation of that user. In order to meet emerging Navy requirements for routing between afloat users in this environment, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) routing model is being developed for use at the TSAT-ADNS interface. The TSAT terminal suite will provide the Navy user connectivity to the TSAT satellite network and resources. Unlike legacy SATCOM, where bandwidth and channel capacity allocated to the user are fixed, the TSAT system will provide a dynamic and automatic Radio Frequency (RF) bandwidth resource allocation service via Dynamic Bandwidth Resource Allocation (DBRA). DBRA will actively perform dynamic resource allocation and de-allocation based on the uplink and downlink channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the link layer, current offered network load and policy. TSAT will be implementing Policy-Based Network Management (PBNM) via a TSAT terminal policy agent interface to manage and control the terminal behaviors. Currently, it is assumed that the Navy/ADNS will also manage some aspects of the TSAT terminal. However, the specific functions and management information within the terminal suite that may be managed by the Navy/ADNS are not yet defined. The satellite payload router will peer with the TSAT terminal router via standard Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). This will limit BGP route distribution within TSAT through filtering on the route's community or the extended community attribute. The shore TSAT terminal suite may be utilized to provide high bandwidth and throughput entry point connecting the users to resources and services of the GIG. It will operate continuously in support of distributed ships, submarines, aircraft, and shore based tactical and non-tactical users.<br />

One question before the GAO was, could this leading technology be integrated in time versus the Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites that had 5 percent of the bandwidth of TSAT? &quot;When they cancelled TSAT, they cancelled programs that were heavily reliant on TSAT,&quot; says Cristina Chaplain, director of acquisition and sourcing management for the GAO. ... &quot;The question is how fast can AEHF come on line when they need it, as that program has its own problems?&quot; While inferior to TSAT’s space segment, Lockheed Martin’s AEHF Milstar 3 is intended to provide 10 times the capacity and six times higher data rate transfer than the Milstar 2 satellites. The transition back to existing programs may fill the gaps and shortfalls. &quot;With the cancellation of the TSAT program, TSAT missions such as communications-on-the-move and airborne ISR must be supported within these programs [Wideband Global Satellite (WGS) constellation and the Advanced EHF satellite system], and as appropriate, through commercial leases and/or hosted payloads,&quot; says Steve Tatum, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin. &quot;TSAT was originally envisioned to support up to 30 Gbps (gigabits per second) of additional communications capacity for the U.S. military including a mix of EHF protected, Ka-band AISR and optical services, although the requirement was later reduced to 5 Gbps of EHF protected services, including communications on the move,&quot; says Tatum. &quot;AEHF is significantly more capable than Milstar. Two additional AEHF’s will be able to handle 21 percent of a single TSAT satellite,&quot; says Bennett. But it remains to be seen if this approach can replace the expected performance of TSAT.<br />

Paul Kennedy was probably right: the US will go the way of all great powers — down. The individual dramas of the past decade — the September 2001 terrorist attacks, prolonged wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis — have delivered the world a message: US primacy is in decline. This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline, but it encompasses a trend that appears to be negative and perhaps alarming. Although the US still possesses incomparable military prowess and its economy remains the world’s largest, the once seemingly indomitable chasm that separated America from anyone else is narrowing. Thus, the global distribution of power is shifting, and the inevitable result will be a world that is less peaceful, liberal and prosperous, burdened by a dearth of effective conflict regulation. Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts. However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid. As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves.’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law. Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that America’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes$A world without American hegemony is one where great power wars re-emerge, the liberal international system is supplanted by an authoritarian one, and trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy.<br />

<strong>Hegemony creates structural disincentives for war—theoretical and empirical evidence</strong><br />
<strong>Wohlforth 9</strong> — William C. Wohlforth, Daniel Webster Professor of Government at Dartmouth College, holds an M.Phil. and Ph.D. in Political Science from Yale University, 2009 (“Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War,” World Politics, Volume 61, Number 1, January, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Project MUSE, p. 29-31)<br />
The upshot is a near scholarly consensus that unpolarity’s consequences for great power conflict are indeterminate and that a power shift resulting in a return to bipolarity or multipolarity will not raise the specter of great power war. This article questions the consensus on two counts. First, I show that it depends crucially on a dubious assumption about human motivation. Prominent theories of war are based on the assumption that people are mainly motivated by the instrumental pursuit of tangible ends such as physical security and material prosperity. This is why such theories seem irrelevant to interactions among great powers in an international environment that diminishes the utility of war for the pursuit of such ends. Yet we know that people are motivated by a great many noninstrumental motives, not least by concerns regarding their social status. 3 As John Harsanyi noted, “Apart from economic payoffs, social status (social rank) seems to be the most important incentive and motivating force of social behavior.”4 This proposition rests on much firmer scientific ground now than when Harsanyi expressed it a generation ago, as cumulating research shows that humans appear to be hardwired for sensitivity to status and that relative standing is a powerful and independent motivator of behavior.5 [end page 29] Second, I question the dominant view that status quo evaluations are relatively independent of the distribution of capabilities. If the status of states depends in some measure on their relative capabilities, and if states derive utility from status, then different distributions of capabilities may affect levels of satisfaction, just as different income distributions may affect levels of status competition in domestic settings. 6 Building on research in psychology and sociology, I argue that even capabilities distributions among major powers foster ambiguous status hierarchies, which generate more dissatisfaction and clashes over the status quo. And the more stratified the distribution of capabilities, the less likely such status competition is. Unipolarity thus generates far fewer incentives than either bipolarity or multipolarity for direct great power positional competition over status. Elites in the other major powers continue to prefer higher status, but in a unipolar system they face comparatively weak incentives to translate that preference into costly action. And the absence of such incentives matters because social status is a positional good—something whose value depends on how much one has in relation to others.7 “If everyone has high status,” Randall Schweller notes, “no one does.”8 While one actor might increase its status, all cannot simultaneously do so. High status is thus inherently scarce, and competitions for status tend to be zero sum.9 I begin by describing the puzzles facing predominant theories that status competition might solve. Building on recent research on social identity and status seeking, I then show that under certain conditions the ways decision makers identify with the states they represent may prompt them to frame issues as positional disputes over status in a social hierarchy. I develop hypotheses that tailor this scholarship to the domain of great power politics, showing how the probability of status competition is likely to be linked to polarity. The rest of the article investigates whether there is sufficient evidence for these hypotheses to warrant further refinement and testing. I pursue this in three ways: by showing that the theory advanced here is consistent with what we know about large-scale patterns of great power conflict through history; by [end page 30] demonstrating that the causal mechanisms it identifies did drive relatively secure major powers to military conflict in the past (and therefore that they might do so again if the world were bipolar or multipolar); and by showing that observable evidence concerning the major powers’ identity politics and grand strategies under unipolarity are consistent with the theory’s expectations.<br />

<strong>Hegemonic decline causes transition wars</strong><br />
<strong>Goldstein 7— A</strong>very Goldstein, David M. Knott Professor of Global Politics and International Relations at the University of Pennsylvania, Associate Director of the Christopher H. Browne Center for International Politics, Senior Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, holds a Ph.D. from the University of California-Berkeley, 2007 (“Power transitions, institutions, and China's rise in East Asia: Theoretical expectations and evidence,” Journal of Strategic Studies, Volume 30, Number 4-5, August-October, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Taylor &amp; Francis Online, p. 647-648)<br />
Two closely related, though distinct, theoretical arguments focus explicitly on the consequences for international politics of a shift in power between a dominant state and a rising power. In War and Change in World Politics, Robert Gilpin suggested that peace prevails when a dominant state’s capabilities enable it to ‘govern’ an international order that it has shaped. Over time, however, as economic and technological diffusion proceeds during eras of peace and development, other states are empowered. Moreover, the burdens of international governance drain and distract the reigning hegemon, and challengers eventually emerge who seek to rewrite the rules of governance. As the power advantage of the erstwhile hegemon ebbs, it may become desperate enough to resort to the ultima ratio of international politics, force, to forestall the increasingly urgent demands of a rising challenger. Or as the power of the challenger rises, it may be tempted to press its case with threats to use force. It is the rise and fall of the great powers that creates the circumstances under which major wars, what Gilpin labels ‘hegemonic wars’, break out.13<br />
Gilpin’s argument logically encourages pessimism about the implications of a rising China. It leads to the expectation that international trade, investment, and technology transfer will result in a steady diffusion of American economic power, benefiting the rapidly developing states of the world, including China. As the US simultaneously scurries to put out the many brushfires that threaten its far-flung global interests (i.e., the classic problem of overextension), it will be unable to devote sufficient resources to maintain or restore its former advantage over emerging competitors like China. While the erosion of the once clear American advantage plays itself out, the US will find it ever more difficult to preserve the order in Asia that it created during its era of preponderance. The expectation is an increase in the likelihood for the use of force – either by a Chinese challenger able to field a stronger military in support of its demands for greater influence over international arrangements in Asia, or by a besieged American hegemon desperate to head off further decline. Among the trends that alarm [end page 647] those who would look at Asia through the lens of Gilpin’s theory are China’s expanding share of world trade and wealth (much of it resulting from the gains made possible by the international economic order a dominant US established); its acquisition of technology in key sectors that have both civilian and military applications (e.g., information, communications, and electronics linked with the ‘revolution in military affairs’); and an expanding military burden for the US (as it copes with the challenges of its global war on terrorism and especially its struggle in Iraq) that limits the resources it can devote to preserving its interests in East Asia.14<br />
Although similar to Gilpin’s work insofar as it emphasizes the importance of shifts in the capabilities of a dominant state and a rising challenger, the power-transition theory A. F. K. Organski and Jacek Kugler present in The War Ledger focuses more closely on the allegedly dangerous phenomenon of ‘crossover’– the point at which a dissatisfied challenger is about to overtake the established leading state.15 In such cases, when the power gap narrows, the dominant state becomes increasingly desperate to forestall, and the challenger becomes increasingly determined to realize the transition to a new international order whose contours it will define.<br />

This hegemony is by no means fated to end any time soon, however, given that the United States remains predominant by most conventional indicators of national power. The character of the United States’ hegemonic behavior in the future will thus remain an issue of concern both within the domestic polity and internationally. Yet the juvenescence of the United State’s “unipolar moment,” combined with the disorientation produced by the September 11 attacks, ought to restrain any premature generalization that the imperial activism begun by the Clinton administration, and which the Bush administration took to its most spirited apotheosis, would in some way come to define the permanent norm of US behavior in the global system. In all probability, it is much more likely that the limitations on US [end page 54] power witnessed in Afghanistan and Iraq will produce a more phlegmatic and accommodating United States over the longer term, despite the fact that the traditional US pursuit of dominance — understood as the quest to maintain a preponderance of power, neutralize threatening challengers, and protect freedom of action, goals that go back to the foundations of the republic — is unlikely to be extinguished any time soon.<br />
Precisely because the desire for dominance is likely to remain a permanent feature of US geopolitical ambitions — even though how it is exercised will certainly change in comparison to the Bush years — the central task facing the next administration will still pertain fundamentally to the issue of US power. This concern manifests itself through the triune challenges of: redefining the United States’ role in the world, renewing the foundations of US strength, and recovering the legitimacy of US actions. In other words, the next administration faces the central task of clarifying the character of US hegemony, reinvigorating the material foundations of its power, and securing international support for its policies.<br />

Introducing <u><a class="wiki_link" href="/home">language</a></u> that would later find its way to doctrine, the report asserted, “information dominance could well be the sine qua non for effective military operations in future conflicts” 112 and “information superiority could be the decisive operation in future conflicts.” 113 Furthermore, the report speculated that, since belligerents also understand the decisive nature of information dominance – especially after witnessing the Gulf War -- a zero-sum-game phenomenon would likely ensue. To allow enemy exploitation of information networks during peacetime would risk enemy information dominance, “which would quickly lead to the progressive inability of friendly forces to execute the highly integrated, information-intensive military operations that will be crucial to success in war.” 114 The report asserted that during war the United States would likely achieve information dominance through a “full-dimensional operation.” In essence, if the United States failed to maintain continuous information dominance, it would lose the deterrent and coercive power of its military force.<br />

<strong>Net-Centric warfare increases the effectiveness of military operations—situational awareness</strong><br />

The advantages network-centric warfare brings to the battlespace are particularly relevant to the tactical and operational levels of war, but they impact all levels of military activity from the tactical to the strategic. Although the construct of an information advantage may seem somewhat intangible, it can be measured, and its impact on military operations can be evaluated in terms of mission effectiveness, survivability and lethality—coins of the realm used by warfighters across the ages. Evidence of the power of network-centric warfare accumulated from a wide range of activities, including combat operations, training events, exercises and demonstrations, continues to strengthen and reinforce its existing tenets. A U.S. Defense Department 2001 report to Congress about network-centric warfare enumerates several specific points: A robustly networked force improves information sharing; information sharing and collaboration enhances the quality of information and shared situational awareness; shared situational awareness enables collaboration and self-synchronization and enhances sustainability and speed of command; and these in turn dramatically increase mission effectiveness. Although the margin of victory has varied across mission areas, the outcome has consistently been decisive in favor of forces that are robustly networked. In some tactical engagements, superior platforms were decisively defeated by less capable platforms that leveraged the order of magnitude improvement in information sharing that networking enables. In other engagements, digitized and networked ground forces with a reduced number of platforms were able to substitute information for mass and outperform units that had fought with a larger number of platforms not similarly digitized and networked. Even more impressive, the combination of networked and digitized ground and air forces was able to defeat an opposition force decisively with unprecedented lethality by creating and leveraging an information advantage. Most recently, military operations in support of operation Enduring Freedom highlighted the emergence of near-real-time information sharing as a source of warfighting advantage. The source of power was not new platforms, but rather the networking of the legacy platforms with special operations forces (SOF). The extent to which ground-based SOF were able to share precision information with command and control aircraft and fighter, bomber and attack aircraft was unprecedented in military operations. It represented an order of magnitude increase in information sharing over what had been previously demonstrated anywhere in the world in combat operations. Two of the more noteworthy and documented examples of the power of network-centric warfare are drawn from the air-to-air mission. In this mission area, a major contributor to enhanced survivability and lethality is an increase in shared situational awareness and enhanced situational understanding. With audio-only communications, pilots and controllers must share information generated by onboard sensors about opposing forces as well as their own position and status via voice. Communicating the minimum essential information required to take offensive or defensive actions takes time, and the resulting situational awareness can often differ significantly from reality. In contrast, when datalinks are employed on fighter aircraft, digital information on blue and red forces is shared instantaneously, enabling all participants to share a common tactical picture. This improved information position constitutes a significant information advantage vis-à-vis an adversary fighting with voice-only communications. This information advantage in turn enables a cognitive advantage in the form of dramatically increased shared situational awareness and enhanced situational understanding. The result is that pilots flying datalink-equipped aircraft can achieve much higher levels of shared situational awareness and understanding on a timeline previously unachievable with voice-only communications. They can translate these advantages into increased survivability and lethality.<br />

Almost 20 years ago, I began a debate about networks that blossomed into an unlikely friendship with Vice Adm. Art Cebrowski, the modern strategic thinker most likely to be as well remembered as Alfred Thayer Mahan, the great American apostle of sea power. He was the first in the Pentagon power structure to warm to my notions of developing fighting networks, embracing the idea of opening lots of lateral communications links between “sensors and shooters.” We disagreed, however, about the potential of networks. Cebrowski thought that “network-centric warfare” could be used to improve the performance of existing tools— including aircraft carriers — for some time to come. I thought that networking implied a wholly new kind of navy, one made up of small, swift vessels, many of them remotely operated. Cebrowski, who passed away in late 2005, clearly won this debate, as the U.S. Navy remains heavily invested in being a “few-large” force — if one that is increasingly networked. In an implicit nod to David Ronfeldt’s and my ideas, the Navy even has a Netwar Command now. Swarming has also gained some adherents. The most notable has been Marine Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper, who famously used swarm tactics in the last great Pentagon war game, “Millennium Challenge 2002,” to sink several aircraft carriers at the outset of the imagined conflict. But rather than accept that something quite radical was going on, the referees were instructed to “refloat” the carriers, and the costly game — its price tag ran in the few hundred millions — continued. Van Riper walked out. Today, some in the U.S. military still pursue the idea of swarming, mostly in hopes of employing large numbers of small unmanned aerial vehicles in combat. But military habits of mind and institutional interests continue to reflect a greater audience for surges than swarms. What if senior military leaders wake up and decide to take networks and swarming absolutely seriously? If they ever do, it is likely that the scourges of terrorism and aggression will become less a part of the world system. Such a military would be smaller but quicker to respond, less costly but more lethal. The world system would become far less prone to many of the kinds of violence that have plagued it. Networking and swarming are the organizational and doctrinal keys, respectively, to the strategic puzzle that has been waiting to be solved in our time. A networked U.S. military that knows how to swarm would have much smaller active manpower — easily two-thirds less than the more than 2 million serving today — but would be organized in hundreds more little units of mixed forces. The model for military intervention would be the 200 Special Forces “horse soldiers” who beat the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan late in 2001. Such teams would deploy quickly and lethally, with ample reserves for relieving “first waves” and dealing with other crises. At sea, instead of concentrating firepower in a handful of large, increasingly vulnerable supercarriers, the U.S. Navy would distribute its capabilities across many hundreds of small craft armed with very smart weapons. Given their stealth and multiple uses, submarines would stay while carriers would go. And in the air, the “wings” would reduce in size but increase in overall number, with mere handfuls of aircraft in each. Needless to say, networking means that these small pieces would still be able to join together to swarm enemies, large or small. Is such a shift feasible? Absolutely. Big reductions in the U.S. military are nothing new. The massive demobilization after World War II aside, active forces were reduced 40 percent in the few years after the Vietnam War and by another third right after the end of the Cold War. But the key is not so much in cutting as it is in redesigning and rethinking. But what happens if the status quo prevails and the potential of this new round of changes in strategic affairs is ignored or misinterpreted? Failure awaits, at ruinous cost. The most likely form catastrophe could take is that terrorist networks would stay on their feet long enough to acquire nuclear weapons. Even a handful of warheads in Osama bin Laden’s hands would give him great coercive power, as a network cannot be targeted for retaliation the same way a country can. Deterrence will lie in tatters. If there is ever to be a nuclear Napoleon, he will come from a terrorist network. Within the U.S. military, the danger is that senior commanders will fall back on a fatalism driven by their belief that both congressional and industrial leaders will thwart any effort at radical change. I have heard this objection countless times since the early 1990s, repeated mantra-like, all the way up to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thus the mighty U.S. war machine is like a Gulliver trussed up by Lilliputian politicians and businessmen. The irony, however, is that the U.S. military has never been in a better position to gain acceptance for truly transformational change. Neither party in Congress can afford to be portrayed as standing in the way of strategic progress, and so, whatever the Pentagon asks for, it gets. As for defense contractors, far from driving the agenda, they are much too willing to give their military customers exactly what they demand (rather than, perhaps, something better). If the U.S. armed forces call for smaller, smarter weapons and systems to support swarming, they will get them. Beyond the United States, other countries' security forces are beginning to think along the lines of &quot;many and small,&quot; are crafting better ways to &quot;find,&quot; and are learning to swarm. Chinese naval thought today is clearly moving in this direction. Russian ground forces are, too. Needless to say, terrorist networks are still in the lead, and not just al Qaeda. Hezbollah gave quite a demonstration of all three of the new rules of war in its summer 2006 conflict with Israel, a virtual laboratory test of nation versus network -- in which the network more than held its own. For the U.S. military, failing a great leap forward in self-awareness of the need for radical change, a downward budgetary nudge is probably the best approach -- despite President Barack Obama's unwillingness to extend his fiscal austerity program to security-related expenditures. This could take the form of a freeze on defense spending levels, to be followed by several years of, say, 10 percent annual reductions. To focus the redesign effort, a moratorium would be declared on all legacy-like systems (think aircraft carriers, other big ships, advanced fighters, tanks, etc.) while they are subjected to searching review. It should not be assumed that the huge sums invested in national defense have been wisely spent. To most Americans who think that being strong on defense means devoting more resources and building bigger systems, this suggestion to cut spending will sound outrageous. But being smarter about defense might lower costs even as effectiveness improves. This pattern has held throughout the transformations of the last few decades, whether in farming or in industry. Why should the military be exempt? There's real urgency to this debate. Not only has history not ended with the Cold War and the advent of commerce-driven globalization, but conflict and violence have persisted -- even grown -- into a new postmodern scourge. Indeed, it is ironic that, in an era in which the attraction to persuasive &quot;soft power&quot; has grown dramatically, coercive &quot;hard power&quot; continues to dominate in world affairs. This is no surprise in the case of rogue nations hellbent on developing nuclear arsenals to ensure their security, nor when it comes to terrorist networks that think their essential nature is revealed in and sustained by violent acts. But this primary reliance on coercive capabilities is also on display across a range of countries great and small, most notably the United States, whose defense policy has over the past decade largely become its foreign policy. From the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to simmering crises with North Korea and Iran, and on to longer-range strategic concerns about East Asian and Central European security, the United States today is heavily invested in hard-power solutions. And it will continue to be. But if the radical adjustments in strategy, organization, and doctrine implied by the new rules of war are ignored, Americans will go on spending more and getting less when it comes to national defense. Networks will persist until they have the capability to land nuclear blows. Other countries will leapfrog ahead of the United States militarily, and concepts like &quot;deterrence&quot; and &quot;containment&quot; of aggression will blow away like leaves in the wind. So it has always been. Every era of technological change has resulted in profound shifts in military and strategic affairs. History tells us that these developments were inevitable, but soldiers and statesmen were almost always too late in embracing them -- and tragedies upon tragedies ensued. There is still time to be counted among the exceptions, like the Byzantines who, after the fall of Rome, radically redesigned their military and preserved their empire for another thousand years. The U.S. goal should be to join the ranks of those who, in their eras, caught glimpses of the future and acted in time to shape it, saving the world from darkness.<br />

<strong>NCW prevents all future conflicts—disorientation and deterrence</strong><br />
<strong>Chang-hee 5</strong> (Chang-hee Nam, professor of Inha University, South Korea, who formerly worked for the Korea Institute f or Defense Analysis, “The Realignment of the USFK in the Military Transformation and South Korea's Defense Reform 2020”,<br />
<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2731:http://www.nids.go.jp/english/event/symposium/pdf/2005/e2005_05.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nids.go.jp/english/event/symposium/pdf/2005/e2005_05.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nids.go.jp/english/event/symposium/pdf/2005/e2005_05.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2731 -->)<br />
By contrast with the LPP, the relocation of the 2 nd Infantry Division to the OsanPyeongtaek area has more to do with a fundamental change in the Pentagon’s global strategy. The foremost locomotive behind the structural realignment of the USFK comes from Secretary Rumsfeld’s military transformation initiative, which gained more salience in the Pentagon’s war on terrorism after the September 11 attacks. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld strongly argues that the U.S. military should adapt to new threats coming from terrorist groups who might use weapons of mass destruction. He believes that the old-fashioned basing of the U.S. forces during the Cold War-era has now become obsolete and can no longer help defend American interests from attacks in unexpected times and places. He contends, “The Pentagon decided to move away from the old ‘threat-based’ strategy that had dominated our country’s defense planning for the early half a century and adopt a new ‘capabilities-based’ approach -- one that focuses less on who might threaten us, or where, and more on how we might be threatened and what is needed to deter and defend against such threats.” 4 The disastrous damage inflicted on Americans by the unprecedented attacks of September 11 awakened the American military thinkers to devise genuinely new ways of thinking. The White House hinted that America now needs a so-called third round of transformation in constructing its national security strategy -- as it did after the British invasion of the early 19 th century and at the advent of the Cold War. 5 The U.S. military now needs to reconfigure its military machine to be able to deal with elusive enemies whose activities are small in size, transnational and ubiquitous. The proponents of Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) in the American military provided a timely solution for adapting to the new types of threats. Notably, the RMA refers to a fundamental transformation in military strategy and operations that transpired in the process of amplifying combat effectiveness by linking Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Precision Guided Munitions (PGMS) with highly sophisticated C4I (Command and Control, Communication, Computer and Intelligence). This network-centric system-of-systems, which gathers accurate information through sophisticated battlefield awareness capabilities, relaying it to the shooter, has been proving its effectiveness in the most recent U.S.-led wars. Arthur Cebrowski, a retired admiral and a former Director of the Office of Force Transformation in the Pentagon, came up with the new concept of “Network-Centric Warfare (NCW).” Cebrowski’s men suggested a network-centric warfare for dramatically amplified war fighting effectiveness, which could be applied to suffocating by maximum vigilance of the terrorist groups to neutralization. A global network of real-time sensor-shooter linkage supported by agile and mobile forces dispersed around key nodes would successfully discourage any country to allow a haven for terrorist groups. “Network-centric warfare is characterized by the ability of geographically dispersed forces to attain a high level of shared battle-space awareness that is exploited to achieve massed effects swiftly without the physical massing of forces required in the past.” 6 This global rapid response system necessitates the reduction and relocation of forces still surrounding the Russian Federation following the old containment strategy. The Pentagon needed to find relevant force projection space to replace that of the past in its reconfiguration of the U.S. ground forces stationed around the globe. In the eyes of the Pentagon’s transformation planners, large contingents of U.S. ground forces on the Korean peninsula, equipped with heavily armored vehicles, impeding mobility, look somewhat outdated and less adaptable to the requirements of new missions in America’s war on terrorism. Other encouraging changes include enhanced lift capabilities and improved deployability of Rapid Deployment Forces (RDF). Transport aircraft like the C-17 now allow for rapid airlift of soldiers and even armored vehicles, reducing the need for advance deployment of large-scale ground forces. The Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT), a crucial component of the Army’s multifunctional Unit of Action (UA) under future chain of command such as UEx and UEy, will replace the army brigades. The future combat team of light infantry troops can be dispatched together with light armored vehicles to any part of the world. This attests to the desire of the U.S. Department of Defense for a global basing system that would reshape U.S. troops overseas to be smaller, modular, mobile, and thus adaptable to carrying out network-centric warfare against scattered and invisible enemies. Rumsfeld has specially emphasized speed, noting that, “In order to defend the American cities, allies, and deployed forces the United States is required to have rapidly deployable, fully-integrated, forces capable of reaching distant theaters quickly and working with air and sea forces to strike adversaries swiftly and with devastating effect.” 7 Accordingly, the Pentagon’s Office of Force Transformation laid out their requirements in the Global Defense Posture Review (GPR), noting that only forces oriented around “speed” are able to define or alter the initial conditions on terms favorable to the U.S. interests, effectively dissuading and defeating asymmetric threats of non-state adversaries. 8 Their report again proudly states, “The U.S. military is developing an enhanced forward deterrent posture through the integration of new combinations of immediately employable, forward stationed and deployed forces; globally available reconnaissance, strike, and command and control (C2) assets; information operations capabilities; and rapidly deployable, highly lethal, and sustainable forces that may come from outside a theater of operations.” 9 According to the transformation research team, ubiquitous, seamlessly joint, and virtually omniscient forces with capabilities for overcoming distance are expected to effectively break the will or otherwise shape the behavior of the elusive enemy. 10 Allowing no safe, hardened sanctuary anywhere in the globe, the potential adversary would no longer retain the will to fight, or would be so disoriented that they can no longer fight or react coherently. 11<br />

Now that the literature review is complete, it is possible to investigate the potential of NCW. This author has not found any proponents of NCW touting that this concept is the “Silver Bullet” to solve all the problems of future warfare. Many of the same problems that have plagued warfighters in the past exist today and will exist in the future: fog and friction, competing advances in technologies, the unpredictable nature of human behavior on the battlefield, and asymmetric warfare to name only a few. The issue isn’t the existence of these challenges to modern warfare but how one exploits the advantages of information to mitigate risk and take advantage of strengths in the force to achieve objectives. 35 Are the potential benefits of NCW worth the opportunity costs associated with aggressively moving forward with the implementation of this new concept? The concept of Network Centric Warfare has already moved beyond the “bumper sticker” stage. NCW is not a fad that will go quietly into the night. There is little doubt that DOD is spending significant finite resources to pursue NCW capabilities. DOD costs in the area of military electronics, aircraft avionics, vetronics, and missile guidance, communications, electro-optics is approaching $99.57 billion in the 2010. 36 There may be changes to terminology, shifts in policy, and alterations in implementation plans. However, the core concepts that relate to leveraging the power of information will remain. The DOD and senior military leaders have been consistent yet cautious in their support of a networked force. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld concisely stated the importance a fully networked force in the Transformation Planning Guidance, “We must achieve: fundamentally joint, network-centric, distributed forces capable of rapid decision superiority and massed effects across the operational environment. Realizing these capabilities will require transforming our people, processes, and military forces.” 37 ADM Giambastiani, former Commander U.S. Joint Forces Command stated, “A fully collaborative and networked force is an imperative, not a luxury.” 38 The former Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, General Michael Haggee said, “The capability to connect disparate units spread over the battlefield will help to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance to commanders who can then call in fire support…Information Technology (IT) will also be critical to Sea Basing, a key component of the Navy’s Sea Power 21 Concept.” 39 Vice Chief of Staff, U.S. Army Gen. Peter Chiarelli recently stated, “Access to information can mean the difference between living and dying.” 40 General William Wallace, USA (Ret.) goes on to caution that “despite the enormous benefits of using a network, it would be folly to lose sight of the fact that it is still merely a tool to aid the commander in understanding and decision making.” 41 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates wrote in his recent Foreign Affairs article, We should be modest about what military force can accomplish and what technology can accomplish. The advances in precision, sensor, information, and satellite technologies have led to extraordinary gains in what the U.S. military can do. The Taliban were dispatched within three months; Saddam’s regime was toppled in three weeks. A button can be pushed in Nevada, and seconds later a pickup truck will explode in Mosul. A bomb dropped from the sky can destroy a targeted house while leaving the one next to it intact. But no one should ever neglect the psychological, cultural, political, and human dimensions of warfare. 42 The question is not if DOD will proceed with NCW, but how.<br />

Unfortunately, several fundamental problems make it virtually impossible for the USAF to completely defend the cyber-based C4ISR critical requirements outlined above. First and foremost, as noted by Dr. Jabbour, Senior Scientist for Information Assurance, Information Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory, attacks on cyberspace can be extremely inexpensive, making it more cost-effective to asymmetrically deny, degrade, or destroy select U.S. capabilities than to match them. 10 At the basic level, adversaries need only a computer and connection to the Internet to attack U.S. cyber-based interests world-wide. 11 Even more complex attacks on infrastructure, such as destroying spaced-based satellites, are significantly cheaper than researching, building, fielding, and maintaining a similar integrated capability. For example, instead of spending billions to match U.S. satellite reconnaissance capabilities, a potential adversary may simply elect to spend millions to destroy or degrade U.S. reconnaissance satellites. Second, it is often difficult to detect attacks launched against cyberspace assets from cyberspace, let alone identify the culprit. 12 This, coupled with jurisdictional concerns, presents the USAF with a myriad of challenges and roadblocks when dealing with cyber-espionage and/or cyber-attacks. 13 For instance, how can the USAF respond to an unseen foe? Can it justify retaliation without convincing evidence? Could retaliation cause further adverse impacts to the USAF, other government agencies, or allies?<br />

Space-based threats proliferate as a result of the ever-growing global availability of <u><a class="wiki_link" href="/home">technology</a></u> and <u><a class="wiki_link" href="/home">access</a></u> to the space domain. There are huge incentives for states to invest in and use space, and the spread of space technologies has occurred. States with sufficient resources can now reach out to space and ‘‘touch’’ satellites through a variety of means, and achieve one and even more of the five Ds. Spacecraft are vulnerable to direct ascent weapons as demonstrated by the Chinese ASAT test, and to a variety of other groundbased, airborne, and space-based ASAT technologies. Direct-ascent launched, or orbit-based nuclear devices, can be detonated, generating radiation and other lethal effects to destroy unshielded electronics over a wide lethal range. Co-orbital ASATs could be employed, comparable to the old Soviet system that was tested extensively in the 1970s and early 80s. In a less likely scenario, space-borne mines can also be deployed in close proximity to spacecraft, or exploded to generate debris clouds that destructively engage whole classes of satellites in the same orbital plane or in crossing orbits. Ground, space-based, or airborne lasers could be used by adversaries to wreak havoc. Blinding operations could be executed and inflict effects ranging from temporary ‘‘dazzling’’ to permanent burnout of optical or other sensors with intense energy bursts. Ground systems, supporting communications, and their nodes, are vulnerable to diverse land, sea, or air kinetic attacks, including sabotage. Unprotected systems are also susceptible to electronic attack through jamming and electromagnetic deception techniques. Jammers emit signals that mask or prevent reception of desired signals; these methods can disrupt uplinks, downlinks, and even cross-links. By disabling the means of command and control, and data communications, jammers render satellites inoperable or unavailable. Electromagnetic deception techniques can be employed to confuse systems; this could include sending false, but deceptively plausible, commands that cause spacecraft to perform damaging or wasteful maneuvers, modify databases or execute configuration changes, or otherwise destroy it. Similarly, supporting terrestrial ground stations, computer networks, and links are vulnerable to information operation and cyber attacks. These attacks could involve directing global denial of service tasks, injecting fake commands, malicious software and viruses into the space system, performing unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of sensitive information (data interception), and causing unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of network information, services, and databases.<br />

According to the Department of Defense‘s Annual Report to Congress on the Military Power of the People’s Republic of China 2008, China is “pursuing comprehensive transformation from a mass army designed for protracted wars of attrition on its territory to one capable of fighting and winning short duration, high intensity conflicts along its periphery against high-tech adversaries – an approach that China refers to as preparing for ‘local wars under conditions of informatization.’” 24 Although this transformation initially appears to be aimed at a potential conflict over Taiwan, Department of Defense officials suggest China is planning for the future as well, essentially preparing its military for future conflicts over resources and/or territories. 25 Fully aware that it currently can‘t compete symmetrically against U.S. military forces, the cornerstone of China‘s new strategy is increasingly focusing on antiaccess strategies with a large emphasis on space and cyberspace. 26 China‘s buildup of cyber forces/capabilities, procurement of EW systems, and successful development of ASAT weaponry, mark China as one of the greatest threats to the USAF‘s cyber-based C4ISR.<br />

<strong>China’s ISR capabilities will coerce Taiwan into unification—destroys hegemony and causes escalation</strong><br />

Given these apparent objectives, China’s military modernization program has focused on building capabilities to coerce Taiwan into unification, establish capabilities for (time-limited) air supremacy over what Beijing calls the first island chain,25 and interdict and destroy U.S. surface ships steaming toward the region. China’s advanced destroyers and submarines can operate in and beyond the second island chain.26 Likewise, improvements in China’s command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR), including space-based and over-the-horizon sensors, could enable Beijing to identify, track, and target military activities deep into the western Pacific Ocean. China is also looking to extend its coercive capabilities (particularly the ability to conduct air and missile campaigns and blockades) against other claimants to waters and resources in the South and East China seas and to clear the waters of lawful U.S. maritime activity. According to the Pentagon’s 2010 report on the PLA, China’s base at Hainan Island is large enough to accommodate a mix of attack and ballistic missile submarines and surface combatants. The base’s underground facilities provide China with access to critical sea lanes and allow for “stealthy deployment of submarines into the South China Sea.” 27 In addition, new missile units with conventional missiles deployed at many locations within China could, together with airborne early warning and control capabilities and aerial refueling programs, extend China’s operational reach into the South China Sea. China’s expeditionary forces (three airborne divisions, two amphibious infantry divisions, two marine brigades, and approximately seven special operations groups) can be used in certain contingencies in North Korea or on Taiwan.28 Sino-U.S. Rivalry Washington’s military posture has supported the U.S. regional strategy of extending a security umbrella over allies and partners. The United States has relied on forward bases, particularly in Japan, to project air and sea power, and has relied heavily on carrier strike groups to steam to the region at the first sign of trouble. Washington’s command of the commons—air, sea, and space—has enabled the U.S. military to project and deploy large amounts of force to the region with relative impunity. The United States has used forward bases in East Asia and on Diego Garcia, as well as command of the Pacific as its own “lake,” to prosecute major wars in Vietnam and Korea, to send force into the Taiwan Strait several times in the twentieth century to quiet Chinese threats, to conduct major humanitarian relief operations that supported important U.S. policy goals in Southeast Asia, to prevent a coup in the Philippines, to deter war on the Korean Peninsula, to ensure the safety of maritime traffic from the Persian Gulf to Asia during the Iran-Iraq War, and to conduct a wide array of major exercises that have reassured all Washington’s regional partners.29 However, that strategy is now facing a serious challenge from Beijing. Near China (as well as in space and cyberspace), the United States will no longer enjoy the uncontested command of the seas and airspace that has allowed it to accomplish its manifold security tasks in Asia. China thus presents a serious challenge to Washington’s traditional security strategy. China could destabilize the region either by unsuccessfully vying for regional hegemony or by successfully becoming the region’s dominant player. An Asia characterized by a China vying for hegemony could devolve into economic or military spheres of influence from which the United States could be excluded, or the region could descend into a highly intense and destabilizing security competition. If the PRC succeeds in fashioning the capabilities to coerce and intimidate Asian states and to realize its apparent desire to be Asia’s dominant power, U.S. interests could be gravely endangered. China’s foreign policy goals and emerging military strategy conflict with some of Washington’s primary security interests in the region. For example, a Taiwan coerced into unification could change the strategic geography of the region in ways harmful to the maintenance of a forward defense and raise doubts about the steadfastness of U.S. security commitments. If China were to establish some degree of local air supremacy and a measure of sea control, it could coerce and intimidate key U.S. allies such as Japan, on whom Washington relies for a forward defense of the Pacific. A China that can block chokepoints in the South China Sea poses a threat to the United States’ interest in unimpeded access to the critical trade routes of Asia. A China with aircraft carriers (and the logistical support such ships need) can start to project power and gain a measure of sea control, thereby instigating harmful arms races as well as putting at risk U.S. maritime interests. In sum, if China were to realize its military aspirations, it could begin to achieve hegemony in one of the world’s most critical regions, enabling Beijing, if it chooses, to reshape the international system more to its liking and—for the first time since before the attack on Pearl Harbor—pose a threat to the United States from the Pacific.<br />

Despite recent headlines reporting the appearance of a Chinese stealth fighter prototype, of more concern to US military planners is the enabling technology that will produce the bite to China's military bark. This angst is focused on China's decade-long programme of military &quot;informationisation&quot; designed to leap-frog over US capabilities in the Pacific region. The PLA is rapidly developing asymmetric warfare techniques against US command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance infrastructure, known as &quot;C4ISR&quot; in military parlance. For China, with its inferior conventional military capabilities, the key to gaining the upper hand in a conflict with the US is to gain dominance of the space theatre and to damage its digital nerve system. China views space as a corner-stone of its future prosperity: a mandate from heaven for China's growth and military strength. For this reason, China is working hard to counter the Pentagon's monopoly in space and to build its own space-based deterrent. The PLA's doctrine of &quot;pressure point warfare&quot;, a multi-layered approach using space, cyberspace and information operations alongside conventional capabilities is designed to cripple an adversary in one swift strike. This fast paced and high-tech military modernisation has led to the emergence of weapons systems and technology, which in certain theatres has closed the military capability gap with the US considerably. These include directed energy, jamming and cyber attack technologies, designed to paralyse the US military machine. The PLA has recently developed and successfully tested advanced anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons systems, demonstrating it can destroy or manoeuvre close to enemy satellites in space. ASAT weapons are part of a new genre of &quot;assassin's mace&quot; or surprise weapons aimed at the Pentagon's Achilles Heel in space and cyberspace. All of these capabilities require state of the art signals processing and communications systems, technology which China has been developing indigenously to create its own command and control architecture. Carrier fears One of the most pressing concerns for the United States navy is the prospect of US aircraft carriers and other vessels being denied access to theatres of operation in the event that the US were dragged into a conflict over Taiwan or in support of its other Pacific allies. Coined by Pentagon planners as China's &quot;A2/AD&quot; (Anti Access/Area Denial) strategy, the PLA would attempt to prevent US aircraft carriers from deploying to theatre, targeted by Chinese torpedoes, Cruise Missiles and Anti Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASBMs). PLA tacticians know that a successful strike against a moving US aircraft carrier requires advanced space-based targeting assets and an ability to penetrate the US ballistic missile defence umbrella. They also know that their land-based missiles are vulnerable to attack from the US. One solution is to develop a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) capability, something which is also causing for concern for US defence secretary Robert Gates. The PLA's latest weapons systems serve as an opportunity to showcase China's considerable achievements and provide an anchor for the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. What the PLA is prepared to reveal in public is also directed at the domestic audience as much as abroad - hence the roll-out of the J-20 stealth fighter prototype and the likely launch of an aircraft carrier within a year or two. China, Taiwan and the United States do not want a confrontation; this would likely be a disaster of global proportions.<br />

<strong>Satellite vulnerabilities collapse hegemony—causes Taiwan War</strong><br />

One senior Air Force officer said that thanks to satellite technology the U.S. no longer fights in the fog of war, but in a “huge cloud of electrons.” However, because four-fifths of America’s military data is transmitted through unhardened commercial satellites, and a single Global Hawk unmanned surveillance drone flying over the Middle East can consume several times more bandwidth than was used in the whole of the 1991 war against Iraq, Air Force officers commonly describe space as being America’s “Achilles Heel.” 34 Referring to China’s January 11, 2007 direct-ascent ASAT test, General Hamel of the Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center said “if they take our asymmetric advantage in space, we go from an information age war machine to an industrial age war machine…shifting the balance; the edge will go to the adversary.” 35 Many specialists also argue that aside from the U.S. military dependency on orbital space, the U.S. economy, and in turn, much of the world economy, is also rapidly becoming dependent on space-based systems. They posit that, in effect, the U.S. is now a “space faring” nation whose very way of life is tied to the myriad capabilities provided by the orbital space medium. War games conducted as part of U.S. national security protocols, such as the Army-After-Next, Navy Global and Air Force Global Engagement series, Space Game 2 and Schriever 1 &amp; 2, as well as the privately conducted “DEADSATS” war games, conducted from the late 1990s and the early 2000s, confirm this view. According to some space experts who were intimately involved with the war games, the exercises exposed “a critical national Achilles heel that politicians, economists and corporate CEOs have largely ignored…losses in space can quickly affect the economic, social, and national security fabric not only of the United States, but of the entire world.” These experts further speculate that “large military powers,” such as the United States, could “be held hostage by the unknowns inherent in a new kind of war.” 36 These concerns are directly linked with China’s ASAT weapons and their potential applicability in any future U.S.-Sino conflict. A more recent war game, “Pacific Vision,” conducted by Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) underscored the vulnerability of the unprotected commercial communication satellite channels on which the Air Force relies, as well as its cyber and radar vulnerabilities to Chinese attack. 37 Any possible U.S. military contingency around the Taiwan Strait would require secure satellites as the U.S. becomes ever more reliant upon its space systems. Moreover, reconnaissance satellites are thought to limit the risk inherent in the build-up of forces that both the PRC and the U.S. could be expected to deploy to the region in the event of a crisis. However, if the U.S. was blinded as the result of a preemptive Chinese ASAT attack, the conflict could quickly escalate to a dangerous level. According to two experts on the subject, “if there is a great-power war in the twenty-first century, our crystal ball says that it will be between the United States and China over Taiwan, with a very serious potential for a horrible escalatory process.” 38 This underscores the gravity of the topic as well as the negative impact the Chinese shift towards fielding ASAT weapons could have.<br />

<strong>US-China War over Taiwan goes nuclear—rapid escalation—only information solves</strong><br />
<strong>Bush and O’Hanlon 07</strong>, Richard C. Bush, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and director of its Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, Michael O'Hanlon, senior fellow in Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution, where he specializes in U.S. defense strategy (“A War Like No Other: The Truth About China's Challenge to America”, p. 186, google books)<br />
If war resulted, escalation pressures would be enormous. It would be the first significant war between nuclear weapons states in world history. And the nuclear arsenals of the two sides could, as unreasonable and illogical as it sounds, come into play. Nuclear exchanges could even result. At a time when the threat of superpower nuclear war has become much less vivid in the public eye due to the end of the Cold War, a Taiwan crisis could—ironically enough—quickly create the most serious nuclear risk since the Cuban Missile Crisis. The conclusion is not intended to be melodramatic. Even in the event of war, the risk of nuclear conflagration would be be much less than fifty-fifty, since both sides would surely recognize the dangers. But crises have dynamics all their own. What neither side would see as desirable could nonetheless occur as the fog of war impeded accurate and timely information flows and clouded leaders’ judgments—and as the loss of lives raised the stakes to the point where neither Beijing nor Washington could easily back down. In addition, the war plans of the two sides could create momentum of their own. Although details are classified (and always changing in any even), in the past these war plans apparently have called for hastier escalation than political leaders generally appreciate. This may have changed of late, and certainly recent American commanders in the region have been sensitive to the need to build positive relationships with China and to avoid assuming that conflict would quickly escalate. But predisposition to restraint may not easily survive direct combat with a major military power; arguments in favor of rapid escalation will be powerful, whether or not the carry the day. Leaders in Taiwan, China, and the United States need to think these issues through thoroughly in advance—for the sake of their war plans, their diplomacy, and their politics. They must figure out how to avoid escalation in any serious crisis or war that beings—for once the three parties get to that point, avoiding all-out U.S.-China war is more important than other realistic concerns. Indeed, it is so paramount in importance that Taipei, Beijing, and Washington must avoid the temptation to manufacture crises or play politics with the independence of sovereignty issues.<br />

The Secretary of Defense should direct full funding for the key programs, TSAT and JTRS in particular, and push for their earliest possible deployments. This should be done concurrent with critical reviews of continuing legacy systems procurements since these may not be able to provide the required net-centric capabilities. Both GAO and independent assessments have determined that the technologies necessary for TSAT development are mature. History tells us that funding inadequacy and uncertainty inevitably lead to cost and schedule increases, and that operational users are reluctant to transition away from a legacy system to one whose future is uncertain. Fully funding and aggressively executing the TSAT program is therefore essential. Accordingly, the USAF should be directed to establish a firm cost, schedule, and performance baseline and aggressively execute it, and should adequately and fully fund full scale development of the TSAT system.<br />
Current systems are insufficient—TSATs create high-speed communication and interoperability<br />

Significant problems derive from limitations on the dissemination of collected data. Currently, meta-data are not consistently applied and tags are not consistent from agency to agency. Military commanders demand much larger quantities and more sophisticated types of intelligence (especially tactical imagery), but in many cases are unaware of and incapable of accessing data available throughout the intelligence community. “The number of images and signal intercepts are well beyond the capacity of the existing analyst community so there are huge backlogs for translators and image interpreters and much of the collected data are never reviewed. Further, decision makers and intelligence analyst have difficulty knowing what information is available.” Although an enormous number of full-motion video missions in support of tactical commanders has been conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan, the task force suggested that surveillance has often been episodic and continuing coverage of a given region had not always been possible. The task force report emphasized that the ISR concept encompasses more than platforms for collection. It noted that DOD has developed the Global Information Grid which includes a high-speed communications network of various ground, air and space components. There is a need, according to the task force, for better ways for tactical commanders to access this information “on the move” and thus it emphasized the advantages of assured and accessible communications as would be made available by the redundant and complementary communications capabilities terrestrial fiber, government and civilian communications satellites, networks built and maintained by specific agencies. (The task force advocated the Transformational Satellite System (TSAT) to provide links to the fiber network to mobile and fixed theater commands. TSAT was subsequently killed by DOD because it was considered duplicative.) A key goal should be, according to the Task Force, to ensure that future communications systems adhere to interoperability standards to ensure that they can support joint and international operations as well as “reach back” to U.S. agencies for analytical support. The essential concern of the task force was to ensure that the ongoing proliferation of platforms and sensors be matched by sufficient communications capabilities to enable their use. Currently, they found that “Our rapidly growing airborne ISR collection capabilities are not in balance with supporting communications.”<br />

By all accounts, the success of the Pentagon’s ambitious plan to transform the U.S. military into a network-centric force is riding on the transformational satellite communications system (T-Sat) now in development. Defense planners are convinced that full-scale military transformation and network-centric operations will be impossible to achieve without the spaceborne communications that the revolutionary T-Sat constellation would provide. The military has begun its transition to highly mobile, fast-reaction, quick-strike, netcentric forces that include increasing numbers of autonomous or semiautonomous systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It therefore requires ultrareliable, superswift communications among all sorts of sensor systems, weapons platforms, and command posts in the air, on land, and at sea around the globe. T-Sats will be the space element, and the sine qua non, of the military’s planned GIG (global information grid)—its “Internet in the sky.” Thus the T-Sat system is seen as “the cornerstone of [the Defense Dept.’s] future information operations,” the “centerpiece of our future global communications network,” and “the heart of the DOD net-centric operations environment concept essential to all future operations,” a Pentagon document proclaims.<br />

The T-Sat system is the heart of the Pentagon’s transformational communications architecture (TCA), devised by defense scientists in 2004 under the direction of Peter Teets, former undersecretary of the Air Force. The TCA resulted from the transformational communications study (TCS) undertaken by the Defense Dept. in 2002. The architecture addresses, among other things, wideband space-to-space and space-to-high-altitude airborne communications using a common standard for laser communication; communications and relay satellites; ground terminals; operational management systems; and communications interfaces. The TCA makes sure that new, transformational satcom systems will be able to connect with existing, or legacy, systems in space. The Air Force-managed T-Sat/T-MOS system is being developed to do just that. Meink explains that T-Sat will be “the means of removing communications constraints in terms of capacity, control, adaptability, responsiveness, and coverage,” and of meeting global U.S. requirements for communications across the defense, intelligence, and civil communities, including NASA. “T-Sat would be a key enabler of our forces whether or not they go to this idealized net-centric warfare,” Meink says. “T-Sat would be critical to what our forces are capable of doing right now, not just to what they’ll be capable of doing in the future. We’re trying to do as much as we can with what we have right now.”<br />

At risk also is the development of the Transformational Satellite Communications program, or TSAT, an Air Force project that is supposed to work with Future Combat Systems. The Defense Department is planning to cut about $4 billion of the TSAT budget over the next five years, partly because of congressional concerns about an expensive and technical project that already has been cut, delayed and restructured. The Air Force has yet to select a contractor for the project, though Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the two leading contenders, have both been working on development contracts. TSAT would be about 100 times faster than military satellites in orbit now, Air Force officials say. That's to an extent because the satellites would take advantage of the latest Internet technology to reroute communications traffic more efficiently, they say. TSAT is expected to also provide more securely encrypted communications for Future Combat Systems to prevent enemies from intercepting or jamming signals. Until recently, military officials said the program would launch its first satellite in 2016, though now they say the schedule is uncertain. According to a 2006 report, the GAO said TSAT began without sufficiently mature technology, noting that costs have increased and the timetable has been delayed. Before the latest cutbacks, according to the Air Force, the program had increased by about $8 billion, or 50 percent, to $24 billion, including inflation. The new cutbacks will defer work, delaying the timetable and adding to the program's overall expense because of &quot;the costs associated with extending the contract to perform necessary work,&quot; the military said. But Richard Pino, the Air Force's TSAT program director, said &quot;the technologies are all at the right levels of maturity.&quot; Boeing's Muilenburg said the prospect of additional cuts should not pose a problem for Future Combat Systems. In lieu of TSAT, he said that the Army program could use current military and commercial satellites. Loren B. Thompson, a defense consultant at the Lexington Institute, a public policy think tank, said, however, that TSAT &quot;is crucial to the secure networking capabilities that underpin&quot; Future Combat Systems. Given the cutbacks, he said, &quot;If TSAT collapses, which looks like a distinct possibility, soldiers may have to rely on links that are harder to access on the move, more vulnerable to jamming and interceptions, and offer nowhere near as much bandwidth.&quot; Cristina Chaplain, who oversees the GAO's review of space systems, also said that &quot;TSAT was being designed to support communications on the move, whereas other programs don't do that to the extent that's needed by&quot; Future Combat Systems.<br />

The Transformational Satellite Communications System (TSAT) is one of our newest programs. TSAT will augment and eventually replace the AEHF satellite communications system and will provide unprecedented satellite communications with Internet-like capability to extend the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) to deployed users worldwide as well as deliver an order of magnitude increase in capacity over AEHF. TSAT will be our first family of satellites to perform on-board/on-orbit routing of data using Internet Protocol (IP), initially IP version 6 in the case of TSAT. This on-board routing, performed by the Next Generation Processor Router, will allow huge increases in satellite efficiency because static connections will no longer have to be established and maintained, whether they are being actively used or not. Like Milstar and AEHF, TSAT will provide worldwide, secure, survivable satellite communications to U.S. strategic and tactical forces during all levels of conflict, in the EHF band. Unlike Milstar and AEHF, which have Radio Frequency crosslinks to connect the satellites in a ring, TSAT will have laser communications crosslinks. These crosslinks will be capable of moving 40 gigabytes per second when we complete fielding of the 5-satellite (plus an on-orbit spare) constellation. In addition, TSAT will have large antennas to support our tactical force’s need for protected communication-on-the-move, with small diameter vehicle-mounted antennas. The Transformational Satellite Communications System Mission Operations System will provide network management for the TSAT system, providing network-centric interoperability between TSAT and the Department of Defense’s Global Information Grid. The space segment will also include laser communications and Ka-band RF for air and space intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) users. As TSAT will be IPv6 and have an on-board router, mission planning and execution will be an order of magnitude more dynamic—and flexible—than it is today. To address this new capability, the program includes a payload and network management segment called TMOS—the TSAT Mission Operations System. Of note, TSAT will not have common user wideband communications capability, so it is not a follow on to WGS.<br />

The TSAT system will serve as a Tier 1 provider of data transport services with the overall Network-Centric architecture of the DoD. As a Tier 1 provider, the TSAT system will provide global coverage and connectivity for users. Compliance with the Network-Centric vision requires that TSAT natively support Internet protocols and packet forwarding capabilities. The TSAT network transports data as cipher text in accordance with the black core vision of the Global Information Grid (GIG) architecture. The TSAT system will be backwards compatible (i.e., interoperate and connect to AEHF, the predecessor circuit-based MILSATCOM system). As a result, the TSAT system will provide AEHF compatible interfaces and the ability to plan and provision AEHF circuits. The TSAT system will also interconnect with the MUOS and WGS constellations. As illustrated in Figure 1, TSAT will provide data transport services for the following main mission categories: i) strategic, ii) tactical, and iii) airborne/spaceborne intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. The ability to support each mission category imposes particular requirements for the TSAT system. Support for the strategic mission implies that TSAT links be anti-jam and low probability of intercept. Therefore, TSAT links must provide robust communications under natural or directed channel impairments. The system will be capable of transmitting with greater spectral efficiency under benign channel conditions. In the case of tactical environment, the TSAT system will support a large number of terminals in multiple theaters of operation. The terminals typically vary in the transmission modes (coding, modulation, and burst rates) they support, the environment they operate in, their degree of mobility, their bandwidth demands, their participation in joint operations, their access to administrative/ management support, the type of application traffic they transport and their susceptibility to threats. The airborne and space ISR missions demand high-rate data links between globally located sensing platforms to selected processing centers, primarily in the continental United States. The TSAT system architecture therefore must accommodate a range of heterogeneous users.<br />

<strong>The James Webb Space Telescope is on the chopping block in Congress – only reviving it can preserve US science leadership</strong><br />

The House Appropriations Committee proposed Wednesday to kill the James Webb Space Telescope, the crown jewel of NASA’s astronomy plans for the next two decades. The telescope, named after a former administrator of NASA, is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, and it was designed to study the first stars and galaxies that emerged in the first hundred million years or so after the Big Bang. It was supposed to be launched in 2014, but NASA said last year that the project would require at least an additional $1.6 billion and several more years to finish, because of mismanagement. The announcement of the telescope’s potential demise came as part of a draft budget for NASA and other agencies, including the Commerce and Justice Departments. In all, the committee proposed lopping $1.6 billion off NASA’s current budget, which is $18.4 billion for 2011. The Obama administration had originally requested $18.7 billion for NASA. Astronomers reacted with immediate dismay, fearing that the death of the Webb telescope could have the same dire impact on American astronomy that killing the Superconducting Supercollider, a giant particle accelerator in Texas, did in 1993 for American physics, sending leadership abroad. Canceling the Webb telescope would “have a profound impact on astrophysics far into the future, threatening U.S. leadership in space science,” said Matt Mountain, director of theSpace Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which would run the new telescope. “This is particularly disappointing at a time when the nation is struggling to inspire students to take up science and engineering,” he added. Tod R. Lauer, an astronomer at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory in Tucson, echoed his view. “This would be an unmitigated disaster for cosmology,” he said. “After two decades of pushing the Hubble to its limits, which has revolutionized astronomy, the next step would be to pack up and give up. The Hubble is just good enough to see what we’re missing at the start of time.” The Webb telescope, he said, “would bring it home in full living color.”<br />

Hubble, and the other ongoing Great Observatories (Chandra and Spitzer) have demonstrated the value and cost-effectiveness of broadly-capable space observatories through their wide-ranging and continuing scientific discoveries. Such Great Observatories have been shown to return discoveries very cost-effectively. The Great Observatories have also made a disproportionately large contribution to advancing public science interest and literacy (Hubble again is the pre-eminent example). Furthermore, the breadth of the science programs that such flagship missions can undertake, along with their ability to respond quickly to discoveries from other missions and observatories, makes them a truly unique scientific resource that benefits large numbers of scientists, their students and their postdoctoral researchers. Hubble’s role in the discovery of planets beyond our solar system, of dark energy, and of young galaxies looking back through 96% of time to just 500 Myr after the Big Bang are some of the many examples of forefront science areas that have touched the popular imagination. JWST will play a similar role to Hubble, except that its dramatically higher performance will lead to an even broader range of studies and discoveries even closer to the cuttingedge of astrophysical frontiers. The James Webb Space Telescope Advisory Committee (JSTAC) is an international committee of senior members of the scientific community who are experienced with large space projects and their optimal operation. Given the importance and cost of JWST, the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Director set up JSTAC with the support and concurrence of NASA, ESA and CSA. The core focus of the JSTAC is to offer advice on maximizing the scientific return from JWST within its 5-year required life (10-yr goal). The JSTAC’s recommendations to the STScI Director are made available to the space agencies and are also made public to the science community (and all interested parties) through the STScI website. The space agencies are also cognizant of the JSTAC’s deliberations and recommendations through their ex-officio agency members. The JSTAC fully endorses the completion of the construction and the launch of JWST not only because it will dramatically increase humanity’s understanding of the cosmos, but also because it will continue Hubble's legacy of inspiring the next generation of scientists. JWST will also demonstrate technologies crucial for future NASA science missions of all sizes. The JSTAC is very concerned that recent funding and management issues during the development process for JWST may place the future of the mission at risk. The JWST Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP) report provided a critical assessment of the recent management problems and budget issues in response to a letter from Senator Mikulski to the NASA Administrator. As the ICRP report noted, technical progress on the mission had been excellent but a number of issues have arisen that require additional funding to resolve. The JSTAC recognizes the fiscal challenges facing the US as well as the international partners, but asks for your support and that of OSTP to work with OMB and NASA, and ultimately Congress, to find a costeffective approach to bring this remarkable mission to fruition. The impact of not moving forward expeditiously towards launching JWST as soon as practical would reverberate far beyond the astronomical science community. The cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) had ramifications for US leadership in the physical sciences that is still being felt. The center of gravity of highenergy physics moved to Europe. As a project of comparable scale and scientific importance, JWST is crucial to US scientific leadership both in science and through the visibility of its space program. US leadership in space has arisen through NASA’s human spaceflight program and through its stunningly successful and popular science missions. To abandon JWST at this time would not only have a dramatic impact on NASA’s science programs, but would also have a dramatic impact on US leadership in space. JWST, like Hubble, is a flagship program that has public visibility and scientific capabilities far beyond smaller missions. The cost and the risks of flagships are more than compensated for by the scientific and public interest returns. Our international partners are making very substantial investments in JWST, and are key partners for the US effort. The contributions of the European Space Agency (ESA), its member states and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) are central to the success of the project. Europe is providing two scientific instruments, the launch vehicle and operations staff for the project at the STScI. In value, this contribution is equivalent to the total cost of a medium-sized space mission within ESA. The Canadian contribution of the critical fine guidance sensor and a further science instrument is the largest space science project supported to date by the Canadian Space Agency. The CSA also provides operations staff at the STScI. The international contributions have been essential for the development and implementation of the project and their contributions represent a major commitment of their resources towards a project that will do much to raise the visibility of the US and its technological capabilities. JWST is challenging but doable. No other nation could currently undertake a mission of the scale of JWST. JWST distinguishes the US technologically and scientifically, and is a striking example of US leadership in the field of space science. The JSTAC asks for your support in moving JWST forward expeditiously to launch. I would be happy to provide further information or a briefing on the importance of the JWST science mission from the perspective of the JSTAC.<br />

To discover sustainable hegemony in an increasingly multipolar world, American policy makers will need more than the Kaysen list of advantages from basic science. Dr. Carl Kaysen served President John Kennedy as deputy national security adviser and over his long career held distinguished professorships in Political Economy at Harvard and MIT. During the 1960s, Kaysen laid out a framework with four important reasons why a great power, the United States in particular, should take a strategic interest in the basic sciences. 1. Scientific discoveries provided the input for applied research, which in turn produced technologies crucial for wielding economic and military power. 2. Scientific activity educated a cadre of operators for leadership in industries relevant to government such as health care and defense. 3. Science proficiency generated the raw elements for mounting focused, applied efforts such as the Manhattan Project during World War II to build the first atomic bomb. 4. Scientific progress built a basic research reserve that when necessary could move quickly to shore up national needs.1 These arguments underscored science‘s contribution to new products and services that provided market or military advantages. The pursuit of physics, chemistry, and biology at the frontiers of knowledge could have direct effects on national excellence. The following sections of this article extend Kaysen‘s list for the present multi-polar world. The United States’ largest military and economic shares in such a world do not guarantee empire. Soft power from scientific achievement, however, may make up part of the deficit, enough to augment America‘s reputation and American leadership in the international order. The U.S. science establishment is then described and evaluated for its capacity to integrate and leverage the complete list of science benefits: Kaysen‘s nation-based items plus the civilization-based advantages exposited here. Case studies of the Office of Naval Research and U.S. scientific outreach to Brazil illustrate underlying strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. system for maintaining the lead in basic science. Among the weaknesses, democratic regimes tend to suffocate professions, particularly in the sciences, due to natural hostility between democracy and technocracy. The United States might yet find the right balance by inculcating a politically sophisticated professionalism. In other areas of heavy government responsibility—finance, health care, foreign intelligence, and defense—officials and the public have over time placed considerable trust in expert agents. With greater scientific literacy at the mass level and greater political literacy at the scientific level, America‘s state and society may forge a somewhat freer, healthier relationship with American science, accruing benefits for U.S. material power in the long run and, in the short run, for persuasive influence in the international system. Science and International Leadership In their book on Leading Sectors and World Powers (1996), George Modelski and William Thompson extended their analysis of innovation back, beyond the birth of industrial capitalism, to the Sung Dynasty in China at the turn of the First Millennium. 2 Modelski and Thompson mentioned inventions like the compass that helped leaders extract wealth from maritime East-West trade routes, but they also noted the Sung rulers’ cultivation of knowledge and the influence of Chinese intellectuals on administrative reform. A scientific society has the opportunity to apply methods and models toward political and economic questions. Just before the November 2008 elections, the New York Times’ David Ignatius sat down with two former national security advisers, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft, for a series of interviews on foreign policy. 3 In their discussion of complementary strengths that could lay the groundwork for greater transatlantic cooperation, the advisers noted how impressive it was that the European Union could knit together so many independent states with sophisticated, comprehensive rules and regulations without inadvertently strangling economic growth. It seems improbable that Europe could build the administrative structures for a successful common currency or a single labor market without an ethos that came from scientific competence. Progress in the physical sciences can spill over in a way that supports modern institutions and efficient public policy. Spillover to social sciences reinforces the notion that scientific progress and scientific literacy are civilizing influences. As such they can fortify what Joseph Nye termed a country‘s soft power, its capacity to establish appealing precedents for the rest of the world. 4 Science shares properties with Olympic sport in that it can open avenues for non-coercive cultural hegemony. Foreign emulation in science, though, counts for more than soccer or gymnastics. The demonstration effect in physics may initially appear as man-overcoming-Nature rather than man-versus man, but great scientific advance is more cumulative than victory in the Games. Anyone seeking to take the next step must accommodate the vernacular of the pioneer and accept his tutelage in the universal logic governing scientific concepts. Moreover, the ingenuity and skills on display as a citizen in a specific nation-state, albeit working at university, unlocks another secret of nature register around the world as excellence that could someday be harnessed by government and adapted to the state-versus-state context. That fungibility garners international respect and piques interest in greater collaboration. In his study of American science overtures to Europe during the first decades of the Cold War, John Krige related how overlapping interests and in some instances the overlapping community of scientists and government officials infused pure science aid with foreign policy purpose. The construction of CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire) for all-European particle research in Geneva. European conferences of the well-connected Ford Foundation and the development of the NATO Science Committee did not simply advance basic knowledge; they also nurtured a special dialogue, unencumbered by normal diplomatic preoccupations. This privileged communication nevertheless facilitated American hegemony and buttressed Western solidarity against intimidation, or alternate offers, from the Soviet Union. In material balance of power terms, the larger economy and more capable nuclear forces of the United States were seen as less threatening to Western Europe than the Red Army, deployed just over the makeshift border with East Germany. 5 Cultural appeal, including scientific prowess as well as liberal democratic ideals, afforded the United States extra diplomatic margin as it simultaneously expanded its own arsenal and its alliances against a technically inferior opponent. Finally, during the late-Cold War, after 1970, the economic rise of Germany and Japan, the larger diplomatic role of China, and the greater international participation from post-colonial governments in the developing world reshaped the global agenda. Problems traditionally managed by the great powers— arms control, arms proliferation, international development, environmental consequences of industrialization and urbanization—were picked up by non-governmental entities who sought to influence state behavior. Given their small budgets and their status as outside observers rather than diplomats or official negotiators, specialized knowledge was their instrument of choice. As transportation and communication technologies improved through the 1980s and 1990s, issue-based groups and public policy institutes proliferated, combining with academic researchers to build epistemic communities.<br />

Paul Kennedy was probably right: the US will go the way of all great powers — down. The individual dramas of the past decade — the September 2001 terrorist attacks, prolonged wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis — have delivered the world a message: US primacy is in decline. This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline, but it encompasses a trend that appears to be negative and perhaps alarming. Although the US still possesses incomparable military prowess and its economy remains the world’s largest, the once seemingly indomitable chasm that separated America from anyone else is narrowing. Thus, the global distribution of power is shifting, and the inevitable result will be a world that is less peaceful, liberal and prosperous, burdened by a dearth of effective conflict regulation. Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts. However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid. As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves.’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law. Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that America’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes$A world without American hegemony is one where great power wars re-emerge, the liberal international system is supplanted by an authoritarian one, and trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy.<br />

<strong>Soft power solves democracy</strong><br />

The United States has also attempted to use soft power to promote the spread of democracy around the globe. Unlike in the other two issue areas, the U.S. democracy promotion campaigns met with some success as evidenced by a spate of electoral revolutions in the postcommunist region. We argue that the successful inﬂuence of these U.S. democracy promotion efforts is due to the presence of the necessary conditions for an effective soft power campaign. In the countries that experienced electoral revolutions, there was a functioning marketplace of ideas, the United States identiﬁed and supported credible messengers to transmit ideas about democratization, and ideas about the best practices for bringing down authoritarian regimes could signiﬁcantly impact the outcome. In recent years, the United States has devoted a disproportionate amount of its democracy promotion attention to the postcommunist region. The proportion of countries receiving USAID democracy assistance, and the duration of time over which the countries receive assistance, are higher in the postcommunist region than in other world regions. A survey of USAID funding from 1990–2003 “reveals that the postcommunist region stands out as a clear priority for USAID with respect to democracy assistance.” 73 Other U.S. government-funded democracy promotion organizations such as the National Endowment for Democracy have similarly concentrated their resources on the postcommunist region. The U.S.’s soft power strategies aimed at promoting democracy in the postcommunist world since the end of the Cold War have met with notable success. The rate of electoral revolutions in this region has been staggering. According to a recent study, “pivotal elections that have either enhanced or introduced democracy have taken place in eight countries, or 40 percent of the twenty postcommunist countries that remained eligible for such revolutions.” 74 The well-publicized “color revolutions” swept through Georgia (The Rose Revolution, 2003), Ukraine (The Orange Revolution, 2004), and Kyrgyzstan (The Tulip Revolution, 2005). The available studies on the wave of electoral revolutions in the postcommunist region all identify American democracy promotion efforts as an important contributing cause of these revolutions, and some scholars go so far as to argue that the revolutions were signiﬁcantly engineered by the United States. 75 For example, in a recent study on Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, Michael McFaul writes that the ideas and resources provided by the United States and other external actors “did play a direct, causal role in constraining some dimensions of autocratic power and enhancing some dimensions of the opposition’s power.” 76 The United States invested in opposition, media, and civil society groups, signaled their displeasure with incumbent authoritarian regimes, and intervened to prevent incumbent regimes from stealing elections. 77<br />

This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security and well-being in the coming years and decades. In the former Yugoslavia nationalist aggression tears at the stability of Europe and could easily spread. The flow of illegal drugs intensifies through increasingly powerful international crime syndicates that have made common cause with authoritarian regimes and have utterly corrupted the institutions of tenuous, democratic one. Nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons continue to proliferate. The very source of life on Earth, the global ecosystem, appears increasingly endangered. Most of these new and unconventional threats to security are associated with or aggravated by the weakness or absence of democracy, with its provisions for legality, accountability, popular sovereignty, and openness. Lessons of the Twentieth Century The experience of this century offers important lessons. Countries that govern themselves in a truly democratic fashion do not go to war with one another. They do not aggress against their neighbors to aggrandize themselves or glorify their leaders. Democratic governments do not ethnically &quot;cleanse&quot; their own populations, and they are much less likely to face ethnic insurgency. Democracies do not sponsor terrorism against one another. They do not build weapons of mass destruction to use on or to threaten one another. Democratic countries form more reliable, open, and enduring trading partnerships. In the long run they offer better and more stable climates for investment. They are more environmentally responsible because they must answer to their own citizens, who organize to protest the destruction of their environments. They are better bets to honor international treaties since they value legal obligations and because their openness makes it much more difficult to breach agreements in secret. Precisely because, within their own borders, they respect competition, civil liberties, property rights, and the rule of law, democracies are the only reliable foundation on which a new world order of international security and prosperity can be built.<br />

Today, however, a new moment of challenge and opportunity awaits the transatlantic alliance. Confronted by financial crisis, unstable energy supplies, an aging population and ominous climate change, a consensus has emerged in both Europe and the United States that we must answer these urgent challenges with substantially increased innovation. And the election of President Barack Obama, with his clear belief in the importance of science to virtually all societal issues, is a clear signal that the United States is poised to bring renewed commitment to the global scientific enterprise. “We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology’s wonders to raise health care’s quality and lower its cost,” Obama said in his inaugural address. “We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universi­ ties to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. All this we will do.” These are welcome words, and they are sure to galvanise new efforts on both sides of the Atlantic. This is, therefore, a crucial moment for the future of the European­U.S. science and engineering relationship. By themselves, excitement and energy will not address key questions; to chart the way forward, there must be deliberations at high levels of our governments and our research institutions. That is precisely why the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre hosted a joint brainstorming at the recent AAAS Annual Meeting in Chicago (12­16 February). An immediate outcome planned for next October will be the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding and the hosting of a high­level AAAS­JRC science summit to mark the 50 th anniversary of the Joint Research Centre’s Ispra site in Italy. Among the many questions for discussion will be how can Europe and the United States develop a shared approach to the policy­making challenges that confront us? How do we allow for both the benefits of creative and economic competition and cohesive, efficient cooperation? As we try to mobilise a large, complex system for action, what are the particular roles of individual scientists and engineers, their labo­ ratories and universities, professional associations and foundations? What role should industry play? Ultimately these discussions between technical and policy experts will provide the connective tissue and critical steps for turning words into action. Science has always been international, of course. Hundreds of years ago, Europe’s rise was shaped by Persian and Arab understanding of mathematics, astronomy and medicine and by Chinese inventions such as printing, the compass and gunpowder. Scientific and technological progress in the early days of America would have been stunted without Europe’s academic excellence and industrial techniques. During the Cold War, bilateral science and technology agreements were crucial in thawing tensions with the Soviet Union and China. Throughout the 20 th century, the transatlantic part­ nership has helped produce historic progress in fields ranging from medicine and genetics to physics, communication and space exploration. Today our students move freely between universities and labs in the United States and Europe; from telescopes high atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii to developing the Large Hadron Collider beneath the Franco­Swiss countryside, our scientists and engineers are working together on important projects. However, as we look to the future, with new technologies making collaboration easier and more productive, a more comprehensive approach to cooperation has become imperative. The intertwined issues of energy and climate change are the most obvious challenge, and the most urgent. They also may be the most obvious examples where international cooperation is a must between various groups in the United States, the Joint Research Centre and other European and world actors. Patterns of energy consumption by industrialised nations are causing global geopolitical instability and profound damage to the Earth’s climate. Finding and implement­ ing solutions will require the involvement of scientists from many disciplines, as well as policymakers at every level of governments and in every nation. Many people believe that the United States and Europe must be at the hub of action, if only because they historically have been the biggest sources of greenhouse gases. They must find “an agreed formula” on how to address climate change, Germany’s ambassador to the United States, Klaus Scharioth, said during a recent meeting of European ambassadors at the University of California­Los Angeles. “If we don’t do it, we have not the slightest chance of convincing the Chinese and the Indians and the Brazilians or anybody else.” Ambassador Scharioth’s point applies as well to the way we must approach other global challenges: the health of our oceans and fisheries, the spread and control of infectious disease, improved food production, the development of clean water supplies, and efforts to control the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While it may be correct that Europe and the United States need to lead these efforts, our research efforts must be opened up as much as possible to all interested nations. That is not just a diplomatic gesture; our researchers stand to gain new insights and research opportunities by working with colleagues in every nation. Nations that just a decade ago were considered ‘Third World’ are today making signifi­ cant investments in scientific research, development and education, and are studying exactly the same problems facing more developed countries, even if the details of the problems facing them are different. Individual scientists and their institutions, both in Europe and the United States, are already involved in a range of cooperative ventures with these nations. But if we make these efforts more systematic, the trans­ atlantic nations can help anchor a global network of scientific knowledge. There is an emerging effort in the United States to use the international character of science to help build trust and cooperation among nations, particularly among those whose governmental relationships have been strained. For example, scholars and scientists in the United States have put ‘science diplomacy’ into practice and recently met with counterparts from North Korea, Iran, and Cuba, among others. Similarly, we need to expand scientific engagement with Russia, China and nations of the Middle East, where coopera­ tion will be crucial if we want to address issues such as climate change, energy and nuclear proliferation on a global scale. Last fall, a group of U.S. elected officials, diplomats, and leaders from science, business and education met in Washington, D.C., to develop strategies for expanded science diplomacy. Like the European ambassadors who met at UCLA, many at that meeting were hopeful that the new Obama Administration will see science diplomacy as a critical tool for solving problems and building global peace and prosperity. These early efforts could begin to reverse the mistrust and hostility that have produced a global stalemate in recent years. As we prepare for the tests ahead, history reminds us that a strong commitment to the Euro­U.S. partnership will give us a foundation for work that will help solve many of the world’s most pressing problems and improve life for our children, our grand­ children, and billions of people on every continent.<br />

A pandemic will kill off all humans. In the past, humans have indeed fallen victim to viruses. Perhaps the best-known case was the bubonic plague that killed up to one third of the European population in the mid-14th century (7). While vaccines have been developed for the plague and some other infectious diseases, new viral strains are constantly emerging — a process that maintains the possibility of a pandemic-facilitated human extinction. Some surveyed students mentioned AIDS as a potential pandemic-causing virus. It is true that scientists have been unable thus far to find a sustainable cure for AIDS, mainly due to HIV’s rapid and constant evolution. Specifically, two factors account for the virus’s abnormally high mutation rate: 1. HIV’s use of reverse transcriptase, which does not have a proof-reading mechanism, and 2. the lack of an error-correction mechanism in HIV DNA polymerase (8). Luckily, though, there are certain characteristics of HIV that make it a poor candidate for a large-scale global infection: HIV can lie dormant in the human body for years without manifesting itself, and AIDS itself does not kill directly, but rather through the weakening of the immune system. However, for more easily transmitted viruses such as influenza, the evolution of new strains could prove far more consequential. The simultaneous occurrence of antigenic drift (point mutations that lead to new strains) and antigenic shift (the inter-species transfer of disease) in the influenza virus could produce a new version of influenza for which scientists may not immediately find a cure. Since influenza can spread quickly, this lag time could potentially lead to a “global influenza pandemic,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (9). The most recent scare of this variety came in 1918 when bird flu managed to kill over 50 million people around the world in what is sometimes referred to as the Spanish flu pandemic. Perhaps even more frightening is the fact that only 25 mutations were required to convert the original viral strain — which could only infect birds — into a human-viable strain (10).<br />

The findings of the comprehensive report: 'The impact of climate change on the world's marine ecosystems' emerged from a synthesis of recent research on the world's oceans, carried out by two of the world's leading marine scientists. One of the authors of the report is Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, professor at The University of Queensland and the director of its Global Change Institute (GCI). 'We may see sudden, unexpected changes that have serious ramifications for the overall well-being of humans, including the capacity of the planet to support people. This is further evidence that we are well on the way to the next great extinction event,' says Hoegh-Guldberg. 'The findings have enormous implications for mankind, particularly if the trend continues. The earth's ocean, which produces half of the oxygen we breathe and absorbs 30 per cent of human-generated carbon dioxide, is equivalent to its heart and lungs. This study shows worrying signs of ill-health. It's as if the earth has been smoking two packs of cigarettes a day!,' he added. 'We are entering a period in which the ocean services upon which humanity depends are undergoing massive change and in some cases beginning to fail', he added. The 'fundamental and comprehensive' changes to marine life identified in the report include rapidly warming and acidifying oceans, changes in water circulation and expansion of dead zones within the ocean depths. These are driving major changes in marine ecosystems: less abundant coral reefs, sea grasses and mangroves (important fish nurseries); fewer, smaller fish; a breakdown in food chains; changes in the distribution of marine life; and more frequent diseases and pests among marine organisms. Study co-author John F Bruno, associate professor in marine science at The University of North Carolina, says greenhouse gas emissions are modifying many physical and geochemical aspects of the planet's oceans, in ways 'unprecedented in nearly a million years'. 'This is causing fundamental and comprehensive changes to the way marine ecosystems function,' Bruno warned, according to a GCI release. These findings were published in Science.<br />

<strong>And warming is real and anthropogenic – prefer scientific concensus over fringe theories</strong><br />
<strong>Alley, 10</strong> – Professor of Geoscience at Penn State, authored over 200 refereed scientific papers, which are &quot;highly cited&quot; according to a prominent indexing service, erved with distinguished national and international teams on major scientific assessment bodies [Richard, 11-17-2010, “Climate Change Science; Committee: House Science and Technology; Subcommittee: Energy and Environment,” CQ Congressional Testimony, Lexis]<br />
Background on Climate Change and Global Warming. Scientific assessments such as those of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States (e.g., National Research Council, 1975; 1979; 2001; 2006; 2008; 2010a; 2010b), the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have for decades consistently found with increasingly high scientific confidence that human activities are raising the concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, that this has a warming effect on the climate, that the climate is warming as expected, and that the changes so far are small compared to those projected if humans burn much of the fossil fuel on the planet. The basis for expecting and understanding warming from CO2 is the fundamental physics of how energy interacts with gases in the atmosphere. This knowledge has been available for over a century, was greatly refined by military research after World War II, and is directly confirmed by satellite measurements and other data (e.g., American Institute of Physics, 2008; Harries et al., 2001; Griggs and Harries, 2007). Although a great range of ideas can be found in scientific papers and in statements by individual scientists, the scientific assessments by bodies such as the National Academy of Sciences consider the full range of available information. The major results brought forward are based on multiple lines of evidence provided by different research groups with different funding sources, and have repeatedly been tested and confirmed. Removing the work of any scientist or small group of scientists would still leave a strong scientific basis for the main conclusions. Ice Changes. There exists increasingly strong evidence for widespread, ongoing reductions in the Earth's ice, including snow, river and lake ice, Arctic sea ice, permafrost and seasonally frozen ground, mountain glaciers, and the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. The trends from warming are modified by effects of changing precipitation and of natural variability, as I will discuss soon, so not all ice everywhere is always shrinking. Nonetheless, warming is important in the overall loss of ice, although changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation in response to natural or human causes also have contributed and will continue to contribute to changes. The most recent assessment by the IPCC remains relevant (Lemke et al., 2007). Also see the assessment of the long climatic history of the Arctic by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP, 2009), showing that in the past warming has led to shrinkage of Arctic ice including sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet, and that sufficiently large warming has removed them entirely.<br />

<strong>Warming is an existential threat</strong><br />
<strong>Mazo 10</strong> – PhD in Paleoclimatology from UCLA [Jeffrey Mazo, Managing Editor, Survival and Research Fellow for Environmental Security and Science Policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, 3-2010, “Climate Conflict: How global warming threatens security and what to do about it,” pg. 122]<br />
The best estimates for global warming to the end of the century range from 2.5-4.~C above pre-industrial levels, depending on the scenario. Even in the best-case scenario, the low end of the likely range is 1.goC, and in the worst 'business as usual' projections, which actual emissions have been matching, the range of likely warming runs from 3.1--7.1°C. Even keeping emissions at constant 2000 levels (which have already been exceeded), global temperature would still be expected to reach 1.2°C (O'9&quot;&quot;1.5°C)above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century.&quot; Without early and severe reductions in emissions, the effects of climate change in the second half of the twenty-first century are likely to be catastrophic for the stability and security of countries in the developing world - not to mention the associated human tragedy. Climate change could even undermine the strength and stability of emerging and advanced economies, beyond the knock-on effects on security of widespread state failure and collapse in developing countries.' And although they have been condemned as melodramatic and alarmist, many informed observers believe that unmitigated climate change beyond the end of the century could pose an existential threat to civilisation.&quot; What is certain is that there is no precedent in human experience for such rapid change or such climatic conditions, and even in the best case adaptation to these extremes would mean profound social, cultural and political changes.<br />

<strong>And cancelling the James Webb will undermine current and future cooperation with Europe – it makes the US seem like a bad partner.</strong><br />

JWST is being developed in international partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency. Unilaterally canceling this program, especially so close to completion, will significantly undermine our relationships with key allies on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency have been collaborating with NASA on the design and construction of JWST since 1996 and officially became partners in 2003. Europe is providing one of the four major scientific instruments for the telescope and a portion of a second instrument. It is also providing the launch on an Ariane 5 launch vehicle and will provide manpower to support JWST operations. In return, ESA is counting on access to the observatory for its astronomers, including at least 15 percent of the total observing time, similar to the current arrangement with Hubble. 13 Canada is also designing and building one of the four scientific instrument packages. Canadian astronomers are expecting at least 5 percent of the telescope’s observation time for astronomical research. 14 Both partners have already invested time and money in developing their portion of the instruments. As we attempt to increase our knowledge about the universe, we require increasingly complex systems. To build and operate these systems, international partnerships are becoming more and more important. Unilaterally canceling JWST would send a disheartening message to existing and potential partners and allies, and damage to U.S. credibility would likely make future joint endeavors much more problematic.<br />

<strong>And science cooperation is the underpinning of all EU-US cooperation</strong><br />
<strong>Potočnik, 6</strong> – European Commissioner for Science and Research [March 7, 2006, Janez Potočnik, “Between cooperation and Competition - Science and Research as a Transatlantic Bridge Builder,” The American European Community Association Round-table<br />
Luncheon in Brussels]<br />
The EU and the United States have a unique relationship as international partners. We share common values and interests and between us we account for the largest bilateral trade relationship in the world. We also stand together to confront global challenges, be it threats to our peace and security or concerns over our climate, our health or our energy supply. The list can be made long. What better subject than science and research to demonstrate how closely interdependent the world’s two economic giants are! And to illustrate how our common challenges stimulate not only cooperation, but also competition, which in turn triggers innovation and results. The first question is why the US and the EU cooperate on science &amp; research at all? Well, cooperation on science &amp; research between our two continents goes back a long time, and has its natural, self-evolving reasons. We simply have had no other choice than to work together to tackle universal concerns without boundaries. Look at avian flu, bio-terrorism or energy security, to take a few examples. We need to pool resources for expensive, long-term endeavours. Look at ITER, for example. This is a gigantic project bringing together seven parties to develop a future sustainable energy source by developing fusion energy. ITER is a prominent example of how common challenges are of such a scale that we have no other choice than to go together. Separately, these types of massive initiatives are simply not possible, or, at least, make no sense at all. Cooperation shortens the path leading from science to innovation and from knowledge to solutions in areas such as nanotech, biotech, environment, climate and cybersecurity. In all these areas, and in many more, we share information, knowledge, practices and results. In nanotechnology, for example, the Commission works together with the National Science Foundation to exchange information and organise seminars and workshops. Coordinated calls for joint EU-US research proposals have been launched since 1999, to draw on the best expertise on both side of the Atlantic. We work together because we realise that it is in the interest of both Europe and the US to do so. And often, of course, it is also in the interest of many other countries around the globe, whether they are directly involved in the cooperation, or not. But – of course – we also cooperate simply because that is what scientists do. Naturally, spontaneously and, often, effectively. Scientists are, by the mere nature of their work, mobile and outward looking. Research does not know of any national frontiers and scientists simply work where and with those that offer the best opportunities. But perhaps even more important for our transatlantic links is the dynamism and creativity that competition brings. Competition is part of our natural disposition as social individuals, and also an imperative of the societies we live in. Whether it’s the market share of our companies that we have at heart, or the wellbeing of our people, or the next breakthrough in science and technology, or - indeed, all of the above - competition is the name of the game. We compete because we know that today’s discoveries will most probably underpin tomorrow’s economic achievements. And we compete because – in the US as much as in Europe – we draw healthy stimuli and encouragement from comparing our respective figures. Numbers of science and engineering graduates, researchers as percentage of the workforce, figures for R&amp;D investment, numbers of publications and patents and so on… This mix of cooperation and competition is a key engine of progress. That’s how we discover and advance. How we set and reach objectives, improve performances and achieve results. By finding the right mix or the right balance between cooperation and competition. Be it between individuals, organisations, economies or societies. And isn’t this also what scientists spontaneously do? They compete for excellence, for recognition, for results and for funds. They strive to be the first to publish or to patent. But they also learn from one another. They compare and exchange and they join forces aiming for common achievements. The same is true for companies and other organisations, for which a balanced mix of cooperation and competition is often the key to performance and achievement. And this is also what we do with our Research Framework Programme. We stimulate the best teams to compete for limited financial resources, and at the same time we encourage cooperation so as to gain from complementary expertise, crossfertilisation, pooling of human and material resources. This way we promote excellence, we encourage specialisation and we produce better results. And now we are working to implement a Research Framework Programme that is open to the whole world, for our mutual benefit. Quite naturally and logically the cooperation with countries that are not part of the European Union is vital for a better integration of Europe as a whole. We plan to offer grants to attract the best scientists to European laboratories where a mutual exchange of experience and information can benefit both the host country and the country of origin. And we expect to see Member States harmonising their regulations for visiting researchers and making it easier for them to get the necessary visas. For this to work we must endeavour to make sure that the opportunities for participation are better known on both sides of the Atlantic and identify the most appropriate and user-friendly mechanisms to enable our researchers to work together. The specific weight of Science and Research within the Transatlantic Agenda has been growing steadily and has acquired greater visibility lately, notably with the latest EU-US summit in December last year. Basic research, nano, space, information technology, innovation and other areas now figure prominently on that agenda. This is certainly the fruit of a converging political determination on both sides of the Atlantic. But it is also the consequence of the fact that both sides increasingly perceive science and research as a critical component of the respective policies for economic competitiveness, growth and jobs. The new American Competitiveness Initiative announced by President Bush in his recent State-of-the-Union address – and substantiated in the budget proposal that the US government just put forward – clearly points in this direction. And it is interesting to read how, in its goals as well as in some of its ingredients, it clearly echoes our own Lisbon objectives and measures! Science and research are perceived both here and in the US as more “useful” than before. And indeed, research is taken more seriously politically than ever before. Think about the scientific dimension of issues like environmental protection or climate change, that have seen Europe and the US on opposite sides in economic progress and consumer protection. Think about access to space and the development of global positioning systems. These are cases where science and politics go hand in hand. But they are also examples of the fact that sometimes when the politics brings us apart, then science can help us find the necessary common ground. We have seen this clearly happen during the last few years. Now the relations between Europe and the US are again marked by positive cooperative tones and promising perspectives. But we have gone through a period, up to recently, during which the list of differences looked longer than the list of agreements. From steel to agricultural subsidies, from GMOs to Kyoto, from the International Criminal Court to the war in Iraq, some people on both sides almost lost sight of the solidity and durability of the transatlantic partnership. But, interestingly, even during those more difficult times, science and research have always stood out as areas where cooperation could continue to grow, unaffected by political tensions elsewhere. Or better: science and research benefited from a sort of &quot;compensatory&quot; status. They came to be perceived as fields where - precisely while we were &quot;quarreling&quot; on several other matters - we could still prove to ourselves, to one another and to the world, that we remained each other's best partners and allies. Now that we have moved on to a smoother phase in our transatlantic dialogue, science and research must continue to exert their bridging function. The commitments made by our top political leaders in June last year must be taken seriously and delivered upon. I intend to start from there, build on past achievements, to make further substantial progress in transatlantic cooperation in S&amp;T. There are areas like nano and biotech, where we already have a strong basis of cooperation, and we can improve further; and there are areas like health and researchers' mobility where there is great potential for cooperation that waits to be developed. I intend use the opportunity of a visit to the United States before the summer - my first visit there in my present capacity - to make progress in this direction.<br />

The report's starting point -- that U.S.-European relations are extremely important -- is undeniable. A united Western alliance would shape world institutions in line with values and practices rooted in liberty and democracy and coax rising powers such as India and China into going along with this international status quo for the foreseeable future. Indeed, this is already happening as China accepts liberal economic rules at home in order to enter institutions such as the G7 and the World Trade Organization. By contrast, a disunited West would tempt such powers to play off Europe and America against each other and foster a global jockeying for power not unlike the maneuvering between a half-dozen great powers that led to 1914.<br />

According to probability theory, adding additional detail onto a story must render the story less probable. It is less probable that Linda is a feminist bank teller than that she is a bank teller, since all feminist bank tellers are necessarily bank tellers. Yet human psychology seems to follow the rule that adding an additional detail can make the story more plausible. People might pay more for international diplomacy intended to prevent nanotechnological warfare by China, than for an engineering project to defend against nanotechnological attack from any source. The second threat scenario is less vivid and alarming, but the defense is more useful because it is more vague. More valuable still would be strategies which make humanity harder to extinguish without being specific to nanotechnologic threats - such as colonizing space, or see Yudkowsky (this volume) on AI. Security expert Bruce Schneier observed (both before and after the 2005 hurricane in New Orleans) that the U.S. government was guarding specific domestic targets against &quot;movie-plot scenarios&quot; of terrorism, at the cost of taking away resources from emergency-response capabilities that could respond to any disaster. (Schneier 2005.) Overly detailed reassurances can also create false perceptions of safety: &quot;X is not an existential risk and you don't need to worry about it, because A, B, C, D, and E&quot;; where the failure of any one of propositions A, B, C, D, or E potentially extinguishes the human species. &quot;We don't need to worry about nanotechnologic war, because a UN commission will initially develop the technology and prevent its proliferation until such time as an active shield is developed, capable of defending against all accidental and malicious outbreaks that contemporary nanotechnology is capable of producing, and this condition will persist indefinitely.&quot; Vivid, specific scenarios can inflate our probability estimates of security, as well as misdirecting defensive investments into needlessly narrow or implausibly detailed risk scenarios.<br />

Imagine for a moment that the globe is inhabited by a single individual who roams free across outback plains, through rainforests, across pure white beaches — living off the resources available. Picture the immensity of the world surrounding this one person and ask yourself, what possible impact could this single person have on the planet? Now turn your attention to today’s reality. Almost 7 billion people inhabit the planet and this number increases at an average of a little over one per cent per year. That’s about 2 more mouths to feed every second. Do these 7 billion people have an impact on the planet? Yes. An irreversible impact? Probably. Taken together this huge number of people has managed to change the face of the Earth and threaten the very systems that support them. We are now embarked on a trajectory that, if unchecked, will certainly have detrimental impacts on our way of life and to natural ecosystems. Some of these are irreversible, including the extinction of many species. But returning to that single individual, surely two things are true. A single person could not have caused all of this, nor can a single person solve all the associated problems. The message here is that the human-induced global problems that confront us cannot be solved by any one individual, group, agency or nation. It will take a large collective effort to change the course that we are on; nothing less will suffice. Our planet is facing several mammoth challenges: to its atmosphere, to its resources, to its inhabitants. Wicked problems such as climate change, over-population, disease, and food, water and energy security require concerted efforts and worldwide collaboration to find and implement effective, ethical and sustainable solutions. These are no longer solely scientific and technical matters. Solutions must be viable in the larger context of the global economy, global unrest and global inequality. Common understandings and commitment to action are required between individuals, within communities and across international networks. Science can play a special role in international relations. Its participants share a common language that transcends mother tongue and borders. For centuries scientists have corresponded and collaborated on international scales in order to arrive at a better and common understanding of the natural and human world. Values integral to science such as transparency, vigorous inquiry and informed debate also support effective international relation practices. Furthermore, given the long-established global trade of scientific information and results, many important international links are already in place at a scientific level. These links can lead to coalition-building, trust and cooperation on sensitive scientific issues which, when supported at a political level, can provide a ‘soft politics’ route to other policy dialogues. That is, if nations are already working together on global science issues, they may be more likely to be open to collaboration on other global issues such as trade and security. Many countries have recognised the value of science diplomacy. In March this year, the US passed a bill to fund a Global Science Program for Security, Competitiveness and Diplomacy. Earlier, President Obama used his speech in Cairo to announce an expanded team of science envoys in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. In April, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband made the case for research as a political bridge. In Australia, there are two science envoy posts, one in Brussels and the other in Washington DC. In my own role as Chief Scientist, I engage with researchers and agency heads of other nations to improve Australia’s scientific relations. For example, my recent trip to the United States included a visit with Professor Daniel Kammen, Clean Energy Envoy of the US State Department, and previous trips have established a connection with Chief Scientists and Scientific Academy Presidents in Britain, China, India, New Zealand, and the United States. Central to these diplomatic efforts, is the establishment and continued nurturing of collaboration. Scientific collaboration operates best as a network of individual researchers supported by corporate and government policy and investment. The keys then are forging links at the ground level and providing clear and consistent bi-national and multi-national policy and funding frameworks to sustain these links.<br />

<strong>And science diplomacy prevents all their impacts from escalating</strong><br />
<strong>The Royal Society, 10</strong> – a Fellowship of more than 1400 outstanding individuals from all areas of science, mathematics, engineering and medicine, who form a global scientific network of the highest calibre. The Fellowship is supported by over 130 permanent staff with responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Society and its activities. [January, 2010, “New frontiers in science diplomacy”]<br />
Cooperation on the scientific aspects of sensitive issues may sometimes be the only way to initiate a wider political dialogue. The soft power of science, and the universality of scientific methods, can be used to diffuse tensions even in ‘hard power’ scenarios, such as those relating to traditional military threats. For example, technologies to verify nuclear arms control agreements were a rare focus of joint working between the US and USSR during the Cold War. Lessons from the Cold War are once again highly pertinent. In the run-up to the May 2010 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), nuclear disarmament is firmly back on the international agenda. However, the timescale for disarmament is long, as illustrated by the history of negotiations over the Chemical Weapons Convention. After the Geneva Convention banned the use of chemical weapons in 1925, negotiations for a treaty banning their production and stockpiling did not start until the 1980s, and the convention entered into force only in 1997. Even now, stockpiles of chemical weapons in the US and Russia have yet to be destroyed. So focusing in 2010 on the challenges of the final stages of a nuclear disarmament process may be premature. A more practical next step could be to establish the scientific requirements for the verification regime necessary to support future stages of negotiation (Pregenzer 2008). In 2008, the Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs suggested that a high-level Intergovernmental Panel on Nuclear Disarmament could be established (based on the model of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). This panel could begin by identifying the scientific and technical aspects of disarmament, and then set out a research agenda necessary to achieve them. International cooperation would be essential, both between nuclear and non-nuclear weapon states, as all would need to have confidence that reductions are taking place. The recent initiative between the UK and Norwegian governments on disarmament verifi cation sets a precedent here, and could be expanded to include additional States (VERTIC 2009). However, security threats now extend beyond the military domain, with environmental security attracting particular attention (Abbott C, Rogers P &amp; Sloboda S 2007). Essential resources, such as freshwater, cultivable land, crop yields and fish stocks, are likely to become scarcer in many parts of the world, increasing the risk of competition over resources within and between states (UNEP 2009). This could intensify as previously inaccessible regions, such as the Arctic Ocean, open up as a consequence of climate change and ice melt. Substantial parts of the world also risk being left uninhabitable by rising sea levels, reduced freshwater availability or declining agricultural capacity. Many of the regions that are vulnerable to the impacts of these multiple stresses are already the locus of existing instability and conflict (see Figure 2). 5 Conclusions The main conclusions to emerge from the discussions at the Royal Society/AAAS meeting were as follows: 5.1 The three dimensions of science diplomacy The concept of science diplomacy is gaining increasing currency in the US, UK, Japan and elsewhere. It is still a fl uid concept, but can usefully be applied to the role of science, technology and innovation in three related areas: • informing foreign policy objectives with scientifi c advice (science in diplomacy); • facilitating international science cooperation (diplomacy for science); • using science cooperation to improve international relations between countries (science for diplomacy). 5.2 Science and universal values Scientific values of rationality, transparency and universality are the same the world over. They can help to underpin good governance and build trust between nations. Science provides a non-ideological environment for the participation and free exchange of ideas between people, regardless of cultural, national or religious backgrounds. 5.3 The soft power of science Science is a source of what Joseph Nye terms ‘soft power’ (Nye 2004). The scientific community often works beyond national boundaries on problems of common interest, so is well placed to support emerging forms of diplomacy that require non-traditional alliances of nations, sectors and non-governmental organisations. If aligned with wider foreign policy goals, these channels of scientific exchange can contribute to coalition building and conflict resolution. Cooperation on the scientific aspects of sensitive issues—such as nuclear nonproliferation—can sometimes provide an effective route to other forms of political dialogue. Similarly the potential of science as an arena for building trust and understanding between countries is gaining traction, particularly in the Middle East and wider Islamic world (see Case study 1). 5.4 Motivations for science diplomacy Science diplomacy seeks to strengthen the symbiosis between the interests and motivations of the scientific and foreign policy communities. For the former, international cooperation is often driven by a desire to access the best people, research facilities or new sources of funding. For the latter, science offers useful networks and channels of communication that can be used to support wider policy goals. Foreign ministries should place greater emphasis on science within their strategies, and draw more extensively on scientific advice in the formation and delivery of policy objectives. In the UK, the appointment of Professor David Clary FRS as the Chief Scientific Adviser at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office creates an important opportunity to integrate science across FCO priorities, and develop stronger linkages with science-related policies in other government departments. Mechanisms to help achieve this could include: • ensuring messages about the value of science are promulgated throughout foreign ministries and embassies, including to all Heads of Mission; • incorporating science policy training into induction courses and training for foreign ministry staff, and specialist diplomatic training for dedicated science officers; • involving more scientists in foreign ministries to advise at senior and strategic levels; • encouraging the recruitment of science graduates as part of the general intake to the foreign service; • encouraging secondments and pairing between diplomats and scientists; • encouraging independent scientific bodies to provide science policy briefi ngs for foreign ministry and embassy staff.<br />

<strong>Mountain 11</strong> —Ph.D in astronomy, Director of the Space Telescope Science Institute [Winter 2011, Matt Mountain, “The James Webb Space Telescope—It’s Complicated, but so Is Leadership,” vol 28, issue 1, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2758:https://blogs.stsci.edu/newsletter/files/2011/03/STScIWINTER2011NL.pdf#page=49 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://blogs.stsci.edu/newsletter/files/2011/03/STScIWINTER2011NL.pdf#page=49" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.stsci.edu/newsletter/files/2011/03/STScIWINTER2011NL.pdf#page=49</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2758 -->]<br />
The recent release of NASA’s Independent Comprehensive Review Panel report (the Casani report) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has understandably caused consternation within the community, and some of our colleagues’ sound-bite quotes decrying the state of space astrophysics were quickly circulated in the press and on the Internet. As the dust has settled, it’s important to step back for a moment to reflect on why we want to build such an audacious telescope. The words of the President of the AAS, Debra Elmegreen, in a recent article in Space News bear repeating, “We all need to recognize that JWST and the initial $5 billion investment cannot be allowed to fail, since so much of future astrophysics research was built upon the foundation it was to provide—as the Casani report concludes, ‘JWST will play a key role in understanding how and when the first galaxies were born, characterizing the planets that are now being discovered around nearby stars, in providing further insights into the nature of the dark energy and dark matter, and into how stars and planetary systems are born. There is no easy path to understanding such complex scientific questions. To do these things at the level needed to advance scientific understanding requires a complex telescope with truly unique capabilities. JWST is that telescope.” (Space News, “American Leadership in Astrophysics at Risk,” 22 November 2010.) I came to the Space Telescope Science Institute because of JWST. Even though I helped to build two large ground-based telescopes, I recognized that there are astronomical observations we struggle to do from the ground. For example, even with 8-m or 10-m telescopes it is next to impossible to take the spectra of highredshift galaxies to understand the star-formation processes a billion years after the Big Bang. The same is true when trying to measure distant (z &gt; 1) supernovae to try and unravel Dark Energy—it’s a really tough measurement from the ground. As is mapping dust emission to uncover telltale trails of young planetary systems; this is proving to be difficult even in the closest systems. My colleagues who built the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes similarly realized that to take the next steps in exploring the Universe would require a bigger space telescope. There is no mystery why: observational astrophysics is a photon-limited field, and once you have near perfect detectors (as we do), our only free parameters are either to spend millions of seconds on every observation or to increase the aperture of the telescope. A large-aperture space telescope combined with the low backgrounds found at L2 was the basic design rationale for JWST, and the broad science this telescope enables was compelling enough to make it the highest-priority large space mission of the 2000 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics. A decade later, even as our scientific expectations have evolved since the original science case was written—as the Casani report itself notes—JWST remains the most scientifically powerful telescope NASA, ESA and CSA will ever have built: “the next Great Observatory to replace the Hubble Space Telescope.” A decade ago, we were just coming to terms with the possibility of Dark Energy. With JWST, we will reach back to the beginning of time to detect very early supernovae and break the possible degeneracy between supernova evolution and Dark Energy. A decade ago, we had not yet begun to measure the constituents of exoplanetary atmospheres with transit spectroscopy using Hubble and Spitzer. With JWST, we will use the same technique; as the recent 2010 Decadal Survey (New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics; NWNH) recognized, JWST will be “a premier tool for studying planets orbiting stars that are smaller and cooler than the Sun.” The goal of detecting liquid water on a planet close to the size of Earth, in the habitable zone around another star, may be within the reach of JWST. As NWNH notes, with JWST “the era of study of … cousins of the Earth … is underway.” And this does not include the great unknown territory that will be uncovered when we fly a telescope 100 times more sensitive than Hubble, almost 1000 times more sensitive than Spitzer. Imagine the creative energy unleashed by the roughly 8,000 astronomers who currently use Hubble and Spitzer. According to a White Paper submitted to NWNH (Sembach et al. 2009), over the period 2005–2007, the Spitzer and Hubble programs alone generated over $130M in General Observer grants, and this community published over 3,000 papers based on Hubble and Spitzer data. JWST is the next Hubble, the next Spitzer—that’s why we are building this ambitious telescope. It is true JWST has confronted us with some seriously tough technological challenges: how to build a telescope 65% the size of the W. M. Keck telescope, but reduce its mass by almost two orders of magnitude compared to a ground-based telescope; how to find a way to package it so it could be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket and deployed a million miles from Earth; and how to operate it at 40K. It’s been very hard to manufacture 18 beryllium mirrors that can hold their figures to better than 20 nanometers at cryogenic temperatures, or build a deployable gossamer-like sunshield the size of a tennis court. But we have. The Casani report recognized these technological achievements: “a substantial amount of cutting-edge hardware has been delivered and is now being tested as part of the first steps toward the overall integration and test of the Observatory.” We are not looking at a trail of technological failures or wasted resources. In fact, what we see is a series of “solved problems” on the complex and difficult journey to build the most powerful space telescope launched by any space-faring nation. A few weeks ago, The New York Times ran an obituary of Joseph Gavin, who designed and built the lunar lander. It drew me back to an earlier era, where doing difficult things in space defined a nation and a generation. The Times quoted Gavin as saying, “If a project is truly innovative, you cannot possibly know its exact cost and exact schedule at the beginning…and if you do know the exact cost and the exact schedule, chances are that the technology is obsolete.” The Casani report echoed these words: “from 2002 to 2008, JWST struggled with several cutting-edge developments. These developments took longer and consequently cost more than forecast.” Let us remind ourselves it was very hard to build the Hubble Space Telescope. But we did. Today Hubble supports thousands of astronomers worldwide, and continues to inspire the public and a new generation of school children with its images of breathtaking beauty. Now we are again struggling with the consequences of doing something no one has done before. Those of us who have built machines like large telescopes have experienced the myriad ways that unpredictable problems emerge from new technologies, challenging engineering, and the complicated logistics of putting complex things together. The JWST project needs to do better, and the Casani report articulates what needs to be changed. NASA and the Project Team have committed to learning these lessons and regaining the trust of both those who have advocated for JWST and the tax-payers who have funded JWST. But I don’t see an astronomers’ hurricane, leaving devastation in its wake. I see committed engineers and scientists struggling to work at the edge of the impossible. I see a community willing to take risks on behalf of science, so we can extend the scientific frontiers and do things no one has done before. I see that building a state-of-the-art machine for science is in the end an inherently complex and tremendously imperfect human endeavor. The cover letter to the Casani report on why JWST should go forward finished on a famous quote from the dawn of the Space Age, “…we do these things and others, not because they easy, but because they are hard.” To finish President John F. Kennedy’s quote: “…because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills; because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone.” In the end, someone has to provide “the next Hubble” to the next generation. If not us, then who?<br />

<strong>Specifically cancelling the Webb will prevent future astronomical discoveries</strong><br />
<strong>European Astronomical Society, 7/25/11</strong> [July 25, 2011, European Astronomical Society, “Statement on the uncertainty surrounding JWST funding prepared by the EAS,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2759:http://eas.unige.ch/news_display.jsp?news_id=20110725 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://eas.unige.ch/news_display.jsp?news_id=20110725" rel="nofollow">http://eas.unige.ch/news_display.jsp?news_id=20110725</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2759 -->]<br />
European astronomers follow with great concern the evolution of the situation of the JWST project, as they are convinced that its cancellation would cause severe damage to the advancement of astronomy worldwide. JWST promises to be one of the world leading instruments for the coming decade in astronomy. Following on the achievements of the Hubble Space Telescope, it will focus on the many questions related to the origins of planets, stars and galaxies. It is expected to be unsurpassed in scope and capabilities. In addition, many major developments in world astronomy, like the ALMA array and the giant telescope E-ELT, are being designed and developed taking into account the expected capabilities of JWST. Together these instruments will bring mankind to the next step in the understanding of the Cosmos. JWST is an essential part of this development. The loss of JWST would therefore damage astronomy in a major way in the USA, in Europe and in the world. Many European astronomers and their funding agencies, together with colleagues in the USA and in Canada, have invested considerable resources and efforts in this project, in particular for the development of the MIRI and NIRSpec instruments. European astronomers within the instrument teams, and also very many others with no project involvement, have planned research programs for the coming years building on JWST capabilities, trusting that it will be launched as planned.<br />

<strong>And astronomical discoveries can spur national interest in STEM</strong><br />

The excitement of scientific discovery is a powerful force among our Nation’s youth, and leads directly to an improved standard of living in our Nation by attracting talented young people to pursue STEM careers. Astronomy has a role to play in this regard, not just in uncovering the mysteries of the Universe, but by drawing young people to the worlds of science, technology and engineering. Nearly everyone I have met involved in the pursuit of science, from student to professor, is amazed by discoveries about the Universe revealed by NSF-supported telescopes like the VLA and NASA missions like the Hubble Space Telescope and the Kepler mission. The “Rising Above the Gathering Storm” report warns that our younger generation is less educated than its parents, and that the nation is not adequately training the next generation of engineers and scientists; this failure directly impacts our economy. The public science literacy rate is less than 30%, and the US must improve to remain competitive. Astronomy offers one way to help because it is a mind-opening field that engages the public and schoolchildren in science; 60 million people go to museums and planetariums every year, 15% of all future K-12 teachers take astronomy as their only college science course, and 250,000 college students are enrolled in astronomy courses annually.<br />

<strong>That’s key to the economy</strong><br />
<strong>The Hill 11</strong> [Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), “U.S. Economic Future Needs STEM Education”, April 1th, 2011, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2761:http://opportunityequation.org/news-press/us-economic-future-needs-stem --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://opportunityequation.org/news-press/us-economic-future-needs-stem" rel="nofollow">http://opportunityequation.org/news-press/us-economic-future-needs-stem</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2761 -->]<br />
The United States has begun to lose its status as a scientific and technological leader, and the only way we can hope to compete in the 21st century global economy is if we invest in research and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education. It is vital that we not lose sight of that, even in these tough budget times. As we work to pass an FY 2011 appropriations bill and a budget resolution for FY 2012, I urge my colleagues to remember that our long term economic growth and competitiveness are dependent upon the investments in research and education that we make today. Many high-tech companies cite the availability of a skilled STEM workforce as the number one reason for determining where they locate their facilities. More and more U.S. companies are moving abroad because they can’t find the highly skilled workforce they need here at home. According to 2008 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the professional IT workforce was projected to add a little under a million new jobs between 2008 and 2018. This represents more than twice the rate of the overall workforce growth between 2008 and 2018. If we want those jobs to stay in the U.S., and in Texas, we must continue to invest in STEM education for our future workforce. Our best STEM students have no trouble competing with their international peers, but we cannot rely on just the top five percent. On average, our K-12 students continue to lag far behind their international peers in math and science aptitude. Earlier this year, the National Assessment Governing Board released the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) science scores. The assessment found that less than half of our nation’s students are demonstrating solid academic performance and proficiency in science. Equally troubling are the significant achievement gaps at every level between White and minority students. The NAEP revealed that, on a zero to 300 scale, Black fourth-graders and eighth-graders scored an average of 36 points lower than their White counterparts and Black 12th-graders scored an average of 34 points lower than their White counterparts.<br />

<strong>Independently—funding the Webb is key to spur economic growth</strong><br />
<strong>Lieberman 8/5/11</strong> – Director of SPIE, SPIE is the largest international not-for-profit society in optics, photonics and imaging [August 5, 2011, R. A. Lieberman, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2762:http://www.aura-astronomy.org/news/2011/JWST%20Statement%20-%20August%202011.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aura-astronomy.org/news/2011/JWST%20Statement%20-%20August%202011.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.aura-astronomy.org/news/2011/JWST%20Statement%20-%20August%202011.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2762 -->]<br />
5 August 2011 – SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics, strongly objects to the decision of the U.S. House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Space to terminate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This proposal wastes billions of taxpayer dollars already invested in the project, undermines American leadership and innovation in space technology, and will eliminate much-needed jobs and economic growth at a time of critical importance for our country. We understand that the proposed cuts to JWST come as part of a larger effort by Congress to rein in federal spending. Unfortunately, NASA and other federal science agencies and programs have been unduly targeted in these cuts. While SPIE fully supports improved and informed oversight of all federal spending on science and technology and recognizes the importance of beginning to reduce the deficit, we need be smart about the reductions. Federal support for science will spur economic growth and help restore a firm fiscal foundation for our nation. JWST is symbolic of our nation’s science and technology future and provides an opportunity for Congress to demonstrate its commitment to supporting this key job-creating field. More than 50 years of experience shows that a strong federal commitment to scientific research is crucial to building a better America. NASA’s 2012 budget proposal asked Congress for $375 million for JWST for the coming year — hundreds of millions less than what the Independent Comprehensive Review Panel estimated the program would need to keep the launch from extending beyond 2015. More than 75% of the telescope’s hardware has already been delivered. It takes decades for space telescope missions to be fulfilled, and due to their duration and complexity, it is imperative that NASA be provided with a stable, long-term budget to avoid inefficiencies and achieve its missions. Now is not the time to abandon a project in which U.S. taxpayers have already invested so much. Just as Hubble has added enormously to our understanding of the universe over the last 20 years, once launched JWST will contribute unanticipated new discoveries and capture the imagination of an entirely new generation of Americans. In this era of boundless discovery and exploration, it is even more critical to ensure a robust national commitment to both manned and scientific space programs and to maintain America's leadership in space science.<br />

<strong>Economic decline causes war—multiple reasons</strong><br />
<strong>Royal 10</strong> — Jedidiah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, M.Phil. Candidate at the University of New South Wales, 2010 (“Economic Integration, Economic Signalling and the Problem of Economic Crises,” Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, Edited by Ben Goldsmith and Jurgen Brauer, Published by Emerald Group Publishing, ISBN 0857240048, p. 213-215)<br />
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict. Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent states. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski and Thompson's (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next. As such, exogenous shocks such as economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power (see also Gilpin. 1981) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, increasing the risk of miscalculation (Feaver, 1995). Alternatively, even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately, Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland's (1996, 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that 'future expectation of trade' is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour of states. He argues that interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations. However, if the expectations of future trade decline, particularly for difficult [end page 213] to replace items such as energy resources, the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. Crises could potentially be the trigger for decreased trade expectations either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 Third, others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level. Blomberg and Hess (2002) find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn. They write, The linkages between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover, the presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other. (Blomberg &amp; Hess, 2002. p. 89) Economic decline has also been linked with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism (Blomberg, Hess, &amp; Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. “Diversionary theory&quot; suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a 'rally around the flag' effect. Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995). and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force are at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999), and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that the tendency towards diversionary tactics are greater for democratic states than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that periods of weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force. In summary, recent economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels.5 This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention. This observation is not contradictory to other perspectives that link economic interdependence with a decrease in the likelihood of external conflict, such as those mentioned in the first paragraph of this chapter. [end page 214] Those studies tend to focus on dyadic interdependence instead of global interdependence and do not specifically consider the occurrence of and conditions created by economic crises. As such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.<br />

<strong>We must act now – the James Webb is on the chopping block</strong><br />
<strong>Amos, 11</strong> – BBC science correspondent, Kennedy Space Center [July 7, 2011, Jonathan Amos, “JWST backed by Nasa amid call to scrap telescope mission,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2763:http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14073222 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14073222" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14073222</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2763 -->]<br />
The James Webb Space Telescope remains central to Nasa's mission, deputy administrator Lori Garver says. The agency chief was responding to moves in the House of Representatives to cull the troubled observatory, which is now $2bn over budget. A House appropriations panel has put forward a bill that would clip Nasa's 2012 budget and end JWST funding. But Garver told BBC News: &quot;James Webb is obviously part of our future that we believe very strongly in.&quot; She said the White House administration and the Nasa management would be working with the House and the Senate to produce a budget that would enable the agency to fulfil its science and exploration objectives. &quot;The process is not over,&quot; she added. Ms Garver was speaking here at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida where Nasa is preparing to launch its last ever shuttle mission. The JWST is supposed to be the next great undertaking in space astronomy. The telescope would have the biggest mirror ever sent into orbit and incorporate detectors capable of seeing the very first galaxies to form in the Universe. But getting it ready for flight has proved to be a major technological challenge. Uncertain timescale One recent assessment suggested JWST's total cost had ballooned from $3.5bn to $5bn, and that continued delays could inflate the final bill well beyond $6bn. In parallel with the price escalation, the probable launch date has slipped deeper and deeper into the decade with some commentators wondering whether JWST might not even be ready to fly this side of 2020. It is against this background that the House Appropriations Committee has drawn up it Fiscal Year 2012 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill. It calls for a $16.8bn budget for Nasa, which is $1.6bn below last year's level and $1.9bn below what US President Barack Obama would like the agency to receive. The panel would terminate funding for JWST if it had its way. But there is a long way to go in this story. The Senate will have its view, and then Congress as a whole will have to come to a determination. Nasa itself is conducting its own internal review of the JWST project. Ms Garver said she was hopeful that everyone could come to an agreement on the telescope's future. &quot;We absolutely do believe that we are working towards a budget that will deliver a James Webb telescope this decade. We are just now completing the bottoms up review of the cost to be able to get a funding profile to do just that.&quot; JWST is not a US-only project; it has significant input from the Europeans and the Canadians. Europe's contribution includes the launcher, an Ariane 5, to get the telescope into orbit, and the provision of two of the observatory's four instruments - MIRI and NIRSPEC. European Space Agency Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain was asked at the recent Paris Air Show about delays to the overall programme. He said Europe would continue working to its timeline and would not be distracted by the arguments over James Webb taking place in the US. &quot;We will be ready for a launch in 2016/17,&quot; he told BBC News. &quot;If the launch has to be later because Nasa doesn't have the financial wherewithal or the technical ability to go ahead in 2016/17 then we can put our instrumentation in storage pending a launch date. But I stress, we are not going to delay the delivery of our contribution because that would actually cost more, so we are going to finish our work as quickly as possible. &quot;Esa is not the bottleneck when it comes to the launch date,&quot; he added.<br />

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will launch in 2018 only if NASA receives more funding for the program than the flat budget assumed in the President's FY2012 budget request according to an agency official. JWST is usually described as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, although it will study the universe in a different part of the spectrum (infrared instead of visible) and from a very different location (the L2 Lagrange point instead of Earth orbit). NASA's Rick Howard told the NASA Advisory Council's Science Committee on April 21 that the agency is still looking at how best to &quot;rebaseline&quot; the program to move forward. That effort will be completed in the coming weeks. Howard was designated as JWST Program Director last fall after an independent review faulted the program's &quot;budgeting and program management, not technical performance&quot; as the cause of substantial cost increases. That report said the earliest launch date was 2015 if certain financial resources -- $500 million for each of FY2011 and FY2012 -- were made available. Howard is doing a more detailed assessment and looking more closely at what funds are likely to be provided. Howard stressed that he is still gathering data to feed into the agency's Joint Confidence Level (JCL) independent cost estimating process before any decisions are made. The last three years of the program preparing for launch are &quot;incompressible,&quot; he said. If a launch date prior to 2018 is desired, the schedule could be moved forward only if more money is provided in the immediate future (FY2012 or FY2013). Absent such increases the agency is looking at 2018 as the earliest launch date, which is five years later than the original plan. Achieving the 2018 date also requires more funds in the longer term than what is in NASA's FY2012 projection. That &quot;runout&quot; shows the program flat funded at $375 million per year for the next five years. Howard said if that really turned out to be the budget for the program, launch would be pushed out into the 2020s. Howard said funding adjustments would have to be discussed within the agency and with the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Several committee members emphasized that programs like JWST cannot be accomplished with flat budgets and said they hoped OMB and OSTP realize that. NASA plans to spend $471 million on JWST in this fiscal year (FY2011) and Howard insisted the amount for FY2011 would not be lower than that. As an agency, NASA received $561 million less than the $19 billion it requested for FY2011. The agency is developing an operating plan to show how to plans to spend the approximately $18.5 billion that Congress provided. Howard clearly believes that JWST will not be a place where cuts are made to accommodate the lower appropriation. Meanwhile, JWST hardware is being delivered to NASA. One issue is how to store everything for this unexpectedly lengthy period of time and deal with obsolescence and workforce issues. Howard asked rhetorically how many of the people working on the program would want to stay with it now that the launch date is so many years later than planned. Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), chair of the Senate Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee that funds NASA, is a long time cheerleader for NASA and its space and earth science programs, many of which are managed at Goddard Space Flight Center in her State. She has been an ardent advocate for JWST, but her displeasure at the new cost overruns that emerged last year was made clear when she demanded the independent review that led to the current replanning effort (the &quot;Casani report,&quot; after its chair, John Casani).<br />
<br />
<strong>And postponing the funding will only escalate costs and erode the launch schedule</strong><br />
<strong>Lobbia et al, 10</strong> – the Aerospace Corporation (Executive Secretary), holds a BS degree in Aerospace Engineering, and MS and PhD degrees in Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering [October 29, 2010, Marcus Lobbia, “James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP),” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2765:http://www.scribd.com/doc/42064436/Jim-Webb-Space-Telescope-report --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/42064436/Jim-Webb-Space-Telescope-report" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/42064436/Jim-Webb-Space-Telescope-report</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2765 -->]<br />
Managing costs on a year-to-year basis led to deferred <u><a class="wiki_link" href="/home">work</a></u> and life cycle cost increases. Inadequate reserves in the period immediately following Confirmation resulted in a nonexecutable Project. Without the reserves needed to fund the exigencies normally experienced in the course of development, the Project simply continued the practice of deferring some of the work planned in the current year to a future year. Due to the inefficiencies created when deferring already planned work, this led to escalating increases in the life cycle cost of JWST and continued erosion of the schedule. Experience shows that deferred work potentially doubles or triples costs, due to the impact of the deferrals on other work. This leads to a cascading effect wherein the cost of delayed activities further reduces the limited real reserves available to the project in later years, creating an escalating spiral for project life cycle cost. As the JWST Project was underfunded from Confirmation, the result has been a substantial impact to life cycle cost and schedule.<br />

<strong>Senate funding isn’t enough even if it passes.</strong><br />
<strong>Space News 9/16</strong> — Space News, 2011 (“Senate Panel Restores James Webb Space Telescope Funding,” Byline Dan Leone, September 16th, Available Online at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2766:http://www.space.com/12977-senate-james-webb-telescope-funding.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.space.com/12977-senate-james-webb-telescope-funding.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.space.com/12977-senate-james-webb-telescope-funding.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2766 -->, Accessed 09-16-2011)<br />
With appropriators in both the House and Senate agreeing to cut NASA's budget, the odds have increased that spending on the U.S. civil space program will decline in 2012.<br />
However, the competing bills, which differ dramatically at least in their treatment of Webb, must be reconciled before any NASA budget reaches Obama's desk.<br />
With the U.S. government's 2011 budget year coming to an end Sept. 30, time is running out for Congress to complete work on 2012 spending bills. If lawmakers miss the Sept. 30 deadline — as they have done frequently in recent years — NASA and the rest of the government may by funded by continuing resolutions, temporary spending measures that tend to freeze federal spending at or below current levels.<br />
The <u><a class="wiki_link" href="/home">extra money</a></u> that Senate appropriators approved for JWST falls short of what an independent review panel recommended NASA give the project to avoid further delays. [Giant Space Telescopes of the Future (Infographic)]<br />
That review, conducted in 2010 and led by John Casani of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said the JWST program would need cash infusions of $250 million in both 2011 and 2012 to be ready to launch by late 2015 — more than a year later than NASA's official launch date at the time.<br />

<strong>The plan does not meet this interpretation: they do not defend topical action—exploration of the science fiction literature discussed in the 1AC does not increase U.S. exploration and/or development of space beyond the Earth’s mesosphere.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>There are several net-benefits to our interpretation.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>First—Respect: requiring the affirmative to defend topical action ensures both sides receive a fair hearing—sidestepping the resolution is disrespectful and excludes us from the debate.</strong><br />

Debate as a dialogue sets an argumentative table, where AND not accrue the dialogical benefits of topical advocacy.<br />
<br />
<strong>This is an issue of fundamental fairness—the affirmative is obliged to invite a negative response.</strong><br />

A second reason to reject the topic has to do AND case is obliged to invite a negative response.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second—Productive Disagreement: defending topical action ensures that the affirmative’s arguments are adequately tested by productive rejoinder—“trial by fire” is better than axiological acceptance as a means of opinion formation.</strong><br />
<strong>Galloway 7</strong> — Ryan Galloway, Assistant Professor and Director of Debate at Samford University, 2007 (“Dinner and Conversation at the Argumentative Table: Re-Conceptualizing Debate As An Argumentative Dialogue,” Contemporary Argumentation &amp; Debate, Volume 28, September, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Academic Search Premier, p. 7-8)<br />
In addition to the basic equity norm, dismissing the AND as the judges and observers of such debates.<br />
<br />
<strong>Third—Space Policy Education: high school debates about space policy are uniquely educational—only topical discussion captures these benefits.</strong><br />

<strong>The net benefit is the Jackal/Giraffe Critique—</strong><br />
<strong>The affirmative’s “demand” for change is an undesirable linguistic strategy – such a discursive move embodies the language of the jackal and creates a slave-like relationship between speaker and listener.

<strong>First, the 1AC provides a detached and orderly description of China that reduces a complex and nuanced society to a specimen that can be clinically observed and analyzed.

While U.S. China scholars argue fiercely over AND rendered largely invisible by those common positivist assumptions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second, the affirmative’s representations of China are a myth: the way we view China is not a product of objective study but rather of the way we view ourselves. In particular, the 1AC relies on a self-imagination in which the goal of all nations is to be more like America—the way the affirmative approaches China and the way their authors discuss China are guided by this self-imagination. All of the affirmative’s impact claims are false: they reflect how we feel about ourselves more than they describe an objective reality.</strong><br />

American Self-imagination and the Construction of Otherness In AND and that difference need not equate to threat.<br />
<br />
<strong>The alternative is to give up the fantasy of rendering China knowable.

I have argued above that the &quot;China threat&quot; AND of interpreting and debating China might become possible.<br />
