====**The Bering Strait tunnel is a unique act of imagination that acts a symbol of hope for global cooperation**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">MORRISON, 11</span>**
(Richard, “A train trip from Moscow to New York?; The proposed construction of a tunnel linking the rail networks of
Russia and North America is a brave new world indeed,” The Times, August 26 2011, lexis)
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Not since Yuri Gagarin orbited the Earth 50 years ago have the Russians grabbed so many headlines for their technological daring...</span>If the Bering Strait tunnel does open in 2045, I'll buy myself a train ticket to New York as a 90th birthday treat.


====**Unfortunately, American perceptions of Russia shift between extremes of cultural relativism and economic universalism – current attitudes towards Russian technological projects stems from an unresolved mix of contempt and fascination**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">ENGERMAN, 3</span>**
(David, Engerman is Assistant Professor of History at Brandeis University, Modernization from the Other Shore: American Intellectuals and the Romance of Russian Development, p. 7-11, 2003)
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">American ideas about Russia's predominantly peasant population also built on indigenous Russian ones...</span>
Within most chapters, biographical sections highlight the ubiquity of these beliefs, even among experts with discordant political views and divergent personal experiences.

====**This is particularly true of the Bering Strait tunnel - an article in one of the West’s most prestigious newspapers exemplifies the condescending stereotypes of Russian madness that are applied to the Bering Strait plan - Russians are depicted as irrational zealots, obsessed with dreams of gigantic megaprojects despite their backwardness and inferiority, yet even this critic feels the pull of imagination in the Bering Strait tunnel**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">WHITTELL, 1 </span>**
(Giles, “Oh no, Ivan, spare us another big idea,” The Times, Jan 6 2001, lexis)
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">...The Bering tunnel is a typical example of Russian folie de grandeur Isn't it wonderful? We'll be able to travel from London to Seattle in ten days instead of ten hours...</span>That is when Russia's tree-huggers and moss-watchers should assemble at the extreme eastern tip of Chukotkaand ask those of us who follow them for the exotic dateline what on earth would travel along a Bering tunnel.

====**This example represents a broader trend of pitting Russia against the U.S. which spills over into our daily lives —we will forget the details we learn but retain a general impression of Russia**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">WASHBURN AND BURKE, 97 </span>**
(Philo, Purdue University, and Barbara, U of Minn Morris, “The Symbolic Construction of Russia and the United States on Russian National Television,” Sociological Quarterly, September 1997)
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Numerous analysis have argued that American media presentations of international events tend to fall in line with the policy interests of the U. S. government (Gans 1980; Paletz and Entman 1981; Parenti 1993; Qualier 1985; Wallis and Baran 1990)...</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The power involved here is an ideological power; the power to signify events in a particular way.</span>


====**Depicting Russia as a foreign Other located in a distant Asia encourages violence and constructs an enemy relationship**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">ENGERMAN, 3</span>**
(David, Engerman is Assistant Professor of History at Brandeis University, Modernization from the Other Shore: American Intellectuals and the Romance of Russian Development, p. 2-4, 2003)
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">These questions redounded around the world in the twentieth century...</span>
. Particularist views of Russia, which emphasized the nations unique traditions and character traits, dominated American writings until the 1920s.

====**These cultural discourses determine policy towards Russia**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">VAN EFFERINK, 10</span>**
(Leonhardt, MSc in Financial Economics at Erasmus University Rotterdam and an MA in 'Geopolitics, Territory and Security' at King’s College London. He is now working on a PhD with Royal Holloway’s (University of London), “Polar Partner or Poles Apart?” PSA Graduate Network Conference December 2010, [[@http://www.psa.ac.uk/spgrp/51/2010/Ppr/PGC2_Van%20EfferinkLeonhardt_Polar_Partners_or_Poles_Apart_PSA_2010.pdf]])
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The term ‘critical geopolitics’ had already been coined by the end of the 1980s (Dodds 2001)...</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As a result, it dehistoricises, degeographicalises and depoliticises knowledge.</span>

====**Otherization of Russia results in real hostility**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">LIEVEN, 1 </span>**
(Anatol, Senior Associate for Foreign and Security policy at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, “Against Russophobia,” World Policy Journal, Winter, [[@http://www.worldpolicy.newschool.edu/journal/lieven.html]], 2001)
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Russophobia today is therefore rooted not in ideological differences but in national hatred of a kind that is sadly too common...</span>
For of one thing we can be sure: a country that is seen to need enemies will sooner or later find them everywhere.



====**Interrogating our perceptions of Russia is key to good foreign policy education overall—the same condescending discourses are spread to others**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">LIEVEN, 1 </span>**

(Anatol, Senior Associate for Foreign and Security policy at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, “Against Russophobia,” World Policy Journal, Winter, [[@http://www.worldpolicy.newschool.edu/journal/lieven.html]])
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Ever since the Cold War ended, Western officials and commentators have been telling the Russians how they need to grow out of their Cold War attitudes toward the West and Western institutions, and learn to see things in a "modern" and "normal" way...</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">At worst, it can encourage a kind of racism, in which certain nations are classed as irrationally, irredeemably savage and wicked</span>
==<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Plan</span>== 

====**Thus the plan: Forrest and I ask you to imagine that the United States federal government ought to increase its investment in transportation infrastructure in the United States to facilitate a fixed-link Bering Strait crossing.**==== 
==**Imagination**== 

====**We must take a leap of imagination—the Bering Strait link is being killed by focus on the details of implementation and the fear of risk - we should start by imagining the crossing, not by debating how government policy is implemented**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">OLIVER, 7 </span>**

(James, writer and journalist, The Bering Strait Crossing: A 21st Century Frontier Between East and West, 216-219, 2007)

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">'North by Northwest', now it is time to pass between continents, from the risible to the sublime, which is more challenging to assess...</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">One way or another, this boundary, this 21st century frontier between East and West, must be confronted. This is the crossing point.</span>


====**The Arctic Circle is the next utopia**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sennot, 12</span>**

(Charles M., Vice President, Executive Editor and co-founder of GlobalPos, 3-27-12, “The Arctic Circle: Earths Final Frontier?”, Global Post, [[@http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/groundtruth/arctic-circle-the-final-frontier]])
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">MEDFORD, Massachusetts — The Arctic Circle is the next gold rush with eight nations holding territory in the melting tundra all vying to stake a claim to the bountiful resources that lie beneath the ice flows...</span>
The truth is that the Arctic Circle is a tabula rasa, a place where political leaders, business investors, environmentalists, dreamers and schemers are all trying to assert their will and give shape to its uncertain future.

====**Utopianism good – key to change**==== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">**Streeten, 99** </span>
(Paul, Development, v. 42 n.2 ingenta, 1999)
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">First, Utopian thinking can be useful as a framework for analysis...</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Otherwise, when the opportunity arises, we shall miss it for lack of preparedness and lose out to the opponents of reform, to those who want to preserve the status quo.</span>

====**We should imagine possibilities rather than legislate commands**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">EPSTEIN, 99 </span>**
(Mikhail, Associate Professor in the Department of Russian and East Asian Languages and Cultures at Emory University, Transcultural Experiments: Russian and American Models of Creative Communication, p. 166-168, 1999)
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Though ethics is usually presented as a set of rules and norms of behavior, this does not imply that the contents of ethics should be as normative and prescriptive as its forms are...</span>
Thus, in addition to the golden rule of commonness, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we need a differential and interferential ethics based on imagining others as different from ourselves andimagining ourselves as possibilities for others.</span>

====**The Bering Strait tunnel is the key metaphor to overcome other threats**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">GERLICZ, 9 </span>**
(By Dr. Claude Gaudeau de Gerlicz, Chair, Bioespas, Bioinformatic and Biotechnology Laboratory, France, “Great Projects as Potential Peace Engines,” March 19 2009, [[@http://www.upf.org/bering-strait-project/193-bering-strait-research/1682-great-projects-as-potential-peace-engines]])
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Humanity has always sought to gather around great projects to decrease social tensions or transcend political, ethnic, or religious boundaries...</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Construction of a tunnel was to be undertaken by a New Jersey construction company under a 90-year contract.</span>


====**Our act of imagination shapes world politics—representations create the world and are inextricably linked to policy**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">WELDES, 3</span>**– Senior Lecturer, Bristol University; PhD Minn

(Jutta, “Popular culture, science fiction, and world politics: exploring inter textual relations” in “To seek out new worlds: science fiction and world politics” ed. Weldes, Palgrave Macmillan 2003, 12-13)
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">But this is at best a partial understanding of the relationship between representation and “the real.”...</span>
Based as they are on such assumptions, our analyses have more in common with Cynthia Weber’s use of popular film to “access what IR theory says, how it plots its story, and how all this together gives us a particular vision of the world” (2001: 132, emphasis added).

====**We should imagine alternative worlds even if they’re technically impossible - which means you should vote aff even if the Bering Strait tunnel is impossible**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">LIPPARD, 10</span>**- Sr. Security Product Manager for Global Crossing and a Ph.D. student in Human and Social Dimensions of Science and Technology at Arizona State University
(April 29 2010, Jim, “ Science fiction scenarios and public engagement with science ”[[@http://lippard.blogspot.com/2010/04/science-fiction-scenarios-and-public.html]])
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Science fiction has been a popular genre at least since Jules Verne’s 19th century work, and arguably longer still...</span>
Miller and Bennett, however, argue otherwise--that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">not only is science fiction useful for thinking about longer-term consequences, but that the parts about the people--how technologies actually fit into society--are just as, if not more important than the ideas about the technologies themselves.</span>
