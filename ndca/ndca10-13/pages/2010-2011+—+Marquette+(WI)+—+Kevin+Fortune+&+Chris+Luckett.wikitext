WASHINGTON (Kyodo) -- <span class="CardText-Underlined">The <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">planned transfer</span> of some U.S. Marines from Okinawa <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">to Guam faces a financial hurdle as the U.S. government considers it will be impossible to repay a Japanese loan to finance infrastructure projects needed for the transfer of the Marines to the </span>U.S. Pacific <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">territory</span>, bilateral diplomatic sources said Friday.</span>
… As a long delay in the transfer could adversely affect the bilateral alliance, the Japanese government has not ruled out the possibility of shouldering the infrastructure-building costs, the sources said//.//

**Contention Four: A Reality Check**
**The negative will attempt to convince you that the plan is undesirable by appealing to far-fetched scenarios of global destruction – we ask that you remain skeptical of their convoluted internal link chains.**

**FIRST—“there’s always a risk” is not a reason to vote negative – low probability internal link chains should not be used as an excuse to reject the plan.**

First, and foremost, <span style="font-size: 9pt;">**__we need to realize that some risks are so trivial that they are simply not meaningful.__** </span>

<span style="font-size: 9pt;">**__…__**</span> <span class="CardText-Underlined">Just as we ignore these risks in our own lives, we should be willing to ignore minimal risks in debates.</span>

**Second—rejecting low probability internal link chains is key to rational policymaking—accumulated experience proves that appeals to the possibility of catastrophic causal chains should not influence our decision-making**.
<span class="Citation-AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">Sven Ove</span> __**Hansson**__</span>**<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">, </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Professor in the Department of Philosophy and the History of Technology at the Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm**,** Sweden),</span> __**<span class="Citation-AuthorDate">2005</span>**__

However, it would not be feasible to take such possibilities into account in all decisions that we make.
…<span class="Highlighted"><span style="border: medium none;">. The same applies to technological, economic, social, and political sys<span style="border: medium none;">tems</span></span></span>, although our knowledge about their resilience towards various disturbances has not been sufficiently systematized.

**Third—disregard the negative’s pleas for you to “judge normally” and reject their absurd internal link chains – improving risk calculation is key to meaningful education in debate.**

__**SUBPOINT A: GUNS DON’T KILL PEOPLE, PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE**__
**THE ASSUMPTION THAT CIRCUMSTANCES CAUSE VIOLENCE IS MISGUIDED – EVERY VIOLENT ACT REQUIRES AN INDIVIDUAL TO CHOOSE TO COMMIT VIOLENCE.**
Susanne KAPPELER, Lecturer in English at the University of East Anglia (UK) and freelance writer, 1995 ["Violence and the will to violence," The Will To Violence: The Politics of Personal Behaviour, Published by Polity Press (Cambridge, UK), [[http://debatecoaches.org/wiki/index.php/Special:BookSources/0745613047|ISBN 0745613047]], p. 1-2]
Violence is a ubiquitous reality in our society … The circumstances identified may differ according to the politics of the explainers, but the method of explanation remains the same.

__**SUBPOINT B: THE DISPLACEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY**__
**THE AFFIRMATIVE’S APPROACH IS A FORM OF COLLECTIVE VICTIM-BLAMING THAT STIGMATIZES ENTIRE GROUPS IN ORDER TO EXONERATE INDIVIDUAL PERPETRATORS – THEIR FLAWED METHODOLOGY DISPLACES RESPONSIBILITY AND TURNS THE CASE – THEY HAVE MISIDENTIFIED THE CAUSE OF THEIR HARMS.**
Susanne KAPPELER, Lecturer in English at the University of East Anglia (UK) and freelance writer, 1995 ["Violence and the will to violence," The Will To Violence: The Politics of Personal Behaviour, Published by Polity Press (Cambridge, UK), [[http://debatecoaches.org/wiki/index.php/Special:BookSources/0745613047|ISBN 0745613047]], p. 2-3]
While consideration of mitigating circumstances has its rightful place in a court of law trying (and defending) an offender, this does not automatically make it an adequate or sufficient practice for political analysis … It is a version of collective victim-blaming, of stigmatizing entire social strata as potential hotbeds of violence, which rests on and perpetuates the mainstream division of society into so-called marginal groups — the classic clienteles of social work and care politics (and of police repression) — and an implied ‘centre’ to which all the speakers, explainers, researchers and carers themselves belong, and which we are to assume to be a zone of non-violence.

__**SUBPOINT C: THE MOMENT OF DECISION**__
**THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO ADOPT A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO VIOLENCE. INSTEAD OF VIEWING VIOLENCE AS A PRODUCT OF CIRCUMSTANCES, WE SHOULD INTERROGATE THE MOMENT OF DECISION WHEN INDIVIDUALS CHOOSE TO COMMIT VIOLENCE. THIS METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH ENABLES EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE TO THE VIOLENT IDEOLOGY OF THE AFFIRMATIVE AND IS A NECESSARY PRECONDITION TO REMEDYING THE HARMS THEY HAVE OUTLINED.**
Susanne KAPPELER, Lecturer in English at the University of East Anglia (UK) and freelance writer, 1995 ["Violence and the will to violence," The Will To Violence: The Politics of Personal Behaviour, Published by Polity Press (Cambridge, UK), [[http://debatecoaches.org/wiki/index.php/Special:BookSources/0745613047|ISBN 0745613047]], p. 5-7]
A politics aiming at a change in people’s behaviour would require political work that is very much more cumbersome and very much less promising of success than is the use of state power and social control … Ideology, however, is not just made by others; we are all of us subjects of ideology — as the producers of our own thinking and as the recipients of other people’s discourse — unless we resist such ideological structures of thought and discourse in a continual critique of ideology itself.

__**SUBPOINT D: START WITH THE “I” WORLD**__
**THE AFFIRMATIVE’S INFATUATION WITH INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE AT THE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT OBSCURES OUR INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIOLENCE – THIS ORGANIZED IRRESPONSIBILITY CONSTITUTES A WILLED REFUSAL TO MEANINGFULLY RESIST VIOLENCE. WE SHOULD BEGIN NOT WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF WHAT OTHERS SHOULD DO BUT WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF WHAT WE SHOULD DO.**
Susanne KAPPELER, Lecturer in English at the University of East Anglia (UK) and freelance writer, 1995 ["Violence and the will to violence," The Will To Violence: The Politics of Personal Behaviour, Published by Polity Press (Cambridge, UK), [[http://debatecoaches.org/wiki/index.php/Special:BookSources/0745613047|ISBN 0745613047]], p. 10-11]
‘We are the war’ does not mean that the responsibility for a war is shared collectively and diffusely by an entire society — which would be equivalent to exonerating warlords and politicians and profiteers or, as Ulrich Beck says, upholding the notion of ‘collective irresponsibility’, where people are no longer held responsible for their actions, and where the conception of universal responsibility becomes the equivalent of a universal acquittal.6 … We share in the responsibility for this war and its violence in the way we let them grow inside us, that is, in the way we shape ‘our feelings, our relationships, our values’ according to the structures and the values of war and violence.
