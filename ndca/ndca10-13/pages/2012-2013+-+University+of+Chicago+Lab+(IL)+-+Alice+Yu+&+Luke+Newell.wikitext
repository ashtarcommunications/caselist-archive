The reactions we hope for </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">from them</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> are not calculations of positions, nor are they new political alliances. </span>


<span style="font-size: 10pt;">What we hope for is of a different nature.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span>


<span style="font-size: 10pt;">We see that the human [humyn] masses are at the disposition of blind forces which condemn them to inexplicable hecatombs, and which</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, while making them wait,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> give them a morally empty and materially miserable life</span>.¶ w<span style="font-size: 6pt;">hat we have before our eyes is the horror of human impotence.¶ We want to confront this horror directly. </span>


<span style="font-size: 10pt;">We address ourselves to the direct and violent drives which</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, in the minds of those who hear us, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">can contribute to the surge of power that will liberate men [humyns] from the absurd swindlers who lead them.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ We know that</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> such drives have little to do with the phraseology invented to maintain political positions. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The will to be done with impotence implies, even in our eyes, scorn for this phrasemongering; the taste for verbal agitation has never passed for a mark of power.¶ On this point, we want to express ourselves in a precise way.¶ Derided </span>


<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">humanity</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> [humynity] has </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">already </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">known surges of power. These chaotic </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">but implacable</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> power surges </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">dominate history and</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> are known as Revolutions</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. On many occasions</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> entire populations have gone into the street and nothing has been able to resist their force. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">It is an incontestable fact that</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> if men [humyns] have found themselves in the streets, armed, in a mass uprising, carrying with them the tumult of the total power of the people, it has never been the consequence of a </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">narrow and speciously defined</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> political alliance.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">What drives the crowds to the street is the emotion </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">directly</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> aroused by striking events in the atmosphere of a storm, it is the contagious emotion that, from house to house, from suburb to suburb, suddenly turns a hesitating man [humyn] into a frenzied being.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ It is evident that</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> if</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, in general, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">insurrections had </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">had </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">to wait for learned disputes </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">between committees and the political offices of parties, then</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> there never would have been an insurrection.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span>



<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Still, as astonishing as this may seem, one frequently notes, among militant revolutionaries, a complete lack of confidence in the spontaneous reactions of the masses.¶ The need to organize parties has resulted in unusual habits among the</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> so-called revolutionary agitators, </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">who </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">confuse the entry of the Revolution into the street with the political platforms, with the well-groomed programs, with their maneuvers in the halls of Congress.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ Amazingly,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> a distrust of the same order prevails against intellectuals. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The distrust of intellectuals only apparently contradicts the one that underestimates the spontaneous movements of the masses.¶ As much as they can,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> certain </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">professional </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">revolutionary activists would like to eliminate, from the human [humyn] tragedy that the Revolution necessarily is, all its emotional resources, the brutal conversion of the masses, the atmosphere charged with hope, the rages and enthusiasms express in periods of crisis by those who write.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ We are as far as we can be from the belief that a movement can do without its leaders, as far as we can be from the belief that this leadership can do without the resources of human knowledge contributed by the most recent advances of human understanding. But first of all we must protest against everything that is born in the poisoned atmosphere of professional congresses and committees, all of which are at the mercy of hallway maneuvers.¶ </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We do not think it is possible to raise a political question without having a debate. And for us having the debate means having it in the street, it means having it where emotion can seize men [humyns] and push them to the limit, without meeting the eternal obstacles that result from the defense of old political positions.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">My partner and I are not the 99 percent. From almost any standpoint, we are the privileged, the lucky, the ones born with a silver spoon already in our mouths. Mornings, we ascend into the ivory tower called the University of Chicago’s Laboratory Schools. Afternoons, we ride in cars that bring us from one fortress to another.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">There were 42 homicides in Chicago last month. Twenty-one of them were within five minutes walking distance of our sheltered pristine world.</span>


<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Question: Why do we stay silent?</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Answer: Who would listen to us? What is protest now but a shout in the shadows?</span>


In 1989 a group of students stormed Tiananmen Square in China to protest an increasingly rigid and oppressive government. Its origins began with the sons and daughters of the elite and rippled through Beijing for 3 days, rocking the authoritarian regime. When the crackdown began, it was brutal and swift. While the regime strutted in full military regalia, a peasant, sick of the atrocity moved himself in front of a tank. The horrifying violence—the people v. the system—had become visible.

This event reverberated from that one square to spark a new dissent that would spread past the borders of China into the Soviet Union. And in 1991, those protests would be a driving force in the downfall of the USSR.

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Maybe their cause was good or maybe it wasn’t. But only that revolution opened up the grounds for change—something the self-interested and insipid political system could never have dreamed of. </span>The rallying cry wasn’t a celebration of a victorious protest, a celebration of the deaths, but to remember an individual that stood up against all odds. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The movement of the people to their rebellions is the only option to challenge the violences of the status quo. </span>

In this debate we are called to affirm: Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States. The resolution hails us to work but we will not comply. Rather than lending volume to the echoes in the halls of congress we give the power of our voices to the purpose of revolutionary agitation. We furthermore affirm that this energy should be invested in outpourings into the streets…somewhere a smug politician asks what are you rebelling against…answer: what have you got?

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Bataille 1985</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Georges, “Visions of Excess”, ed. Allan Stoekl, p. 164-168)</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> We do not endorse Bataille’s gendered language.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In a certain sense, the Popular Front meant nothing more than the revolutionaries’ abandonment of the anticapitalist offensive; the move to the defense of antifascism; the move to the simple defense of democracy; the abandonment, at the same time, of revolutionary defeatism.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Now comrades, what can we think of this abandonment of the anticapitalist offensive, at precisely the time when a great number of people, independently of their political tendencies, agreed upon the disastrous character of the capitalist system? From the revolutionary point of view, the abandonment of the anticapitalist offensive in the midst of the present crisis would represent the most scandalous possible weakness; isn’t it incredible to leave to the worst slave of capitalism, to the fascistic Croix de feu lackeys of the de Wendels, the rallying cry awaited by the anxious, disconcerted masses, the rallying cry to fight against a capitalism despised by the vast majority of men?</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The default of the politicians thus would abandon the real world, the world of tragic sufferings and hopes, to the degrading verbal comedy of barracks-room thugs.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And at the same time, while dread mounts from day to day before the imminence of the physical extermination of men and human wealth, wouldn’t it be incredible to anticipate a new conflict by giving the idea of antifascism a value on the level of military struggle, when we know, meanwhile, that stupid imperialism precisely engendered this fascism that we mean to fight while marching in the ranks assigned to us by generals and industrial magnates.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Comrades, if human reality, or to be more precise, human [humyn] reality in the street- personally, it is in tying to it all the hope that stirs me that I use this term “street,” which opposes life, real life, to the schemes as well as to the isolation of the absurdly involuted individual- if human reality did not in every possible way go beyond the mediocre conceptions and betrayals of conniving politicians, then the Popular Front would not have, for any of us, the profound meaning that it has acquired in the circumstances that we have lived and that we continue to live. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Even today</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, while many people- rightly or wrongly- are claiming that the Popular Front is falling apart at the top, that, beyond an antifascist defense it will be incapable of setting forth a plan for concerted action essential to the exercise of power, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">we </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">continue to</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> see growing among the masses </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">who make up its strength,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> who were in the street yesterday, who will invade the street tomorrow, the agitation of the people’s omnipotence.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Badly formed political conceptions have set these people in motion, but the Popular Front does not depend on the will of its founders to work exactly for their goals:</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> the Popular Front is above all now a movement, an agitation, a crucible in which </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">formerly </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">separated political forces meld with </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">an often</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> tumultuous effervescence.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now that the various social strata that constitute it have become conscious of the strength they represent when reunited, this strength, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">going to their heads,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> will attract them to each other and will break the chains meant to hold them.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Therefore, when our comrades of the revolutionary Socialist left call for the transformation of the defense against fascism into an anticapitalist offensive, of the Popular Front into the Popular Front of combat, they are only expressing the dynamic movement inherent in the makeup of forces in motion. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Today it is not advisable for anyone to be opposed to the rise of the all-powerful populace.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We must not be unaware, however, that difficulties must be overcome, before the offensive can be realized, without which the party will find itself in the hands of those who are still criminally talking of the “lost victory.”</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We do not believe that organized parties should disappear, but </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">we do not believe </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">either </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">that the masses can attain the power to put an end to domination </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">by the capitalist lackeys</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> unless a movement appears that can escape </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">sterilizing control </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">of these parties.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We must above all recognize as critical the period following the formation of a government that, without being the direct expression of the Popular Front, could nevertheless be brought to power by the parliamentarians who belonged to this Front.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> From time to time the spokesmen of the Popular Front themselves are led to make statements that show an extreme uneasiness on this point. Concerning a Popular Front government, Pierre Jerome, secretary-general of the Vigilance Committee, a few weeks ago express the fear that he could not cover budgetary expenditures with forseen income: “In that case,” Pierre Jerome state, “we will see our enemies furnished with the best weapon they could hope for. To be sure, if panic sets in, we ourselves should not faint with fear…” Jerome in any case sees a way out of this great difficulty: “In the end, all we need to do is make the rich pay…”</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In fact, nothing is more likely in the near future than a repeat of the disastrous events that sooner or later followed the electoral victories of the so-called Left of 1924 and 1932.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Without being able to have confidence in more or less arbitrary details, one can foresee, at one time or another, a serious crisis of the entire Left, a crisis that will not fail to serious affect the Popular Front itself.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">To tell the truth, those of us who see the Popular Front as a reality in motion have nothing to become excessively alarmed about in such a crisis. We must only forestall it, knowing full well that </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">no development of forces and no great social transformation can take place without a crisis, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">knowing as well above all that</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> the forces destined to prevail are those that not only overcome their crises, but are capable of profiting by them</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Popular Front means for us the awareness the people first attained, in the days of February, of their strength in the face of Fascist thugs and lackeys. We do not believe that this awareness will allow itself to be shaken on the day miserable directors betray their own impotence.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">These conditions are, on the contrary, in our opinion, necessary so that the masses, who have no desire for the reactionary solutions leading to poverty and war, this time can become aware of the inherent necessities of power. It is possible that</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> a crisis is indispensable for the transformation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">- as indicated from the outset by the menacing attitude of the masses in the street- of the defensive Popular Front into the Popular Front of combat, and, of course, of combat for the anticapitalist dictatorship of the people.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is clear from now on that, in order to have confidence in its own resources, the Popular Front must first lose the confidence it currently has in its principal leaders.I do not think it necessary here to insist upon our reasons for having the greatest distrust and even the greatest contempt for given professional political parliamentarians, who tomorrow risk being entrusted with the position of leadership.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">What interests us above all- </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the analysis of the economic bases of society having been accomplished, its results having proven, moreover, to be limited</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">- are the emotions that give the [human] [humyn] masses the surges of power that tear them away from the domination of those who </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">only know how to</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> lead them on to poverty and to the slaughterhouse.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But we would not want to suggest that we blindly abandon ourselves to the spontaneous reactions of the street.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We are led to make an essential distinction between the reactions that agitate men [humyns] in the street and the phrasemongering of politicians, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and all the teachings of the present period at the very least show that </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">this </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">distinction </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">credits the men who have nothing </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">going for them</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> but their passions, to the detriment of those corrupted and </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">often </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">emptied of human content by the strategic task.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But we find no reason to renounce </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the decisive intervention of</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> judgment and </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">of</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> the </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">methodological </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">understanding of the facts. We only wish to apply intelligence less to </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">so-called</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> political situations </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and to the logical deductions that ensue,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> than to the immediate comprehension of life. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Even independently of the tragic events now taking place,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> we believe that there is more to learn in the streets of great cities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, for example, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">than in political newspapers or books. For us a significant reality is the </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">state of prostration and</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> boredom expressed inside a bus by a dozen human [humyn] faces, all of them complete strangers. For anyone not </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">already </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">hardened by the emptiness of life, there is </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">in this world, which seems to have at its disposal limitless resources, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">a confusion remedied only by a kind of lazily accepted general imbecility. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Even poverty seems at the very least less incurable than this stupid distress</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. A beggar whose broken voice cries out a song one can barely hear in the rear of a courtyard seems at times to have lost less in the game of life than the human [humyn] matter arranged in buses and trains during rush hour</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Someone told me the other day, correctly, that the source of the Croix de Feu’s might was very simple: the Croix de Feu, in general, are people who are bored. The minimum of contagious passion animating the Croix de Feu, the low budget exaltation- to tell the truth, an exaltation good for workrooms- maintained by this pillar of human boredom (family barracks) known as the Count Colonel de la Rocque, is somehow enough to maintain a vague gleam of life in empty brains, but no taste for what is burning or colorful in life grips them, and the sinister job of the Croix de Feu becomes their whole life.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The opium of the people in the present world is </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">perhaps not so much religion as it is</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> accepted boredom. Such a world is at the mercy, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">it must be known,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> of those who provide </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">at least the semblance of</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> an escape from boredom. Human [humyn] life aspires to the passions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and again encounters it exigencies.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It can appear </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">out of place and even absolutely</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> absurd to those who worry about which platforms must serve as the basis for future actions, when we respond by saying that the world in which they bustle about is doomed to boredom.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This remark, however, has a very simple meaning: in the Communist opposition, I have personally known a great number of people for whom the definition of platforms has had an essential value. Their activity resulted only in stunning boredom, which they saw precisely as the mark of revolutionary seriousness.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We want to say that we oppose these preoccupations.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We believe that strength will belong not to those for whom action is a demand for morose and disagreeable work, but to those who, on the contrary, will deliver the world from its exhausting boredom.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We want to give precise answers to questions that demand precise answers, but we maintain that what is essential lies elsewhere.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We must contribute to the masses’ awareness of their own power; we are sure that strength results less from strategy than from collective exaltation, and exaltation can come only from words that touch not the reason but the passions of the masses.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We want to hope that soon the masses will know how to gather and find together, in this reunion, the burning heat that attracts men from all sides and that will become the basis for an implacable popular domination.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> We ask all those who, along with us, mean to pursue an action parallel to the one we see open before us how they hope to achieve the dictatorship of the working masses, how, first of all, they hope to realize the transformation of the defensive Popular Front into a Popular Front of combat.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">As for us, we want to pose the question in a precise way. It seems to me personally that the only way to pose the question is the following: </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">it is not really a question of knowing </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">first of all </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">what must be done, but what result must be envisioned. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We know that</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> the question of the takeover of power is now being posed. We know that</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in all likelihood,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> the democratic regime, which struggles amidst mortal contradictions, cannot be saved.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The succession is open</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We have many reasons to think that the Croix de Feu provide no response to the necessities resulting from the current situation- neither in their social content, the tenor of their program, nor in the personality of their chief. Their effective value seems to us in this respect to be situated far below that of the Italian Fascists or the German National Socialists.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Popular Front in its present form is not, nor does it present itself, as an organized force within sight of taking power. It must thus be transformed, according to the plan of the socialist revolutionary Left, into a Popular Front of combat.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">As for us, we say that</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> this presupposes a renewal of political forms</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a renewal possible in the present circumstances, when</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> it seems that all revolutionary forces are </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">called upon</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> to fuse in an incandescent crucible. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We are assured that insurrection is impossible for our adversaries.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> We believe that </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">of the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">two hostile forces that will engage in the struggle for power, the fascists and the people, the force that gets the upper hand will be the one that shows </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">itself </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">most capable of </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">dominating events and</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> imposing an implacable power on its adversaries. What we demand is a </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">coherent disciplined organization, its entire</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> will straining with enthusiasm toward popular power; </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">this is the sense of responsibility that must devolve on those who tomorrow must be the masters, who must subordinate the system of production to human interests, who must impose silence, in their own country and at the same time throughout the world, on the nationalists’ criminal and puerile passions.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> After February 16.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">500,000 workers, defied by little cockroaches, invaded the streets and caused an immense uproar.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Comrades, who has the right to lay down the law?</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This ALL-POWERFUL multitude, this HUMAN [HUMYN] OCEAN…</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Only this ocean of men [humyns] in revolt can save the world from the nightmare </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">of impotence</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> and carnage in which it sinks!</span>


Status quo structural violence outweighs nuclear war.
<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Abu-Jamal 98</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 7pt;">(Mumia, award-winning PA journalist, 9/19, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 7pt; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.flashpoints.net/mQuietDeadlyViolence.html]]</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 7pt;">)</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">We live</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">, equally immersed, and to a deeper degree, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">in a nation that condones and ignores wide-ranging "structural' violence</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">, of a kind </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">that destroys human life with a breathtaking ruthlessness. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Former Massachusetts prison official and writer, Dr. James Gilligan observes; </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">By "structural violence" I mean the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">, as contrasted by those who are above them. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Those excess deaths </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">(or at least a demonstrably large proportion of them) </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">are a function </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">of the class structure; and that structure is itself a product </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">of </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">society's collective human </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">choices, concerning how to distribute the collective wealth of the society</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. These are not acts of God. I am contrasting "structural" with "behavioral violence" by which I mean the non-natural deaths and injuries that are caused by specific behavioral actions of individuals against individuals, such as the deaths we attribute to homicide, suicide, soldiers in warfare, capital punishment, and so on. --(Gilligan, J., MD, Violence: Reflections On a National Epidemic (New York: Vintage, 1996), 192.) </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">This form of violence</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">, not covered by any of the majoritarian, corporate, ruling-class protected media, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">is invisible to us and because of its invisibility, all the more insidious</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. How dangerous is it--really? Gilligan notes: [E]very fifteen years, on the average, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a nuclear war </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">that caused 232 million deaths; and </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">every single year, two to three times as many people die from poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">of the Jews over a six-year period. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">This is</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">, in effect, the equivalent of </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">an ongoing, unending, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">in fact </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">accelerating, thermonuclear war</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">or genocide on the </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">weak and </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">poor every year of every decade, throughout the world</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">.</span>

Finally, there is no weak liberal solution. The excess energy must be expended either gloriously or catastrophically.

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Bataille ‘91</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Georges. The Accursed Share. P. 21. Translated by Robert Hurley) </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 7pt;">We do not endorse Bataille’s gendered language.</span>

Man's [Humynkind’s] disregard for the material basis of his life still causes him to err in a serious way. Humanity [humynity] exploits given material resources, but by restricting them as it does to a resolution of the immediate difficulties it encounters <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(a resolution which it has hastily had to define as an ideal),</span> it assigns to the forces it employs an end which they cannot have. Beyond our immediate ends, mans [humynkind’s] activity in fact pursues the useless and infinite fulfillment of the universe. " <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Of course, the error that results from so complete a disregard does not just concern man's claim to lucidity. It is not easy to realize one's own ends if one must, in trying to do so, carry out a movement that surpasses them</span>. No doubt these ends and this movement may not be entirely irreconcilable; but if these two terms are to be reconciled we must cease to ignore one of them; otherwise, our works quickly turn to catastrophe<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I will begin with a basic fact:</span> The living organism, in a situation determined by the play of energy on the surface of the globe, ordinarily receives more energy than is necessary for maintaining life; the excess energy <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(wealth)</span> can be used for the growth of a system <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(e.g., an organism);</span> if the system can no longer grow, or if the excess cannot be completely absorbed in its growth, it must necessarily be lost without profit; It must be spent, willingly or not, gloriously or catastrophically.

<span style="color: #343434; font-family: Times;">Badiou’s communism thus drives itself straightaway into the ditch separating new from the old: “at a distance from the state,” but still fundamentally oriented toward hoary ideas about the state’s withering away. Though “organization” no longer means a party capable of seizing state power and directing its military and bureaucratic power toward particular programmatic ends, it does mean that “[y]ou decide what the state must do and find the means of forcing it to, while always keeping your distance from the state…” And yet this orientation toward the state – regardless of its reliance on telekinesis rather than direct contact – reproduces the primary weakness of the riots and uprisings of the present, the very thing it seeks to overcome. Whether or not they feature explicit demands, these riots are always heard by the state and powers-that-be as practical calls for reform: “Mubarak must go!” and “No more austerity!” are how the uprisings of Egypt and Greece sound in paraphrase. This has less to do with the ideas actually held by participants, who may indeed have anticapitalist and antistate aspirations, than it does with their particular strategic and tactical choices: massing in the square defensively, for instance, or attacking the parliament building on the eve of an austerity vote. Even the supposedly “meaningless” violence of the London riots gets heard as a call for reform, for amelioration of poverty, social exclusion, and the racist harassment of the police. It is unclear, then, what solution Badiou’s call for “organization” might provide to the limits of the historical riot, which he rightly notes “does not by itself offer an alternative to the power it intends to overthrow.” The dubious case of “Latin American socialism” and the sloganizing of the antiglobalization movement notwithstanding, no such alternative has yet emerged in the 21st century. We might wonder, instead, if the very concept of an alternative belongs to the now-outmoded politics of party, state and program. In the 20th century, “alternative” always meant an </span>//<span style="color: #343434; font-family: Times;">alternate form of modernization </span>//<span style="color: #343434; font-family: Times;">and </span>//<span style="color: #343434; font-family: Times;">industrialization </span>//<span style="color: #343434; font-family: Times;">– modernization under socialist (or fascist) conditions of political control and distribution. Past revolutionary ideas of the future depended on a conception of an alternate course of development. But such futures are gone. There are no creditable images of the century to come that are not formed of nightmare and ruin, however much the Shanghai skyline tries to tell us otherwise. Everyone dreads the future. Which means that we might need to revise our very conception of what “revolution” and “alternative” mean.</span>
