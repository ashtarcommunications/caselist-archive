For a brief moment, Naoto Kan looked like the anchor who could end Japan’s drift. Where his predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama, was a patrician dogged by corruption scandals and perceived as incapable of leading his own government, Kan came into the premiership stressing his own middle-class background ... But the U.S. needs to be patient—especially on Okinawa. It needs to accept that in the months and years to come, anything beyond a limited military alliance focused on the defense of Japan is a nonstarter for Japan’s beleaguered politicians.

This monograph began by making the assertion that the alliance can and must become more than simply a narrow defense pact if both the United States and Japan want to be successful in shaping the security future of East Asia in ways that support peace, prosperity, and the growth of democratic and human values ... Creating the conditions for that liberal development and tamping down the anticipated frictions that will arise along the way can best be accomplished in tandem. In the long run, this liberalism backed by the concerted power of the United States and Japan will bring lasting stability to the region.

Many scholars and analysts argue that in the twenty-first century international instability is more likely in East Asia than in Western Europe. Whether one looks at variables favored by realists or liberals, East Asia appears more dangerous ... The historically based mistrust among the actors in Northeast Asia is so intense that not only is the maintenance of a U.S. presence in Japan critical, but the form the U.S.-Japan alliance takes also has potentially important implications for regional stability.

Because the stakes are so high in Asia, it is urgent that the United States and Japan develop a common perception and approach regarding their relationship in the 21st century... But Washington must make clear that it welcomes a Japan that is willing to make a greater contribution and to become a more equal alliance partner. We see the special relationship between the United States and Great Britain as a model.

The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious, not only for the Northeast Asian region but for the whole international community ....

In the latter, enhanced joint defense capabilities from neighboring Japan could deter any aggressive behavior by China’s military.

As China gains economic clout, its government's brand of touchy, saber-rattling nationalism becomes more worrisome. That touchiness is rooted in the memory of humiliation inflicted by foreigners, from the Western colonial concessions of the 19th century, and it is rooted in the more recent memory of Japanese atrocities during the World War II occupation ... The United States would feel compelled to come to Taiwan's aid, resulting in a war between heavily armed countries that possess nuclear arsenals.

THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -- horror of horrors -- raise the possibility of a nuclear war... There would be no victors in such a war.

Japan’s withdrawal from the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) could damage the most durable international non-proliferation regime.

Japan has a vital role to play in the stability and security of North East Asia. North East Asia encompasses within its confines some of the most explosive flashpoints around the globe... Any further downslide in this direction can only help China and endanger US security interests and architecture in East Asia.

Simply put, to the Chinese obsessed with strategic assessments based on estimation of ‘Comprehensive National Power’, in Chinese perceptions, Japan's strategic power gets that much more devalued by Japan's political instability and the growing American ambiguities on Japan’s value to US strategic interests ... The strategic spin-off for China from such exploitation of Japan’s vulnerabilities could result in re-emergence of Japanese nationalism, a nuclear weapon and missiles arsenal and an independent military posture.

To many security experts, the most alarming possible consequence of a Japanese decision to develop nuclear weapons would be the development of a regional arms race ... The counter-argument, made by some security experts, is that nuclear deterrence was stabilizing during the Cold War, and a similar nuclear balance could be achieved in Asia. However, most observers maintain that the risks outweigh potential stabilizing factors.

The spread of ballistic missiles and other nuclear-capable delivery systems in Asia, or in the Middle East with reach into Asia, is especially dangerous because plausible adversaries live close together and are already engaged in ongoing disputes about territory or other issues ...

Metric: Does NPT adherence provide a leverage point for outside influence and action to prevent proliferation? NPT adherence clearly provides a point of leverage, although the nature of that leverage* and its likely effectiveness*could vary depending on the country ... The indirect impact of Article II may be more compelling. The ‘‘no acquisition, no manufacture’’ obligation provides a nonproliferation leverage point for rallying outsiders, for engaging in dialogue with countries rethinking their nonproliferation commitment, and for taking action after NPT breakout.

Proliferation. Roger Molander, of RAND Corporation, asserts that “in the near future, a large number of countries are each going to develop a small number of nuclear weapons.”50 The Union of Concerned Scientists considers this to be the greatest long term danger confronting both US and international security today... Ambassador Lehman envisages a scenario in which proliferation may induce a chain reaction of related regional arms races that could result in unintended and unexpected consequences far removed from the objectives of the proliferating nations, and in the United States’ specific case, a risk that the nation could get sucked into a conventional regional conflict which is subsequently escalated into nuclear warfare by its allies or their opponents.54

Jonathan Tepperman’s article in the September 7, 2009 issue of Newsweek, “Why Obama Should Learn to Love the Bomb,” provides a novel but frivolous argument that nuclear weapons “may not, in fact, make the world more dangerous….” Rather, in Tepperman’s world, “The bomb may actually make us safer.” ... Thus, he not only favors nuclear weapons, but finds the security of these weapons to trump human security. Presumably he would have President Obama providing new and secure nuclear weapons to North Korea, Pakistan and any other nuclear weapons states that come along so that they will feel secure enough not to use their weapons in a first-strike attack. Do we really want to bet the human future that Kim Jong-Il and his successors are more rational than Mr. Tepperman?

Even if the NPT does not formally collapse, a silent crowd armed with nuclear weapon capabilities could come into existence if countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Japan or Taiwan decide to reconsider their decision to give up nuclear weapons and secretly pursue a nuclear weapon option while remaining NPT parties ...The credibility of the IAEA safeguards system has already been undermined by the discovery of secret nuclear weapons programmes in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and North Korea and by the discovery of undisclosed – suspicious – nuclear activities in Iran.

Learning as states gain experience with nuclear weapons is complicated. While to some extent nuclear acquisition might provide information about resolve or capabilities, it also generates uncertainty about the way an actual conflict would go – given the new risk of nuclear escalation – and uncertainty about relative capabilities. Rapid proliferation may especially heighten uncertainty given the potential for reasonable states to disagree at times about the quality of the capabilities each possesses ...While a stable and credible nuclear arsenal communicates clear information about the likely costs of conflict, in the short-term nuclear proliferation is likely to increase uncertainty about the trajectory of a war, the balance of power, and the preferences of the adopter.

Both Okinawans and Americans deserve justice. It's time for Washington to deliver.

**Restructuring the Alliance key to assertive Japanese foreign policy and regional stability – Europe proves.**

This week marks the 50th anniversary of the U.S.-Japan alliance, but the Obama administration seems sincerely flummoxed as to whether to bemoan or commemorate the occasion ... A more assertive and independent Japan promises to do much more for East Asia and the United States than a Japan that defers to Washington. It is past time for Washington and Tokyo to bring the alliance into the 21st century.

A change of head of government in Japan no longer surprises anyone. Two weeks ago, Yukio Hatoyama resigned as prime minister and was replaced by former finance minister Naoto Kan ... Japan is the largest trading partner and investor in Indonesia. Japan has been playing an important role in our economic development and is a fellow democracy with whom we share many values and norms.

<span class="Underline"> </span>
<span class="Underline">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Racism is an evil weed sown in the garden of humanity, its seeds sown in its earliest days sending fresh shoots each season so that once again little has changed </span>**</span>

<span class="Underline"> </span>
<span class="Underline">Racism is an evil weed sown in the garden of humanity. It has grown wildly, entangling the healthy plants and covering the pathways, creating a great maze, a labyrinth with twists and turns that have led humanity astray. Racism has entwined and entrapped us all. </span>
<span class="Underline"> Before we begin to define and dissect racism in our present day, it is essential to realize how deeply the roots of racism are embedded and intertwined in the life and history of the United States. From its earliest days, the seeds were sown and this evil plant has grown and flourished. It is clearly evident in the genocide of Native Americans, in the enslavement of Africans, and in the drafting of a constitution that reserved and guaranteed the precious fruits of freedom almost exclusively for European immigrants. </span>
<span class="Underline"> As the decades and centuries passed, the roots of racism remained strong, sending up fresh shoots each season. With chilling regularity, to this very day, new crops of racial violence and death are harvested in the streets and alleys of U.S. cities and in the dusty lanes of our rural countryside. Each time this undesirable harvest manifests itself, our nation’s leaders express their moral outrage and indignation. Then, nodding in agreement and pledging to prevent its recurrence, we forget that it ever happened, guaranteeing thereby that it will happen again and again, just as surely as seedtime turns to harvest. </span>
<span class="Underline"> With this pattern we passed through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and are now nearly through the twentieth century as well. Each time a particularly horrible phase of racial turmoil breaks out, we pretend at its passing that we have finally achieved racism’s defeat and death. And we pretend to be newly surprised when, months or years later, another and another and still another shoot of the evil plant emerges, promising a greater harvest than ever. </span>
<span class="Underline"> And so today, in the final decade of the twentieth century, we have become alarmed once again at the persistent evil of racism. The daily headlines assert its reality. The evening news assaults our consciences. New names and places become household words, and a new geography lesson is taught, from the wanton killings of African Americans in New York City’s Howard Beach and Bensonhurst, to the slaughter of Asians in Stockton, California; from senseless police brutality videotaped in Los Angeles, to violent campaigns against Native Americans in Wisconsin. A collage of names, places, facts, and figures reshapes our consciousness. Words and phrases like “regentrification” and “permanent underclass” become part of a new vocabulary, created to explain the current racial situation. The latest graphs, charts, and surveys demonstrate once again that little has changed for the better and much has taken a turn for the worse.  </span>

<span class="Underline">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Racism can be expressed with a violent Fist or a Velvet glove. Contemporary Racism has slipped on the velvet glove, invoking a devastating power of illusion by focusing merely on individual bigotry leaving untouched society’s racist systems and institutions. </span>**</span>
<span class="Underline">BARDNT Director of Crossroads, a non profit Organization 1991 </span>
<span class="Underline">Joseph-ordained minister; “Dismantling Racism: The Continuing Challenge </span>
<span class="Underline"> to White America; p.31-33 </span>
<span class="Underline">Racism can be expressed with an iron fist or with a velvet glove. At its coarsest and most unsophisticated, racism uses violence to enforce explicit laws to subjugate and control. Examples of such racism are the practice of slavery in the United States, the genocide of Jews in Nazi Germany, and the system of apartheid in South Africa. The evil of such blatant racism is obvious. </span>
<span class="Underline"> Racism also assumes sophisticated forms that depend less on brute force than on psychological methods that dissipate resistance. In such forms, racism may in fact create the illusion that it does not exist and therefore be far more difficult to detect and eliminate. Yet its power to oppress is no less than that of open and blatant racism. Iron fist or velvet glove, the results are the same. </span>
<span class="Underline"> For example, under a blatant form of racism, laws explicitly dictate where members of the subjugated race can live, the limits of their education, and the kind of work they must do. As a result, they are undereducated, underemployed, and ghettoized. However, under a more sophisticated system of racism, members of the same race have no explicit restrictions on where they live, no legal limitations on their education, nor on the kind of jobs they can have. Yet, they are still undereducated, underemployed, and ghettoized. It is, of course, emphatically denied that racism exists, but it obviously does exist because of the observable results. It is this sophisticated form that racism has taken in the United States, particularly during the past thirty years, and that we are seeking to describe e and define in this book. </span>
<span class="Underline"> If racism is prejudice plus power, then contemporary racism’s greatest power is this ability to create illusions and delude victims and perpetrators alike. It deludes the victims into believing that their rulers have only their best interests at heart. It deludes the dominant group into believing that it is not racist, that it is treating its victims well, and that there is no need to change. This power to create illusions is devastating, for it provides justification to the dominant group for its actions. A few more examples may be helpful here. </span>
<span class="Underline"> We have already seen the illusion that is created when racism is described simply in terms of personal prejudice and individual bigotry. As we discussed a few pages earlier, such an understanding of racism does not begin to explain racism’s incredible power. Yet, as long as this illusion is maintained, the energy for change will be focused only on improving individual attitudes and actions, and the actual power of racism which is lodged in society’s systems and institutions will be untouched. </span>
<span class="Underline"> Another illustration is the illusion that the victims of racism are responsible for their own plight. Racism’s victims are blamed for their problems in many ways. In our nation’s inner cities, people of color are blamed for the deteriorating condition of their housing, even though it began long before they came there and continued because of their forced overcrowding. They are blamed for their unemployment and underemployment, even though our economic system requires varying degrees of unemployment in order to maintain itself. Amazingly, this illusion is so successful that even the victims of racism often believe that their suffering is a product of their own failures. It is, therefore, a matter of great importance to them, as well as to us, to find ways of exposing the disguises and illusions that hide racism’s power. We will be able to comprehend the definition of racism as prejudice plus power only to the degree that we are able to see this power at work. </span>
<span class="Underline"> One of the reasons we are fooled by such illusions is that most of us do not participate directly in the enforcing of our prejudices. We do not actually feel as though we are exercising the power that results in victimizing people of color. We do participate, however, even when this power is exercised for us by others in ways that are to our benefit. </span>

<span class="Underline">OBSERVATION TWO: THE TRUTH </span>
<span class="Underline"> </span>
<span class="Underline">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Keep it real, Obama’s skin don’t change U.S. militarism. Iraq is still suffering and Obama does not even acknowledge or disavow the real motive for the U.S. military onslaught.  </span>**</span>
<span class="Underline"> </span>
<span class="Underline">WORLD WIDE COMMITTEE OF THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL 2k9 </span>
<span class="Underline">With Iraq Plan, Obama embraces US militarism-2 March 2009; www.wsws.org/articles/2009/persom2.shtml </span>
<span class="Underline">Nearly six years after the US conquest, Iraq still does not have running water, electricity, adequate sewage and other necessities of modern life; unemployment is estimated at 50% of adult population; there are some 4 million refugees in internal or external exile; and most Iraqi cities are divided into ethnic and religion-based neighborhoods separated by blast walls and checkpoints. Obama did not acknowledge, let alone disavow, the real motive for the US military onslaught-Iraq’s vast oil wealth and strategic position at the center of the Middle East. That silence only demonstrates that the new president shares the fundamental goal of his predecessor, to strengthen the grip of American imperialism over the Middle East and Central Asia, source of the bulk of the world’s oil and gas supplies. This fact was immediately recognized by the most fervent defenders of the Bush administration’s aggression, including Senator John McCain, Obama’s Republican opponent in the presidential election, other congressional Republicans, and the right-wing press. The Wall Street Journal, for instance editorialized in praise of Obama’s Camp Lejeune speech, calling it “Obama’s Bush vindication.” The Journal gushed: “Mr. Obama delivered a sober speech, offering a policy worthy of the Commander in Chief he now is.” It singled out “Mr. Obama’s implicit repudiation of his own positions as a candidate” by agreeing to keep a large U.S. military presence in Iraq, as many as 50,000 troops, after the nominal August 2010 withdrawal date, an action that seeks to maintain “the strategic advantage” of a U.S. puppet regime in the Persian Gulf. As  </span>
<span class="Underline"> </span>

<span class="Underline">Obama explained in his speech, a major reason for the redeployment of some U.S. forces out of Iraq is to have sufficient military power available to confront both “the challenge of refocusing on Afghanistan and Pakistan,” and “comprehensive American engagement across the region.” Millions of Americans voted for Obama, not because they believed that the war in Iraq was a distraction from the pursuit of broader imperialist goals, but because they regarded the unprovoked invasion and conquest of a sovereign nation as a crime, and opposed the predatory character of American foreign policy as a whole. Their voices have not the slightest impact on the formulation of policy in the Obama White House. As the events of last week demonstrate, it is the military-intelligence apparatus that calls the shots here. Obama did not make an independent decision as commander-in-chief, but rubber-stamped the course backed by one faction of the military establishment against the other. According to press accounts that followed Obama’s speech at Camp Lejeune, the 19-month “withdrawal” plan selected by Obama was the preferred option of Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Gates confirmed, in an interview Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press”, that the Iraq field commanders, headed by Gen. Raymond Odierno, preferred a 23-month schedule for withdrawal, while the Pentagon brass, concerned about the need for troops in Afghanistan and being stretched too thin to engage in other potential conflicts, opted for the shorter timeframe. Obama did not replace any of the Bush administration’s principal military decision makers when he took office. Instead, he retained Gates, Admiral Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Odierno and General David Petraeus, head of the U.S. Central Command and architect of the “surge” in Iraq. His embrace of militarism was demonstrated in the very fact that Obama chose to give the speech at a Marine base to an audience of uniformed troops, not in a civilian setting or through a televised White House address. The effect was to suggest that in the America of 2009, decisions on war and peace are of concern primarily to the military, with the American people relegated to the role of bystanders. The whole process demonstrates the erosion of American democracy. The American people cannot, through voting in election after election, effect any change in the foreign and military policy of the government. The war in Iraq goes on, and the war in Afghanistan is being escalated, regardless of popular sentiments. </span>

<span class="Underline">At a time of such great international turmoil economically and politically, it is increasingly important to identify and understand the social dynamics of crisis. A global social crisis has long preceded the economic crisis, and has only been exacerbated by it. The great shame of human civilization is the fact that over half of it lives in abysmal poverty. </span>
<span class="Underline">Poverty is not simply a matter of ‘bad luck’; it is a result of socio-political-economic factors that allow for very few people in the world to control so much wealth and so many resources, while so many are left with so little. The capitalist world system was built upon war, race, and empire. Malcolm X once declared, “You can’t have capitalism without racism.” </span>
<span class="Underline">The global political economy is a system that enriches the very few at the expense of the vast majority. This exploitation is organized through imperialism, war, and the social construction of race. It is vitally important to address the relationship between war, poverty and race in the context of the current global economic crisis. Western nations have plundered the rest of the world for centuries, and now the great empire is hitting home. What is done abroad comes home to roost </span>

<span class="Underline">Thus, the American Empire is in decline, spending itself into utter debt and is at the point of “imperial overreach.” As Eric Margolis wrote, “If Obama really were serious about restoring America’s economic health, he would demand military spending be slashed, quickly end the Iraq and Afghan wars and break up the nation’s giant Frankenbanks.” </span>
<span class="Underline">So, while people at home are on food stamps, welfare, living in tent cities, going to soup kitchens, getting by on debt, and losing their jobs; America sends forces abroad, conducting multiple wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, expanding the war into Pakistan, funding military operations in Yemen, Somalia, Uganda, building massive new military bases in Pakistan and Colombia and providing military aid to governments around the world. As the empire expands, the people become more impoverished. </span>
<span class="Underline">We cannot afford to ignore the relationship between war, poverty and race. The poor are made to fight the poor; both are often disproportionately people of colour. Yet war enriches the upper class, at least powerful sects of it in industry, the military, oil and banking. In a war economy, death is good for business, poverty is good for society, and power is good for politics. Western nations, particularly the United States, spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year to murder innocent people in far away impoverished nations, while the people at home suffer the disparities of poverty, class, gender and racial divides. We are told we fight to “spread freedom” and “democracy” round the world; yet, our freedoms and democracy erode and vanish at home. You cannot spread what you do not have.

<span class="Underline">http://www.eurasiareview.com/2010/05/financial-crisis-and-leviathan.html </span>
<span class="Underline">Even if policy makers decline to adopt World War II-type policies as remedies for the current recession, the immense magnitude of the present-day military-industrial complex certainly complicates all efforts to effect a recovery, by draining more than $1 trillion a year from the economy’s potential to produce private consumer and producer goods. The current long-running wars and military occupations in Afghanistan and Iraq, which will probably never end, although eventually they may be scaled back somewhat, only add to the economic drain on U.S. resources. So far, more than $1 trillion has been expended for these ill-fated adventures, and their total cost may eventually cumulate to several times this amount, not simply because they, like the U.S. military presence in Japan, Korea, and various European countries, will continue indefinitely, but also because of the need to care for a multitude of physically and psychologically disabled veterans over a span of several decades. </span>
<span class="Underline">Even if the wars in the Middle East were concluded overnight, however, a huge distortion would continue to affect the U.S. economy, owing to the normal operation of the military-industrial complex and the maintenance of the current armed forces and their far-flung empire of more than 800 large overseas bases. This military hypertrophy reflects not an attempt to pump up the macroeconomy, as military Keynesians would have it, but rather the devotion of U.S. ruling elites to the maintenance of global military hegemony, ultimately capped by the attainment of “full-spectrum dominance”—“control of land, sea, air and space and all attendant resources” over the entire world. </span>
<span class="Underline">Why do U.S. policy makers seek such god-like control of the planet? To the extent that the military leadership itself contributes to shaping national-security policies, this overleaping ambition merely expresses the latest phase of the military’s longstanding maniacal quest for total power—the undoubted ability to win any and all conceivable wars. Among the civilian leadership, the motives range more widely. An important impulse, though it is never mentioned frankly in polite company, is to maintain a foreign military presence configured so as to make the state of Israel as secure as possible. Another abiding interest is to control the worldwide distribution of petroleum, if necessary by bribing, intimidating, or taking military action against the governments of important oil-producing countries, especially in the Persian Gulf region. </span>
<span class="Underline">Related to this wholly unnecessary quest to control the world’s oil-distribution channels—after all, it does not serve the interests of the oil producers to withhold their product from the world market—is the ambition to play the Great Game by throwing up barriers to the expanding influence of China and India and the residual potential of Russia in southwest Asia, especially in the Caspian Sea region, where vast stores of oil and gas remain to be tapped and brought to market. For more than half a century, U.S. leaders have been obsessed with projecting their country’s power into petro-military adventures of all sorts. However senseless this fixation might seem in a purely economic perspective, we can scarcely deny that the coziest crony capitalists in the oil and related industries have reaped a great deal of income along the way, and owing to their extraordinary political clout, they have every expectation of continuing to reap such income in the future, with the vital assistance of U.S. diplomats and armed forces to grease the skids. </span>
<span class="Underline">Although the military-industrial-congressional complex is one of the most powerful interest groups in U.S. politics, and we may certainly expect it to struggle forcefully to retain or even to increase the flow of wealth placed at its disposal, the U.S. government’s increasingly precarious financial condition may compel even this powerful coalition to settle for a smaller space at the trough, especially if stagflation sets in as the U.S. economy’s normal condition during the next decade (as I suspect it will). If America’s economic future turns out to be even worse than I now foresee—for example, with rapid inflation, price and capital controls, and a flight from the dollar—then even greater retrenchment of the U.S. military presence abroad will be unavoidable. Such economic ruin would be a heavy price to pay for reining in America’s global hegemony, but, nevertheless, the military retrenchment itself would be a consequence that most of the world’s people would celebrate. </span>

<span class="Underline">Today, the global power hierarchy has shifted in such a way, that the vast majority of the Earth's population exists in poverty and desolation, while, according to world bank statistics, 20% of humans account for 75% of the worlds monetary wealth. The differences in global rich and poor have become so big that, nearly 12% of the world suffer from undernourishment, while, according to the world bank, the spending priorities amongst the richest nations consist of Alcoholic drinks, Cigarettes, Perfumes, and Cosmetics. Even Ice cream, and pet-foods are of a higher priority than more globally needed services. To be more specific, in 1998, Europeans spent 11 billion on ice cream, and 17 billion on pet food. It's been estimated that over 1 billion men women and children, around 18% of the earth don't have access to clean drinking water. Most of which are located in Asia, Africa, and South America. The distance between people starving, and wealthy has never been so well defined. </span>
<span class="Underline">Since the establishment of Euro-Centric global domination, any rising nations, which even remotely threatened to shift the dynamics of the world, back to their pre-colonial positions have been dealt with swiftly, and particularly harshly if the nations in action were non white. The two world wars saw Germany, and Eastern Europe destroyed and rebuilt by programs like the Truman and Marshal plans. The plans worked to repair Europe after the wars, and set them up so well economically, that they would no longer have to worry about revolutions that could potentially aid in any global switch of power. Help, through these plans was offered to every European nation that suffered during the war, including the USSR. Although many North African, and Asian countries were severely damaged, no non-white nations were offered help. This helped to set the European world far ahead of any others, and gave them a head start in the race to the globalized world, in which we find ourselves today. Even looking past the world wars, and subsequent economic plans, history tells us that any rising non-white nation that was seen as a threat to the European power structure was militarily dealt with. A few examples are Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Nicaragua, Grenada, and Angola. The average historian or sociologist would say all of the above were proxy wars aimed at containing the USSR(another white entity vying for power) however all of these nations were non-white and suffered hundreds of thousands, to millions of casualties. Also, while the war of words waged on between the West and the eastern Soviet bloc, many European nations moved to social democracy without a drop of bloodshed. On the other hands, any countries that even attempted similar changes were quickly stopped. </span>
<span class="Underline">Those actions remain to this day. Venezuela, a country without the power to do much to anyone is at the end of American threats on a regular basis. The same goes for Cuba, while extremely socialistic programs take place in the world capital White Supremacy – the United States. While Israel beefs up its military, and, according to the Federation of American Scientists, hold possibly hundreds of nuclear devices, Iraq, Iran and North Korea suffer sanctions for attempting the same. Even this month (fall 2009), the United States sees China strengthening its military, and are weighing its options and planning ways to pit the PRC's neighbors against her. What could possibly the reason for this global hypocrisy? History shows us that it's the maintenance of Global European domination, for without it, possibly in the minds of Europeans, the world would revert to its natural state, which existed before Europe dominated.

<span class="Underline"> After eight years of the Bush-Cheney regime, the United States confronts these questions in light of a deep and profound crisis of legitimacy. The current crisis is intimately shaped by the demands of 21st century American imperialism and is reflected in the (un)spoken language of white supremacy. </span>
<span class="Underline"> The financial crisis engulfing the global capitalist system has exposed the hollow core of the American Dream.

While racial politics have always been a prized weapon in the arsenal of both political parties, what makes the 2008 incarnation of this political ritual unique is that the appeals to white supremacy-not the amorphous language of “race” to which mainstream media commentators refer-while recognized and justly denounced in its most extreme expression, still resonates within the political landscape precisely because of the crisis of capitalism and the military exploits of the American Empire. </span>
<span class="Underline"> In times of economic crisis and national malaise, the old political standby of subtle and not so subtle appeals to white supremacy becomes logical. Why? Because so much of what constitutes the American nationalist imaginary joins all that is felt to be familiar, normal, secure, and safe with the attributes, disposition, and outlook of the quintessential white person. And in moments of national anxiety and economic insecurity politicians must reassure the American people that all is right (and white) with America. </span>
<span class="Underline"> Thus, it should not come as a surprise that there has been a lack of critical commentary on the white supremacist dimensions lurking just beneath the surface of what is taken to be a legitimate political appeal to the middle class as represented in the language and image of “Joe Six-Pack” and “Joe the Plumber.” So as the story goes, the dreaded “outsiders” of the White Republic are produced and reproduced-immigrants, terrorists, socialists, Muslims, black nationalists, and the list goes on-in an effort to make sure that all that is solid for the United States of America does not melt into air. </span>
<span class="Underline"> On November 5, 2008, Americans will wake up to a new day. And as with all new days there will be work left over from the previous day to do. But for the United States of America, the work that is left over is from the beginning and has steadily increased over the course of centuries. </span>
<span class="Underline"> And, once again, we will begin the long arduous process of making a nation. Perhaps, just perhaps, we will eschew the short sighted vision of power and might and just try to do what is just and right, both in America and throughout the world. </span>

<span class="Underline">Often times I'm hit with the argument that racism is not equal to White Supremacy, and that all </span>
<span class="Underline">people can practice and proliferate racism. This ideology that we label as racism is much like any other </span>
<span class="Underline">word with the suffix of 'ism'. The use of this suffix is there to denote a strict system of theories or doctrines that direct a people, society, class or group to a specific objective. To understand how racism is a global system, one would have to break down its use, and view its application through lenses as unbiased as possible. At the very least, lenses not corrupted by the need to maintain the social structure of white supremacy(racism). Keeping in line with a long tradition of foreign cultural degradation, and oppression, in the late 1800's the collective governmental and scholarly institutions of Europe decreed that all other peoples of the Earth were subhuman, and were destined to be controlled, and indeed dominated by Europeans. No more were there calls of infidelity, and barbarism. The new call was subhuman, savage and inadequately equipped for self determination. This new manifestation of white supremacy(racism) was aimed destroying, and rebuilding many nations of Africa, and South East Asia, and to solidify the western stranglehold on North and South America. In what's known as the scramble for Africa, France, Britain, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Germs and Portugal took maps of the continent of Africa and divvied it up amongst themselves. Without the consent of one African leader, the future of the continent was written. It went as far as to 'grant' European nations control of any land they could conquer! The scramble was officially known as the “Berlin Conference”. This meeting between the most powerful monarchs was held with the aim of removing two walls that blocked the forward momentum of creating the global economical structure that the Europeans so badly wanted to create. According to the text book “History of Africa” by Kevin Shillington, the first item on the agenda was legitimizing King Leopold's personal fiefdom of the Congo. “In return,” as Shillington put it, “the Belgian king agreed to allow European traders and missionaries free access to the area.” The next issue effectively stated that any nation that could militarily dominate the land they claimed, would be legally entitled to it. Through this edict, Europeans moved to use Africa as their battleground. It functioned to house the battles that would determine the world's next super power. The end result of these conferences was an end to almost all the kingdoms(with the exception of Ethiopia) and the creation of the 53 states that compromise of the continent today. None of which, ever being able to completely revert to their respective pre-colonial environment The history of European domination, and the road to globalization was an extremely long and rough one. Much of the non-European world is still suffering from it, and comparatively the entire European world had benefited from it. Just imagine, the continent of Europe went from slavery, through serfdom, to the economic power that it is today.  </span>

<span class="Underline">As the ideas of racial equality produced in and through the Civil Rights Movement gradually acquired hegemony in the nation, they congealed into firm notions of what counted as victories over racial subjugation, and in the process produced their own meanings of racism. As important as these victories have proved to be, the inflexibility of the resulting definitions of racism have created, both in legal and popular discourses, enduring deceptions regarding the nature of racism. Definitions of racism informed by particular historical conditions became trans- or ahistorical ways of conceptualizing racial discrimination and subjugation. The persistence of these meanings beyond the particular historical conditions that produced them has hampered the evolution of a new vocabulary and new discourse that might allow us to identify new modes of racism in what is known as the post-Civil Rights Era. </span>
<span class="Underline">That the International Human Rights Community has recognized some of these new modes of racism was indicated in the title of the 2001 Durban, South Africa World Conference Against Racism, Racist Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerances. Regrettably, media coverage of the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington, which occurred at the end of the conference, resulted in sparse media attention to the aftermath of the World Conference. More public conversations about the conference might have helped to popularize more capacious meanings of racism. Within the United States, scholars and activists have pointed out the perils of basing theories of racism, as well as antiracist practices, on the black-white paradigm that informed the quest for civil rights and, further, of assuming that the civil rights paradigm is foundational to the very meaning of antiracism. Neither paradigm can account, for example, for the role colonization and genocide against indigenous people played in shaping U.S. racism. The historical genocide against indigenous people relies precisely on invisibility – on an obstinate refusal to recognize the very existence of native North Americans, or a recognition or misrecognition that only acknowledges them as impediments to the transformation of the landscape – impediments to be destroyed or assimilated.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Differently racialized populations in the U.S. – First Nations, Mexican, Asian and more recently people of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent –have been targets of different modes of racial subjugation. Islamaphobia draws on and complicates what we know as racism. Moreover, racism, as it affects people of African descent, is today more deeply inflected by class, gender, and sexuality than we may have recognized it to be at the middle of the twentieth century. </span>

<span class="Underline">Because racism is viewed as an anachronistic vestige of the past, we fail to grasp the extent to which the long memory of institutions – especially those that constitute the intimately connected circuit of education and incarceration –continue to permit race to determine who has access to education and who has access to incarceration. While laws have had the effect of privatizing racist attitudes and eliminating the explicitly racist practices of institutions, these laws are unable to apprehend the deep structural life of racism and therefore allow it to continue to thrive. </span>
<span class="Underline">This invisible work of racism not only influences the life chances of millions of people, it helps to nourish a psychic reservoir of racism that often erupts through the utterances and actions of individuals, as in the cases previously mentioned. The frequent retort made by such individuals who are caught in the act is: “I’m not a racist. I don’t even know where that came from” can only be answered if we are able to recognize this deep structural life of racism. </span>

<span class="Underline">There is another direction, at once more practical, moral, and hopeful which can help us get out of this mess. We must confront together the fundamental problems of the U.S. and global economies that have given rise to so much injustice, suffering and environmental devastation. We must fundamentally reevaluate programs inspired by fear and guilt that make White society put combinations of money and police and prisons into inner cities, hoping that somehow the basic problems will go away. Instead, we must address the needs of particular communities and areas in the context of the larger community in the country and the world. This will help us address the root causes of the persistence of racism, violence, and misery which lie in the inequities of the larger global social and economic system.  </span>
<span class="Underline">There is ample precedent for this great common enterprise. People of all ethnic backgrounds have struggled shoulder-to-shoulder in this country and throughout the world for justice, decency and a modicum of well-being for everyone. In the nineteenth century, when there were signs in New York City that proclaimed "Irish and dogs not allowed," Blacks and Irish Americans struggled side-by-side in unions for better wages and working conditions, until racism divided them late in the nineteenth century. Blacks and Whites fought for civil rights, and some died together in that struggle, far above the color barriers that had been set up for them. Whites did not hesitate to follow Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., as a leader of all the people of this country, and not only of African-Americans. Millions of Blacks, Whites, soldiers, pacifists, draft resisters and other civilians struggled together to end the Viet Nam war.  </span>
<span class="Underline">We have common problems enough. The lack of good schools, safe neighborhoods, and health insurance affects Blacks disproportionately, but it affects everyone. So does the shortage of well-paid jobs. The degradation of the environment may affect communities of color disproportionately, but few breathe truly clean air everyday, or are confident that it will be better for their children. While toxic dumps are located disproportionately in rural areas and in communities of color, few can escape the ill-effects of toxic chemicals in our midst. Even the lack of leadership in Washington, corrupted by military and corporate machinery that greases elections with copious sums of money, has become a pressing common problem.  </span>
<span class="Underline">There is a tradition of struggle at the grassroots that can provide the basis for success. The examples above show that it has already done so in many areas. Just in the recent past that tradition has helped to shut down nuclear weapons production in this country. It has slowed the deadly international trade in toxic wastes. It has spawned a movement for safe energy and sane lifestyles. In the Sanctuary movement, of the 1980s, many Americans, including Whites, provided shelter to Central Americans fleeing war and violence, thereby opposing the U.S. government at considerable risk and cost to themselves. And millions of Americans, Black and White, worked together to assist the struggle of the people of South Africa against apartheid, which is probably the real cause of President de Klerk's peevish comments about the Rodney King case.  </span>
<span class="Underline">A common struggle, moved by the value that everyone has a right to a decent and peaceful life, good government and a healthy environment, can provide the common bonds to enable us to overcome racism in this country, and exploitation around the world.  </span>

<span class="Underline">The struggle against racism will be long, difficult, without intermission, without remission, probably never achieved, yet for this very reason, it is a struggle to be undertaken without surcease and without concessions. One cannot be indulgent toward racism. One cannot even let the monster in the house, especially not in a mask. To give it merely a foothold means to augment the bestial part in us and in other people which is to diminish what is human. To accept the racist universe to the slightest degree is to endorse fear, injustice, and violence. It is to accept the persistence of the dark history in which we still largely live. It is to agree that the outsider will always be a possible victim (and which [person] man is not [themself] himself an outsider relative to someone else?). Racism illustrates in sum, the inevitable negativity of the condition of the dominated; that is it illuminates in a certain sense the entire human condition. The anti-racist struggle, difficult though it is, and always in question, is nevertheless one of the prologues to the ultimate passage from animality to humanity. In that sense, we cannot fail to rise to the racist challenge. However, it remains true that one’s moral conduct only emerges from a choice: one has to want it. It is a choice among other choices, and always debatable in its foundations and its consequences. Let us say, broadly speaking, that the choice to conduct oneself morally is the condition for the establishment of a human order for which racism is the very negation. This is almost a redundancy. One cannot found a moral order, let alone a legislative order, on racism because racism signifies the exclusion of the other and his or her subjection to violence and domination. From an ethical point of view, if one can deploy a little religious language, racism is “the truly capital sin.”fn22 It is not an accident that almost all of humanity’s spiritual traditions counsel respect for the weak, for orphans, widows, or strangers. It is not just a question of theoretical counsel respect for the weak, for orphans, widows or strangers. It is not just a question of theoretical morality and disinterested commandments. Such unanimity in the safeguarding of the other suggests the real utility  </span>
<span class="Underline">of such sentiments. All things considered, we have an interest in banishing injustice, because injustice engenders violence and death. Of course, this is debatable. There are those who think that if one is strong enough, the assault on and oppression of others is permissible. But no one is ever sure of remaining the strongest. One day, perhaps, the roles will be reversed. All unjust society contains within itself the seeds of its own death. It is probably smarter to treat others with respect so that they treat you with respect. “Recall,” says the bible, “that you were once a stranger in Egypt,” which means both that you ought to respect the stranger because you were a stranger yourself and that you risk becoming once again someday. It is an ethical and a practical appeal – indeed, it is a contract, however implicit it might be. In short, the refusal of racism is the condition for all theoretical and practical morality. Because, in the end, the ethical choice commands the political choice. A just society must be a society accepted by all. If this contractual principle is not accepted, then only conflict, violence, and destruction will be our lot. If it is accepted, we can hope someday to live in peace. True, it is a wager, but the stakes are irresistible. </span>

<span class="Underline">To study racism is to study walls. We have looked at barriers and fences, restraints and limitations, ghettos and prisons. The prison of racism confines us all, people of color and white people alike. It shackles the victimizer as well as the victim. The walls forcibly keep people of color and white people separate from each other; in our separate prisons we are all prevented from achieving the human potential that God intends for us. The limitations imposed on people of color by poverty, subservience, and powerlessness are cruel, inhuman, and unjust; the effects of uncontrolled power, privilege, and greed, which are the marks of our white prison, will inevitably destroy us as well. </span>
<span class="Underline"> But we have also seen that the walls of racism can be dismantled. We are not condemned to an inexorable fate, but are offered the vision and the possibility of freedom.

<span class="Underline">Thirty-six years ago, on April 3, 1967, civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered a powerful speech against the U.S. war in Vietnam at Riverside Church in New York City.  </span>
<span class="Underline">King raised the inseparable links between racist injustice at home and U.S. military escalation against the Vietnamese.  </span>
<span class="Underline">He said, The greatest purveyor of violence in the world today—my own government.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Today, millions upon millions of people around the world are expressing a similar view in words and actions as the U.S. leads a brutal aggression against the people of Iraq and intensifies the violation of their sovereignty.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Inside the U.S., anti-war activities are being organized by African Americans and other activists of color in Harlem, Baltimore and elsewhere to coincide with the 35th anniversary of King's assassination on April 4. These events will include King's anti-war stance, which many believe led to his government-sponsored assassination.  </span>
<span class="Underline">These protests reflect the fact that the overwhelming majority of Black people across the United States are against this war.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Sixty-four percent of African Americans voiced opposition to the war in one sample poll conducted by the New York Times on March 26. A New York City poll cited 78 percent against the war. Some stated that they felt a strong sense of solidarity with the Iraqi people because, like Black people here, the Iraqis are victims of a racist war by the U.S. government.  </span>
<span class="Underline">There are many oppressed people in the United States who view the police as unwanted armed occupiers in their communities, similar to the armed occupation by the U.S. and British imperialist military in Iraq.  </span>
<span class="Underline">And a number of those polled noted that the Bush administration blatantly hijacked the 2000 elections from African Americans and other working-class voters in Florida .  </span>
<span class="Underline">Who's on front line of imperialist wars?  </span>
<span class="Underline">Fighting the racist character of the U.S. military has always been a component of the struggle for social equality for African Americans.  </span>
<span class="Underline">During World War I, many Black soldiers joined the military and faced racism in every aspect of military life.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Black labor leader A. Philip Randolph threatened a march by hundreds of thousands of Black workers in 1941 against racism in the defense industries and the military. This threat forced President Franklin Roosevelt to issue an executive order reaffirming the desegregation of these institutions on the eve of the U.S. entering World War II.  </span>
<span class="Underline">On July 26, 1948, President Harry Truman issued an executive order calling for the full integration of the U.S. military. Once the Korean War broke out in 1950, Black soldiers constituted 13 percent of the U.S. military. Forty percent of them were placed in combat units—meaning they faced a significantly disproportionate casualty rate.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Like Black soldiers in World War I and II, soldiers involved in the Korean War consciously hoped that by proving to be some of the best fighters in the military, they would be seen as equal in the eyes of whites after the war and that this would result in either the reduction or eradication of racism. This proved to be a pipe dream.  </span>
<span class="Underline">During the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s, Black people were drafted into the military and were once again placed in combat units in disproportionately high numbers.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Between 1961 and 1965, Black soldiers accounted for one out of every five combat-related deaths in Vietnam. In 1965 alone, Black soldiers accounted for one of every four combat-related deaths. The overall U.S. Black population was about 13 percent during this period.  </span>
<span class="Underline">The emerging anti-Vietnam War movement and national liberation movements encouraged young people—Black and white—to avoid the draft by fleeing to Canada and elsewhere.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Although the leadership of the anti-war movement was predominantly white and middle-class, the anti-war views of Dr. King and former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali had a great impact, especially on the campuses.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Many soldiers became anti-war while in Vietnam. Some even carried out acts called fragging. This means they refused orders and turned their guns on their superior officers, instead of the Vietnam ese. The spread of fragging played a strategic role in the defeat of the U.S. military in Southeast Asia.  </span>
<span class="Underline">In the early days of the new U.S. war against Iraq, fragging has already appeared. Sgt. Asan Akbar, a young Black Muslim, is accused of shooting at the top officers of the 101st Airborne and throwing grenades into their command center.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Economic draft a means to escape poverty  </span>
<span class="Underline">Today, there are an estimated 1.4 million U.S. military personnel. No matter what their nationality, the overwhelming majority come from the working class.  </span>
<span class="Underline">The soaring cost of tuition means fewer families can afford to send these youths to college. So many see the military as a means to get a job skill, education and other benefits. Hardly any youths from families of great wealth and privilege join the ranks of the military.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Black people make up close to 13 percent of the overall U.S. population in 2003, but comprise 22 percent of the enlisted personnel. Half the enlisted women in the Army are Black.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Today a large number of Black women who join the military are working-class single mothers like Shoshana Johnson, the Army cook who is reportedly a prisoner of war in Iraq.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Dr. King's words still ring true today. The pursuit of this widened war has narrowed domestic welfare programs, making the poor, white and Negro, bear the heaviest burdens both at the front and at home, he stated in a Feb. 25, 1967, speech entitled The Casualties of the War in Vietnam.  </span>
<span class="Underline">He continued, While the anti-poverty program is cautiously initiated, zealously supervised and evaluated for immediate results, billions are liberally expended for this ill-considered war. The recently revealed mis-estimate of the war budget amounts to ten billions of dollars for a single year.  </span>
<span class="Underline">The security we profess to seek in foreign adventures we will lose in our decaying cities. The bombs in Vietnam explode at home: they destroy the hopes and possibilities for a decent America. ... Poverty, urban problems and social progress generally are ignored when the guns of war become a national obsession.  </span>
<span class="Underline">The disproportionate numbers of Black and other oppressed peoples in the ranks of today's Pentagon military are not a sign that they wanted to fight wars abroad.  </span>
<span class="Underline">It is economic factors that force many people of color to join the armed forces.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Three million jobs have disappeared so far during the Bush regime. There was the destruction of welfare under the Clinton regime, along with the erosion of health care and other social programs.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Two million people are in U.S. prisons, a hugely disproportionate number of them Black and Latino, due to drug-related convictions.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Half of African American children are still born into poverty.  </span>
<span class="Underline">Organizing against racist wars of capitalist expansion abroad and for money for jobs at home are important messages that must reach oppressed and working-class youths—inside and outside the military.  </span>
