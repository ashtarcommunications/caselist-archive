====**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Chow K</span>**==== 
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The affirmative takes the position of the Maoist—their veneration of the oppressed constructs an ideal subaltern with whom they can engage in parasitic solidarity—this is virulent form of colonialism which turns the academy into a site for the consumption of Otherness for personal gain</span>
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt" style="background-color: #ffffff;">Chow</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, Professor Comparative Lit at Brown, </span><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt" style="background-color: #ffffff;">’93</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> (Rey, “Writing Diaspora” p 10-13)</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background-color: #ffffff;">The Orientalist has …had our consciousnesses "raised."</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">This utilization of the “other” as a site for knowledge-gathering is inseparable from the militaristic logic which views everything in terms of its usefulness to the US – the affirmative’s assistance can only show us a target to be destroyed by US bombs—nuclear genocide is inevitable in the world of the affirmative.</span>
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt" style="background-color: #ffffff;">Chow</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, Professor Comparative Lit at Brown, ‘</span><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt" style="background-color: #ffffff;">6</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> (Rey, “The Age of the World Target” p 40-42)</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">You should reject the affirmative because of their failure to question the indebtedness of their intellectual project to institutions mired in the very privilege they sanctimoniously criticize—your obligation as an intellectual is to struggle against becoming the object and instrument of power</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 6pt;">While the struggle for hegemony remains …</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">in the academic sense?</span>

====**Pastoralism K**==== 
Framework and link – adaptive resilience posits the state as a pastoral savior – assumptions of irreversible climate change preclude necessary measures
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Methmann</span>, Researcher Institute of PolSci at U of Hamburg, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and Rothe</span>, PhD Candidate at U of Hamburg, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">’12</span> (Chris and Delf, August “Politics for the day after tomorrow: The logic of apocalypse in global climate politics” Security Dialogue, Vol 43 No 4, p 323-344, SagePub)
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Adaptation: Making people fit for survival in the apocalypse …. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Radical contingency replaces planning as the logic of government.</span>

Impact – pastoral responsibility over apocalyptic events allows unending violence
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Boone</span>, Professor Gender Studies Wisconsin-Madison, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2K</span> (Joseph Allen, “Queer Frontiers: Millenial Geographies, Genders, Go West and Generations” p 40-41)
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Perhaps. But </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">to claim</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">… civic initiative that can</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> scarcely </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">be done without</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.</span>

Alternative – reject the aff’s solution-oriented approach in favor of a broader epistemic questioning about our relationship to knowledge and earth
Alarmism about nuclear war in the 80’s is indicative of our argument -- crisis framing __prevented__ effective mobilization to change the nuclear system and only allowed short term solutions without changing the __structure__ of the nuclear state. __Long term social change__ is essential to eliminate the systems of thought that produced these ‘environmental crises’. They only __prevent us from adapting__.

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">In these countries </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">in the early 1980s, … even more devastating nuclear future.</span>

====**Arctic Nationalism K**==== 
The affirmative’s sensationalization of Arctic conflict reinforces nationalism

It is certainly important to oppose such evolutionary doctrines by all intellectually credible means.
AND
Kymlicka, Iris Young, William Connolly, and Jurgen Habermas all envision.

The role of the ballot is to investigate methodology before policy recommendations – Alternative is to reject nationalism to create an accurate research agenda that advances shared human interest

Methodological nationalism takes the following premises for granted: it equates societies with nation-
AND
if the social sciences want to avoid becoming a museum of antiquated ideas.

====**Transportation Planning K**==== 
Transportation planning is not neutral – the affirmative sacrifices minority populations and perpetuates inequality
Bullard 4 – Professor of Sociology @ Clark
Robert D. Bullard, Professor of Sociology and Director of Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, Ph.D. in Sociology, "Highway Robbery," pr. 3
Transportation systems do not spring up out of thin air. They are planned-
AND
economically depressed and deteriorating central cities and that transportation apartheid has been created.
The role of the ballot is to reject the affirmative~’s violation of social justice
Nieutvenhuis 10 – Professor of Management and Policy Studies
Jan, "Social Justice in Education Today, Acta Academica, 43.1
Accept the geo-historical context of the struggle as something that must be reconciled
AND
to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.
Voting negative is an act of criticism – it promotes reflection on transportation inequality and opens the black-box of transportation planning
Willson 1- Professor of Department of Urban and Regional Planning @ California State Polytechnic University
Richard, "Assessing communicative rationality as a transportation planning paradigm," Transportation, http://www.uvm.edu/~~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf
Purpose of planning. The purpose of transportation planning continues to be to develop strategies
AND
because developing the planning process is an explicit part of the planning activity.
