=<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Contention 1 — Militarization</span>= 

**In a globalized world, the way we answer questions effects and shapes the way we think about politics in general. Space is both a blank canvas and a mirror—how we theorize space can aid or abet our thinking about sovereignty, cooperation, and violence**
**Stuart 2009** [Jill, <span style="color: black;">Dr . Jill Stuart is LSE Fellow in Global Politics in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics and Political Science</span>, “Unbundling Sovereignty, Territory, and the State in Outer Space”, from //Securing Outer Space,// edited by Bormann and Sheehan]

**<span class="Underline">Sadly, the radical potential to think differently about space and sovereignty has been hijacked by militarization. This is not just a militarization of OUTER space—it is also a militarization of our INNER space. Status quo politics and rhetoric is an attempt to militarize both space and the American psyche in order to maintain imperial dominance.</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 11pt;">This militarized mindset is the cause of genocidal violence—a politics based in bounded communities cannot result in anything save atrocities—it can only solve wars between like-minded people</span>**
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Archibugi 8 (2008, Daniele, “The Global Commonwealth of Citizens: Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy” Princeton University Press, Chapter 2 p. 41-43 )</span>

<span class="Underline">**And, absent a mindset shift towards peace and empathy, a mentality of pure war will overcome us, negating value to life and making extinction inevitable**</span>

**<span class="Debate-CardTagandCite-F6Char">And, moreover, this psychological emphasis on the nation and the individual community first can no longer solve problems in the world. Every existential threat humanity faces—war, terrorism, proliferation, population growth and total environmental collapse—can only be dealt with via true international cooperation. The psyche of the status quo makes all of these impacts inevitable</span>**

=<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Plan</span>= 

**The United States Federal government should commit all available resources to developing a network of cooperative, internationally accessible environmental monitoring satellites. We’ll clarify.**

=<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Contention Two—Cosmopolitanism</span>= 

**Cooperative science projects like the plan make global cosmopolitanism an international necessity—the plan causes a shift in our collective mentalities.**

**Earth Observation satellites key to US environmental leadership- near-term support key to long-term credibility**

**Concentrating on ENVIRONMENTAL problems in space encourages peaceful, cooperative action as opposed to militarization**

**Weaponisation is NOT inevitable, but US action is key—we need to take the first step towards international institutionalism**

**And, now is key—we are at a tipping point. Either you vote aff to endorse a critical cosmopolitanism or you cede control of outer space to the neo-cons.**

=<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Contention Three—Reclaiming Psychological Space</span>= 

**Academic methodology has been hijacked to serve the nation state- historical memory and statistics are twisted to make hegemony into the ultimate truth- rejecting methodological nationalism creates a new research agenda that is critical to understand the world and advance cosmopolitanism.**
**Beck and Sznaider, 2006** [Ulrich and Natan,. Professor of sociology at Munich's Ludwig-Maximilian University and the London School of Economics; and professor of sociology at the Academic College of Tel-Aviv-Yaffo, Israel. “Unpacking cosmopolitanism for the social sciences: a research agenda,” The British Journal of Sociology 57.1, Wiley InterSciences.]

**This means we need to mix our focus between critical theory and problem-solving --- Only this focus on method generates social learning that avoids error replication and changes international politics.**
**Widmaier, 2004** [Wesley W.. Department of Political Science, St. Joseph’s University. “Theory as a Factor and the Theorist as an Actor: The ‘‘Pragmatist Constructivist’’ Lessons of John Dewey and John Kenneth Galbraith,” International Studies Review 6.3,]

**Space is an opportunity—how we understand space politics can change the way we view domestic politics, and vice versa. Cooperative Space exploration isn’t enough—it needs to be combined with a methodological emphasis on terrestrial cosmopolitanism**
