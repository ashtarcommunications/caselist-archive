The resolution should limit the perameter of the discussion

==T-Substantial== 
===1NC=== 

**“Substantial investment” must be an increase of at least 20%**
**Traficant 89** (“H.R.2489 -- Foreign Subsidiary Tax Equity Act (Introduced in House - IH)”, 5-24, http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c101:H.R.2489.IH:)

SEC. 2. INCOME FROM RUNAWAY PLANTS OR FROM MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS LOCATED IN A AND (B)(ii)) on the first day of such period.'

**That means the plan must spend 9 billion dollars**
**¾ of 60 billion = 45; 20% of that = 9 billion**
**CBO 8** (Congressional Budgeting Office, “Issues and Options in Infrastructure Investment”, May, http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/91xx/doc9135/05-16-infrastructure.pdf)

Federal spending on infrastructure is dominated by transportation, which accounted for nearly three- AND of the $170 billion spent on infrastructure by state and local governments.

**Anything less is “minor remodeling”, not “investment”**
**Delisle 10** (Deborah S., Superintendent of Public Instruction – Ohio Department of Education, “Weekly Update”, EdConnection, 10-4, http://www.ercoinc.org/updates/October10.html)

Certification required for improvements with ARRA Funds (SFSF and IDEA) Section 1511 of AND include building construction, structural alterations to buildings, building maintenance or repairs.

**That’s a voting issue**
**a) Limits – allowing small modifications to existing policy creates an unsustainable negative research burden that eviscerates in depth education – that outweighs because breadth is inevitable over the course of the year**

**b) Predictability – holding the line on substantial is critical**
**Devinsky 2** (Paul, “Is Claim "Substantially" Definite? Ask Person of Skill in the Art”, IP Update, 5(11), November, http://www.mwe.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/publications.nldetail/object_id/c2c73bdb-9b1a-42bf-a2b7-075812dc0e2d.cfm)

In reversing a summary judgment of invalidity, the U.S. Court of AND persons experienced in this field of mechanics, upon reading the patent documents."

**c) Ground – they can avoid of our spending, politics disads and tradeoff disads by saying the plan is too small to be perceived**


==T-Vehicles== 
===1NC=== 

**“Transportation infrastructure” is transport networks, not vehicles**
**GC 12** (Global Cargo & Commodities Limited, “Haulage & Transport”, http://www.globalcargogh.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=44&Itemid=132)
The field of transport has several aspects; loosely they can be divided into a AND of tolls or gasoline taxes) may be considered part of the operations.

**Excludes modification**
**Trimbath, PhD in Economics, 11** (Susanne, US Chamber.com [website of the US Chamber of Commerce], former Senior Research Economist in the Capital Market Studies at the Milken Institute, Senior Advisor on corporate community investment for the Business Civic Leadership Center of the US Chamber of Commerce, PhD in economics from NYU, 2011, “Transportation Infrastructure: paving the way,” http://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/issues/infrastructure/files/2009TPI_Update_Economics_White_Paper_110712.pdf, alp)

The strategy applied by the US Chamber of Commerce for the infrastructure performance index project AND • Highways • Airports • Railways • Waterways (Ports) • Intermodal Links

**Voting issue ---**
**Limits --- there are hundreds of types of existing vehicles and nearly infinite new innovations possible --- expanding beyond networks makes Neg preparation impossible and undermines clash and depth of discussion**

**Ground --- vehicles change the link direction to politics, rob core trade-off DAs, and have multiple uses so they artificially inflate advantage ground --- core ground is key to fairness**

==T-Communication== 
===1NC=== 

**ITs is communication infrastructure, not transportation**
**IEDC 12** (International Economic Development Council, “Economic Development Reference Guide”, http://www.iedconline.org/?p=Guide_Infrastructure)

Infrastructure Infrastructure encompasses existing transportation, communication and utility networks. Rebuilding the physical infrastructure AND Satellite communications and microwave antenna Mobile phone networks Local area networks (LAN)

**Only targeting “hard”, physical objects is topical --- the Aff’s indirect approach unlimits**
**Cantarelli 10** (Chantal C., Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management – Delft University of Technology, et al., “Cost Overruns in Large-scale Transportation Infrastructure Projects: Explanations and Their Theoretical Embeddedness”, European Journal of Transport and Infrastructure Research, 10(1), March, p. 7)

We define transportation infrastructure projects as follows: ‘Transport infrastructures include roads, rail AND defined in this paper by a minimum cost level of 500 million euros.

**Voting issue --- The expand the topic by including different catagories of infrastructure – explodes the lit base and makes negative research impossible destroying clash and decision making skills**

==T-Underlying Structures== 
===1NC=== 

**A. Interpretation - Transportation infrastructure must be the underlying structures like building a road not accessories to a road like new road signs.**
**Trimbath, PhD in Economics, 11** (Susanne, US Chamber.com [website of the US Chamber of Commerce], former Senior Research Economist in the Capital Market Studies at the Milken Institute, Senior Advisor on corporate community investment for the Business Civic Leadership Center of the US Chamber of Commerce, PhD in economics from NYU, 2011, “Transportation Infrastructure: paving the way,” http://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/issues/infrastructure/files/2009TPI_Update_Economics_White_Paper_110712.pdf, alp)

The strategy applied by the US Chamber of Commerce for the infrastructure performance index project AND • Highways • Airports • Railways • Waterways (Ports) • Intermodal Links

**B. Violation – modification is not creating underlying strucutres.**

**C. Voting issue –**
**Limits – allowing ‘accessory affs” create thousands of potential affs that creates topic explosion and makes it impossible to be neg – kills topic education – voter for fairness and education.**

==T-Capital Expenditure== 
===1NC=== 

**“Investment” requires capital expenditure**
**Anderson 6** (Edward, Lecturer in Development Studies – University of East Anglia, et al., “The Role of Public Investment in Poverty Reduction: Theories, Evidence and Methods”, Overseas Development Institute Working Paper 263, March, http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/docs/1786.pdf)

1.3 Definitions We define (net) public investment as public expenditure that AND 1995; Sahn and Younger, 2000; and World Bank, 2002).

**Plan only raises a tax – not direct government spending**

**Voting issue ---**
**1. Ground --- SPENDING ON INFRASTRUCUTRE is key to unique disadvantages and topic links. Any other interpretation lets them spike out of our main source of offense.**

**2. Limits --- other definitions of “investment” make all incentives topical --- “capital expenditure” is the only way to meaningfully restrict the topic mechanism, which is the crux of all strategy and research**
