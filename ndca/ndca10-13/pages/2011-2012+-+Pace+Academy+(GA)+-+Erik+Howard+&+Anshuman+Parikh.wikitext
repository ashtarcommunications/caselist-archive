//**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif;">The US aerospace industry is in decline –Chinese gains put them ahead by 2016. Only reinvigorating the aerospace industry can maintain our edge against Europe and Asia</span>**//

China is aiming to reshape the global aviation industry…putting tremendous pressure on the continuation of American world leadership.



**<span style="color: black;">Mass investment into groundbreaking space development reverses this trend – only federal government certainty ensures private sector investment and long-term sustainability of the aerospace sector</span>**

//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Unfortunately, the US investment in advanced research…</span>// //<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">for the public, the nation, and the world.</span>//



**Scenario 1 is the economy:**



//**<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif;">A dominant aerospace industry is vital to economic growth—its key to innovation and jobs</span>**//

==Topicality== 
===T Pre-exist=== 
**Interpretation: Increase requires making an already existing thing greater**
**Buckley et al, 06 -** attorney (Jeremiah, Amicus Curiae Brief, Safeco Ins. Co. of America et al v. Charles Burr et al,
<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/supreme_court/briefs/06-84/06-84.mer.ami.mica.pdf]]</span>)

First, the court said that…already-existing policy. See Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88, 101 (2004) (“a phrase gathers meaning from the words around it”) (citation omitted).

**Violations: The aff creates a new program**

**This is a voting issue:**
**a) Predictable limits – creating a new space programs is infinite – this is uniquely harmful in this topic where incentive lacks a fixed meaning and could be anything. Limiting the topic to expanding current programs is vital to giving the negative a chance.**
**b) Predictable ground – our interpretation creates a stable literature base where we can create predictable counterplans based off of criticisms of existing federal programs**


===**T/ FW (Against K aff)**=== 
**United States federal government substantially increases space exploration and/or development in the United States. The __sole purpose of the ballot__ is to answer the resolutional question: Is the outcome of the enactment of a topical plan better than the status quo or a competitive policy option?**

**This is most predictable –**

**“Resolved” before a colon reflects a legislative forum**
<span class="Heading2Char">Army Officer School, 04</span> (5-12, “# 12, Punctuation – The Colon and Semicolon”, http://usawocc.army.mil/IMI/wg12.htm)

<span class="Style9ptUnderline">The colon introduces</span> the following…<span class="Style9ptUnderline">That this council petition the mayor</span>.


**__And__, “United States Federal Government should” means the debate is solely about the outcome of a policy established by governmental means**
<span class="Heading2Char">Ericson, 03</span> (Jon M., Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts – California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater’s Guide, Third Edition, p. 4)

<span class="StyleTimesNewRoman9pt">The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future…future action that you propose. </span>


**The affirmative does not meet this because they ask you to __instead of defending the adoption of the resolution.__**

__**This is a voting issue –**__

__**First, they are**__ **non-topical __because they don’t defend the enactment of a policy by the United States federal government. Topicality is an a-priori voting issue – as judge you are__ only allowed __to affirm those policies within__ your jurisdiction __dictated by the resolution.__**

__**Second is fairness – it is impossible to be negative in their world. If the affirmative is not constrained by the topic, they get to just speak in general about the horrors of racism, talk about their personal experiences or interpret the resolution any way they see fit. These claims are nearly**__ **unlimited in scope__, non-falsifiable, impossible to predict, and unfair for the team that is forced to debate against it.__**

__**Third, defending a topical affirmative is the only way to ensure that teams must research and debate**__ **both sides __of an argument and learn from__ multiple perspectives __about the topic. Forcing a rigid adherence to the__ topic __facilitates__ switch-side debating __– the advocacy of things you sometimes don’t necessarily believe in.__ Topic based education and ground __should be prioritized because it encourages students to learn in-depth about__ new __and important public policy issues__ each year__.__**

__**There is**__ **no risk of offense__. They can still read their ethics claims as a justification why the federal government should take action – they just can’t be the starting point of the plan.__ And__, they can make their arguments as criticisms when they are negative. There is no unique reason why they need this ground every debate or on the affirmative. This is heart of__ switch-side __debate.__**

__**You can vote negative to endorse their political and ethical strategy. Voting against the affirmative requires only a determination that they are outside the bounds of the topic, NOT that they are**__ **wrong __– this is a__ more effective way __to rally support around their ideas__**

__**This is a**__ **prior question __that must be resolved first – it is a pre-condition for debate to occur__**
__**Shively, 2000** – Assistant Prof Political Science at Texas A&M__
__(Ruth Lessl, Partisan Politics and Political Theory, p. 181-2)__

__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The requirements given…some basic agreement or harmony. </span>__

__**Finally, our framework is also socially productive – forcing students to**__ **assert policy solutions __has tremendous research and education benefits and encourages them to become__ advocates for change __rather than mere spectators__**
__**Joyner , 99** – Professor of International Law in the Government Department at Georgetown University__
__(Christopher C., Spring, 199, 5 ILSA J Int'l & Comp L 377)__

__Use of the debate can…political critique, and legal defense.__


__**Competitive debate is a dialogue between two teams. Their willful refusal to defend the resolution is an act to exclude the negative from meaningful participation in the dialogue. Fairness exists to provide a voice for both sides.**__
__**Galloway, 7** –professor of communication at Samford University (Ryan, “DINNER AND CONVERSATION AT THE ARGUMENTATIVE TABLE: RECONCEPTUALIZING DEBATE AS AN ARGUMENTATIVE DIALOGUE”, //Contemporary Argumentation and Debate,// Vol. 28 (2007), ebsco)__
__Debate as a dialogue sets… dialogical benefits of topical advocacy.__


__**It’s a voting issue and outweighs their offense – their attempt to exclude the negative obliterates the pedagogical benefits of in-round dialogue. Fairness norms are vital because they allow**__ **both__ teams to be heard in a meaningful way. Debate as dialogue is vital to refine and develop positions, test ideas and is a prerequisite to meaningful political participation**

**Role of the ballot is the evaluation of policy simulation and to maximize the lives saved. We should never sacrifice individuals for abstract market values – however, attempts to preserve lives gives equality to all rational beings – that’s key to value to life**
<span class="TagCharChar">Cummisky 96</span> (David, professor of philosophy at Bates College, Kantian Consequentialism, pg. 145)

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">We must not obscure…sacrifice some to save many.</span>

What follows is not an attempt to…prepared to build up the state or a new state<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>


**Vote Negative:**
**First, the Aff should lose—lack of a concrete plan makes any positive change impossible either in debate or the world at large and only empowers reactionary forces—they undermine the purpose of debate which is to teach us good decision-making skills that we can use in any context**

**Second, this is not a framework argument—whether debate is about policy, activism, or identity, plans are necessary for practical reasons—this is a solvency turn, not a normative rule or a theory argument**

**Third, it undermines clash—it’s impossible to engage their ideas if we don’t know what they are—that clash is critical to develop strategies and test ideas which eventually result in social change**
