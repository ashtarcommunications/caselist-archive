The underlying political message of space exploration …remember that exploration almost always leads to greater wealth."

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The plan is key:</span>**

A shift from economical use of limited resources to the…solar cells from lunar resources and installing them.

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none;">C. The Moon, specifically the South Pole, is the lynchpin of the system and solar system development overall. The pole is key to minerals, others are going for the Moon now.</span>**
