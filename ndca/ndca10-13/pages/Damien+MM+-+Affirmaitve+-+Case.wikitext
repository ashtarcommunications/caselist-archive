Note: Its the same 1AC since Greenhill
===Contention One: Hegemony=== 

Weaponization inevitable—vulnerability of assets combined with ease of access to ASAT technology

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Perhaps there remains a belief … to retain soft power while expanding hard power.</span>


Even if we are dominant now, Russia, China, India and Japan all are advancing

The ONLY OPTION is for the US to weaponize space and now is key—only way to stop an arms race and maintain hegemony

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">This is the context in … </span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">least for the next few years—is remote.</span>



China is intent on taking over Earth by establishing military dominance in space- only the creation of a US Space Force can stop this by taking us beyond hegemony

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">If all goes according to … </span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">Everything that will follow depends upon it.</span>


Maintaining those assets alongside weaponry is key to overall US tech leadership—that’s independently key to heg

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">This does not necessarily mean … in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy.</span>


Even if hegemonic decline is inevitable, plan prevents transition wars

===Contention Two: China=== 
Weaponization and subversion of U.S. space dominance is China’s goal—uncertainty means escalation is imminent

None of your evidence applies—China doesn’t consider their asymmetric ASAT capabilities weapons but the threshold has already been crossed

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">The Chinese definition of the … </span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">a long and complicated coexistence in outer space.</span>


The risk of crisis instability and miscalculation in space is high – the PLA is likely to initiate an attack in a crisis

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">One characteristic of too many … space instability seems high and likely to grow.</span>
History proves that realists are right about the inevitability of a space race with China—both sides want the military and economic benefits

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">The coming war with China … all satellites within range, cheaply and effectively. </span>


The impact is US-Sino nuclear war over Taiwan

Any of satellites causes escalation to spiral out of control—most likely scenario for great power war

China will escalate the conflict—perception of rational escalation ensures US gets drawn into a broader nuclear conflict

===Plan Text=== 
Plan: The United States Department of Defense should develop and deploy microsatellites tasked with inspection, surveillance, maintenance, protection, and propulsion capabilities to facilitate a Parasitic Attitude Control System.

===Contention 3: Solvency=== 

The best covert seizure of space would be deployment of micro-satellites in the form of a Parasitic Attitude Control System to hack and dismantle enemy capabilities without debris or negative perception

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">The idea of covertly supplanting … </span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">approach</span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;"> to neutralize enemy satellites without </span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">necessarily</span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;"> obliterating them</span>
Microsat defense systems are the best and ONLY way to protect current satellites and stay covert until necessary

Even if it was detected, PACS renders countermeasures or escalation pointless
