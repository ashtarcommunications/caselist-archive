Affirmative -

PLAN: The United States federal government should, //rebus sic stantibus,// nullify the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States of America and the Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and the Republic of Korea. We reserve the right to clarify.

1. The status quo fails to realize the reality that humans are able to destroy the world but go on about business as usual. Society suffers from an inability to comprehend the destructive capability of nuclear weapons; they are leading us down the road to catastrophe
Lifton and Falk 82 <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">(Robert Jay, and Richard, professor of international law at Princeton, Indefensible Weapons)</span>

2. Deterrence legitimizes nuclear weapons: it is a failed theory which will not create peace. Relying on deterrence in even the slightest degree will only create more fear which will keep us on the brink of annihilation.

3. Treaties between states have replaced the Gods of Old—we no longer offer lambs on an altar, and instead offer our Will to Power. Absent the will to power, life becomes meaningless—any reason to reject the plan becomes pointless when life has no value.
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Der Derian in 1993</span> <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">(James, Professor of IR and political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, “The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche and Baudrillard”, The Political Subject of Violence, ed. David Campbell and Michael Dillon, Page 101-105)</span>

4. Insecurity and suffering recur eternally and only by accepting this can we give life meaning. Eternal recurrence means that impacts lose all meaning absent a Will to Power and are all independent reasons to vote affirmative—the ability to will an eternity of suffering upon oneself would be a true affirmation of life.

5. Representations of the possibility of war are used to justify deterrence and normalize the existence of nuclear weapons and wages a war against our psyche.
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Lifton and Markusen 90</span> <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">(Robert Jay, Professor of psychiatry and psychology at John Jay College, and Eric, Professor at South State University, The Genocidal Mentality, pg. 75-76)</span>


6. This narrative psychologically numbs us to the capacity of nuclear weapons, makes us complicit with their use and numbs us to their psychological damage.
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Lifton and Markusen 90</span> <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">(Robert Jay, Professor of psychiatry and psychology at John Jay College, and Eric, Professor at South State University, The Genocidal Mentality)</span>


7. This nuclearism twists itself in order to demonize social values and ideologies in order to promote securitization and a gendered notion of the state.
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Bidwai and Vanaik 2k</span> <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">(Praful, Fellow at Institute for Policy Studies and Achin, Fellow of the Transnational Institute of Amsterdam, New Nukes: India, Pakistan, and Global Disarmament)</span>


8. And, nuclearism begets nuclearism. Every nuclear weapon used for deterrence only guarantees that more will be built—ensuring psychic numbing and security.
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Lifton and Falk 82</span> <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">(Robert Jay, and Richard, Professor of International Law and Practice at Princeton, Indefensible Weapons)</span>


9. Our fear of the bomb cedes agency and we become machines—no longer humans capable of anything other than servitude, enslaved to our own fears. Preservation of the machine becomes our ultimate goal and means that any disad scenario is only a reason why you should vote for the plan—there's only a risk the machine would fail.
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Chernus 86 </span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">(Ira, Professor of Religious studies at UC Boulder, //Dr. Strangegod//, p. 136-140)</span>


10. The plan solves by allowing for us to access a greater Will to Power and find meaning in our own lives.
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">Lifton 87</span> <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">(The Future of Immortality and Other Essays for a Nuclear Age, pg. 277-278)</span>


11. Even if we lose the spillover debate, you’re still going to give the aff its full weight. Attempting to change the world is crucial to celebrating life: Our denial of the securitizing logic of the status quo allows for us to celebrate our own life. Refusal to do this denies our own lives value and condemns others to unnecessary suffering.
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">May 05</span> <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">(Todd </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">May</span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">, Professor at Clemenson University. “To change the world, to celebrate life,” Philosophy & Social Criticism </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">2005</span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"> Vol 31 nos 5–6 pp. 517–531)</span>


12. The ontological damnation of security not only outweighs nuclear war, but is a necessary prerequisite for one to begin. That means that we will always control the key internal link to any of their disads and that extinction means nothing without the aff.
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Caputo 93</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12.6667px;"> (JOHN CAPUTO, PROFESSOR OF HUMANITIES, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY, 1993. DEMYTHOLOGIZING HEIDEGGER. 136-141.)</span>



13. No matter what disads they run, you have no choice but vote for the plan. The ability to roll the dice and accept the outcome would be a radical affirmation of life—were the government able to will its own destruction, then it would be affirming the symbolic death of the Sovereign.
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Deleuze 83</span> <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">(Gilles, Prof of Philosophy @ U of Lyon, Paris, and Lycees, Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 25-27)</span>
