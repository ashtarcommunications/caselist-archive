==Transportation Infrastructure== 

**Interpretation- Transportation infrastructure is the systems that allow people or goods to flow**

==Gas Tax== 
**A. Investment is capital spending on infrastructure’s physical capital**
**CBO, 9**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Congressional Budget Office (“Subsidizing Infrastructure Investment with Tax-Preferred Bonds”, October, </span>[[http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/106xx/doc10667/10-26-taxpreferredbonds.pdf]]<span style="font-size: 8pt;">)</span>
In this analysis, investment … on research and development.

**Violation – the plan increases the tax, not a net-increase in transportation infrastructure**
**Words and Phrases, 5** (Cummulative Supplementary Pamphlet, v. 20a, p.295)
Cal.App.2 Dist. 1991. Term “increase,” as used in statute giving the Energy Commission modification jurisdiction over any alteration, replacement, or improvement of equipment that results in “increase” of 50 megawatts or more in electric generating capacity of existing thermal power plant, refers to “net increase” in power plant’s total generating capacity; in deciding whether there has been the requisite 50-megawatt increase as a result of new units being incorporated into a plant, Energy Commission cannot ignore decreases in capacity caused by retirement or deactivation of other units at plant. West’s Ann.Cal.Pub.Res.Code § 25123.

==Pipelines== 

**Interpretation – transportation infrastructure is airports, ports, roads, and rail. Pipelines are explicitly defined as energy infrastructure.**
**Commander et al. 10**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> //(NO DATE CITED, 2010 is the copyright date)// *Charles Commander, Sector Leader (Global & Americas) **Jamie Page, Sector Leader (EMEA)** *Stafford Bagot, Sector Leader (APAC) “Engineering, Construction & Infrastructure” http://www.heidrick.com/ExecutiveSearch/Industry/Industrial/Pages/ECI.aspx</span>
While the term infrastructure is widely used to cover a range of asset classes, traditionally it has been used to describe three specific categories of physical assets:
Transportation - infrastructure such as airports, ports, roads and rail etc. Energy - infrastructure such as power stations and gas distribution pipelines Social - infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and prisons

==ITS== 


**A – Interpretation: Transportation infrastructure is separate from telecommunications infrastructure.**
**Snieska and Simkunaite 9**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Vytautas, Professor – Kaunas University of Technology, and Ineta, Professor – Projectu Vadybos Centras, “Socio-Economic Impact of Infrastructure Investments”, Inzinerine Ekonomika-Engineering Economics, Vol 3, p. 17, ken)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Authors of scientific literature suggest many definitions of infrastructure sector and its components, they widely interpret the features and functions of infrastructure while the issue of measurement is based mainly on the available data for different regions. Infrastructure is defined as a complex of capital goods which are not consumed directly; they provide services only in combination with labour and other inputs. This description allows to distinguish a wide range of components and to analyse their direct impact on development issues and emphasises the need of specification of infrastructure sector in order to measure its impact. In this article</span> __infrastructure is defined as the core physical structure consisting of: transportation infrastructure, water supply and disposal infrastructure, telecommunications infrastructure and power infrastructure,__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> consisting of </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sub sector</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">s that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are defined</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by a set of physical variables: </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">transportation infrastructure</span> __(length of <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">roads, rail tracks</span>____, etc.), water supply and disposal infrastructure (resident population connected to wastewater collection and treatment systems), telecommunications infrastructure (number of telephone lines), power infrastructure (power plants, transmission and distribution lines).__

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Aff isn’t transportation infrastructure – its wireless technology</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">RITA 8/28</span>** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(U.S. Department of Transportation Research and Innovative Technology Adminstration, “ITS Joint Program Office,” 8/28,[[@http://www.its.dot.gov/its_program/about_its.htm]])</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The current</span> __<span style="font-size: 10pt;">ITS</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Research Program is described in the ITS Strategic Research Plan, 2010-2014. The</span> __<span style="font-size: 10pt;">focus of the program is substantially on vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity through the application of advanced wireless technologies</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to enable transformative changes in the surface transportation system. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, V2V and V2I applications have the potential to address 80% of unimpaired crashes. These capabilities may also have significant potential for congestion and air quality improvements. The ITS Research Program develops and tests the underlying technology and applications and conducts policy research aimed at enabling V2V and V2I capabilities. The ITS JPO also runs active programs for technology transfer, ITS professional capacity building and ITS evaluation, aimed at providing valuable resources for state and local agencies and other ITS stakeholders.</span>
