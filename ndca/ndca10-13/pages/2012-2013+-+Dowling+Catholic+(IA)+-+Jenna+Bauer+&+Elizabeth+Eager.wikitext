<span class="Underline">Absent deterrence measures, conflict is inevitable</span>
<span class="Underline">Grundberger 4/26 – staff writer for John Hopkins Newsletter (Jacob, “Cold Wars: Why Militaries Must Get out of the Arctic” 4/26/12 http://www.jhunewsletter.com/op-ed/cold-wars-why-militaries-must-get-out-of-the-arctic-1.2862157#.T-vuSsWs9n8)//AB//</span>
//<span class="Underline">A disturbing trend has swept the world’s most northern states. Over the last few months, the international community has taken notice of the deployment and expansion of militaries to a new frontier, the Arctic Circle. Despite naysayers, the militaries of states such as the United States, Russia, Canada and the Scandinavian powers have demonstrated their acknowledgment of global warming by directing their forces in various exercises aimed at understanding and mastering this new battlefield. This is all being done in preparation for the potential for future conflict. Unsurprisingly, the source of this conflict will be energy resources. The U.S. Geological Survey has estimated that the Arctic may contain 13 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil and 30 percent of the world’s undiscovered natural gas. In addition, due to global warming, the National Research Council has predicted that sea lanes will be open in the region by the year 2030. Militaries, therefore, have begun to prepare for what they believe to be the inevitable crises that will break out over territorial disputes in the Arctic. It seems to me that the militarization of this pristine territory is not only misguided, but will yield harmful consequences that will cause invariable damage to international and environmental security. One of the biggest problems with the militarization of the Arctic is the insistence of northern military powers to adhere to the fallacious Realist assumption of the inevitability of war. While resource wars have always been a staple of international relations, there is something to be said about the insistence of these states to militarize the region as opposed to seeking any sort of international mediation.</span>//

//<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Climate change impacts in the Arctic, particularly the decline of sea ice and retreating glaciers, have stimulated human activities in the region, many of which have the potential to create oil pollution. </span><span class="underline">A primary concern is the threat of a large oil spill in the area. <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Although a </span></span>**__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">major oil spill has not occurred in the Arctic</span> region<span class="underline">,82 </span><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">recent economic activity, such as oil and gas exploration</span><span class="underline"> and tourism (cruise ships), </span><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">increases the risk of oil pollution</span><span class="underline"> (and other kinds of pollution) in the Arctic. <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Significant spills</span> in high northern latitudes (e.g., the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska and spills in the North Sea) <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">suggest that the “</span></span><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">potential impacts of an Arctic spill are likely to be severe for Arctic species and ecosystems</span>.”__83** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">A primary factor determining the risk of oil pollution in the Arctic is the level and type of human activity being conducted in the region. Although climate changes in the Arctic are expected to increase access to natural resources and shipping lanes, the region will continue to present logistical challenges that may hinder human activity in the region. For example (as discussed in another section of this report),84 the unpredictable ice conditions may discourage trans-Arctic shipping. If trans-Arctic shipping were to occur on a frequent basis, it would represent a </span><span class="underline">considerable portion of the overall risk of oil pollution in the region. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">In recent decades, many of the world’s largest oil spills have been from oil tankers, which can carry millions of gallons of oil.85 Although the level of trans-Arctic shipping is uncertain, many expect </span>**__<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">oil exploration and extraction</span> activities <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">to intensify in the region</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.86 Oil well blowouts from offshore oil extraction operations have been a source of major oil spills, eclipsing the largest tanker spills.

//<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">HOUSTON — In the latest in a series of embarrassing setbacks, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Shell</span> Oil Company</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> announced on Monday that it has been forced to delay drilling for oil in Alaskan Arctic waters this year after a </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">spill containment dome was damaged during a testing mishap</span>. The <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">accident further delayed Shell’s</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> six-year, $4.5 billion </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">effort to drill of off the coast of Alaska</span>, </span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">although it will not stop the company</span></span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;"> from performing preliminary work</span> this year on several wells in the region</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. But </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">the company will</span> have to <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">wait</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> at least </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">one</span> more <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">year before it can drill</span> for oil</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Shell had expected to receive all the necessary permits to drill up to five wells this summer and fall, but </span><span class="underline">a series of <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">equipment problems and persistent sea ice forced the company to</span> repeatedly <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">cut back</span> its program</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. “We are disappointed that the dome has not yet met our stringent acceptance standards,” Shell said in a statement. “We will not conduct any operations until we are satisfied that we are fully prepared to do it safely.” The Alaskan Arctic is one of the great untapped frontiers for offshore drilling in the United States. Energy experts say the Arctic seas could produce up to a million barrels of oil a day, roughly equivalent to 10 percent of current domestic production. Details of the dome accident were still hazy, Shell officials said. But it occurred during the testing of the Arctic Challenger, a containment barge, in Bellingham, Wash. </span><span class="underline">The barge, a piece of Shell’s response plan for dealing with any potential oil spill in the Arctic, has been the source of multiple headaches for the company. Electrical problems and other issues prevented it from passing Coast Guard fitness tests</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> that were required before Shell could win final approval from the Obama administration to drill in the Arctic. The containment dome, which is designed to gather spilled oil, was aboard the barge during the latest tests. </span><span class="underline">Shell said a mechanical device malfunctioned on the dome as it was being lowered into the water</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. A submarine robot was sent to help repair the damage, but it got tangled in some of the dome’s anchor lines. Company officials said they still needed to determine how much damage the dome suffered in the operation. Shell said it would also investigate whether the problem with the dome was a design issue or simply a testing error. </span><span class="underline">Environmental activists said <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">the accident was one more sign that Shell could not deal with</span> all the <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">problems</span> it would face <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">drilling in the Arctic, where powerful winds and long dark nights would make cleaning a spill extremely difficult</span>. “This reaffirms <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Shell was</span> clearly <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">not ready to drill</span> this summer, and no matter how much the Obama administration was willing to lower the bar for them, they were not able to cross it</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">,” said Brendan Cummings, senior counsel of the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the environmental groups that has gone to court to try to stop Shell from drilling. “It opens the door to further challenges in court and elsewhere.” Shell has suffered a series of misfortunes since </span><span class="underline">July, when <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">a drill ship dragged anchor and went adrift, nearly colliding with the Alaskan shore</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. And only a week ago, </span><span class="underline">Shell was forced to temporarily abandon preliminary drilling because <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">sea ice was moving into the Chukchi Sea drilling area</span> just a day after the work began. The <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">window for drilling</span>, which <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">is predicated on ice floes</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">and agreements </span><span class="underline">to protect whales and other wildlife, closes</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> the third week in September in the Chukchi and at the end of October in the Beaufort Sea. Shell is asking permission from the Department of Interior for an extra couple of weeks of drilling time in the Chukchi. Shell has a flotilla of ships in the Arctic waters, and company officials say they still hope to drill several pilot holes 1,400 feet deep in the Chukchi and Beaufort, the first drilling in the region in more than two decades. </span><span class="underline">The company has Department of Interior permission to drill the preliminary holes</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> without the containment dome and barge on site since the company will be operating thousands of feet above zones that contain oil and gas. The preliminary holes will eventually hold blowout preventers, the emergency equipment designed to shut a well down when surges of oil and gas are out of control. After this year’s drilling, the holes will be capped to await further drilling next summer. Most of the permits Shell has spent years to obtain will carry over to next year, and the company said it still hopes to drill up to 10 exploratory wells in the two seas.</span>//

//<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">These concerns assume new urgency in view of the growing impact of climate change, which is affecting the Arctic more rapidly and more radically than any other part of the planet. Permafrost is thawing and the polar ice cap is shrinking three times faster than experts were predicting just a few years ago. At this pace, the Arctic Ocean is likely to be ice free in summer within 20 years. </span><span class="underline">What is an unmitigated environmental disaster to conservationists</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, however, </span><span class="underline">is a potential bonanza to the oil industry: an opportunity to finally tap one of the largest remaining reserves of oil and gas in the world. Alaska’s Arctic is for them the final frontier and they have invested heavily in its development</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Shell alone has invested roughly $3 billion to purchase leases and prepare for exploratory drilling in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas next year.3 This report examines the capacity to respond to a spill in the Alaskan Arctic in light of the oil industry’s ambitions to expand drilling there. The first section considers the </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">growing risk of a major Arctic spill and</span> some of its <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">ecosystem impacts</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The next section surveys the </span><span class="underline">main <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">methods available to clean up offshore oil spills and the challenges of applying them in the Arctic</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. In the next two sections, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">we define</span> the concept of <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">a “response gap,</span>” discuss its implications for drilling in the Arctic, <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">and</span> take a closer look at the <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">logistical and </span></span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">infrastructural challenges</span></span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;"> that spill responders would face</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Section VI takes a critical look at response capacity and contingency planning for an Arctic spill in light of the response gap. Finally, we offer a set of general recommendations to help narrow that gap through stricter safeguards and improved response capacity. Before we delve into the details, however, there is a simple question that merits posing: Why should we care about the Arctic when most of us don’t live there? </span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Arctic key to global biodiversity, ocean, and climate patterns</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">; </span><span class="underline">The Arctic and the subarctic regions surrounding it are important for many reasons. One is <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">their enormous bio</span>logical <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">diversity</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: a kaleidoscopic array of land and seascapes </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">supporting millions of migrating birds and charismatic species</span> such as polar bears, walruses, narwhals and sea otters</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Economics is another: Alaskan fisheries are among the richest in the world. Their $2.2 billion in annual catch fills the frozen food sections and seafood counters of supermarkets across the nation. However, there is another reason why </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">the Arctic is</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> not just important, but </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">among the most important places on</span> the face of the <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Earth. A keystone species</span> is</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> generally </span><span class="underline">defined as one whose <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">removal from an ecosystem triggers a cascade of changes affecting other species</span> in that ecosystem. <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">The same can be said of the Arctic in relation to the</span> rest of the <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">world. With feedback mechanisms that affect ocean currents and</span> influence <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">climate patterns, the Arctic functions like a global thermostat. Heat balance, ocean circulation patterns and the carbon cycle are</span> all <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">related to its</span> regulatory and carbon storage <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">functions. </span></span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Disrupt these</span> functions <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">and we affect far-reaching changes in the conditions under which life has existed on Earth</span> for thousands of years</span><span class="underline">. In the context of climate change, </span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">the Arctic is a keystone ecosystem for the entire planet</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.</span>//

Diverse mangrove and coral reef ecosystems provide a wide variety of habitats that are essential for many fishery species</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. To make it simpler for economists to comprehend </span><span class="underline">the magnitude of services offered by biodiversity</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, a team of researchers estimated their value – it </span><span class="underline">amounted to $US33 trillion per year</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. “</span><span class="underline">By protecting biodiversity we maintain ecosystem services” <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Certain species play a </span></span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">“keystone”</span></span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;"> role</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> in maintaining ecosystem services. Similar to the removal of a keystone from an arch, </span><span class="underline">the <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">removal of these species can result in the collapse of an ecosystem</span> and the subsequent removal of ecosystem services. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The most well known example of this occurred during the 19th century when sea otters were almost hunted to extinction by fur traders along the west coast of the USA. This led to a population explosion in the sea otters’ main source of prey, sea urchins. Because the urchins graze on kelp their booming population decimated the underwater kelp forests. This loss of habitat led to declines in local fish populations. Sea otters are a keystone species once hunted for their fur (Image: Mike Baird) Eventually a treaty protecting sea otters allowed the numbers of otters to increase which inturn controlled the urchin population, leading to the recovery of the kelp forests and fish stocks. In other cases, ecosystem services are maintained by entire functional groups, such as apex predators (See </span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">[[http://news.mongabay.com/2010/0202-hance_toppredators.html|Jeremy Hance’s post at Mongabay)]]</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. During the last 35 years, over fishing of large shark species along the US Atlantic coast has led to a population explosion of skates and rays. These skates and rays eat bay scallops and their out of control population has led to the closure of a century long scallop fishery. These are just two examples demonstrating how biodiversity can maintain the services that ecosystems provide for us, such as fisheries. </span><span class="underline">One could argue that to maintain ecosystem services we don’t need to protect biodiversity but rather, we only need to protect the species and functional groups that fill the keystone roles.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> However, </span><span class="underline">there are a </span><span class="Emphasis2">couple of problems with this</span>//<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"> idea</span>//<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="underline">First of all, for most ecosystems we don’t know which species are the keystones</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">!</span> <span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Ecosystems are so complex</span></span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;"> that we are still discovering which species play vital roles</span> in maintaining them. <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">In some cases its </span></span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">groups of species</span></span><span class="underline"> not just one species <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">that are </span></span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">vital for the ecosystem</span></span><span class="underline">. Second, <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">even if we did</span> complete the enormous task of <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">identify</span>ing and protecting <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">all keystone species, what back-up plan would we have if</span> an unforseen <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">event</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> (e.g. pollution or disease) </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">led to the demise of these</span> ‘keystone’ <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">species</span>? Would there be another species to save the day and take over this role</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">? Classifying some species as ‘keystone’ implies that the others are not important. This may lead to the non-keystone species being considered ecologically worthless and subsequently over-exploited. Sometimes we may not even know which species are likely to fill the keystone roles. </span><span class="underline">An example of this was discovered on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> This research examined what would happen to a coral reef if it were over-fished. The “over-fishing” was simulated by fencing off coral bommies thereby excluding and removing fish from them for three years. By the end of the experiment, the reefs had changed from a coral to an algae dominated ecosystem – the coral became overgrown with algae. When the time came to remove the fences the researchers expected herbivorous species of fish like the parrot fish (Scarus spp.) to eat the algae and enable the reef to switch back to a coral dominated ecosystem. But, surprisingly, the shift back to coral was driven by a supposed ‘unimportant’ species – the bat fish (Platax pinnatus). The bat fish was previously thought to feed on invertebrates – small crabs and shrimp, but when offered a big patch of algae it turned into a hungry herbivore – a cow of the sea – grazing the algae in no time. So a fish previously thought to be ‘unimportant’ is actually a keystone species in the recovery of coral reefs overgrown by algae! </span><span class="Emphasis2">Who knows how many other species are out there with unknown ecosystem roles! </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">In some cases it’s easy to see who the keystone species are but in many ecosystems seemingly unimportant or redundant species are also capable of changing niches and maintaining ecosystems. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">The more biodiverse an ecosystem</span> is, <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">the more likely these species will be present and the more resilient</span> an ecosystem is to future impacts. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Presently </span><span class="underline">we’re only scratching the surface of understanding the full importance of biodiversity and how it helps maintain ecosystem function. The scope of this task is immense. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">In the meantime</span><span class="Emphasis2">, <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">a wise insurance policy for maintaining ecosystem services would be to conserve biodiversity</span></span><span class="underline">. In doing so, we increase the chance of maintaining our ecosystem services in the event of future impacts</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> such as disease, invasive species and of course, climate change. </span><span class="underline">This is the</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> international year of biodiversity – a </span><span class="underline">time to recognize that <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">biodiversity makes </span></span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">our survival on this planet</span></span><span class="underline"><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;"> possible</span> and that our protection of biodiversity maintains this service.</span>//
