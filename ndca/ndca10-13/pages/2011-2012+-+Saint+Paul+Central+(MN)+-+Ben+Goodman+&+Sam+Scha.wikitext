**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The most immediate cultural reference for space exploration comes from the last three decades of the TV show Star Trek. Star Trek isn’t just a TV show. It’s how Ben and I know “space exploration,” and it’s a powerful mega-text that both represents and simultaneously critiques the mainstream narrative of the colonizing mission of the United States in space. Just as space exploration programs attempt to make sense of the unknown, the Federation approaches the alien Borg in what seems like a hegemonic narrative. In both cases however, when we confront the alien, Star Trek shows that the alien…is…us.</span>**

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Thus we affirm an exploration of space beyond the Earth’s mesosphere</span>**

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Absent an understanding of the Borg we participate in a paranoid understanding of the Other that generates ontologically vicious cycles of threat creation, violence, and the entrenchment of the threatened identity</span>**

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Exploiting this moment of connection is key to breaking down our paranoia of the Other—Only examining the resolution through a prism of science fiction in which ideas of self and other, difference and sameness, are explored and critiqued can we solve</span>**

**Thus, we artistically and metaphorically affirm the exploration of space beyond the Earth’s mesosphere**.

**The role of the ballot is to judge the most persuasive performance of identity surrounding the topic. The stage of debate is where we perform – our identity is a construct of this space that is the cloth from which we are cut; the womb from which we are infinitely born. Ben and I were born this way, as debaters, when we made the decision to join the activity. To ignore our choice to affirm our identities, in which the resolution is ingrained, is to end our continuity within this space. Absence of self in our own womb existentially jeopardizes both of us – that is to say that our very birth, life, and identity are literally annihilated. Without the explicit inclusion of celebratory otherness omnipresent in the manifesto of Mother Monster, we become two very real people that are subsumed and destroyed by the dissolving of identity.**

**The manifesto of Mother Monster begins its exploration of the resolution upon the Government-Owned Alien Territory in space – the imagery through which Gaga translates her message is that of the cultural idiom of the superstar. In giving birth to her own race of freaks, she simultaneously explores and develops space beyond Earth’s mesosphere to familiarize us with the notion of the alien.**

**Only through Mother Monster’s art can we transgress and celebrate the defiance in otherness – she is the cultural trickster of our era, whose role is to deconstruct through transgression which embraces difference and brings seriousness to our trick, our joke: Performance.**

**Art is the sole way to redefine our own cognition and perception of the world – art teaches us that there is no one solution to a problem, no singular “correct” interpretation of a resolution, but instead a language in and through which we can bring images and utopias into reality. Space exploration is such an image in and of itself, but there is a clear distinction between our performance and that of a traditional policy debate – our integration of images is both a literal and metaphorical rupture in the divide inherent to debate which defends the use of static, external jargon binaries to give meaning to performance. With the use of images we can become the race of freaks whose biological identity is performance; whose very existence transcends the dividing nature of status quo debate that is apart artistic transgression.**

**Static categorization leads to the worst kinds of violence and allows things like the holocaust to happen - we become the oppressed objects of genocide when brought into the realm of difference binaries because the systematic grouping of identities turns entire communities against certain ways of life. In a very literal sense, competing and generalizing frameworks lead to the extermination of difference-ness within our own womb, turning the body from which we are birthed against its own child. Alignment against the hybridity of performativity and essentialism is alignment with the dichotomic oppressor.**
