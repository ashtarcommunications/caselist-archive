He is currently directing several studies for NASA and the U.S. Air Force, including a study of the role and size of the activities conducted by NASA’s astronaut office, a study of NASA’s aeronautics flight test research program, and the Space Studies Board’s recently concluded planetary science decadal survey.

===Taoism K=== 

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Living in accord with the Tao precludes taking action to prevent death. As mere humans, we are blind to the overarching meaning of the universe and thus any action we take is unproductive and immoral. </span>**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Once upon a time, …. especially not — ourselves.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Their calls to save humanity are based on a flawed fear of death and a misunderstanding of the continuous nature of the universe.</span>**

**Protest within the academy support dominant ideologies because they are co-opted as self-congratulatory proof of the liberal tolerance of the existing order. The co-optation of safe protest also legitimates the violent elimination of more threatening protest.**

**Lockard and Schalit, 04** (Issue #65, (ASU Professor, Journal Editor) Joe and Joel, Protest Culture, Neo-liberalism, and Contingent Human Rights, January).



__If protest culture…__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">negation by the market.</span>





**Confusing criticism with action is like the TV viewer who thinks that sarcastic commentary puts them above viewers who have been fooled into enjoyment by the poor plot or cheesy writing. The joke is actually on the cynic because all that the critique changes is the type of enjoyment derived from watching. Given that their end goal is the empty gesture of the ballot, the 1AC criticism turns itself by placing us even more firmly within the existing order.**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Developing this idea … clearly understood interests.</span>







**Academics engaged in critique can be entirely sincere as they speak from a position of privilege within academy. But, when we passionately cry out on behalf of the subaltern, we bring them into not only our discussion, but into the world order we claim to protest against. We still know what is best for the Other. Critiques are a continuation of colonialist violence.**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As we contemplate … dare not speak.</span>



**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hence we present our alternative: reject the affirmative on the grounds that it plays into the power of the structures they claim to critique. We will not claim to solve better, just to avoid making it worse.</span>**
