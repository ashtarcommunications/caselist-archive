**The Aff needs to specify the metaphysical assumptions behind the plan**

**Standards**


**A. Failure to specify makes the aff a moving target by enabling them to reinterpret the 1AC advocacy to avoid our K links and kills our ground**


**B. Specificity is key to solvency – lack of specification or appeals to transcendence means that the aff can’t solve for their impacts because without metaphysics life has no value**


**C. Lack of specification renders the 1AC harms and solvency improvable – they lack an outside source of coherence or meaning, independent reason to vote neg on presumption – they cant prove that the change they propose is tenable**

**Voter for fairness**
