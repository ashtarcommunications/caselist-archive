Song (30 sec) 
“I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long? How long?” 

According to UNICEF approximately 24,000 people will die today from starvation. You won’t see this number on the news. It wasn’t a result of a natural disaster, suicide bomber, terrorist, or communist. These deaths are four times the number of coalition forces killed in the military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. A death is a death is a death, but why are some considered more important than others?

These issues are not merely a matter of good or bad intentions and identifiable decisions. 
In "Gender and 'Postmoder' War," Robin Schott introduces some of the ways in which war is currently best seen not as an event but as a presence (Schott 1995). Schott argues that postmodern understandings of persons, states, and politics, as well as the high-tech nature of much contemporary warfare and the preponderance of civil and nationalist wars, render an event based conception of war inadequate, especially insofar as gender is taken into account.

I take Schott's characterization of war as presence as a point of departure, though I am not committed to the idea that the constancy of militarism, the fact of its omnipresence in human experience, and the paucity of an event-based account of war are exclusive to contemporary postmodern or postcolonial circumstances.1

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">This sort of narrow, symptom-focused view has become especially apparent with the coverage of the recent natural disaster in the Pacific. This problem has manifested itself in two ways: </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; margin-left: 0.5in;">“Yeah i hate it for japan but remember those idiots started world war 2. They bombed pearl harbor. Wonder how much money we will send to them” </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; margin-left: 0.5in;">“It’s been almost a full day of tsunami coverage. Time to move on. At first, I really did kinda feel bad for Japan. But then, I Googled “Pearl Harbor Death Toll”. There. All better.” </span>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">These self-centered, callous perspectives demonstrate the danger of crisis-based politics – people view life as a series of competitions, in which one group’s tragedy is another’s SCOOOORE. </span>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Fourty-two years ago, Kurt Vonnegut wrote the following in response to the firebombing of Dresden: </span>

It is so short and jumbled and jangled, Sam, because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre. Everybody is supposed to be dead, to never say anything or want anything ever again. Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre, and it always is, except for the birds. And what do the birds say? All there is to say about a massacre, thinks like //‘Poo-tee-weet?’//

I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part in massacres, and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them with satisfaction or glee. 

I have also told them not to work for companies which make massacre machinery, and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that. 


<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Vonnegut did not view this as a solitary or independent event. //Slaughterhouse Five// recognizes the pervasive and continuous nature of violence, and we believe that we should adopt this perspective. </span>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Therefore, Amrut and I advocate that the resolution, **Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military and police presence in all of the following: South Korea, Japan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey**, is a good idea**.** We recognize that the resolution is not a panacea for all violence, and we would like to have a discussion about our roles in structures of violence, not solely in the topic countries but throughout the world. </span>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">As debaters, this is especially important, since we have become desensitized to the realities of violence in our attempt to “win” rounds. We throw around words like “dehumanization,” “nuclear war,” “rape,” & “genocide” as meaningless buzzwords, the same way that we throw around words like solvency. Justified as impact calculus we have heard morally repugnant statements like: “Only 72 rapes are insignificant in comparison to our extinction impact.” </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A very successful team reads arguments like Biopower and Patriarchy good on the negative, yet they run an affirmative criticizing Orientalism and Imperialism. How much critical thinking does debate teach us when we pick and choose the most convenient times and ways to view structural violence – where we can criticize one form of power relations for 2 hours, and then immediately switch to a morally repugnant advocacy of oppression in the name of “survival” just to WIN a debate round? </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the aftermath of the tsunami in Japan, a debater posted the following on Cross-X.com: </span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">“New aff: God is angry at the Japanese, abandoning our support for them is key to avoiding eternal damnation. </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">You know that the literature is out there, somewhere.” </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Debaters are notorious for twisting events and literature to our own purposes, just as politicians use these events to push tangentially related agendas. After hearing about the disaster in Japan, our thoughts soon turned to how this would affect our debate rounds… one member of our team exclaimed, “Why couldn’t the earthquake have waited two weeks?” Obviously, her comment was not intended to downplay the suffering of the Japanese people, but this demonstrates that our empathy toward those affected by the quake and tsunami was inevitably tainted by the self-centered mindset of the debater. </span>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">And don’t think that this mindset ends when we walk out of the round – the continuous barrage of callous discourse numbs us to the reality of atrocities in daily life. It’s no coincidence that Karl Rove is a former policy debater. </span>

That claim is powerful because American economic and military power lies behind it. And any alternative position in such a world is virtually powerless. Given this inexorable historical reality , to assume, as the protocols of debate do, that all positions are equal is to efface the imbalances of power that are the fundamental condition of history and to annul the Moral authority inhering in the position of the oppressed. This is why I have said that the appropriation of my interested work on education and empire to this transcendental debate world constitute a travesty of my intentions. </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; color: black; font-size: 12pt;">scholarship</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;"> __is not "disinterested."

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Levinas is introduced in this paper to highlight the role of ‘the other’ within the process of identity constitution and the importance of the singular element that is inherent in every ethical demand. From a Levinasian perspective an encounter with the other, which is understood as an ethical relation, constitutes a central frame of reference for the formation of the self. Thus, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the self is</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> considered to be </span><span class="underline">constantly <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">constructed</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, disturbed and reconstructed </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">within</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the (</span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">ethical) relations with the other</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In contrast to Foucault, Levinas does not see identity formed by an outside authority. Hence, the identity of an individual cannot be defined ‘‘from the outside by the finger that points to it’’ (Levinas, 1969, p. 289). By saying this, Levinas does not defend the idea of an autonomous subject. Rather he emphasizes that </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">subjectivity is</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> primarily </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">produced on</span> the basis of endless <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">encounters with the other, not on</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the basis of </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">determining</span> or totalizing <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">norms</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Levinas, 1969, p. 23). However, self-identification is not a copy of the categorical consciousness that the ‘I’ has of the other, rather it is shaped in the interplay between the interiority of the self and the other’s exteriority.As the self, for Levinas, is continuously being developed in relation to the other, it diverges from itself without letting go of itself. Subjectivity is, therefore, ‘‘not in phase with itself’’, rather it is always ‘‘about to come’’ (Levinas, 1981, p. 32) and never final. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The self</span> is</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, thus, </span><span class="underline">not something, which</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> lies latently in the individual and </span><span class="underline">waits</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> awakening (Levinas, 1969, p. 219), rather </span><span class="underline">it <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">constantly unfolds in</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">response to the other</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Therefore, in Levinas’ understanding, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the self cannot recognize itself by solely focusing on itself</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The self is transformed and continuously recognized in its (ethical) response to the other. In Levinas’ philosophy </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the (ethical) response</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to the other </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is inevitable</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The self can neither avoid encounters with the other nor neglect ethical demands. Levinas’ ethical self is affected by the other and its difference. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">By the call of the other’s ‘face’ the self is demanded to care for the other</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> instead of passing the other by. Thus, according to Levinas, the relationship with the other always includes responsibility of the self to the other. Following Levinas’ thinking again; ‘‘no one can stay in himself; the humanity of man, subjectivity, is a responsibility for others’’ (Levinas, 2003, p. 67). Hence, the constitution of subjectivity is seen as an ongoing dynamic process of ‘‘unfolding one’s own being without at any point losing contact with the other’’ (Levinas, 1969, p. 61). The </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">acknowledgement of</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the other’s </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">difference</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, therefore separates the self from this other at the same time as it</span><span class="underline"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">connects</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the self to it (Levinas, 1969, p. 299). According to Levinas, subjectivity arises in what he calls an ethical ‘‘offering of oneself’’ (Levinas, 1981, p. 54). This means that the encounter with the other also must be thought as an ‘exposure of oneself’. Thus, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the other’s call demonstrates</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a risk of critique and a </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">questioning</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of </span>**__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">one’s own</span>__**__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> <span class="underline">beliefs</span></span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and common sense (Levinas, 1969, p. 43). At the same time, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the call</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the other</span><span class="underline"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">allows for selftransformation</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and development as</span><span class="underline"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it changes the way the self sees</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> both the other and the self (Muhr, 2008a, see also Werhane, 1995). Due to its transformational nature, the Levinasian </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">exposure</span> of the self</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and one’s vulnerabilities </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">demands more than</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> simply </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">displaying</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a few </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">weaknesses</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is more radical in nature, offering as it does the self in all its ‘‘uniqueness, stripped of all protection that would multiply it’’ (Levinas, 1981, p. 56). To constitute the self as an ethical subject then, an attempt to let go of unifying judgments and the willingness to leave all categories (such as white, male, rich, married) behind which can potentially ‘protect’ the self is required. It requires an unconditional openness to the other and its difference. As we ask how to constitute the ethical self in relation to others, the ideas of singularity, proximity, exposure and openness that characterize Levinas’ conceptions of ethics and responsible conduct are, thus, of particular significance. Generally speaking, this section saw us address why we think of the subject as a ‘‘a contingent mode of organization’’ (O’Leary, 2002, p. 117) which is continuously developed within socially constituted power/knowledge relations (Butler, 2005, p. 113). As we saw above, Levinas argued that the self cannot stand unaffected by the other. In a similar vein, following Foucault’s and Butler’s work, we assume that ‘‘</span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">there is no ‘I’</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that can stand </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">apart from</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">social conditions</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of its emergence, no ‘I’ that is not implicated in a set of conditioning moral norms’’ (Butler, 2005, p. 7). Since the process of subjectification is never fully determined, there are both limitations to the constitution of the (ethical) self, but </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">there are</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">possibilities to transcend</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> these</span><span class="underline"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">limitations and</span> to <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">give alternative</span> meaning and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">responses to established beliefs</span> and truths. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This also implies that we have not lost the ‘subjective ground’ for ethics. On the contrary, this disposition may well be </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">an essential condition for moral inquiry</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the condition under which ethics itself emerges (Butler, 2005, p. 8). In our view, subjectivity is therefore constituted through social norms and it arises within ‘the act of giving an account’ (Butler, 2005), where the self encounters and responds to the other. </span><span class="underline">The act of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">giving an account is</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> thereby not just an act where the self tries to describe itself, it is at the same time, as we learned from Levinas, a narrative enacting and </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">transforming</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the self (see Butler, 2005, p. 66). In the following section, we will investigate further into the act of giving an account since, on the one hand, it is an example of the narrative performing of the self, and on the other hand, it illustrates the idea of a ‘‘subject formation that acknowledges limits of selfknowledge’’ (Butler, 2005, p. 19).</span> <span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">The act of giving account Ethics, for us, is about ‘telling the truth’ in the form of an open response to the other; it is about what has to be said, not about justifying what has been said (see also Muhr, 2007). In contrast to code- and ruleoriented approaches, we argue that an enclosing of <span class="underline">ethics</span> and the ethical subject <span class="underline">prohibits</span> the important <span class="underline">continuous questioning of</span> norms and the reflection on<span class="underline"> what has been taken for granted</span> until now. Thus, code-oriented concepts of business ethics tend to be ideological and ‘totalizing’ (Levinas, 1969, p. 22). In excluding what is doubtful, precarious, unknown and ‘not yet’, they proffer the possibility of full responsibility. Judith Butler calls this illusion of full responsibility an ‘act of ethical violence’ (Butler, 2005, p. 42). Drawing primarily on Levinas and Foucault in a recent text, she develops the scene of ‘giving an account of oneself’: a conception of ethics, and indeed of responsibility, that appreciates the lack of self-transparency (Butler, 2005, p. 19). The act of giving account is an act of speech, in which the subject ‘‘gives himself in words and engages in an extended act of self verbalization’’ (Butler, 2005, pp. 112–113) as a way of making the self and one’s world appear for the other (Wild, 1969, p. 14). This act expresses for Butler a crucial tension that is inherent in the idea of responsibility: <span class="underline">the demand</span> to give account and take responsibility always emerges from a specific situation and<span class="underline"> is bound to a certain social context</span>. This embeddedness restricts the possibilities to give a true, full and responsible account of the self, as Butler notes [W]hat I find so hard to narrate are the norms – social in character – that brings me into being. They are, as it were, the condition of my speech, but I cannot fully thematize these conditions within the terms of my speech (Butler, 2005, p. 82). Since the subject is affectively and emotionally involved in the act of giving account, he or she is thus not able, even if willing, to distance him- or herself from normative expectations and rules that always produce a specific way of seeing, listening and responding. The <span class="underline">involvement</span> within the act of giving account <span class="underline">makes it impossible to simultaneously question dominant norms</span> under which the self is subordinated. However, the ability to reflect seems to constitute a fundamental precondition for responsible acting. Here, we consider this paradox that forms part of the idea of responsibility as a limitation of full responsibility. Following Butler’s argument, the accountable self is not entirely able to account for itself. This implies that being ethical consists not only in asking the question ‘who am I and who are you?’, but also – and maybe more importantly – in asking this question without the expectation to obtain a full and final answer (Butler, 2005, p. 43). In referring to Levinas, Butler thus identifies an ‘otherness’ within oneself. On this view, she argues that if the identity we say we are cannot possibly capture us and marks immediately an excess and opacity that falls outside the categories of identity, then any effort to give an account of oneself will have to fail in order to approach being true (Butler, 2005, p. 42). </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Consequently, it is also the ‘opaque side’ of the self that makes full accountability impossible. This opaque side of the self is caused by limits of self-knowledge and self-awareness. Although the otherness, or blindness, within the self modulates in different scenes of address, it can, however, never be completely recognized and perceived by the self. According to Levinas we cannot live without addressing the other or without being addressed by the other. The ‘scene of address’ is, thus, also constituted through the ‘call’ of the other and is, therefore, not to calculate beforehand or fully to control through the self. Even if this incalculable demand of the other is another reason why full accountability is not possible, it establishes the scene of giving account at the same time as a primary ethical relation (Butler, 2005, p. 21); as an ethical relation that prompts the self to act by a responsibility not known nor defined in advance. In short, the ‘‘response to the demand to give an account of oneself is a matter of fathoming at once the formation of the subject and its relation to responsibility’’ (Butler, 2005, p. 135). Butler’s attempt, therefore, represents a rethink of the cultural terms of ethics ‘‘to remember that not all ethical relations are reducible to acts of judgment, and that the very capacity </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to judge presupposes a prior relation</span> between those who judge and those</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> who are </span><span class="underline">judged’’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Butler, 2005, p. 45). In extending Levinas’ philosophy she thereby asks for mutual responsibilities, which apply both to the self and the other. Such an ethics – which Butler calls ‘an ethics of responsiveness’ – is, thus, based on our shared, invariable and partial blindness about ourselves. Butler, therefore, sees the otherness within the self as a potential ‘‘source of my ethical connection with others’’ (Butler, 2005, p. 84). Hence, even if it seems to be ‘‘really true that we are divided, ungrounded or incoherent from the start’’ (Butler, 2005, p. 19), it would not be impossible ‘‘to ground a notion of personal or social responsibility’’ (Butler, 2005, p. 19). Moreover, the </span><span class="underline">acceptance that self-knowledge and responsibility are always limited allows us to reframe</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the notion of </span><span class="underline">the moral agent</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the last section then, we want to summarize our arguments by showing how the self, facing limits of responsibility, can be constituted as an ethical subject.Acknowledging limits of responsibility In referring to Butler’s work we tried to explore the ways in which responsibility is bounded, and we soon noted three significant limitations: the first is the lack of self-transparency and self knowledge that relates to a certain form of opacity to oneself. Secondly, social norms (under which the self and the other act) always structure, to some extent, the ‘scene of giving account’. This implies that </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">we are not able to</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> completely </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">distance ourselves from the</span> specific <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">‘regime of truth’</span>, in which <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">we are embedded</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The third limitation lies in the act of giving account itself. Since this act is never a pure individual performance, the self cannot autonomously determine, independently from the other, how to behave and act in the scene of address. To give account of oneself also means to expose to the other. The modes of interactions that are (re)created within this scene are, thus, never fully foreseeable. However, even if the ‘otherness’ within the self cannot be eliminated, it seems to be of significance to ask ‘‘who am I, how am I different from others, and why do I do what I do?’’ (Cummings, 2000, p. 224). Despite the limits of giving account, these questions are still essential to the constitution of ourselves as subjects of moral conduct. Foucault (1984) claimed that the attempt to ‘know myself’ is a constitutive part of the development of ethical self-relations and thus, of responsibility to the other. The figure of the ‘parrhesia’, which Foucault elaborates in ‘Fearless Speech’ (2001), refers to this attempt. </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Parrhesia is</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, according to Foucault, </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a ‘practice of critique’</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; it means </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">‘to tell the truth’</span> to myself and to others<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, even if the self is always embedded in</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and thus restricted by </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">one’s </span>own <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">‘regime of truth’</span>.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Parrhesia is a practice based on mutual relations, where </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the target is not to ‘‘persuade the assembly, but to convince someone that he must take care of </span>himself and</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">others</span>; and</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> this means that he must </span><span class="underline">change his life’’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Foucault, 2001, p. 106). </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ‘parrhesiastes’ as a ‘</span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">critical friend’ feels bound</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to use his freedom and </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to tell his truth without</span> considering costs</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, potential personal consequences</span><span class="underline"> and </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">without</span><span class="underline"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">reflecting on one’s own</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> strategic</span><span class="underline"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">position</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and therefore the ‘truth teller’ is willing to take a risk in becoming responsible (Butler, 2005; Foucault, 2001). Thus, parrhesia refers to a certain ethical form of living with the other and with the self; one that includes a willingness to question ourselves and the ways in which we relate to others and to the world more generally. Furthermore, it implies that </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">even if there are</span> certain <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">limits of responsibility</span> in relation to oneself and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to others, this does not mean that one can</span> neglect or <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">reject </span>the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">taking</span> of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">responsibility</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Bauman contends that to take responsibility means ‘‘being bound to make choices under conditions of acute and painful uncertainty’’ (Bauman and Tester, 2001, p. 46). From such a perspective, decisions have to be made in the light of ambiguity and ‘undecidability’, in the space in-between general rules and a singular context- specific ethical demand. Moreover, we are precisely asked to decide responsibly under conditions of uncertainty and ‘undecidability’, between knowledge and non-knowledge, between calculability and incalculability (Derrida, 1993). Derrida (especially 1993, 1997) emphasizes that an action which is considered ‘right’ and ‘true’ in one context can just as well be judged ‘wrong’ and imply precarious effects in another context. This implies that each decision produces a ‘supplement’ in the sense that to decide for someone and something involves a decision against something else (see e.g. Weiskopf, 2004, p. 242f). In an ‘ethics of responsiveness’ </span><span class="underline">the ethical subject is not</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> understood as </span><span class="underline">a ‘rule follower’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Hence, in this approach </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the attempt is not to identify what is ‘right and wrong’</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or ‘moral and immoral’, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">but to focus on</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the ‘aporetic space’ (Derrida, 1993) </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in-between rules which requires</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> one’s own considered</span><span class="underline"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">response.</span> Responsibility becomes</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, thus, ‘‘a matter of </span><span class="underline">reflection and choice amongst undecidable alternatives’’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Clegg et al., 2007, p. 118). Becoming a responsible subject despite limitations </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">For</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> those </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">poststructuralist</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of persuasion, </span><span class="underline">the question of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">responsibility can never be solved</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, controlled or closed. On this viewpoint, Levinas emphasizes that </span><span class="underline">morality lies not in establishing rules</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to which the self and the other have to apply and ethics has, therefore, nothing to do with expectations from or demands for the other. Rather, for Levinas, the ethical demand constituted in the encounter with the other affects and disposes the self to take responsibility. However, the self that tries to give an openhearted response can never be responsible enough because it can never fully cope with the ‘call’ of the other, because the ethical demand is always ‘to come’ (Levinas, 1981, p. 12). According to both Levinas and Derrida the ‘problem’ of responsibility is infinite. There are no ‘right’ decisions insofar as </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">every decision</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> inevitably </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">produces</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its </span><span class="underline">inclusions and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">exclusions</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Derrida, 1995, p. 27). Derrida argues that ‘‘if responsibility would not be infinite there would be no ethical and political problems’’ (Derrida, 1999, p. 192). But responsibility is infinite since undecidability, lack of guarantees, non-knowledge, uncalculated events – the ‘not yet’ – are immanent in it, or even constitute the ethical question. Within an ‘‘ethics of modesty, responsiveness and patience to the other’s difference’’ (Butler, 2005, p. 42) </span><span class="underline">every</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> singular </span><span class="underline">decision</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, therefore, </span><span class="underline">includes a new responsible moment</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> where the ethical effort lies in problematizing familiarities and certainties (Levinas, 1969, p. 43) as well as in considering the unique request within the broader social context (Weiskopf, 2004, p. 243). From this perspective the ethical response to the other also includes a risk since it demands an opening up to critique and self-questioning (see Foucault, 1992; Levinas, 1969). To take responsibility, therefore, also demands ‘courage’ from the ethical self. In this regard Butler mentions that we must recognize that</span><span class="underline"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">ethics requires us to risk ourselves</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> precisely </span><span class="underline">at moments of unknowingness</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, when what forms us diverges from what lies before us, </span><span class="underline">when</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> our </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">willingness to become undone in relation to others constitutes our chance of becoming human</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Butler, 2005, p. 136). Consequently the ethical relation with the other is simultaneously a chance and a risk (Levinas, 1969). </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">In the encounter</span> with the other <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">‘‘one discloses oneself by neglecting one’s defenses</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, leaving a shelter, exposing oneself to outrage, to insults and wounding’’ (Levinas, 1981, p. 49). Hence, the recognition that one is not always similar to how one presents oneself requires not only the willingness to accept the irreducible limits of responsibility; rather, it requires a certain patience with others and oneself (Butler, 2005, p. 42). Following Butler it is exactly this ‘patience’, the </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">careful listening and responding to the other’s demands</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, that could </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">avoid</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> acts of ‘</span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">ethical violence’</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In conclusion, Butler’s assumption that ‘‘I am my relation to you’’ (Butler, 2005, p. 81) implies that the self is created and transformed in the encounter with the other and thereby incited to reflect upon itself (Butler, 2005, p. 125). Thus, the moral subject is keen ‘‘to become critical of norms under which we are asked to act’’ (Butler, 2005, p. 24). This means that the moral agent strives to distance him- or herself from established ‘regimes of truth’, including his or her own (Foucault, 2001). Thus, if we are to act in a responsible way, reflection on how to use our scopes in response to the other and in relation to the respectively singular is indispensable. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">To be ethical</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> therefore </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">means to</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> question the self at the moment of uncertainty and to </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">try to act responsibly in spite of limitations</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If we do that, we are, according to Butler, not being irresponsible – or if we are after all, ‘‘we will surely be forgiven’’ (Butler, 2005, p. 136).</span>

We will literally all be dragged to HELL and smitten into oblivion by the wrath of the Almighty if we allow gays to marry 
<span class="cite">The Onion, March 12, 2011</span>
(“Town Of Davenport, Iowa Descends Into Hell Following Gay Marriage Ceremony, March 12, 2011 |Issue 47.10, [[http://www.theonion.com/articles/town-of-davenport-iowa-descends-into-hell-followin,19446/]]) 
<span style="font-family: Times,serif;">Davenport moments after allowing the couple to publicly affirm their love for each other. </span>
<span style="font-family: Times,serif;">FORMER DAVENPORT, IA—</span><span class="underline">Immediately following the performance of a same-sex marriage ceremony</span><span style="font-family: Times,serif;"> Sunday afternoon at Holy Christ Almighty Lutheran Church on Lincoln Avenue, </span><span class="underline">the city of Davenport, IA and all 99,685 of its residents were reportedly smitten into oblivion by the merciless wrath of God and flung into the deepest bowels of eternal hell. </span>
<span style="font-family: Times,serif;">According to state authorities, </span><span class="underline">the nightmarish incident occurred approximately five seconds after a local pastor pronounced homosexual men </span><span style="font-family: Times,serif;">Brian Palmer, 39, and Greg DeHaan, 43, </span><span class="underline">married in the eyes of God, at which point a tremor registering 8.5 on the Richter scale ripped the earth asunder and Davenport's inhabitants were swallowed by a widening chasm, where they found themselves eviscerated on the fiery spears of 10 million shrieking demons. </span>
<span style="font-family: Times,serif;">"They tried to warn us and we didn't listen—</span><span class="underline">Lord, why did we not listen?" said Rev. Kenneth Hanson, the clergyman</span><span style="font-family: Times,serif;"> who </span><span class="underline">performed the unholy marriage, moments before being dragged into a bottomless pit, flayed alive, and devoured by Satan</span><span style="font-family: Times,serif;">, the Great Deceiver. </span><span class="underline">"All I wanted to do was provide basic civil rights and legal recognition to Brian and Greg, two people who love each other and have been together for 15 years. But I was wrong. Oh, so wrong!" </span>
<span class="underline">"Children of God throughout the nation!" Hanson cried out as he plummeted into the infernal void. "Do not make the same mistake </span>we here in Iowa have made<span class="underline">! Save yourselves before it is too late!" </span>
<span style="font-family: Times,serif;">Witnesses reporting from the scene immediately preceding the destruction of Davenport recounted a number of horrific sights, including demonic wraiths clothed in smoke and ash flying through the city's streets; homosexuals and heterosexuals alike being torn limb from limb by goat-legged imps, the skeletons of live dogs leaping from the creatures' bodies to feast upon small children; and a great wall of fire that spread from the altar where the small, private wedding ceremony was conducted in west Davenport and consumed all. </span>
<span style="font-family: Times,serif;">In the wake of the disaster, many friends, relatives, and fellow Iowans said they blamed Brian and Greg most of all, for having given in to Satan's obvious machinations despite the numerous warnings presented to them. </span>
<span class="underline">"Why did Brian and Greg insist upon this public, legally binding avowal of their love?" sobbed a relative</span><span style="font-family: Times,serif;"> who now lives in Minnesota and wished to remain anonymous due to fear of reprisals by the Forces of Righteousness. </span><span class="underline">"Why couldn't they have just kept living as second-class citizens, without the tax incentives and insurance flexibility offered to married couples?"</span>
<span class="underline">As friends and family of the longtime couple endured the agony of hot lances pierced through their eyes and a cloud of sulfurous gas enveloped the city, Iowans expressed great remorse for ignoring God's design and allowing the union of Brian and Greg to occur. </span>
<span style="font-family: Times,serif;">"We should have seen this coming when that Plague of Locusts appeared in central Scott County last month after they applied for the marriage license," said a terrified Marsha Ternus, former chief justice of the Iowa State Supreme Court, who was ousted last November for her support of an earlier ruling declaring the state's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. "It was such a clear omen, yet we were too blind to see. </span><span class="underline">We have brought the Vengeance of the Lord down upon the people of Davenport with our hubristic refusal to obey what is written in holy scripture. May God have mercy on our souls." </span>
<span class="underline">The event, which is being called a clear and irrefutable message from God as to his position on gay marriage, came as a shock to many around the nation who believed that allowing gays and lesbians to marry was the right thing to do and therefore could not invoke the displeasure of the Almighty Lord. </span>
<span style="font-family: Times,serif;">Meanwhile, as citizens prayed furiously for the Lord's forgiveness, officials said they were working around the clock to drain local rivers and lakes of the blood and entrails of sinners, and will soon plug up the gaping, smoldering hole where Davenport once stood and from whence the stench of roasting flesh and the cackle of Satan himself continues to emanate. </span>
<span style="font-family: Times,serif;">Following the immolation of Davenport, </span><span class="underline">LGBT communities across the country immediately issued statements acknowledging their culpability for the catastrophe, admitting that homosexuality was a sinful lifestyle deserving of wrathful punishment. In surveys, 100 percent of homosexuals polled said that, given the clear evidence of God's Will</span> shown by the tragic events,<span class="underline"> the best course of action would be to abandon </span>the notion of<span class="underline"> gay rights altogether and beg</span> the Lord's <span class="underline">forgiveness. </span>
<span class="underline">"I thought antigay activism was cruel and bigoted before, but now I can see that, yes, my sexual orientation is truly an abomination in the Eyes of God," said lesbian activist</span><span style="font-family: Times,serif;"> and organizer Professor </span><span class="underline">Julia Cafritz</span><span style="font-family: Times,serif;"> of Houston, responding to early reports of God's actions in the Midwest. </span><span class="underline">"My very existence is an affront to all that is good and true in this country.</span><span style="font-family: Times,serif;"> I'm sorry, America. I'm so, so terribly sorry." </span>
<span style="font-family: Times,serif;">At press time, </span><span class="underline">officials said the overall strength of the traditional American family had increased by 47 percent following the eternal damnation of Davenport, while pure, hardworking Christians everywhere would continue to be assured a place in heaven</span><span style="font-family: Times,serif;">.[[image:file:///C:/Users/Amrut/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.jpg width="16" height="16"]] </span>
