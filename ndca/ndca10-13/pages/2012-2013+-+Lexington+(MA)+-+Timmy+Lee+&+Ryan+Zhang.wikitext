==Cap 1NC== 


Focus on subjective violence and easily identifiable flashpoints of conflict misses the boat – only focusing on the background or objective violence can solve root cause – cannot be viewed from the same stand point – the call to act will be strong but responding creates a stop-gap which prevents engaging in criticisms of capital

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zizek 2008</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Slavoj Violence p 1-4</span>

If there is a unifying thesis that runs through the bric-a-brac... kept at a distance out of respect towards its victims.



Resisting capitalism’s reliance on economic evaluation is the ultimate ethical responsibility – the current social order guarantees social exclusion on a global scale

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zizek and Daly 2k4</span> (Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek page 14-16)

For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian ... the abject Other to that of a ‘glitch’ in an otherwise sound matrix.



The Affirmative’s demand for urgency is a product of hypocritical outrage meant to extend the privilege of global capitalism – our alternative is to do nothing in the face of the affirmative

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zizek 2008</span> Slavoj Violence p 6-8

Let’s think about the fake sense of urgency that... violence. We need to “learn, learn, and learn” what causes this violence.
