<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Practice is democracy, so the standard is:</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The goodness of a practice as a whole is unrelated to the goodness of the particular rules within that practice. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"What is missing...capacity for thought."</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Moreover, even seemingly-problematic practice rules should not be rejected. MacIntyre, Alasdair, After Virtue. University of Notre Dame Press, 1984. 190. "A practice involves...gustibus est disputandem."</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Finally, independent of the practice rules framework, democracies are intrinsically valuable. Christiano, Thomas (University of Arizona).

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">“Returning to smoking…can be deterred.”</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The adult criminal justice system empirically deters crime while rehabilitation fails; the increase in juvenile crime is directly attributable to a decrease in punishment. Yahya 2:</span>
