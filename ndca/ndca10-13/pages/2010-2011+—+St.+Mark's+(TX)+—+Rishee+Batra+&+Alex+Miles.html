<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">Sica 11/27</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">—president, Sica Wealth Management, which currently manages nearly 1 billion in client assets, real estate and private equity holdings, consistently ranked among the top producing advisors in the country and as a specialist in managing assets (Jeffrey, 27 November 2010, “SPIRIT OF FREEDOM-What the Conflict on the Korean Peninsula Means to the World Economy”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blogs.forbes.com/jeffreysica/2010/11/27/spirit-of-freedom-what-the-conflict-on-the-korean-peninsula-means-to-the-world-economy/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.forbes.com/jeffreysica/2010/11/27/spirit-of-freedom-what-the-conflict-on-the-korean-peninsula-means-to-the-world-economy/</a>, RBatra)</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The most important aspect of this confrontation is how North Korea’s closest ally, China, deals with their recent aggression and insatiable need to advance their nuclear capabilities. China has a long history of using North Korea as a buffer against the US. Since the end of the Korean War, they have been leery of our strong alliance and our military presence in South Korea. They have never welcomed having our warships anywhere near their coastline. Furthermore, they have yet to firmly condemn North Korea on the attack of a South Korean warship which killed 46 sailors last March, the revelations of their nuclear capabilities or the most recent events. Alternatively, China, in a statement from its foreign ministry regarding our military exercises, has chosen to warn the US against “any military acts in our exclusive economic zone without permission.” In other words, China is threatening the US not to come too close to their coastline or face consequences. This statement by China will only serve to encourage the radical Korean dictator and his offspring to further threaten South Korea and defy the US. It should concern the Obama Administration that the strongest stand taken by the Chinese has been against the US protection of our allies, and not against the aggression of a radical dictator. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The US market fell this week amid concerns that the Korean peninsula conflict will escalate. The bulls have chosen to focus on this conflict as yet another example of “saber rattling” from North Korea, but its consequence could be far greater than ever before, considering a few key factors. FIRST, China has the greatest influence over North Korea and how they handle them will substantially affect the world economy. SECOND, China is the largest foreign holder of US Government debt in the history of our nation, with holdings of nearly 900 billion dollars. This position gives them significant leverage over the US and substantially undermines our ability to negotiate with them when they side against us, as they seem to be doing now. THIRD, China has systematically devalued the juan in response to QE2 creating the dawn of inflation as we are beginning to see now and will soon see in the US. The recent interest rate increase in China has yet to show signs of curbing inflation. If the US and China are unable to come to terms with the conflict in the Korean Peninsula, it is unlikely they will come to terms with stabilizing their currencies — continuing on a path of systematically devaluing currencies and creating a future threat of inflation while undermining a worldwide economic recovery. Finally, an insane dictator with nuclear weapons that is not kept at bay, by its closest ally and neighbor, is always a threat to the economy and well being of nations throughout the world. China has a responsibility to help stabilize the region and until they do, uncertainty and fear will remain throughout the worldwide financial markets, keeping us in a very defensive position. </span></span><br />
<strong>China/ U.S. currency fights risk a trade war that collapses the economy</strong><br />
<strong>Peterson 11/14</strong>—finance news reporter (Janet, 14 November 2010, “World Trade Markets: U.S. Chides China Currency Devaluation, G20 Upset”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usmoneytalk.com/finance/world-trade-markets-u-s-chides-china-currency-devaluation-g20-upset-911/" rel="nofollow">http://www.usmoneytalk.com/finance/world-trade-markets-u-s-chides-china-currency-devaluation-g20-upset-911/</a>, RBatra)<br />
As the United States pushes for the world to exert pressure on China to allow its currency to rise, they are meeting resistance from leaders at the G-20 summit. While the United States is accusing China of devaluing their currency, they themselves are being accused of the same practice.<br />
Both Countries Using Devaluation Tactics<br />
While both the United States and China agreed in a joint statement to avoid currency devaluation tactics, although it is a non-binding agreement. At issue is China’s massive intervention in the market to keep the yuan undervalued on the world market. As an apparent counter, the fed is printing hundreds of billions of dollars to pump into the economy that analysts predict will depress the value of the dollar.<br />
Risk Of Trade War<br />
Leaders at the G-20 summit are not backing the United States, but at the same time fear that the rhetoric will escalate into a trade war that will drive the global economy back into a recession. Leaders balked at the recent move to inject $600 billion dollars into the market with the express purpose of making American imports more competitive with China. The move may effectively only serve to cause China to devalue their currency even further.<br />
<strong>Extinction</strong> <br />
<strong>Harris &amp; Burrows 2009</strong> Mathew, PhD European History @ Cambridge, counselor of the U.S. National Intelligence Council (NIC) and Jennifer, member of the NIC’s Long Range Analysis Unit “Revisiting the Future: Geopolitical Effects of the Financial Crisis” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4005:http://www.ciaonet.org/journals/twq/v32i2/f_0016178_13952.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/journals/twq/v32i2/f_0016178_13952.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciaonet.org/journals/twq/v32i2/f_0016178_13952.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4005 --><br />
Of course, the report encompasses more than economics and indeed believes the future is likely to be the result of a number of intersecting and interlocking forces. With so many possible permutations of outcomes, each with ample Revisiting the Future opportunity for unintended consequences, there is a growing sense of insecurity. Even so, history may be more instructive than ever. While we continue to believe that the Great Depression is not likely to be repeated, the lessons to be drawn from that period include the harmful effects on fledgling democracies and multiethnic societies (think Central Europe in 1920s and 1930s) and on the sustainability of multilateral institutions (think League of Nations in the same period). There is no reason to think that this would not be true in the twenty-first as much as in the twentieth century. For that reason, the ways in which the potential for greater conflict could grow would seem to be even more apt in a constantly volatile economic environment as they would be if change would be steadier. In surveying those risks, the report stressed the likelihood that terrorism and nonproliferation will remain priorities even as resource issues move up on the international agenda. Terrorism’s appeal will decline if economic growth continues in the Middle East and youth unemployment is reduced. For those terrorist groups that remain active in 2025, however, the diffusion of technologies and scientific knowledge will place some of the world’s most dangerous capabilities within their reach. Terrorist groups in 2025 will likely be a combination of descendants of long established groups_inheriting organizational structures, command and control processes, and training procedures necessary to conduct sophisticated attacks and newly emergent collections of the angry and disenfranchised that become self-radicalized, particularly in the absence of economic outlets that would become narrower in an economic downturn. The most dangerous casualty of any economically-induced drawdown of U.S. military presence would almost certainly be the Middle East. Although Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons is not inevitable, worries about a nuclear-armed Iran could lead states i n the region to develop new security arrangements with external powers, acquire additional weapons, and consider pursuing their own nuclear ambitions. It is not clear that the type of stable deterrent relationship that existed between the great powers for most of the Cold War would emerge naturally in the Middle East with a nuclear Iran. Episodes of low intensity conflict and terrorism taking place under a nuclear umbrella could lead to an unintended escalation and broader conflict if clear red lines between those states involved are not well established. The close proximity of potential nuclear rivals combined with underdeveloped surveillance capabilities and mobile dual-capable Iranian missile systems also will produce inherent difficulties in achieving reliable indications and warning of an impending nuclear attack. The lack of strategic depth in neighboring states like Israel, short warning and missile flight times, and uncertainty of Iranian intentions may place more focus on preemption rather than defense, potentially leading to escalating crises. 36 Types of conflict that the world continues to experience, such as over resources, could reemerge, particularly if protectionism grows and there is a resort to neo-mercantilist practices. Perceptions of renewed energy scarcity will drive countries to take actions to assure their future access to energy supplies. In the worst case, this could result in interstate conflicts if government leaders deem assured access to energy resources, for example, to be essential for maintaining domestic stability and the survival of their regime. Even actions short of war, however, will have important geopolitical implications. Maritime security concerns are providing a rationale for naval buildups and modernization efforts, such as China’s and India’s development of blue water naval capabilities. If the fiscal stimulus focus for these countries indeed turns inward, one of the most obvious funding targets may be military. Buildup of regional naval capabilities could lead to increased tensions, rivalries, and counterbalancing moves, but it also will create opportunities for multinational cooperation in protecting critical sea lanes. With water also becoming scarcer in Asia and the Middle East, cooperation to manage changing water resources is likely to be increasingly difficult both within and between states in a more dog-eat-dog world. <br />
<strong>And, this undermines the entire WTO</strong><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">Globe Advisor 10</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: none;"> (30 September 2010, “Congress flexes muscle over China's yuan”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://secure.globeadvisor.com/servlet/ArticleNews/story/gam/20100930/RBCURRENCYUS0930ATL" rel="nofollow">https://secure.globeadvisor.com/servlet/ArticleNews/story/gam/20100930/RBCURRENCYUS0930ATL</a>, RBatra)</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">U.S. lawmakers are taking direct aim at China's economic policies, endorsing legislation that would allow companies to seek retribution for lost sales due to undervalued currencies such as the yuan. The House of Representatives voted 348-79 Wednesday to amend the 1930 Tariff Act to make clear that &quot;fundamental exchange-rate misalignment&quot; is a punishable subsidy under American trade law. The change, if enacted, would require the U.S. Trade Representative to consider complaints of harm due to foreign currency policies, opening the door to countervailing import duties. China isn't mentioned in the bill, but the target of the measure's authors is clear. As lawmakers considered the legislation at committee last week, the debate was all about China, which politicians, unions and some companies have long accused of benefiting from the active management of its exchange rate at the expense of lost American jobs. Estimates suggest the yuan is undervalued relative to the dollar by anywhere from 5 to 40 per cent. With midterm elections little more than a month away, and the country's unemployment rate stuck above 9.5 per cent two years after the financial crisis, some political show of force against China was all but inevitable. &quot;We want China to know that we're all standing shoulder-to-shoulder for fair trade,&quot; Pennsylvania Republican Tim Murphy, the bill's co-sponsor, told Bloomberg Television before the vote. The China measure has a long way to go before becoming law. The Senate and the president also would have to approve it, and it's unclear whether either would do so. Still, the vote represents a shift in the politics that surround China's economic policies. For all the vitriol spilled on China's currency practices in recent years, the House until Wednesday had stopped short of endorsing a legislative remedy directed at Beijing's policy of keeping the yuan pegged at an advantageous rate against the dollar. Politicians may well be bluffing - many said during the debate that their goal is to give Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner a &quot;stick&quot; to help in negotiations with the Chinese. But the fact that there now is legislation on the table necessarily increases the risk of a trade war between the world's two largest economies. It also threatens to set a precedent for other countries that have issues with the currency policies of China and other countries. &quot;It is important to keep the pressure on China to re-align its currency, but if countries start trying to countervail on the basis of exchange rates, we could be on a pretty slippery and dangerous slope in terms of respect for the integrity of WTO rules,&quot; said Lawrence Herman, a trade lawyer at Cassels Brock in Toronto.</span></span><br />
<strong>The impact is global super power wars – there’s no alternative to multilateral trade – it is a pre-requisite for global stability</strong> <br />
<strong>Panitchpakdi, 4</strong> – Secretary-General of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Supachai, “American Leadership and the World Trade Organization: What is the Alternative?” 2/26/2004, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4006:http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/spsp_e/spsp22_e.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/spsp_e/spsp22_e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/spsp_e/spsp22_e.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4006 -->)<br />
The second point is that strengthening the world trading system is essential to America's wider global objectives. Fighting terrorism, reducing poverty, improving health, integrating China and other countries in the global economy — all of these issues are linked, in one way or another, to world trade. This is not to say that trade is the answer to all America's economic concerns; only that meaningful solutions are inconceivable without it. The world trading system is the linchpin of today's global order — underpinning its security as well as its prosperity. A successful WTO is an example of how multilateralism can work. Conversely, if it weakens or fails, much else could fail with it. This is something which the US — at the epicentre of a more interdependent world — cannot afford to ignore. These priorities must continue to guide US policy — as they have done since the Second World War. America has been the main driving force behind eight rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, including the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the creation of the WTO. The US — together with the EU — was instrumental in launching the latest Doha Round two years ago. Likewise, the recent initiative, spearheaded by Ambassador Zoellick, to re-energize the negotiations and move them towards a successful conclusion is yet another example of how essential the US is to the multilateral process — signalling that the US remains committed to further liberalization, that the Round is moving, and that other countries have a tangible reason to get on board. The reality is this: when the US leads the system can move forward; when it withdraws, the system drifts. The fact that US leadership is essential, does not mean it is easy. As WTO rules have expanded, so too has as the complexity of the issues the WTO deals with — everything from agriculture and accounting, to tariffs and telecommunication. The WTO is also exerting huge gravitational pull on countries to join — and participate actively — in the system. The WTO now has 146 Members — up from just 23 in 1947 — and this could easily rise to 170 or more within a decade. Emerging powers like China, Brazil, and India rightly demand a greater say in an institution in which they have a growing stake. So too do a rising number of voices outside the system as well. More and more people recognize that the WTO matters. More non-state actors — businesses, unions, environmentalists, development NGOs — want the multilateral system to reflect their causes and concerns. A decade ago, few people had even heard of the GATT. Today the WTO is front page news. A more visible WTO has inevitably become a more politicized WTO. The sound and fury surrounding the WTO's recent Ministerial Meeting in Cancun — let alone Seattle — underline how challenging managing the WTO can be. But these challenges can be exaggerated. They exist precisely because so many countries have embraced a common vision. Countries the world over have turned to open trade — and a rules-based system — as the key to their growth and development. They agreed to the Doha Round because they believed their interests lay in freer trade, stronger rules, a more effective WTO. Even in Cancun the great debate was whether the multilateral trading system was moving fast and far enough — not whether it should be rolled back. Indeed, it is critically important that we draw the right conclusions from Cancun — which are only now becoming clearer. The disappointment was that ministers were unable to reach agreement. The achievement was that they exposed the risks of failure, highlighted the need for North-South collaboration, and — after a period of introspection — acknowledged the inescapable logic of negotiation. Cancun showed that, if the challenges have increased, it is because the stakes are higher. The bigger challenge to American leadership comes from inside — not outside — the United States. In America's current debate about trade, jobs and globalization we have heard a lot about the costs of liberalization. We need to hear more about the opportunities. We need to be reminded of the advantages of America's openness and its trade with the world — about the economic growth tied to exports; the inflation-fighting role of imports, the innovative stimulus of global competition. We need to explain that freer trade works precisely because it involves positive change — better products, better job opportunities, better ways of doing things, better standards of living. While it is true that change can be threatening for people and societies, it is equally true that the vulnerable are not helped by resisting change — by putting up barriers and shutting out competition. They are helped by training, education, new and better opportunities that — with the right support policies — can flow from a globalized economy. The fact is that for every job in the US threatened by imports there is a growing number of high-paid, high skill jobs created by exports. Exports supported 7 million workers a decade ago; that number is approaching around 12 million today. And these new jobs — in aerospace, finance, information technology — pay 10 per cent more than the average American wage. We especially need to inject some clarity — and facts — into the current debate over the outsourcing of services jobs. Over the next decade, the US is projected to create an average of more than 2 million new services jobs a year — compared to roughly 200,000 services jobs that will be outsourced. I am well aware that this issue is the source of much anxiety in America today. Many Americans worry about the potential job losses that might arise from foreign competition in services sectors. But it’s worth remembering that concerns about the impact of foreign competition are not new. Many of the reservations people are expressing today are echoes of what we heard in the 1970s and 1980s. But people at that time didn’t fully appreciate the power of American ingenuity. Remarkable advances in technology and productivity laid the foundation for unprecedented job creation in the 1990s and there is no reason to doubt that this country, which has shown time and again such remarkable potential for competing in the global economy, will not soon embark again on such a burst of job-creation. America's openness to service-sector trade — combined with the high skills of its workforce — will lead to more growth, stronger industries, and a shift towards higher value-added, higher-paying employment. Conversely, closing the door to service trade is a strategy for killing jobs, not saving them. Americans have never run from a challenge and have never been defeatist in the face of strong competition. Part of this challenge is to create the conditions for global growth and job creation here and around the world. I believe Americans realize what is at stake. The process of opening to global trade can be disruptive, but they recognize that the US economy cannot grow and prosper any other way. They recognize the importance of finding global solutions to shared global problems. Besides, what is the alternative to the WTO? Some argue that the world's only superpower need not be tied down by the constraints of the multilateral system. They claim that US sovereignty is compromised by international rules, and that multilateral institutions limit rather than expand US influence. Americans should be deeply sceptical about these claims. Almost none of the trade issues facing the US today are any easier to solve unilaterally, bilaterally or regionally. The reality is probably just the opposite. What sense does it make — for example — to negotiate e-commerce rules bilaterally? Who would be interested in disciplining agricultural subsidies in a regional agreement but not globally? How can bilateral deals — even dozens of them — come close to matching the economic impact of agreeing to global free trade among 146 countries? Bilateral and regional deals can sometimes be a complement to the multilateral system, but they can never be a substitute. There is a bigger danger. By treating some countries preferentially, bilateral and regional deals exclude others — fragmenting global trade and distorting the world economy. Instead of liberalizing trade — and widening growth — they carve it up. Worse, they have a domino effect: bilateral deals inevitably beget more bilateral deals, as countries left outside are forced to seek their own preferential arrangements, or risk further marginalization. This is precisely what we see happening today. There are already over two hundred bilateral and regional agreements in existence, and each month we hear of a new or expanded deal. There is a basic contradiction in the assumption that bilateral approaches serve to strengthen the multilateral, rules-based system. Even when intended to spur free trade, they can ultimately risk undermining it. This is in no one's interest, least of all the United States. America led in the creation of the multilateral system after 1945 precisely to avoid a return to hostile blocs — blocs that had done so much to fuel interwar instability and conflict. America's vision, in the words of Cordell Hull, was that “enduring peace and the welfare of nations was indissolubly connected with the friendliness, fairness and freedom of world trade”. Trade would bind nations together, making another war unthinkable. Non-discriminatory rules would prevent a return to preferential deals and closed alliances. A network of multilateral initiatives and organizations — the Marshal Plan, the IMF, the World Bank, and the GATT, now the WTO — would provide the institutional bedrock for the international rule of law, not power. Underpinning all this was the idea that freedom — free trade, free democracies, the free exchange of ideas — was essential to peace and prosperity, a more just world. It is a vision that has emerged pre-eminent a half century later. Trade has expanded twenty-fold since 1950. Millions in Asia, Latin America, and Africa are being lifted out of poverty, and millions more have new hope for the future. All the great powers — the US, Europe, Japan, India, China and soon Russia — are part of a rules-based multilateral trading system, greatly increasing the chances for world prosperity and peace. There is a growing realization that — in our interdependent world — sovereignty is constrained, not by multilateral rules, but by the absence of rules. All of these were America’s objectives. The US needs to be both clearer about the magnitude of what it has achieved, and more realistic about what it is trying to — and can — accomplish. Multilateralism can be slow, messy, and tortuous. But it is also indispensable to managing an increasingly integrated global economy. Multilateralism is based on the belief that all countries — even powerful countries like the United States — are made stronger and more secure through international co-operation and rules, and by working to strengthen one another from within a system, not outside of it. Multilateralism's greatest ideal is the ideal of negotiation, compromise, consensus, not coercion. As Churchill said of democracy, it is the worst possible system except for all the others. I do not believe America's long-term economic interests have changed. Nor do I believe that America's vision for a just international order has become blurred. If anything, the American vision has been sharpened since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington; sharpened by the realization that there is now a new struggle globally between the forces of openness and modernity, and the forces of separatism and reaction. More than ever, America's interests lie in an open world economy resting on the foundation of a strong, rules-based multilateral system. More and more, America's growth and security are tied to the growth and security of the world economy as a whole. American leadership today is more — not less — important to our increasingly interconnected planet. A recent successful, and much needed, example is the multilateral agreement on intellectual property rights and access to medicines for poor countries, in which the US played a pivotal role. It would be a tragic mistake if the Doha Round, which offers the world a once-in-a-generation opportunity to eliminate trade distortions, to strengthen trade rules, and open markets across the world, were allowed to founder. We need courage and the collective political will to ensure a balanced and equitable outcome. What is the alternative? It is a fragmented world, with greater conflict and uncertainty. A world of the past, not the future — one that America turned away from after 1945, and that we should reject just as decisively today. America must lead. The multilateral trading system is too important to fail. The world depends on it. So does America.<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Unfortunately, China has failed to maintain this positive momentum in its foreign policy, damaging U.S.-Chinese relations in the process. The most dramatic change is in its North Korea policy: rather than pressuring Pyongyang after its nuclear and missile tests in the spring of 2009, Beijing seems to have doubled down on its economic and political ties with Kim Jong Il's regime. Knowledgeable observers believe that trade and investment relations between China and North Korea have deepened over the past three years. There has also been frequent high-level public diplomacy between Chinese and North Korean leaders, including two visits by Kim to China last year. Last October, Zhou Yongkang, a member of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee, stood with top members of the Kim regime during the Korean Workers'Party's anniversary celebration. This attention was most welcome in Pyongyang during the regime's sensitive transition period, in which Kim has been grooming his youngest son, Kim Jong Un, to eventually take over.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Driven by the fear of a precipitous collapse of a neighboring communist regime and the reduction of Chinese influence on the Korean Peninsula, Beijing has fallen back on long-held conservative Communist Party foreign policy principles in backing North Korea. In particular, it stood by the Kim regime during the course of several crises sparked by Pyongyang last year. In May, an international commission determined that a North Korean submarine had indeed sunk the South Korean naval ship Cheonan in March; for its part, China refused to review the evidence and protected North Korea from facing direct criticism in the un Security Council. In so doing, Chinese leaders alienated many in the international community, especially South Korea, Japan, and the United States. Beijing similarly protected North Korea from international condemnation after Pyongyang revealed last fall that it had secretly developed a uranium-enrichment facility. And then, after North Korea shelled a South Korean island in November, Beijing once again adopted an agnostic pose, simply calling for calm and warning all sides against any further escalation. The only specific warning it could muster was its ultimately unsuccessful effort to dissuade U.S. warships involved in joint U.S.-South Korean naval exercises from entering the Yellow Sea, which overlaps with China's exclusive economic zone.</span></span><br />

<strong>U.S. forces in South Korea serve as an incentive for Russia to back North Korea</strong><br />
<strong>Nikonov 10</strong>—Russian political scientist, PhD in history, edited by Georgy D. Toloraya, Visiting Fellow at the Brookings Institution, PhD and Doctor of Economy (Vyacheslav A., 7 October 2010, The Korean Peninsula: Challenges and Opportunities for Russia, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nautilus.org/publications/essays/napsnet/sr/the-korean-peninsula-challenges-and-opportunities-for-russia" rel="nofollow">http://www.nautilus.org/publications/essays/napsnet/sr/the-korean-peninsula-challenges-and-opportunities-for-russia</a>, RBatra)<br />
However, it would be prudent to hedge our risks, as we cannot completely rule out the possibility of a sudden crisis that could lead to a rushed unification. The uncontrollable escalation of the Korean conflict remains a possibility, and the task of Russian policy is to not allow the “explosive” scenario to unfold and to explain that the most advantageous scenario is gradual convergence, which at the appropriate time would put voluntary rapprochement of state mechanisms on the agenda. At the start this could possibly be some form of confederation on the path to a unified state, if this is what the populations of North and South want. Such an outcome, however, is not guaranteed. There are many examples in the world of ethnically affiliated states thriving in close contact but without unification. In any case, it would be preferable that the Korean state be neutral, peaceful and without a foreign military presence on its territory. <br />
On the whole, for Russia, considering its current capabilities, the most relevant objective is not attaining predominate position in Korea but rather not allowing the situation to develop such that the entire peninsula to fall under the influence of another state, especially a state that is not on truly friendly terms with Russia. Considering the current balance of forces in Northeast Asia and our economic capabilities, the development of such a scenario cannot be completely ruled out. Thus for us in the short and mid-term perspective it is advantageous for North Korea to exist as a sovereign state, playing the role of a sort of buffer to the geopolitical ambitions of the United States in the region.<br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>And, that constrains South Korea’s cooperation with Russia—the plan ensures broad collaboration</strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Korea Times 10</strong> (30 September 2010, “Russo-Korean ties”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2010/09/137_73777.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2010/09/137_73777.html</a>, RBatra)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">It is safe to say that Russia has been, is and will be an opportunity and a challenge for Korea at the same time. The two neighbors have great potential for collaboration in every field. Russia has the world’s largest deposit of natural gas. It is also rich in coal, crude oil and other natural resources.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Despite such ample opportunities, the two countries are still faced with challenges. Frankly speaking, there have been ups and downs in their relationship. Seoul and Moscow have gone through on-and-off tensions and conflicts over the past 20 years.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The latest conflict has emerged since Moscow refused to support Seoul’s efforts to hold Pyongyang culpable for the March 26 sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan. The Russian military has made its own report on the naval incident, repudiating a Seoul-led international investigation team’s conclusion that North Korea attacked the vessel.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">No doubt Moscow is engaged in equidistance diplomacy between Seoul and Pyongyang. Russia is trying to seek its national interest while claiming its stake in North Korea to regain its clout in East Asia. It is also true that Russia has been more or less dissatisfied with South Korea’s long-standing emphasis on ties with its traditional ally ― the United States.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Since his inauguration, President Lee has set in motion his much-avowed “pragmatic diplomacy” to have better ties with the Big Four powers ― the U.S., Japan, China and Russia. But his policy has yet to pass a test as China and Russia have stood behind the North Korea in what appears to be a new Cold War against South Korea and the U.S. in the wake of the naval tragedy.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">In this context, Seoul and Moscow should defuse such an outdated alignment if they really want to forge strategic partnership and maximize their potential for cooperation and co-prosperity. It’s time for them to have better understanding of each other and build trust to go beyond the complex geopolitics.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>That solves Asian energy security</strong><br />

Prior to the end of the Cold War, North Korea was an ally of Russia. But their alliance ended with the collapse of the bipolar system. Chinese analysts note that Russia placed more emphasis on its relations with the West in the early 1990s. The situation began to change in the mid-1990s, when Russian leaders were said to have decided to strengthen Russia’s relations with its East Asian neighbours. Through a series of treaties, the relations between Moscow and Pyongyang improved substantially which culminated in President Putin’s visit to North Korea in July 2000. In return, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, paid two visits to Moscow in 2001 and 2002, respectively. During his visit to Russia in August 2002, Kim Jong-il was believed to have reached a consensus with Putin on a range of security issues, including the situation on the Korean Peninsula. They also explored opportunities for economic cooperation between the two nations. This, say the Chinese, provided the foundation on which Russia was able to play a useful role in tackling the recent North Korean nuclear crisis (Wang Bingyin 2003a: 11–12).<br />
According to Chinese analysis, Russia has specific interests in the Korean Peninsula. First and foremost is the economic consideration in Russia’s policy towards the area. As one of the ‘four little tigers’ in East Asia, South Korea is believed to have a lot to offer in Russia’s struggle to revive its economy. In particular, Russia can benefit considerably from South Korea’s capital, information technology and experience in production and management skills. Putin is reported to have said in Seoul that it is important to improve Russia’s investment environment in order to attract South Korean investment. PRC scholars have noticed an improved relationship between Russia and South Korea, which has developed rapidly since the early 1990s. Quoting Russian statistics the Chinese pointed to the increase in their trade volume from US$6 billion in 1990 to US$16.89 billion in 2001. But it is not just South Korea that is considered economically useful to Russia. North Korea also has some economic value to Moscow. Apart from its cheap labour, Pyongyang is potentially an attractive market for Russian weapons export. With the decline of the military-industrial complex in Russia, observe the Chinese, Moscow is desperately trying to increase its revenue through export of military equipment and military technology (Wang Bingyin and Zhou Yanli 2001:26; Wang Bingyin 2003a: 12).<br />
Chinese scholars point out that there is a great potential for energy cooperation among Russia, North Korea and South Korea. Russia is known to be rich in oil reserves, whilst North and South Korea are both reliant on oil imports for their economies. Russia’s proposal of repairing and constructing the Siberian network connecting the two Koreas is particularly welcomed by both countries. The Russian government is also said to have proposed the construction of an oil pipeline running from Russia through Mongolia and China to the two Koreas. If these plans were to be successfully implemented, say the Chinese, Russia would certainly be able to increase its energy exports, and North Korea, South Korea, China and Japan would all receive stable, secure and cheap energy supplies (Wang Bingyin and Zhou Yanli 2001:25–26).<br />

<span class="Underline">The resulting massive re-deployment of resources has increased global growth, but has also created economic and political conflicts, both within and among nations. These conflicts are manifesting themselves as rising protectionist pressures around the world.2</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Rising economic activity has also increased Asia’s energy needs faster than can be provided by local supplies. This is increasing Asia’s reliance on locally available coal supplies, which has costly implications for air and water resources. And it is increasing Asia’s reliance on oil and gas imports from the troubled and potentially unstable Middle East, where the lion’s share of the world’s known oil and gas reserves is located. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Without secure future energy supplies a nation cannot provide its people with the stable political and economic environment that underpins strong and sustainable economic growth. This is especially important for Asian nations, where the imbalance between scarce energy resources, large populations, and growing incomes is greater than in other areas.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">For emerging economy governments, whose people have tasted rising incomes, halting growth is not an option. Energy security—securing long term access to the energy resources that Asian nations need to provide sustainable long-term growth and rising living standards for their people-has become an urgent matter for Asian governments.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Some governments are taking steps to attack the energy security problem by increasing exploration for new resources, investing in resources outside their borders, undertaking long-term supply contracts, expanding use of nuclear power, investing in alternative fuel technologies and encouraging conservation.3 Yet, in spite of great efforts and some successes, the ADB’s Asian Development Outlook4 forecasts rising Asian oil and gas imports in the years ahead. The energy security problem grows larger every year. Access to energy resources is the most likely cause of future conflict among nations. Clearly, we need new thinking to solve this problem. </span><br />

One analyst, Gaurav Kampani, summarized the problem arrestingly: Three out of the world’s four remaining states suspected of possessing chemical weapons are in Asia, and all of the states with biological weapons programs are Asian as well. Similarly, five of the current eight nuclear weapon powers are located on the continent, which is also home to the two other countries widely suspected of pursuing nuclear weapons programs—North Korea and Iran. The intersection of mass destruction capabilities and the rise of religious extremism, political disaffection, economic disarray, and deep interstate and intrastate conflicts make Asia the most disaster- prone region in the world.89<br />

<span class="Underline">Aside from the dependence on imports from the Middle East, there is also a danger of tension stemming from such an oil shortage within the Asia-Pacific region itself. The growing demand for energy may strain relations between such important regional actors as China and Japan, for example, which may then engender a set of new destabilizing regional or international conflicts. But an even more immediate problem is the effect of oil market volatility on the region, with the sharp rise in oil prices putting particular pressure on the currencies of some crude importing emerging market countries and the dangers of soaring current account deficits and weaker economic growth. This also threatens to impact the record of growth that has served as the driving force for Asian stability and development since the end of World War II. And while Asia is seen as the most affected region, the surge in oil prices, an increase of 48% over the last two years, also threatens other struggling oil importers.</span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>The plan boosts U.S.-Russia relations</strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Meyer 5</strong>—professor of political science, B.A. Wellesley College, M.A. Columbia University, Ph.D. Columbia University (Peggy Falkenheim, Fall/ Winter 2005, International Journal of Korean Studies, “Russia’s Interests and Objectives on the Korean Peninsula”, RBatra)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">While wanting to resolve the nuclear crisis in a way that preserves its current good relations with the two Koreas, Russia also wants to avoid harm to its ties with the United States. On this issue, one can detect significant differences of opinion in Russia. Since his accession to power, Putin has pursued a multidirectional foreign policy aimed at increasing Russian influence by improving relations with a wide variety of states. There are inherent problems and contradictions in a policy that aims simultaneously to court North Korea and other &quot;rogue states&quot; and to improve relations with Washington. Further confusing the matter is Putin's tendency to say different things to different people, gearing his statements to what his audience wants to hear.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Putin himself seems to recognize the importance of maintaining good relations with the United States. His administration is trying to repair the damage to U.S.-Russian relations done by Moscow's opposition to the U.S. war in Iraq and to limit the potential damage from differences over the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">This juggling act is not easy. It is complicated by the presence within the Putin administration of hard liners who are viscerally anti-Western. Outside the Putin administration, there are broad differences in attitudes toward the United States and toward U.S. policy in Northeast Asia.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">One group of former officials and Korea specialists continues to view the U.S. presence and U.S. influence in Northeast Asia from what could be described as a cold war perspective. One proponent of this perspective is Zhebin who goes even farther than current Russian officials in blaming U.S. policy for the origins of the North Korean nuclear crisis. Zhebin presents a lengthy argument explaining how Washington's failure to fulfill the terms of the Agreed Framework induced North Korea to restart its nuclear reactors and to renounce participation in the nonproliferation regime. Zhebin argues that the U.S. deliberately provoked the crisis to prevent a rapprochement between North and South Korea. He claims that Washington does not want relations between Pyongyang and Seoul to improve because the U.S. needs the North Korean threat to justify its missile defense program so it can claim that it is not directed against China and Russia. Zhebin perceives Washington's ultimate aim as regime change in North Korea, not resolution of the nuclear crisis.23</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Active diplomacy in this direction is especially important for Russia in the context of its global relations with the “centers of power.” As Russia is increasingly seen as an opponent if not a foe of the West (e.g., the expression “the new cold war” has already been coined), it would be natural to think its cooperation with the United States on global issues would be limited at best. However, this logic should not necessarily apply in the Korean case, which might well be considered a special one in Russia-U.S. international dealings. U.S.-Russia cooperation in the framework of the 6PT might have much wider global implications.53 </span><br />
<span class="Underline">At the same time, Moscow conservatives still fear that a full-fledged OSCE-type structure might only increase the U.S. hold on the region without producing tangible benefits for Russia or for other regional actors. They argue that Washington only pursues its own interests and is trying to strengthen its foothold in the area. Under this logic a new security architecture might harness not only its allies but also China and Russia in a framework where the United States, not being a geographical part of the region, would have rights but not obligations. </span><br />

<strong>Relations solve extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Collins &amp; Rojansky 10</strong> – * U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation from 1997 to 2001, AND **deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment (8/18/10, James F. Collins, Matthew Rojansky, Foreign Policy, “Why Russia Matters,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=41409" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=41409</a>, JMP)<br />
A year and a half after Barack Obama hit the &quot;reset&quot; button with Russia, the reconciliation is still fragile, incomplete, and politically divisive. Sure, Russia is no easy ally for the United States. Authoritarian yet insecure, economically mighty yet technologically backward, the country has proven a challenge for U.S. presidents since the end of the Cold War. Recent news hasn't helped: The arrest in July of a former deputy prime minister and leader of the Solidarity opposition movement, Boris Nemtsov, provoked some of the harshest criticism of Russia yet from the Obama administration. Then last Wednesday, Russia announced that it had moved anti-aircraft missiles into Abkhazia, the region that broke off from Georgia during the August 2008 war. The announcement was hardly welcome news for the United States, which has tried to defuse tensions there for the last 24 months. Yet however challenging this partnership may be, Washington can't afford not to work with Moscow. Ronald Reagan popularized the phrase, &quot;Trust, but verify&quot; -- a good guiding principle for Cold War arms negotiators, and still apt for today. Engagement is the only way forward. Here are 10 reasons why: 1. Russia's nukes are still an existential threat. Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Russia has thousands of nuclear weapons in stockpile and hundreds still on hair-trigger alert aimed at U.S. cities. This threat will not go away on its own; cutting down the arsenal will require direct, bilateral arms control talks between Russia and the United States. New START, the strategic nuclear weapons treaty now up for debate in the Senate, is the latest in a long line of bilateral arms control agreements between the countries dating back to the height of the Cold War. To this day, it remains the only mechanism granting U.S. inspectors access to secret Russian nuclear sites. The original START agreement was essential for reining in the runaway Cold War nuclear buildup, and New START promises to cut deployed strategic arsenals by a further 30 percent from a current limit of 2,200 to 1,550 on each side. Even more, President Obama and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, have agreed to a long-term goal of eliminating nuclear weapons entirely. But they can only do that by working together. 2. Russia is a swing vote on the international stage. As one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Moscow holds veto power over any resolution that the body might seek to pass -- including recent efforts to levy tougher sanctions on Iran or, in 2009, against North Korea following that country's second nuclear test. Russian support for such resolutions can also help persuade China and others not to block them. The post-reset relationship between Moscow and Washington works like a force multiplier for U.S. diplomacy. Russia plays an equally crucial role in the G-8 and G-20 economic groups, helping to formulate a coordinated approach in response to economic threats. In 2008, for example, Russia supported a G-20 resolution promising to refrain from protectionism and avoid new barriers to investment or trade. 3. Russia is big. The country's borders span across Europe, Central and East Asia, and the Arctic -- all regions where the United States has important interests and where it cannot afford destructive competition. With an ongoing counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan, the United States has a strong interest in Central Asian stability and relies on Russia not only for direct assistance with logistics and information sharing, but to help manage threats like the recent political upheaval and sectarian violence in Kyrgyzstan. In the former Soviet space, Moscow's historical ties to newly independent states are still fresh and powerful. Moscow is the linchpin to resolving &quot;frozen conflicts&quot; that prevent countries like Moldova, Georgia, and Azerbaijan from prospering economically and moving toward European Union membership. Recently, for example, Moscow signaled renewed interest in resolving frozen conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria. And despite recent troop movements into Abkhazia, a negotiated settlement is still very possible, one that returns some territory to Georgia but preserves its autonomous status, along with that of its fellow breakaway republic, South Ossetia. 4. Russia's environment matters. As the catastrophic fires across Western Russia have dramatically illustrated, Russia is both a victim of global climate change and a steward of natural resources -- including many of the forests now badly burned -- needed to reverse the global warming trend. With more than one-tenth of the world's total landmass, vast freshwater and ocean resources, plus deposits of nearly every element on the periodic table, Russia is an indispensable partner in the responsible stewardship of the global environment. On climate change, there is work to be done, but progress is evident. Russia today is the world's fourth-largest carbon emitter, but as a signatory to the Copenhagen Accord, it has pledged to reduce emissions to 20 to 25 percent below 1990 levels. Another black spot is Russia's use of &quot;flaring&quot; -- a technique that burns natural gas into the open atmosphere during oil extraction, but Medvedev agreed to capture 95 percent of the gas currently released through flaring. Last year he also signed Russia's first law on energy efficiency, which takes such steps as requiring goods to be marked according to their energy efficiency and banning incandescent light bulbs after 2014. True, most of Russia's other commitments are short on deadlines and concrete deliverables. But like China's cleanup for the Beijing Olympics, Moscow could transform resolve into reality with surprising speed, given the right amount of international engagement. And in the meantime, Russia's natural climate-cleaning properties are vast; the Siberian provinces alone contain more clean oxygen-producing forests and reserves of freshwater than continental Europe. 5. Russia is rich. As the &quot;R&quot; in the famous BRIC grouping of emerging economies, Russia is the 12th-largest market in world, with the third-largest foreign currency reserves. And the country's role in world markets is only growing. Russia is a big player in commodity trading, the country boasts a volatile but increasingly attractive stock exchange, and it is open to foreign investment -- even in state-owned industries. Russian businesses are increasingly looking abroad to form strategic partnerships, acquire assets, and sell their products. And as a country that felt the global financial crisis viscerally -- economic growth fell by almost 8 percent in 2009 -- Russia has a strong interest in making sure there is no repeat. Despite occasional retrenchments, such as the ban on grain exports after the summer fires, Russia is committed to becoming a free-trading World Trade Organization member, and wants more access to U.S. and European technology and management know-how to drive its modernization. Excessive bureaucracy and widespread corruption are the biggest challenges to Russia's further economic growth, but these are already top talking points in Medvedev's modernization drive, and engagement with more transparent Western countries such as the United States can only help. 6. One word: energy. The American way of life depends on stable and predictable commodity prices -- gasoline, natural gas, and coal in particular -- and Russia plays a large role in the global production and pricing of these fossil fuels. Russia alone possesses roughly one-quarter of the world's known gas reserves, and it is currently responsible for over a fifth of global exports. It is the second largest oil-producing state after Saudi Arabia and has the second-largest coal reserves after the United States. The even better news for Washington is that Russia is not a member of OPEC, the cartel of oil-producing countries. This gives the country far more freedom to focus on increasing exports rather than reducing them to keep prices down. When it comes to bringing supply to market, many will no doubt remember the so-called gas wars between Russia and Ukraine and Russia and Belarus that left Eastern Europe in the cold several times in recent years. Much of the trouble is attributable to the legacy of Soviet energy infrastructure in Russia's western neighbors, which put a choke-hold on Russia's gas pipelines. Moscow is currently working with the United States, China, and Western Europe to find a way around this problem, which will entail building new pipelines through the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Siberia. 7. Russia is a staunch ally in the war on terror (and other scourges). Even during the dark days after the 2008 Russia-Georgia war, Moscow and Washington cooperated effectively on counterterrorism, counternarcotics, infectious disease prevention and response, and other shared security priorities. Recently, the two have worked together under the auspices of the Bilateral Presidential Commission to coordinate relief strategies for catastrophes such as the Haiti earthquake and the violence in Kyrgyzstan. Both Washington and Moscow recognize that swift, well-organized responses to such crises are key to preventing weaknesses from being exploited -- for example by extremist groups who are happy to fill the vacuum of government authority. Russia is also a critical partner in U.S. law enforcement efforts to defeat organized crime and terrorism financing. The two countries are currently working to map smuggling routes in Central Asia. And Russia has shared information with the United States on the informal financial networks used to fund Taliban and Afghan warlords. 8. The roads to Tehran and Pyongyang go through Moscow. Russia maintains unique relationships with Iran and North Korea -- both top concerns on Washington's nuclear nonproliferation radar. In the past, the Kremlin has used its leverage to keep the path open for negotiations, sending senior diplomats to Tehran and offering carrots such as civilian nuclear assistance and weapons sales (though it has deferred the sale of advanced S-300 ground-to-air missiles that could be used to blunt a U.S. or Israeli air strike). Now more than ever, Washington needs allies with that kind of leverage to help punish violators and discourage cascading nuclear proliferation worldwide. Leading by example on nonproliferation is also a must; as the world's biggest nuclear powers, the United States and Russia are looked to as the standard-setters. If they fail to ratify their latest modest step forward on bilateral nuclear arms control, it will be difficult to push other countries to take similar counter-proliferation measures. 9. Russia can be a peacemaker. Moscow has the potential to play a role in the settlement of key regional conflicts -- or if it chooses, to obstruct progress. Russia is a member of the Middle East &quot;Quartet,&quot; the six-party talks dealing with North Korean denuclearization, and each of the working groups addressing conflicts in the post-Soviet space, such as the OSCE Minsk group on Nagorno-Karabakh, and the 5+2 group on Transnistria. In such post-Soviet regions in particular, Russia has a unique capacity to contribute to peaceful resolution of territorial disputes by facilitating trade and economic engagement with and between former adversaries, and acting as a peacekeeper once a final settlement is reached. In the Middle East, Russia still controls a network of commercial and intelligence assets and has substantial influence with the Syrians, who should be pushed to play a more productive role in the Arab-Israeli peace process. 10. Russians buy U.S. goods. As the U.S. economy stops and starts its way out of recession, most everyone agrees that boosting exports is a key component in the recovery. And Russia is a big market. U.S. companies such as Boeing, International Paper, and John Deere have invested billions in Russian subsidiaries and joint ventures. In all, there are more than 1,000 U.S. companies doing business there today. They are in Russia not only to take advantage of the country's vast natural resources and highly skilled workers but also to meet the demand for American-branded goods. The Russian middle class wants consumer goods and the country's firms increasingly seek advanced U.S. equipment and machinery. Between 2004 and 2008, before the financial crisis hit, U.S.-Russia trade grew by more than 100 percent to over $36 billion annually, and although that figure dropped by a third in 2009, there is potential for an even better, more balanced trade relationship in the coming decade. In short, Russia is indispensible. As long as the United States participates in the global economy and has interests beyond its own borders, it will have no choice but to maintain relations with Russia. And good relations would be even better.<br />

 Contention One: North Korea<br />
U.S. deterrence in Korea fails and only provokes the North. The root cause of all prior attacks as well as North Korean prolif is U.S. hostile policy. Only troop withdrawal prevents war with North Korea and China.<br />

The US-ROK joint military exercises not merely prepare for a possible invasion of North Korea but they also serve as weapons of attrition. They force North Korea to devote much more of its resources to the military than it would if there were no palpable threat. An important component of the exercise is their element of ambiguity. The Korean People’s Army (KPA) can never be sure when a feint might become the real thing, so every exercise has to be taken very seriously. The translation of this commentary from the Rodong Sinmun on the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises in 2009 may be fractured but the underling fear of attack is clear: The said largest-scale saber rattling kicked off by the U.S. imperialists against the DPRK at a time when their scenario for the second Korean war is at the final stage of completion is a very adventurous and dangerous military provocation that can be seen only on the eve of a war, and this is an undisguised military threat and a sort of declaration of war against the DPRK. No one can vouch that the U.S. imperialist bellicose elements will not ignite a war against the DPRK by surprise while reinforcing armed forces and staging war maneuvers in south Korea and its vicinity as they did in Iraq.[18] It is important to note that the clash at Yeonpyeong Island coincided with a substantial military exercise, the Hoguk (‘Safeguarding the Nation’): North Korea fired the artillery during South Korea’s military drill called the Hoguk Exercise on Nov. 22-30 that involves 70,000 South Korean military troops, 50 warships, 90 helicopters and 500 planes. The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) of U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Seventh Air Force will also participate in the exercise.[19] The scheduled participation of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is particularly significant.[20] The 31st MEU is based in Okinawa and it is America’s ‘forward deployed rapid-response’ unit in East Asia. It trains with the ROK marines practicing beach landings, but its major specialism appears to be urban warfare. [21] One of its possible functions is to mount a commando type raid on the DPRK. A Japanese scholar writing in the authoritative PACNET newsletter of Pacific Forum CSIS (the Honolulu branch of the Washington think tank Center for Strategic and International studies rather gave the game away about the ‘North Korean threat’ by putting it thus: As a collapse of North Korea -- rather than a North Korean invasion of South Korea -- has become a more likely scenario, the 31st MEU can search and seize the North Korean nuclear arsenal, and prevent proliferation of those weapons[22] It is not surprising therefore that the KPA was concerned about the Hoguk exercise and responded to the ROK live firing in line with the ‘zero tolerance’ strategy. However, concerns extend beyond specific military exercises, to the whole policy of building up of tension in preparation for a crisis that would lead to an invasion of the North. The KPA barrage can be seen as a message that an attack would be met by a devastating counteroffensive which would, at the very least, imperil Seoul; it was a reminder that ‘Seoul [is] not safe from artillery attacks’.[23] The DPRK’s ‘zero tolerance’ strategy The DPRK’s ‘zero tolerance’ policy long predates the Lee Myung-bak administration, let alone the present crisis. Basically this strategy is to reiterate than no infringement of DPRK territory will be tolerated, and any intrusion will be met by force. There has been flexibility and restraint in implementing this strategy, especially in respect of the NLL (see below), but the underlying strategic calculation is that any sign of weakness will lead to further US and ROK moves against the DPRK. The case of the US invasion of Iraq is often cited by the North Koreans of the dangers of an appeasement policy. This is often raised in respect of the nuclear deterrent. For instance, Alexander Frolov, writing recently in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs journal International Affairs on lessons from the Iraq war made the point: The leadership in N. Korea also realized that nothing less than a nuclear status can guarantee the country against US aggression. [24] However, the relevance of Iraq to the non-appeasement policy goes beyond developing a nuclear deterrent. For instance, in May 2003 after a breakdown in US-DPRK negotiations, the official Korea Central News Agency (KCNA) in a lengthy statement included a reference to Iraq: On March 20 this year the U.S. provoked a war of aggression against Iraq under the pretext of &quot;finding out weapons of mass destruction&quot; in a bid to topple the Saddam government. The Iraqi war taught the lesson that &quot;nuclear suspicion,&quot; &quot;suspected development of weapons of mass destruction&quot; and suspected &quot;sponsorship of terrorism&quot; touted by the U.S. were all aimed to find a pretext for war and one would fall victim to a war when one meekly responds to the IAEA's inspection for disarmament. Neither strong international public opinion nor big countries' opposition to war nor the UN Charter could prevent the U.S. from launching the Iraqi war. It is a serious lesson the world has drawn from the Iraqi war that a war can be averted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation can be protected only when a country has a physical deterrent force, a strong military deterrent force capable of decisively repelling any attack to be made by any types of sophisticated weapons. The reality indicates that building up a physical deterrent force is urgently required for preventing the outbreak of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring peace and security of the world, now that the U.S. does not show any political intention and will to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK. The DPRK will increase its self-defensive capacity strong enough to destroy aggressors at a single stroke. Any U.S. aerial attack will be decisively countered with aerial attack and its land strategy will be coped with land strategy. [25] In reality, a North Korean counter offensive would not match like with like - ‘aerial attack will be decisively countered with aerial attack and its land strategy will be coped with land strategy.’ The DPRK cannot hope to match US military power (especially in the air) so its offensive would be asymmetrical, drawing on its strengths.[26] It would probably utilise its special forces, submarines, and in particular its artillery[27] As noted, the frequent war exercises, the integration of the ROK military into the US command structure, and the associated operational plans, are seen by the DPRK as very threatening: [The United States] made public &quot;strategic guideline No. 1&quot; in November 1978 and thus officially announced the formation of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; in south Korea. It saw to it that the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; took over the &quot;UN Forces Command's&quot; Operation Control of the U.S. forces in south Korea and puppet army. The organization of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; deepened the military dependence of south Korea on the United States and increased the danger for an outbreak of a new war on the Korean Peninsula. The Team Spirit joint military exercises for invading the north had been escalated as a large-scale war exercises involving huge armed forces over100,000-200,000 strong from 1978. Such joint military exercises as the Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI), Ulji Focus Lens and Foal Eagle have been staged almost every day as planned and directed by the command. The aggressive and bellicose nature of the command has remained unchanged even after the June 15 era [the 2000 North-South summit], a new era of reconciliation and cooperation, was ushered in on the Korean Peninsula. Many war scenarios against the north including &quot;OPLAN 5030&quot;, &quot;New OPLAN 5026&quot; and &quot;OPLAN 8022-02&quot; have been worked out and war exercises to carry them into practice conducted in a more frenzied way. This year the command changed the codenames of the RSOI and Ulji Focus Lens with Key Resolve and Ulji Freedom Guardian and is holding actual maneuvers to hurl U.S. imperialist aggression forces in the mainland and abroad into Korean front. It goes without saying that such war exercises and arms buildup had have negative effect on the north-south relations and chilled the ardent desire for the Korean people for reunification. The south Korean people thus press for the dissolution of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; disturbing peace in Korea and obstructing her reunification. The south Korea-U.S. &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot;, a tool for war of aggression and a source of permanent atmosphere of war and tension on the Korean Peninsula, should be disbanded without delay. [28] The most famous example of the efficacy of the strategy is the reported argument between President Kim Young-sam and President Bill Clinton in 1994. According to Kim, Clinton wanted to bomb the North Korea nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. A 2003 BBC report recounted the tale: &quot;Clinton told me that he would launch an immediate bombardment on the Yongbyon area. Clinton was very determined about it, but I argued to him that such an attack should never take place,&quot; said Mr Kim. &quot;So there was quite an argument between him and me. Sometimes the phone conversations lasted more than 40 minutes,&quot; he said. Mr Clinton first revealed the 1994 plan to attack North Korea last month, but said nothing of the alleged dispute with the South. Mr Kim said that a US attack would have led to a tremendous loss of life, and would have turned Seoul into a &quot;sea of fire&quot;. &quot;Finally I told him that if the United States attacks North Korea, I cannot send one single member of South Korea's 650,000 armed forces into battle.&quot; [29] Kim’s version of events was contradicted by Tong Kim (Kim Dong-hyun) a Korean-American who worked as an interpreter for the State Department for over 30 years. According to him, It simply is not the case [...]. There was no discussion about a possible U.S. attack on North Korea between the two presidents via phone. Such discussions indeed took place between their defense ministers Kwon Young-hae and William Perry with the South Korean minister obviously opposed to the military action.[30] The consequences of a Northern counterattack, and specifically an artillery offense against Seoul, was not the only consideration, although it was the main one. A South Korean simulation exercise predicted that ‘bombing of North Korea’s nuclear facilities could in the worst case make the whole of Korea uninhabitable for a decade’.[31] The bombing of Yongbyon was but one variant of the ‘military option’ that the United States has been examining, albeit the favoured one.[32] The release of radioactivity aside, an US attack would mean war with immense devastation of the Korea peninsula, so it is to be expected that there has been, in the past, opposition across the political spectrum, from progressive President Roh Moo-hyun to conservative legislator Park Jin.[33] The exception to that have been those, such as Lee Myung-bak, who pin their hopes on a collapse that would prevent the North from making a counterattack. This is an ongoing issue but as long as the DPRK functions as a viable state, committed and able, to retaliate, then there will be no attack. Part of the reason for the vigorous response at Yeonpyeong was presumably to demonstrate that the KPA was still in business. The DPRK has been threatened, and blockaded, by the United States for decades, but unlike various other countries, it has not been invaded, or bombed. To that degree the zero-tolerance strategy can be said to work. But it has its disadvantages. It is a high-risk strategy. If there is a miscalculation or a misunderstanding, or ‘maverick’ action by soldiers on the front line, then the situation could rapidly whirl out of control. War would be disastrous for North Korea, despite the brave words. It would have grave consequences for the South, and Japan. If it spread to China the results are incalculable, but it might mean the end of the United States, that ‘fragile empire’ as Niall Ferguson recently termed it.[34] It is a variant of the mutually assured destruction of the Cold War period, a bluff that is effective because it is credible, but a bluff that if put into action would be catastrophic. In this case, the destruction would not be equivalent. The DPRK would suffer more than other countries, but the ROK and the US would suffer unacceptable damage and that could be considered sufficient to keep the peace. The strategy has other disadvantages. It allows the DPRK to be portrayed as belligerent, and certainly the coverage of the Yeonpyeong incident, within South Korea, and internationally has been virtually uniformly hostile. Not everyone has jumped on to the bandwagon and there are those, in particular Korean-Americans, who oppose the drift towards war and call for engagement.[35] But these are only a tiny minority. The strategy also runs counter to the main thrust of DPRK strategy which is to negotiate the United States into accepting peaceful coexistence. Recourse to confrontation, and military action, makes that more difficult to prosecute. Finally, it gives a hostage to fortune. The other side (here South Korea but in other circumstances it could be the US) can construct a provocation knowing that it will trigger a response that can be labelled as belligerent. The trick here is to do something which the DPRK regards as provocative but which can be disguised as normal and legitimate. The military exercises in general fall within this category. For the DPRK (and China) they are intimidating and provocative, but that is not how they are described in the Western media. No doubt if the tables were turned and it was a North Korean carrier stalking up the American coast, perceptions would be different. In the particular case of Yeonpyeong the ROK did something that was portrayed as legitimate and non-threatening but which the DPRK found intolerable. To understand why that was so we must turn to the curious case of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) Northern Limit Line The Northern Limit Line is a very strange beast, as a glance at the map shows (fig 1). Fig 1: Contested seas: The NLL and the MDL 1.Yeonpyeong Island (artillery clash) 2.Baengnyeong Island (Cheonan sinking) 3.Daecheong Island 4. Incheon Airport 5.Seoul 6.Incheon 7.Haeju 8.Kaesong 9.Ganghwa County 10.Bukdo Myeon 11.Deokjeok Myeon 12.Jawol Myeon 13.Yeongheung Myeon On this map #1 indicates Yeonpyeong Island where the artillery clash took place, and #2 Baengnyeong Island, off which the Cheonan sank. The upper(blue) line represents the Northern Limit Line (NLL) and the lower (red) one the West Sea Military Demarcation Line (MDL) claimed by the DPRK. The NLL was unilaterally established by the Americans (officially the United Nations Command) in August 1953.[36] The NLL, instead of striking out directly from the coast at the end of the land Military Demarcation Line (MDL), snakes up the west coast of North Korea, through rice crab fish grounds, and taking in various islands the main three of which are .Yeonpyeong (1) , Baengnyeong (2), and Daecheong (3). It has been argued that it was set up to prevent Southern incursions into Northern waters (Syngman Rhee had not signed the Armistice Agreement and wanted the war to continue), although it would be more plausible to see it also as affording bases for inserting intelligence and commando teams. Be that as it may, by the 1990s commando raids were a thing of the past, and yet the ROK refused to negotiate. This despite two major incidents in 1999 and 2002 which were a distinct threat to the ‘Sunshine Policy of then president Kim Dae-jung.[37] There was a further clash in November 2009 under the presidency of Lee Myung-bak.[38] This 2009 incident may have owed something to the more assertive North Korea policy of the Lee administration.[39] The NLL did not receive much international attention until the Cheonan incident of March 2010. There were a number of reasons for this. Most of the causalities in the past were Northern and so, in the eyes of most of the international media, perhaps warranted less attention. The Cheonan was the largest single disaster for the ROK navy. Many commentators were quick to point out what a dangerous situation the sinking of the Cheonan illustrated. Typical was Nicole Finnegan of the Washington-based Korea Economic Institute: Regardless of what we learn the true cause of the tragedy to be, the sinking of the Cheonan has revived fear and debates on how easily North and South Korea could lurch into war unexpectedly.[40] There is nothing new in these concerns. The NLL by its unilateral nature, its configuration close to the North Korean coast, and running through highly prized crab grounds, is a recipe for conflict. Fishing boats from both South and North sometimes ignore the NLL during the crab season and their respective navies tend to follow them. The NLL is also at variance with the now standard territorial sea limit of 12 nautical miles.[41] Writing in 2002, after the clash of June that year, John Barry Kotch and Michael Abbey, point out that: If the two Koreas are genuinely committed to reconciliation, these differences can be resolved through negotiation, thereby preventing future incidents. A line that was drawn more than a half-century ago for an entirely different purpose should no longer be allowed to fester as a source of conflict, thereby retarding the peace process.[42] The differences were not resolved, so the question is why? If this failure to negotiate a resolution had just occurred during the Lee Myung-bak administration it might not have been surprising. But this was during the time of Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun. It is clear that a resolution would have meant the South abandoning the NLL and agreeing to something approximating the North’s line. It seems extremely unlikely that anyone in the DPRK would have opposed that. Although the NLL was established by the UNC, it appears that it is not longer involved, officially at least. It may well be that unofficially it is very much involved; the relationship between the US and ROK military seems to be unexplored territory. Whatever the role of Americans behind the scenes it seems clear that resolution of the NLL was opposed, successfully, by the ROK military. This opposition presumably was partly due to natural inertia – nobody likes giving up territory – but it must have gone deeper than that. The logical conclusion is that there were strong forces in the ROK political elite, revolving around the military, who wanted to keep the NLL precisely because it would “to fester as a source of conflict, thereby retarding the peace process” Fig 2: measuring policy change: KCNA mentions of the NLL over two administrations All of the previous conflicts around the NLL had been at sea, and the artillery duel at Yeonpyeong was the first one on land. To understand how that came about we must return to the map. It appears that the DPRK acknowledges ROK control over the islands, but claims these are its territorial waters, except for the access channels shown on the map.[43] Whilst the NLL has long been a bone of contention, the situation has greatly worsened since the Lee Myung-bak administration came into office. One rough way of measuring that is to calculate the number of times the official KCNA news agency mentions the North Limit Line. Roh Moo-hyun was in office from 25 February 2003 to 25 February 2008 when Lee Myung-bak took over. Fig 2 shows the monthly average of NLL stories over those two administrations. This is admittedly an imperfect metric but the difference between the two administrations is compelling: under Lee Myung-bak the number of North Korean complaints rose nearly three-fold. In March 2008, for instance, the KPA navy warned: Combined firepower drills for &quot;striking and destroying&quot; warships of the Navy of the Korean People's Army and drills for tactical naval maneuvers are staged on Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong Islets and in waters around them almost everyday. A situation in which an armed conflict may break out any moment is prevailing in the frontline waters in the West Sea due to the reckless military provocations of the south Korean military warmongers. Any attempt on the part of the south Korean military authorities to &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;northern limit line&quot; at any cost would only spark off a clash in the said waters.[44] The following year, as the Lee administration moved to join the US-led Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) the KPA navy issued another warning: 3. For the present, we will not guarantee the legal status of the five islands under the south side's control (Paekryong, Taechong, Sochong, Yonphyong [ and U islands) in our side's territorial waters northwest of the extension of the Military Demarcation Line in the West Sea of Korea and safe sailing of warships of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the south Korean puppet navy and civilian ships operating in the waters around there.[45] The PSI is in many ways similar to the NLL. It is unilateral and illegal. The PSI claims that a set of nations – the US and its clients – are above international law and may stop and search ships on the high seas. Ostensibly this is to stop the shipping of weapons of mass destruction which given the United States pre-eminence in the international arms trade smacks of a certain degree of chutzpah.[46] Indeed, as Hazel Smith has documented, ‘There is little hard evidence that the government of North Korea is involved in the illicit shipping of WMD or components of WMD’.[47] The PSI seems to be really about harassing the DPRK and stoking tension, and that also holds for the NLL. The NLL seems to have been much more successful in attaining these objectives so far than the PSI. The NLL was perhaps only peripheral to the Cheonan incident. True the ship sank in disputed waters, and had the NLL not existed, but the two Koreas had been separated by a mutually agreed maritime border, the sinking would probably not have occurred. It appears that it ran aground in shallow waters and in an attempt to extricate itself was sunk by one of the South’s mines.[48] Nevertheless, the actual sinking of the Cheonan appears to have been an accident; it was the subsequent investigation that was deliberately fraudulent. The Yeonpyeong incident is different in that it occurred because of a deliberate provocation by the South. The artillery duel at Yeonpyeong As to be expected there is much that is uncertain and contested about this incident. But the essentials can be traced. The media tends to give the impression that the North Korean barrage against the marine base on Yeonpyeong island on 23 November came out of the blue, with nothing preceding it. The Chosun Ilbo specifically makes that claim: … the latest artillery bombardment on Yeonpyeong Island came completely out of the blue, and there is no way of telling when, where and how North Korea will strike next.[49] A rather more nuanced version is the Washington Post narrative, with the North launching a barrage and the South responding: North Korea launched a massive artillery barrage on a South Korean island Tuesday, killing two South Korean marines, wounding at least 19 other people and setting more than 60 buildings ablaze in the most serious confrontation since the North's sinking of a South Korean warship in March. South Korea immediately responded with its own artillery fire and put its fighter jets on high alert, bringing the two sides - which technically have remained in a state of war since the Korean armistice in 1953 - close to the brink of a major conflagration[50] No mention here of the South’s arms buildup on the island, the North’s warnings, the provocative nature of the Northern Limit Line, or the threatening military exercises. Back in 2008 the KPA complained about the ROK introducing new weaponry into the NLL islands: They also issued an order to batteries of 155 mm caliber howitzers and various type guided weapons deployed on the above-said five islets to be ready to go into action.[51] The KPA statement also claimed that: Combined firepower drills for &quot;striking and destroying&quot; warships of the Navy of the Korean People's Army and drills for tactical naval maneuvers are staged on Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong Islets and in waters around them [take place] almost everyday. A situation in which an armed conflict may break out any moment is prevailing in the frontline waters in the West Sea due to the reckless military provocations of the south Korean military warmongers. Any attempt on the part of the south Korean military authorities to &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;northern limit line&quot; at any cost would only spark off a clash in the said waters. [52] The live fire drills that the ROK conducted on 23 November were not just artillery practice; they were specifically focussed on possible combat against KPA ships in waters around the island. However, it was the specific contested status of those waters, in a tense situation exacerbated by the military exercises since the Cheonan incident, which sparked the North Korean response. It appears that the North warned the South against the drills, but the warnings were disregarded. The Seoul newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported on 24 November that: North Korea in a telegram on Tuesday morning [23 November] criticized an annual South Korean defense drill now underway. The same afternoon the North Korean military fired on Yeonpyeong Island. An official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, &quot;At around 8:20 am. on Tuesday, North Korea sent a telegram that said they would not sit idly by and watch if South Korea fire at North Korean waters during the military training.&quot; North Korea already criticized the drill on Nov. 17 on the website of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland and again on Monday when the drill began. But the military dismissed North Korea's claims, saying an artillery firing drill by the Marine Corps that took place in Yeonpyeong Island on Tuesday had nothing to do with the annual drill but was a part of monthly training there. Moreover, the drill the North cited as an excuse for the attack is an annual routine drill which has been conducted by the South Korean military since 1996. A spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, &quot;The training was directed at South Korean waters to the southwest of Yeonpyeong Island, and the training site had been announced already through the international network of communication of merchant ships.[53] To say that the marine artillery drills had nothing to do with the Hoguk exercise seems to be a sophism. Moreover, the warnings stretched further back. The information available on the English-language KCNA website is only a portion of the published Korean-language material, and on top of that there are the direct communications between North and South (such as the telegram mentioned above). However, there is enough English-language for us to get a certain picture of preceding events, even though often the English translation is of poor quality.’ Fig3: Smoke from rocket fire over Yeonpyeong island This picture taken on November 23, 2010 by a South Korean tourist shows huge plumes of smoke rising from Yeonpyeong island in the disputed waters of the Yellow Sea on November 23, 2010. North Korea fired dozens of artillery shells onto a South Korean island on November 23, 2010, killing four people, setting homes ablaze and triggering an exchange of fire as the South's military went on top alert. (STR/AFP/Getty Images) On the 4th of June 2010 a Rodong Sinmun editorial headed ‘S. Korean Accused of Dangerous Provocations’ warned that: The puppet military is massively amassing offensive forces in the waters off five islets of the West Sea including Paekryong and Yonphyong [Yeonpyeong] islets while vociferating about &quot;defence of the northern limit line&quot; and ceaselessly infiltrating its warships into the territorial waters of the DPRK for the purpose of sparking off a new armed conflict. It is needless to say that the large-scale &quot;demonstration of military muscle&quot; and war maneuvers taking place under this situation are as dangerous acts as playing with fire by the side of a powder magazine. These moves are, in fact, a prelude to an all-out war. The DPRK loves peace and does not want a war. But it is the DPRK's spirit and mettle to react to fire with fire and punish the provocateurs with a merciless retaliation of justice. If the puppet group finally opts for starting a war of aggression against the DPRK in league with foreign forces, defying its warnings, the group will not be able to escape a thousand-fold indiscriminate retaliatory blow, warns the article. [54] This is a generalised warning about retaliation ‘for starting a war of aggression’ rather than specifically threatening a response to military exercises at Yeonpyeong. ‘Indiscriminate’ in this context presumably means ‘all-out war’. This warning was followed by another on 3 August which specifically threatened retaliation for ‘naval firing maneuvers’ from Yeonpyeong and other islands in the area: The Command of Forces of the Korean People's Army in the western sector of the front issued on Tuesday the following notice in this connection: The naval firing maneuvers to be staged by the above-said warmongers in the waters near Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong islets in August with all ground, naval and submarine attack means involved are not simple drills but undisguised military intrusion into the inviolable territorial waters of the DPRK and reckless politically motivated provocation to preserve the illegal &quot;northern limit line&quot; to the last. …. In view of the prevailing situation, the Command of Forces of the Korean People's Army in the western sector of the front made a decisive resolution to counter the reckless naval firing projected by the group of traitors with strong physical retaliation. …. As regards the expected DPRK's counteraction for self-defence, the command warns in advance all the civilian ships including fishing boats not to enter the theatre of naval firing fixed by the group of traitors in the waters close to the five islets in the West Sea of Korea. It is the unshakable will and steadfast resolution of the army and people of the DPRK to return fire for fire. [55] Whether the ROK marines carried out any firing exercises after that warning is unknown. The Chosun Ilbo report quoted above says the drills were held ‘monthly’ but the [London] Telegraph talks about ‘monthly air raid drills’, so the exercises on 23 November may have been the first since the August threat. The island, lined with tank traps and trenches, and equipped with 19 fully-stocked bomb shelters in which residents conduct monthly air raid drills, is permanently ready for war.[56] The South Koreans admitted carrying live firing exercises on 23 November but justified these by saying they were fired into the sea, away from the direction of the North Korean mainland. There seems no doubt they were firing into the sea (on the technical level it was presumably an anti-ship exercise), though the actual direction of fire is unclear. One report says southward.[57] Another says to the west. [58] Yet another has it to the southwest.[59] In fact, as far as the North was concerned, the direction was irrelevant because in any case the shells landed in their territorial waters. And therein lies the rub. The DPRK argues that if it tolerated the exercise it would be relinquishing its claim to the waters. The enemy fired shells from the islet which is so close to the territory of the DPRK that it is within each other's eyeshot despite the fact that there are so many mountains and rivers, sea waters and islets in south Korea. This powder-reeking saber-rattling cannot be construed otherwise than a politically motivated provocation. The enemy is claiming that they fired shells southward from the islet in a bid not to get on the nerves of the DPRK but Yonphyong Islet is located deep inside the territorial waters of the DPRK away from the maritime military demarcation line. If live shells are fired from the islet, they are bound to drop inside the territorial waters of the DPRK side no matter in which direction they are fired because of such geographical features. The ulterior aim sought by the enemy is to create the impression that the DPRK side recognized the waters off the islet as their &quot;territorial waters&quot;, in case that there was no physical counter-action on the part of the former. Herein lies the crafty and vicious nature of the enemy's provocation. The army of the DPRK took such a self-defensive measure as making a prompt powerful strike at the artillery positions from which the enemy fired the shells as it does not make an empty talk. [emphasis added].[60] As can be seen from the map (fig 1), the DPRK seems to accept ROK control of the island (but not necessarily sovereignty) but it does not recognise any claim over the surrounding sea. It would appear that the DPRK claim to these waters has much to justify it; the Northern Limit Line is manifestly iniquitous; it is unilateral and provocative and should have been abolished years ago. But does that justify the DPRK artillery barrage? An important point here is the number of warnings that were given. We have already quoted the public statements, and mentioned a telegram, but the North also claims it made a telephone call to the South: The south Korean puppet warmongers' firing of shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side in the West Sea of Korea on Nov. 23 was a premeditated and deliberate military provocation from A to Z and a war action in fact. On Nov. 22, the south Korean puppet forces made no scruple of announcing that they would fire shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side with artillery pieces they deployed on Yonphyong Island while staging Hoguk exercises for a war of aggression against the DPRK, straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula. In this connection the DPRK side sent a telephone notice to the south Korean puppet military at 8 a.m. on Nov. 23, strongly urging it to immediately cancel the plan for firing shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side. In the notice the DPRK side seriously warned that if it paid no heed to this demand, it would face a resolute physical counter-strike and would be held fully responsible for all the ensuing consequences.[61] This telephone call, and the previous public warnings, have received very little coverage in the Western media, but there is no doubt that it took place, since it was reported by the Seoul newspaper Korea Herald: In the morning [of the clash], the North sent a telephone message to the South, saying “The North would not just sit back if the South fired shots into the North Korean territorial waters,” according to JCS [South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff] officials.[62] We do not know how explicit that warning was, but since it was a telephone call, the Southern officer could presumably have sought clarification. Moreover, we have other reports that the ROK military was aware that that DPRK had moved artillery into position. This was then followed by practice shooting: A senior military said several hours before the shelling began the North Korean military deployed one battery of six 122-mm MLRS shells and later two batteries of 12 112-mm MLRS shells. It also carried out preparatory shooting practice just before the attack. &quot;As far as I know the South Korean military was aware of this,&quot; he said.[63] It seems fair to assume that the local ROK military commander knew what would happen if the firing exercise went ahead. Whether he relayed this to higher levels and asked for confirmation to go ahead we do not know, but it seems likely. There was no great time pressure and taking action which would result in the first artillery exchange since the Korean War would surely have been referred up to higher levels. The warning/foreknowledge issue become even more convoluted with revelations on 1 December that South Korean intelligence had known since August that the North would respond. The Director of the National Intelligence Service [NIS] gave testimony to a closed-door session of a committee of the National Assembly. Members of the National Assembly Intelligence Committee quoted NIS Director Won Sei-hoon as saying the agency knew from wiretapping that the North Korean regime ordered the military to prepare to attack the five islands in the West Sea. He said the NIS submitted the intelligence report to President Lee Myung-bak.[emphasis added] [64] The phrase ‘prepare to attack’ implies, and is meant to imply, a Northern provocation, an unprovoked assault. In fact, we have from another story a much more plausible phrase: The[Asahi Shimbun]quoted the source, who is familiar with North Korea-China relations, as saying, &quot;Early last month, the North Korean military issued instructions in Kim Jong-un's name to senior military commanders to get ready to counter the enemy's provocations any time.&quot; The source quoted an unnamed North Korean Army officer as commenting on the artillery attack on Yeonpyeong. &quot;It had been planned. We had been preparing for that for a long time.&quot; [emphasis added][65] This countering of what the North regarded as a Southern provocation is consistent with the published and telephone warnings. It gives a quite different take on who was provoking whom. This did not prevent the Chosun Ilbo, which ran the story, from heading it ‘Kim Jong-un 'Ordered Attack in Early November'. Not the first time a newspaper has mendaciously given a headline which is contradicted by the actual story under it. In fact, the Chosun Ilbo, which has a very virulent ideological position, often does it. On 3 December it ran a story about an interview Russian Prime Minister Putin gave in the United States in which it was reported that ‘Putin said that he finds the situation in the Korean Peninsula &quot;very acute and disturbing&quot;’. The headline was ‘N.Korean Attack 'Acute and Disturbing,' Says Putin’. The assertion that the NIS submitted the intelligence report to President Lee Myung-bak has to be taken cautiously. From the public account we do not know whether he was given it personally, and the warning drawn to his attention. It may have just been passed to his office, and he never got to read it. That is a generous interpretation. Whether Lee was aware personally it is clear that the North Korean warning that they would retaliate if the exercises took place was known at the highest levels of the South Korean command. Events of the day The actual sequence of events is more complex than most press reports and commentaries suggest. According to the Korea Herald report the Northern shelling started at 2.34pm, but was perhaps not the ‘massive onslaught’ that it was often called: “As the North fired coastal artillery shells at around 2:34 p.m. into waters off the Yeonpyeong Island as well as on the island, we immediately fired back in full accordance with combat rules,” said Lee Hong-kee, chief director for joint operations at the JCS, in a press briefing. [emphasis added][66] Either the accuracy of the Northern artillery was poor, or firing into the water was deliberate. According to the report, here is the sequence of events After 8.00am and before 2.34 pm South fires into sea 2.34 pm North starts firing into sea (and land?) 2.47 pm South starts firing at Northern coastal batteries – ‘strong, concentrated’ counterattack causing ‘considerable damage’ 2.55 pm North ceases firing 3.11 pm North recommences firing 3.42 pm North ceases firing 3.48 pm South telephones North urging it to stop its ‘provocative acts’ By 9.30 pm 2 marines killed; while six others were seriously injured. Ten other soldiers and three civilians suffered minor injuries This raises some intriguing questions. • Did the North fire simultaneously at the island and into the sea, or did the land fire come later? • Did the North fire onto the island only after the Southern counterattack on its positions? • Why did the South make a telephone call asking the North to stop if it had already done so? • Did the North recommence firing sometime after 3.42 pm? • As of 9.30 pm we have three civilians reported with minor injuries but subsequent reports give two dead. Were the dead amongst these three, or were they discovered later? The ‘fog of war’ no doubt produces confusion but these discrepancies suggest that we have not had the full story by any means. The quite erroneous claim that this was an ‘unprovoked attack’ by the North has been repeated so many times by ROK officials, and by the media, that even liberals such as the American investigative journalist Tim Shorrock have been taken in.[67] The other main canard in the official narrative concerns civilians. The theme is set at the top with statements from Lee Myung-bak. On 29 November he gave a short address to the nation: During a seven-minute speech Lee expressed outrage over the North's ruthless attack on civilians, calling it an &quot;inhumane&quot; crime [emphasis added].[68] Others were more circumspect. A JCS spokesman called the firing ‘indiscriminate’: “This provocation is a premeditated, intentional illegal attack in violation of the U.N. Convention, the Armistice Agreement and the inter-Korean non-aggression accord. It is also an inhumane atrocity, in which it indiscriminately fired shells into unarmed civilian residential areas.”[69] Song Min-soon, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade and currently a Democratic Party (i.e. opposition) member of the National Assembly attacked what he called an: outrageous indiscriminate artillery attack against civilians and military alike.[70] The American liberal John Feffer wrote of a ‘disproportionate response’ which killed ‘two civilians and two soldiers’. [71] Early reports (such as the Korea Herald one above) mention only minor civilian injuries, though they talk of a ’civilian area’: ..killing two South Korean marines, wounding 16 soldiers and three civilians, and damaging homes and facilities. This was the first time since the Korean War that the North has fired artillery shells on a civilian area in South Korea.[72] ‘Civilian area’ is a rather elastic term. Most military bases have civilians living in the vicinity, some more than others. The giant US headquarters in South Korea, Yongsan Garrison occupies 2.5 sq km in the centre of this city of 10 million people; the site was originally developed by the Japanese Imperial Army. By 24 November the casualties changed to four – two military and two civilians. In addition to the two marines killed, the bodies of two men, believed in their 60s, were pulled from a destroyed construction site, the coast guard said. At least 18 people - most of them troops - were injured.[73] It was not stated where this construction site was in relation to the marine camp. If it were on the other side of the island, then that would indicate fire that was either indiscriminate or very inaccurate. If it were close by, or even on the camp, then this would put a different complexion on things. It is clear that the main target was the marine camp, as this quotation from the JCS indicates Many landed on a military camp but others on a civilian village on the island. Flames and thick columns of smoke were seen rising above the village and a nearby mountain. &quot;The North must have carefully premeditated the provocation against the camp,&quot; a JCS officer speculated. [74] Fig 4: Damage at the marine base A K-9 Marine artillery base on Yeonpyeong Island under attack by North Korea on Tuesday /Courtesy of the Ministry of Defense [&quot;N.Korean Shelling 'Aimed for Maximum Damage to Lives, Property'.&quot; Chosun Ilbo, 26 November 2010. The Washington Post went one step further and reported that: Most of the shells landed on a military base on Yeonpyeong island [emphasis added][75] However, most reports either did not mention the marine base, or gave no details. For instance, another Washington Post article talked of ‘civilian-inhabited Yeonpyeong Island’ without any reference to the marine base.[76] In fact the military installations were very significant as a New York Times article makes evident. … [Yeonpyeong Island] houses a garrison of about 1,000 South Korean marines, and the navy has deployed its newest class of “patrol killer” guided-missile ships in the Western Sea, as the Yellow Sea is also known. [77] This NY Times article gave the civilian population as 1,600 but this was later revised down to 1,350. [78] Most appear to be connected, as one might expect, to fishing (this area is especially famous for crabs); how many work on the base is unclear. The most detailed, technical, assessment of the artillery duel is given by the US ‘geopolitical intelligence’ company STRATFOR. It released a report, accompanied by a pdf file showing satellite images taken after what it called the ‘North Korean attack on Yeonpyeong Island’. The STRATFOR reports are interesting partly for what they reveal but also what they hide or obscure and for what might be considered a surprising lack of geopolitical intelligence in an organisation in the business of selling the stuff. It admits that: A [South Korean] battery of six K9 155 mm self-propelled howitzers, which was conducting live-fire drills on a Yeonpyeong Island military base, fired some 80 rounds. And then, a bit further down: Significantly, the South claims its Yeonpyeong Island drill was not part of the larger Hoguk exercises under way simultaneously throughout South Korea. North Korea has occasionally protested these drills — including recently — and claims dozens of shells fell in North Korean waters near the island, provoking it to fire. However, as the North does not recognize the Northern Limit Line and considers the entire island and its surrounding water to be North Korean territory, it does not seem to be clear that this particular incident was any more provocative than any other drill.[79] This is a curious argument. Hoguk and the other military exercises over the decades have taken place in South Korean territory or international waters. This one was being held in what the North considered to be DPRK territory. It was not merely provocative from a military point of view, but as they made clear in their statement of 24 November, from a legal one as well. That is a very important distinction which differentiated the Yeonpyeong exercise from others. Although the STRAFOR report mentions the military base in passing, it is absent from the satellite images document. We have satellite photos of destroyed houses, but nothing about the base, which is not even identified. Since the base was the main target of attack, and early reports focused on military dead and wounded, this is a rather suspicious omission. The STRATFOR report, and images, do however throw considerable light, albeit inadvertently, on the issue of the civilian casualties. It would appear from this, and other sources, that the North Korean fire was not very accurate. The North Koreans either exclusively, or mainly (it is not clear which) used Multiple Launch Rocket System [MLRS] artillery These are, as the name suggests, basically a bundle of tubes which can fire rockets. Interestingly it is said that they can be traced back to the 15th century Korean hwacha (‘fire vehicle’) which could fire a hundred or more projectiles in one salvo.[80] The most famous example in modern times was the Soviet Katyusha, used in the Second World War and nicknamed the ‘Stalin organ’.[81] The Americans used them in 1991 in the Gulf War, and the ROK military is equipped with them.[82] MLRS can deliver formidable devastation but are not very accurate, especially the older versions with which the KPA is equipped: The initial barrage consisted of 150 rounds, followed by 20 more intermittently — meaning that while a full battalion appeared to be in position, a fully armed single battery could have conducted the entire attack. Of these 170 rounds, 80 struck Yeonpyeong Island, though 20 failed to detonate….. With a few modern exceptions, artillery rockets are unguided and achieve results through massed fires rather than exceptional accuracy. Here, North Korea had no opportunity to register targets or adjust fire based on input from forward observers; South Korea has subsequently conjectured based on the targets that the North’s maps of military positions on the island may have been dated. The failure of so many rounds to reach the island and a dud rate of roughly a quarter of those that did suggest issues of quality control in manufacture and/or poorly controlled storage, as well as the potential for there to have been issues in the fire direction or on the gunline.[83] So it would appear that the reason that shells fell on the town was not so much that that the firing was indiscriminate, but that it was inaccurate. The North Koreans do not have a monopoly on this, and there was anger in the National Assembly Intelligence Committee when they were presented with the satellite photo (Fig 5) which showed that Southern shells fired from their much more accurate howitzers had missed their target, the North Korean artillery positions Committee members reportedly reacted angrily since they show impact points scattered mainly in paddy and dry fields.[84] Fig 5: Evidence of inaccurate fire In this satellite photo released by the U.S. private intelligence agency Stratfor, rice paddies and fields in North Korea bear traces of South Korean artillery shells [&quot;Spies Intercepted Plans for Yeonpyeong Attack in August &quot;. Chosun Ilbo, 2 December 2010. There was also much dispute about the damage suffered by the North. The DPRK has not released any statement about casualties. In the South, some pointed out that their military equipment was far superior and more deadly and hence there must have been many casualties, and others pointed to the various satellite photos showing hits off target.[85] Sometimes military action is intended primarily to terrorise and demoralise the civilian population – the London blitz, the firebombing of Tokyo, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the ‘shock and awe’ bombing of Bagdad prior to invasion – are just a few examples. If the DPRK fired on Seoul to unleash ‘a sea of fire’ it would be the civilian population that would be hit, and the military impact would be secondary. However, much military action is aimed primarily at the enemy military, and if this happens in a populated area, civilians become, in the US euphemism, ‘collateral damage’. Clearly the distinction between the two is often blurred in practice, and it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to be sure, but it appears from the available evidence that the target for the North Korean fire was the marine base and that civilian casualties and damage were accidental. There are several reasons for assuming this. Firstly, the inaccuracy of the MLRS. Secondly, if the intention had been to cause civilian causalities as a warning about the consequences of Lee Myung-bak’s confrontational policy – ‘today Yeonpyeong, tomorrow Seoul’ – we would expect that point to be made. There is little point in giving a warning unless it is reasonably explicit. I can find no indication that the DPRK has made any suggestion that the Yeonpyeong incident carried such a lesson for the people of the ROK. On the contrary, the public statement expressed regret for civilian casualties and laid the blame on the Southern side: The DPRK side warned several times against the enemy's plan for shelling in the sensitive areas around Yonphyong Island and sent a telephone notice on the morning of the very day the incident occurred as part of its superhuman efforts to prevent the clash to the last moment, but the south side preempted the firing of shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side. The enemy side, however, has kept silent about all these facts. Moreover, it is now working hard to dramatize &quot;civilian casualties&quot; as part of its propaganda campaign, creating the impression that the defenceless civilians were exposed to &quot;indiscriminate shelling&quot; all of a sudden from the DPRK side. If that is true, it is very regrettable but the enemy should be held responsible for the incident as it took such inhuman action as creating &quot;a human shield&quot; by deploying civilians around artillery positions and inside military facilities before the launch of the provocation. The fact that there were human casualties inside the military base clearly proves itself the ulterior intention of the enemy. The U.S. regarded the death of innocent civilians as a common practice in the past in a bid to serve its military purposes in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and other parts of the world. This inhuman atrocity of the US. repeated itself on the Korean Peninsula this time. While the incident occurred, the shells indiscriminately fired by the enemy dropped in the area close to civilian houses far from the artillery positions of the Korean People's Army.[emphasis added][86] This statement brings up a third factor. The claim about a ‘human shield’ doesn’t carry much weight. Civilians live on the island for historical and economic reasons and there is no reason to suppose that they were used to shield the military. However, the claim that civilian casualties occurred within the camp is not implausible. Civilians must have worked at the camp. Indeed, one report from the United States said of the shelling that ‘this resulted in the killing of two South Korean soldiers and two civilian contractors working on a military base’ [emphasis added].[87] As with the Cheonan incident we need a proper, impartial, investigation if we are to draw any firm conclusions, but as with the Cheonan no such investigation is likely. It is interesting to note that the DPRK statement does not claim that it suffered any civilian causalities, merely that enemy shells ‘dropped in the area close to civilian houses’. North Korean propaganda is frequently portrayed as dishonest and deceitful. Here is surely a case where it would have been to their advantage to fabricate civilian casualties, but they did not do so. Finally, it should be remembered that the ROK military on Yeonpyeong Island are not just ordinary soldiers, they are marines, an elite force trained for amphibious assault. Indeed, back in 2009 Rodong Sinmun commented on the buildup up in the area The puppet military reinforced warships and armed forces along and near the &quot;northern limit line in the West Sea&quot; and formed a &quot;task force to be ready to go into action in half an hour&quot; and deployed it on Yonphyong Islet[emphasis added][88] The road behind, the road ahead The fire fight at Yeonpyeong Island seems to have been a manufactured crisis. It appears to be the first time that South Korea, alone or in tandem with the United States, has carried out a military exercise in territory claimed by the North.[89] There have been frequent naval clashes around the Northern Limit Line and it is fairly certain that it has been preserved for that purpose. If’ Seoul’ had really been anxious to avoid incidents and preserve peace then the NLL would have gone long ago. President Roh moo-hyun and Chairman Kim Jong Il, at their summit on 4 October 2007 agreed to ‘special peace and cooperation zone in the West Sea’, but this peace initiative was overturned, as so many others, by incoming president Lee Myung-bak.[90] Preserving the NLL as an area where incidents were likely is one thing, but utilising the NLL deliberately to create an incident is another Warnings and intelligence reports aside, it must have been known that a military exercise within the NLL area would be provocative. On top of which, the legal implications made it intolerably provocative. This suggests that the crisis was planned, not necessarily in great detail, but with sufficient surety of outcome. This reading is quite consistent with Lee Myung-bak’s policy, which is one of building up tension through tension in order to precipitate a crisis on the peninsula, a collapse of the DRPK, and its absorption by the ROK. The DPRK is well aware of this, hence the reaffirmation of the zero tolerance policy at Yeonpyeong. On 23 November, in the aftermath of the clash, the KPA issued a communiqué which reiterated the policy: It is a traditional mode of counter-action of the army of the DPRK to counter the firing of the provocateurs with merciless strikes. Should the south Korean puppet group dare intrude into the territorial waters of the DPRK even 0.001 mm, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will unhesitatingly continue taking merciless military counter-actions against it.[91] This is a calculated policy of brinkmanship, designed to avert war, by threatening war. The danger is, of course, that the momentum of events will bring war about. That, unfortunately, is becoming ever more likely. Lee Myung-bak is a consummate politician. He has set things in motion to produce, and replicate crisis, while giving the appearance of being reluctant. His address to the nation on 29 November used the same rhetorical device as Antony’s speech about Julius Caesar, where he claims to be burying Caesar, not praising him, but of course is doing just that. Lee combined ‘humility’ with an aggressive stance in such a way as to suggest he was reluctant to exacerbate the situation but was being forced into it. President Lee Myung-bak’s address Monday is being summarized as consisting mainly of “humility toward the people of South Korea” and an “ultra-hardline response to North Korea.” Analysts say it shows the president’s perception of the current crisis facing him and its solution following the North Korean artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island. Although even North Korea acknowledged the attack to be a “provocation,” President Lee has faced harsh criticism domestically. Surveys show that more than 70 percent of South Koreans, conservative and progressive alike, feel that the military and Lee Myung-bak administration did not respond appropriately at the time of the attack. The fact that the president began his address Monday with what amounted to an apology to the people of South Korea reflected a consideration of this situation. [emphasis added] The performance so impressed the reporter from the liberal Hankyoreh that we get manifestly false statement that ‘North Korea acknowledged the attack to be a ‘provocation’. Throughout the crises of 2001, especially over Cheonan and then Yeonpyeong, Lee Myung-bak has been very adroit in fanning the flames while give the impression that he was attempting to put them out. In respect of the Cheonan incident President Obama was reported as saying &quot;I think President Lee has shown extraordinary restraint given these circumstances.’[92] It may be objected that this was a public statement and should not be taken too literally; politicians often say in public the opposite of what they think in private. However, there does seem to be a consensus among Western observers at least that Lee is a reluctant warrior being driven into taking steps by the provocative obduracy of the North.[93] Take, for instance, this STRATFOR interview where the interviewer comments: I talked to three former [US?] envoys to Seoul this week and all of them agreed that South Korea had handled this in a pretty cool and sensible fashion[94] The South Korea public is rather more sceptical. One of the WikiLeaks cables [09SEOUL59] illustrates the confusion in the minds of US officials: President Lee is determined not to give in to North Korean pressure. Our Blue House contacts have told us on several occasions that President Lee remained quite comfortable with his North Korea policy and that he is prepared leave the inter-Korean relations frozen until the end of his term in office, if necessary. It is also our assessment that Lee's more conservative advisors and supporters see the current standoff as a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the North, even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship.[95] On the one hand we have Lee facing up to North Korean pressure, but we also get the admission that the ‘current standoff’ ( this was in 2009) is seen as ‘ a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the North, even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship’. Lee’s brinkmanship is, in fact, far more profound and aggressive than the US diplomat realised. Both North and South are engaging in brinkmanship, but the nature of the two is very different. Pyongyang is far poorer and weaker than its adversaries, which include not merely South Korea but the United States, and Japan.[96] North Korea’s brinkmanship is therefore inherently defensive. It is designed to protect the country (or regime if you prefer that) from attack and conquest. That does not mean that it is wise, or will be successful, that is a matter of debate. But it is important to recognise its essential characteristic of defensiveness. South Korea’s brinkmanship, on the other hand, is offensive. It is designed to bring about the collapse of the DPRK and its takeover by the ROK. Lee Myung-bak does not have to do this. His immediate predecessors (Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun) had very different policies. Indeed, his aggressive brinkmanship is arguably a new development because even in the days of the military dictatorships while there was hostility towards the North because the balance of forces if anything favoured the North, there was not such an ambitious policy. However, Lee Myung-bak is reputedly pragmatic and opportunistic. Soon after he won the presidency he was described in the New York Times thus: Mr. Lee has a reputation as a pragmatist who, in contrast to President Roh Moo-hyun, holds few strong ideological positions. As mayor, he created parks and reformed the public transportation system. As president, he said, his main agenda would be to revive the country’s economy.[97] If that is correct, his brinkmanship has been a response to events and opportunities, rather than a considered strategy. In addition, we may discern three factors which may be propelling him to accelerate the buildup of tension on the peninsula. • A desire to renew the anti-North momentum after the relative failure of the Cheonan incident. His setback in the May elections, the widespread public scepticism about the investigation, and the failure to get the UN Security Council to condemn North Korea must rankle. The Yeonpyeong incident is seen as away to rekindle anti-North Korea sentiment In his address on 29 November he specifically made the point: There was a split in public opinion over the torpedoing of the Cheonan. Unlike that time, our people have united as one this time.[98] Despite the frequent assertions of implosion and crisis, the DPRK is not facing collapse. Whilst sanctions must have caused huge damage it appears that the economy is recovering. Certainly Pyongyang, from personal observation on a visit in November 2010, is manifestly economically improved over my last visit three years ago, with more motor vehicles, bicycles, and shops. The electricity supply is much better and there is a very noticeable increase in street lighting. These observations are broadly corroborated by series of recent American visitors.[99] If the South is to take over the North then something must be done to reverse this recovery. Time is not on Lee Myung-bak’s side. His term of office comes to an end on 25 February 2013 and under the present constitution he is ineligible to run again. Moreover, there are suggestions that because of demographic changes the conservative ascendancy represented by the Lee administration may not be sustainable and that South Korea will move to more progressive administrations.[100] Since the North’s brinkmanship is defensive, it is reactive and this leaves the initiative in the hands of the South. Seoul has reinforced its forces on the NLL island and has announced that there will be artillery exercises from Daecheong Island, and again on Yeonpyeong. [101] It seems inevitable that Pyongyang will feel compelled to respond. The new ROK Defence Minister, Kim Kwan-jin, has threatened what he calls ‘self-defense air raids’ in the event of another clash; ‘self defense’ being used in the Japanese sense.[102] It will be recalled that clause 9 of the Japanese constitution prohibits the establishment of armed forces, so the Japanese army, navy and air forces all have ‘self-defense’ in their titles thus solving the constitutional problem. Kim Kwan-jin’s air strike policy is all part of what the New York Times rather approvingly, and with a professional use of euphemism, called a new ‘muscular military posture’.[103] The implications of this new policy are obvious. Not merely has the South great superiority in aircraft, but the new rules allow great flexibility for escalation. However, there are limits to the ROK military’s freedom of action. There is the legal issue of operational control – when would war be deemed a war and thus trigger US control of the ROK military ? But before that stage is reached, the ROK air force is dependent on US intelligence to operate. Thus any serious escalation of the situation on the Korean peninsula would require US endorsement. Would this be forthcoming? Unfortunately it looks as if it would. The Obama administration has termed its policy towards Korea as one of ‘strategic patience’. [104] It might be better described as ‘strategic paralysis’. Not merely has it ignored that calls of a many Korea experts to engage with the DPRK, but it has effectively relinquished control of events to Lee Myung-bak.[105] It might be said that ‘strategic paralysis’ is not confined to US Korea policy but is the defining characteristic of Obama foreign policy, and that would be true, but nowhere is it more perilous than in Korea. Because ultimately Korea is China. A second Korean war would, like the first, soon become a Sino-American war.<br />
North Korea doesn’t take U.S. deterrence seriously anymore<br />
Fenenko 12/8—leading research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of International Security, PhD (Alexei, 8 December 2010, “North Korea no longer takes the U.S. security guarantees seriously”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4008:http://en.rian.ru/valdai_op/20101208/161686288.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.rian.ru/valdai_op/20101208/161686288.html" rel="nofollow">http://en.rian.ru/valdai_op/20101208/161686288.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4008 -->, RBatra)<br />
The current crisis reveals yet another negative trend: North Korea no longer takes American security guarantees seriously. The United States is bound by a set of obligations to protect its two allies – Japan and South Korea; therefore, it is conventionally accepted that the United States would initiate the conflict. Now that the Obama administration has shown that, unlike the previous Republican administration, it does not necessarily take so robust stance on defending its allies, North Korea has begun to “vet” the United States to see if, under certain circumstances, they would be prepared to abandon their allies in the Pacific, especially since the United States already has serious ongoing commitments to two theaters of conflict: Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />

Vessey Senior Fellow for Conflict Prevention and Director of the Center for Preventive Action @ CFR, Adjunct Professor, Georgetown University, PhD (Paul B., 13 January 2011, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://38north.org/2011/01/on-escalation-in-korea/" rel="nofollow">http://38north.org/2011/01/on-escalation-in-korea/</a>, RBatra)</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Despite intermittent crises and many deadly clashes, nearly six decades have passed since the armistice agreement “ending” the Korean War was signed without there being a serious resumption of military hostilities. Though the armed standoff in Korea is hardly a desirable state of affairs, this record can be taken as a reassuring sign of its underlying stability. But how sanguine should we be that the current crisis will recede in much the same way that earlier ones have and that the deterrent relationship will hold? In fact, recent events raise some troubling questions about the volatility of the situation in Korea today.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">First, the November 23, 2010 shelling of Yeongpyeong Island by North Korean artillery clearly caught many experts by surprise. North-South relations had been thawing after a summer of heightened tensions following the sinking of the ROK naval ship Cheonan in March. Even the revelation of new nuclear enrichment facilities immediately prior to the attack had seemed to accomplish its putative goal of convincing the outside world that North Korea could not be left to stew in its own juices and that engagement was now imperative. So why would North Korea set back its coercive diplomatic campaign by launching yet another deadly provocation that antagonized everyone—including its principal patron China—just when the wind was clearly beginning to blow in its favor? Did North Korea fail to see this or did it miscalculate the impact of its actions? Did other factors, notably the succession process underway in Pyongyang, affect the calculus or tip the scales in some decisive way?</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Second, the attack on Yeongpyeong Island was also surprising in that it targeted areas inhabited by civilians for the first time since the Korean War. This was no accident, but a carefully choreographed and well executed attack as Joe Bermudez’s excellent account of what happened indicates. Yes, the numbers killed were still less than previous incidents. And yes, one can infer that the choice of Yeongpyeong still signaled restraint by North Korea as the military base on the island had been the source of offending live fire drills and, moreover, represented an “off peninsula” target and thus less likely to trigger wider escalation. But why would North Korea decide to brazenly disregard such an established “red line,” to say nothing of a cardinal international norm, at this time? Can we infer from this a growing willingness to breach other red lines and engage in still more risky behavior?</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Third, the rapid change in South Korean public opinion from being largely pacifist and unwilling to countenance a forceful response against North Korea to the situation today where a majority now favor military retaliation if provoked has introduced a new element into the crisis. Tough statements by senior ROK officials—including President Lee Myung Bak—that South Korea will use force in the event of another aggressive act suggest that the days of Southern forbearance are over. This is completely understandable and, to many, a necessary prerequisite to deter future provocations. Yet, how confident can we be—especially in light of recent events—that North Korea will take the threat of South Korean retaliation seriously? Might it only goad them further? And should we worry that South Korea might take preemptive action if it had credible indications of another provocation?</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Remarkably, despite all the commentary on the current crisis, to say nothing of the obvious stakes involved, scant attention has been given to how tensions might actually escalate rather than dissipate contrary to past experience. Certainly plenty of commentators have warned about how “miscalculation,” “loss of control” and “unintended escalation” could trigger a new Korean war, but rarely beyond such broad generalizations and assertions. Conversely, those who discount the likelihood of significant escalation should the South retaliate militarily in the future have been no more forthcoming in explaining why the risk remains low other than repeating the broad conviction that it is in neither side’s interests to go to war. As we have seen in many cases, however, an expectation of rational behavior—especially for decision makers under conditions of stress and incomplete information­­—is not something that can be reliably assumed.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The propensity of another major clash on or around the peninsula to escalate militarily depends on numerous complex factors. Understanding them may seem like an arcane or academic exercise, but it is in fact critically important to considering how best to manage the current crisis and prevent the very outcome that everyone—including presumably the North Koreans—wishes to avoid. Four interrelated variables are likely to be the critical ingredients to how another deadly clash might escalate. These can be simplified as the “who, where, what and why” factors:</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Who’s Involved: In the most recent provocations, North Korea has evidently been careful to confine their operations to South Korean targets. A future incident that either intentionally or accidentally involves U.S. forces or citizens in Korea would clearly raise the stakes. It is has been some time since this has happened and one could infer that North Korea understands that the risks have grown too high and thus they will continue to refrain from any direct or harmful interactions with the United States. The decision to carry out joint U.S.-ROK naval exercises in the vicinity of the recent provocations presumably had this in mind to help deter further attacks. Yet, how sure can we really be that North Korea would not target U.S. forces in the future? Might they make the same calculation that the U.S. will be just as risk averse to taking retaliatory action as the ROK has been to date? And even if they do continue to avoid provocations that may involve the U.S., how confident are we that they would know when U.S. forces or citizens are not in harm’s way? Finally, while the involvement of the U.S. would clearly increase the risk of military escalation, we should also not overlook the potential role of Japan. It too has been the target of past provocations and its tolerance for aggressive North Korean behavior has lessened considerably in recent years while its capacity for military retaliation has manifestly increased.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Where the Interactions Take Place: As several analysts have pointed out, the Cheonan and Yeongpyeong incidents are the latest in a decade-long sequence of military clashes along the disputed Northern Limit Line (NLL)—all of which have stayed localized. Were additional incidents to occur in this same general area, the supposition is that South Korea would retaliate in the proximate vicinity and in a proportional way to reduce the risk of further escalation. This raises the question of whether North Korea would view South Korean retaliation against mainland, i.e. “on peninsular” targets—which are reportedly now being considered—as a qualitatively different and therefore disproportionate response regardless of how discrete or contained they were? There is no assurance, in any case, that North Korea would confine any future provocations to the NLL/Yellow Sea area. Meddling with the Kaesong Industrial Complex, including the detention of South Koreans who work there, has been mentioned as a possibility. Insertion of special forces into the South if only for reconnaissance purposes is also not out of the question. There have been plenty of precedents after all. Neither should Seoul be viewed as off limits as demonstrated by the failed assassination attempt in late 2009 by a North Korean “hit team” against their most senior defector Hwang Jang Yop. How South Korea would respond proportionately to these or similar types of activities are not immediately clear, though one can anticipate considerable public agitation to retaliate promptly.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">What Type of Interactions Take Place: The scale, intensity, and nature of any further military interactions clearly have a major bearing on how a crisis would subsequently escalate. Intermittent artillery duels across the NLL and even the DMZ would probably not precipitate a major outbreak of hostilities. The use of airpower, however, which has been raised as a possible retaliatory option by the new ROK Defense Minister, introduces a new, more uncertain element since it entails the direct incursion of sovereign territory and thus represents a clearer political affront to the North. (It also introduces the possibility of downed and captured pilots that could also complicate matters). Targeting major symbols of national power such as nuclear facilities and missile bases—however surgically undertaken—would undoubtedly represent a still greater challenge to the North which we can reliably assume would not go unanswered. The most important variable, however, will be the perceived operational status of each side’s main offensive capabilities. If either North or South Korea perceives that opposing forces are being readied to engage in large scale offensive operations, the incentives to strike first will inevitably increase. For the North the reason would be to avert the almost certain demise of the regime and for the South it would be to minimize the risk to Seoul. But, as has often been observed, precautionary defensive measures designed to bolster deterrence are not easily distinguishable from offensive preparations and thus the potential for miscalculation exists. Here changes to the size, disposition, and alert status of U.S. forces in and around Korea, including the potential activation of reinforcements and the evacuation of non-combatants from forward areas, will be absolutely critical to perceptions of intent.</span></span><br />

Beijing's record during 2010 was far more disconcerting. In March, North Korea sank a South Korean corvette, killing forty-six sailors. In November, it revealed the existence of a facility for enriching uranium, providing Pyongyang an additional prospective path for fissile material development apart from its existing plutonium capability. Later in the same month, it shelled a coastal island, killing South Korean soldiers and civilians. Yet China declined to call Pyongyang to account for these outrages, and sought to protect North Korea from international opprobrium.<br />
China's responses diverged sharply from those of the United States, South Korea and Japan. It talked the talk of major-power cooperation but it did not walk the walk, even in the face of direct threats to regional stability and security about which Beijing has professed repeated concern. Moreover, Beijing openly chastised Washington for undertaking enhanced defense cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo to inhibit additional provocations by Pyongyang.<br />
South Korea has stated that it will no longer tolerate future provocations by the North. It also voices open doubt that Beijing will restrain Pyongyang. South Korean retaliation for additional North Korean actions is no longer a question of if, but of when. Even if Seoul responds in a focused and proportionate manner, such retaliation creates the danger of a cycle of escalation. <br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Korean Peninsula represents the immediate test case for Hu and Obama to &quot;reset&quot; U.S.-China relations and address questions of immediate concern to both countries. The two presidents must undertake three steps to restore genuine cooperation.</span></span><br />
Chinese pressure on North Korea is key to maintain regional stability. The most fundamental part of its strategic calculus is U.S. presence in South Korea<br />
Putten 12/21—research fellow with the Clingendael Institue in The Hague, PhD in History (Frans-Paul van der Putten, 21 December 2010, “Sino-US geopolitical rivalry does not help Korean stability”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/21/sino-us-geopolitical-rivalry-does-not-help-korean-stability/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/21/sino-us-geopolitical-rivalry-does-not-help-korean-stability/</a>, RBatra)<br />
The United States government believes China needs to do more to contribute to stability on the Korean peninsula. According to this view, North Korea is highly dependent on Chinese support and Beijing should use its influence to moderate Pyongyang’s behavior. As some American and other Western observers have put it, it is time for China to start behaving like a responsible great power. But it is not likely that China will fundamentally alter its policies.<br />
The main reason for this is that geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States overshadows the situation on the Korean peninsula. Lately both Chinese and US actions have escalated this rivalry. As long as the two powers are more interested in keeping the other in check than in stabilising the peninsula no significant progress in terms of stabilising the region is possible.<br />
North Korea recently shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong after a period of escalating tensions, killing two soldiers and two civilians. North Korea claims that it opened fire after being provoked by a South Korean exercise. In response to the shelling incident the US and South Korea have conducted joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea. These involved a US aircraft carrier and are regarded as threatening not only by North Korea but also by China.<br />
China’s economic and diplomatic support for North Korea undermines efforts by other countries to affect the behavior of the regime in Pyongyang. Even China is troubled by North Korean behavior. The North Korean nuclear program, and the risks Pyongyang is running in escalating tensions with South Korea and the US, are counter to China’s security interests. Theoretically, the Chinese government could therefore decide to put pressure on Pyongyang by limiting its economic support and by ending the diplomatic support it often gives in the United Nations Security Council. It is very unlikely that China’s policy towards North Korea will change much. The US diplomatic reports revealed by WikiLeaks are a confirmation of uneasy Sino-North Korean relations rather than an indication that this relationship is about to change.<br />
China will probably continue to give more support than any other country because it is highly vulnerable to the consequences of political or economic collapse in North Korea. The longest and most accessible border of North Korea is the one it shares with China. Chaos in North Korea would harm stability in China’s northeast, the region formerly known as Manchuria.<br />
Moreover, Beijing is less motivated to put pressure on the North Korean regime than other countries are. The US is primarily interested in preventing the proliferation of nuclear technologies from North Korea. South Korea and Japan are mainly worried about the military threat from the north. Compared with these countries, China is less concerned about such issues.<br />
The most fundamental element in China’s policy towards North Korea is that Beijing regards the US as a greater security threat than the situation on the Korean peninsula. Since neither China nor the US is by itself the predominant great power in Korean affairs, Beijing can only assume responsibility for regional stability if it does so jointly with the US. However, this will not happen since China and the US each regard one another as their main potential military adversary. They also have contrary interests on the Korean peninsula.<br />
While China regards the US military presence in South Korea as a potential threat that should eventually be removed, the US intends to maintain this presence as it helps to limit Chinese regional influence. The relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang cannot be seen apart from this context of geopolitical rivalry. It is desirable for China that the regime in North Korea continues to exist and that the Chinese government retains a certain degree of influence in Pyongyang.<br />
The recent meeting changed nothing—military presence prevents Chinese pressure and risks regional arms races and war<br />
Klein-Ahlbrandt 1/21—China Adviser and North East Asia Project Director at Crisis Group, supervises the work of a small team of analysts responsible for high quality research and analysis on North East Asia (Stephanie Klein-Ahlbrandt, 21 January 2011, Despite Reports, “China's North Korea Policy Stays the Same,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-t-kleineahlbrandt/post_1614_b_812407.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-t-kleineahlbrandt/post_1614_b_812407.html</a>, RBatra)<br />
During Hu Jintao's visit, he penned a joint statement with President Obama in which -- for the first time -- he voiced concern about North Korea's new uranium enrichment. Many in the U.S. and South Korea are hailing this as support for their position, but they should know better. Despite tactical moves to smooth Hu Jintao's visit, little about China's North Korea policy has changed over the last few weeks nor is it likely to anytime soon.<br />
In the past, a less strident Beijing's willingness to calibrate its responses to North Korean provocations was key to the West's strategy to moderate Pyongyang's behavior. But internal debates on North Korea policy have given way to traditionalist and conservative forces increasingly dictating the line, backed by nationalist public opinion. Over the past year and a half, China has strengthened its political, economic and military relationship with the North, refusing to hold Pyongyang to account for deadly attacks on the South which recently brought the peninsula the closest to war since 1953.<br />
China's top concern of instability on its border deepened in 2009 following reports of Kim Jong-Il's failing health, a disastrous currency reform, and uncertainties surrounding leadership transition. But Beijing's calculations are also increasingly shaped by rising concerns about a perceived U.S. strategic &quot;return to Asia&quot; and by opposition to American military and political presence in the region. China is using its close ties with Pyongyang as a bulwark against U.S. military dominance in the region, giving the rogue nation virtually unconditional diplomatic protection. The two presidents' joint statement this week glosses over all of these realities.<br />
When North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island on November 23 and after the sinking of the South Korean naval ship Cheonan on March 26, China's initial reaction was to dismiss international calls to pressure North Korea. Instead, it criticized U.S. and South Korea for military exercises held in response, which it viewed as more threatening to its security than North Korea's violent behavior. It felt the U.S. was using tensions on the Peninsula as a justification to expand its regional military presence. China also worried about the deepening military cooperation between the U.S., South Korea and Japan, seeing U.S. security assistance not only as an attempt to contain China but also as emboldening regional players against it. While weeks after the shelling, China toned down its criticism of the U.S. and sent an envoy to Pyongyang, it has made no changes to its fundamental economic, military and political support to Pyongyang. Beijing's tactical moves should not be confused with a broader shift in its approach towards North Korea.<br />
Beijing's solidarity with Pyongyang has significantly strained relations with South Korea and Japan, which are strengthening their security alliances with the U.S. Their rejection of China's call for emergency consultations after the Yeonpyeong Island shelling was more than a display of frustration at Beijing's unwillingness to take concrete action. It showed a widening gap between the two camps' perceptions of the North Korean threat and the appropriate ways to manage it. There is a real danger that the North will continue its asymmetric attacks in the Yellow Sea or elsewhere in the South. In response, Japan and South Korea are significantly boosting their military capabilities, intensifying the risk of a regional arms race or of a miscalculation leading to war.<br />
Beijing's stance on North Korea is only the latest example of its increasingly assertive foreign policy behavior. Over the past year, it has intensified sweeping claims to disputed territories in the South China Sea and Diaoyu Islands, escalated a minor incident at sea into a major confrontation with Japan, and showed off a new stealth fighter aircraft just as the U.S. and China were trying to restart their military relations. Beijing is more unwilling now to yield to external demands and increasingly expects quid pro quos from the West in return for cooperation on third country issues such as North Korea and Iran. A common question in Chinese policy circles is why continue to cooperate with the U.S. when it continues to sell arms to Taiwan.<br />
China needs to step up to the plate and assume the responsibilities that come with its rising power status. It has censured North Korea in the past after the 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. Its failure to do the same now -- for the Cheonan sinking, Yeonpyeong Island attack and Pyongyang's new uranium enrichment -- endangers not just the region but also its own security interests. Shielding Pyongyang and continuing unconditional engagement reduces all other countries' ability to deter North Korea. China's strategy leaves it vulnerable to accusation that it is responsible for enabling North Korea's next attack. Let's hope President Obama realizes the joint statement must be backed up with a stern message to President Hu that Beijing's increasingly cozy relationship with Pyongyang and insistence on backing the North's bad behavior only heightens the risk of regional conflict.<br />
China’s top priority is to preserve North Korea as a buffer against the U.S.—causes them to water down sanctions<br />
Carpenter 10—<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">vice president for defense and foreign-policy studies at the Cato Institute (Ted Galen, Winter 2010, Plan B for Dealing with North Korea, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/Policy-TedGalenCarpenter.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pubs/Policy-TedGalenCarpenter.pdf</a>, RBatra)</span></span><br />
The strategy of imposing tighter economic sanctions also faces major hurdles. Both Beijing and Moscow have consistently opposed vigorous sanctions in the UN Security Council, arguing that they will make Pyongyang less rather than more cooperative. The Russians and Chinese (particularly the latter) were successful in dramatically diluting the 2009 sanctions that the United States and Japan wanted. <br />
It is especially important to understand the reasons for China's reluctance to endorse truly robust sanctions. Although a few Sinophobes in the United States charge that China is in league with the North Koreans and would not mind a nuclear-armed North Korea, most evidence suggests that Beijing is not eager to see nuclear weapons introduced on the Korean Peninsula. Among other drawbacks, such a development may lead the Japanese to build nuclear deterrents of their own, which is the last thing China wants. <br />
Maintaining the non-nuclear status quo on the Korean Peninsula may be a significant Chinese objective, but it is not their most important one.5 Beijing's top priority is to preserve the North Korean state as a buffer between China and the US sphere of influence in Northeast Asia. Chinese leaders probably fear that rigorous sanctions would increase the danger of the North Korean state imploding, much as East Germany did in 1989. Such a development could lead to a unified Korea allied to the United States right on China's doorsteps-probably with the continued presence of American military bases on the Korean Peninsula. It might lead to a massive flow of North Korean refugees into China. Uneasiness over these scenarios limits the amount of pressure that Beijing is willing to exert on Pyongyang. <br />
In theory, China might be able to use its economic leverage as North Korea's principal source of energy, food, and other vital commodities to compel Kim Jong Il's regime to halt its nuclear weapons program. Without Chinese cooperation, coercive economic measures would have little impact on Pyongyang. And given Washington's dependence on Beijing's willingness to continue funding the soaring US Treasury debt, American officials are not in a good bargaining position to pressure China into endorsing robust sanctions.<br />
Withdrawal would force China to cooperate on North Korea—solves regional diplomatic disputes<br />
Garfinkle 3 – taught American foreign policy and Middle East politics at the University of Pennsylvania and is editor of The National Interest (1/27/03, Adam, National Review, “Checking Kim,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://article.nationalreview.com/267742/checking-kim/garfinkle" rel="nofollow">http://article.nationalreview.com/267742/checking-kim/garfinkle</a>, JMP)<br />
NO NORMAL DIPLOMACY<br />
The U.S. finds itself in an unenviable situation: one in which it has no military options, yet normal diplomacy is futile. Diplomacy of the sort being pressed upon the U.S. by South Korea amounts to paying North Koreans for acting temporarily less scary until the next occasion for extortion. I have argued that the only way to solve the problem is to transcend it: to think not like a diplomat, who is paid to manage, but like a statesman, who is paid to transform basic circumstances. I proposed last October that the major powers — the U.S., Japan, Russia, and China — unite to condition aid to North Korea in such a way as ultimately to undermine North Korean sovereignty. This proposal stood at least a chance of getting at the real source of the problem, which is the nature of the North Korean regime; and it could provide benefits to all the major powers that they could not otherwise achieve for themselves. I also acknowledged its drawbacks: that North Korea would not easily allow itself to be managed into oblivion and might lash out (which might happen anyway); and that the degree of cooperation we required, especially from China, might not be forthcoming.<br />
China has in fact proved recalcitrant, but not irremediably so. Indeed, the Chinese seem to appreciate the gravity of the present situation, and may still be prepared to cooperate with the U.S. if we persist in our efforts. The reason is that the Chinese may ultimately put their own national interest above habit. The key Chinese interest is that Korea not be nuclearized, because that presupposes a nuclear Japan. China also prefers, however, for perfectly understandable Realpolitik reasons, that Korea not be unified. China has been a free rider on U.S. policy and power for years to achieve both of these interests, and has never been forced to choose between the two. Now that choice is looming: China's reliance on U.S. policy to prevent the nuclearization of the Korean peninsula is proving ill-founded. Meanwhile, as a result of North Korean proliferation, the U.S. has an interest in bringing about a unified non-nuclear Korea in which some redefined U.S. military presence underwrites the peninsula's non-nuclear status. If forced to choose between a) a nuclear North Korea and b) a unified Korea under Seoul's aegis whose non-nuclear status is underwritten by the U.S., China would be slightly crazy not to choose the latter. But it will not so choose until the choice becomes inevitable.<br />
A secondary Chinese interest, often cited, is Beijing's fear of chaos on its border. But unless one assumes that North Korea can be reformed successfully, a proposition for which there is no evidence, waiting will only make things worse from the Chinese perspective. The more time the North Korean regime has both to fail and to build nuclear weapons, the more likely its eventual collapse will be maximally calamitous. China's policy today amounts to propping up an influence-resistant and disaster-prone regime — seething with refugees ready to pour across the Chinese border by the hundreds of thousands. Concert with the U.S., Japan, and Russia, on the other hand, would give China far more influence over what may happen in North Korea , and help to manage it. If the Chinese leadership sees its choices for what they really are, why would it choose a course of minimal influence and maximum ultimate peril?<br />
SENDING OUT FOR CHINESE<br />
And so we come to thoughts the administration may or may not have allowed itself to think, about how the U.S. can achieve the cooperation it needs to solve the North Korean problem. In other words, how can we bring other powers, particularly China, to the point of serious decisions that will lead them to join with the United States?<br />
Charles Krauthammer recently suggested using the &quot;Japan card&quot; for this purpose — in other words, telling the Chinese that their failure to help us isolate North Korea would make the U.S. receptive to Japanese nuclear-weapons development. The U.S. need not say a word to Beijing about this, however; the Chinese understand the stakes better than we do. Besides, we have a far more dramatic option — the explanation of which requires a brief preface.<br />
It made sense for the U.S. to risk war on the Korean peninsula between 1953 and the end of the Cold War, for Korea was bound up in a larger struggle. We could not opt out of any major theater in that struggle without the risk of losing all. But it no longer makes sense to run such risks. What larger stakes since 1991 have justified the costs and dangers of keeping 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea, the overburdening of the U.S.-South Korean relationship, and the tensions caused to the U.S.-Japanese alliance? None that is readily apparent in the cold light of U.S. interests.<br />
The division of Korea puts U.S. interests at risk more than it does those of any other major regional power (we have troops there; we — not China or Russia or Japan — face directly a nuclearizing adversary), and for the sake of the lowest stakes. Think about what the U.S. might suffer if war broke out in Korea, and about what we would gain from its not breaking out. We would suffer thousands of dead GIs, the probable ascription of responsibility for the razing of Seoul (and maybe Tokyo), and maybe accidental conflict with China. What do we gain from the status quo? Perpetual diplomatic heartburn with Japan and others, and the privilege of fruitlessly negotiating with Pyongyang.<br />
In short, the end of the Cold War dramatically changed the balance of risks and rewards in U.S. Korea policy, and should have led us to adjust our stance. But U.S. policymakers conducted business as usual, only responding to North Korean threats and never themselves taking the lead to solve the underlying problem. We should have managed the transition to South Korea's responsibility for its own security, while at the same time joining with other regional powers to limit North Korea's trouble-making potential. Had we started early enough, before North Korea had nukes, we would have had far more robust military options to enforce a muscular diplomacy than we do today.<br />
Better late than never, however; we still need to rethink the Korea problem down to its roots. When we do, we immediately see our other option: Announce our intention to withdraw all U.S. military forces from Korea. Lots of South Koreans would be delighted. More important, such an announcement would force China and the other parties to the problem to face reality.<br />
South Koreans, having to defend themselves, will either see the illusions of their own policy or suffer the consequences of maintaining it. But it's their country, and, frankly, their potential misfortune no longer matters to us as much as it did during the Cold War.<br />
If North Korea becomes a six-or-more-weapon nuclear power, we will be far away, with deterrence reasonably intact, and with a decent if imperfect ability to prevent North Korea from exporting fissile materials and missiles. China, however, cannot relocate. If we profess an intention to leave, Beijing will then have to choose between a nuclear North Korea and Japan (and maybe South Korea, too) on its doorstep, or joining with the U.S. and others to manage the containment, and ultimately the withering away, of the North Korean state. Until it is faced with such a choice, Beijing will temporize and try to fob off the problem on Washington, hoping as before to free-ride on us for an outcome that benefits China more than it benefits the U.S. That's reality, and the Chinese need to face it. We can help them do so. <br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">China continues to calculate that an erratic, nuclearized NK is preferable to unification on Southern terms. A peninsula-wide version of SK is the only realistic unity scenario given NK’s extreme backwardness – decrepit, corrupt NK probably could not even manage the whole peninsula – and SK’s demonstrated unwillingness to sacrifice democracy for unity. China’s continued subsidization for NK’s economy is well-known and has only become more crucial as events like the famines, failed currency reform, UN sanctions, expensive nuclear program, and continued resistance to Chinese-style reforms have effectively devastated the NK economy, all the more ironic for its autarkic claims of juche. (The CIA estimates NK’s GDP at just $42 billion for 24 million people.) China’s refusal to endorse the Security Council reprimand of NK over the Cheonan signaled that when pushed, it will choose North over South.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">This opens the door for continued NK intransigence and provocation. Given NK’s extreme asymmetric dependence on China, it is highly unlikely that NK would openly cross its benefactor. One can only speculate what if any Chinese red-line warnings on provocations were given to Kim Jong-Il on his recent trips to Beijing. Yeonpyeong probably did not cross that line, as the Chinese response has been widely regarded as tepid and insufficient.</span></span><br />
Korea war goes global and nuclear<br />
STRATFOR 10 (5/26/10, “North Korea, South Korea: The Military Balance on the Peninsula,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100526_north_korea_south_korea_military_balance_peninsula" rel="nofollow">http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100526_north_korea_south_korea_military_balance_peninsula</a>, JMP)<br />
So the real issue is the potential for escalation — or an accident that could precipitate escalation — that would be beyond the control of Pyongyang or Seoul. With both sides on high alert, both adhering to their own national (and contradictory) definitions of where disputed boundaries lie and with rules of engagement loosened, the potential for sudden and rapid escalation is quite real.<br />
Indeed, North Korea’s navy, though sizable on paper, is largely a hollow shell of old, laid-up vessels. What remains are small fast attack craft and submarines — mostly Sang-O “Shark” class boats and midget submersibles. These vessels are best employed in the cluttered littoral environment to bring asymmetric tactics to bear — not unlike those Iran has prepared for use in the Strait of Hormuz. These kinds of vessels and tactics — including, especially, the deployment of naval mines — are poorly controlled when dispersed in a crisis and are often impossible to recall.<br />
For nearly 40 years, tensions on the Korean Peninsula were managed within the context of the wider Cold War. During that time it was feared that a second Korean War could all too easily escalate into and a thermonuclear World War III, so both Pyongyang and Seoul were being heavily managed from their respective corners. In fact, USFK was long designed to ensure that South Korea could not independently provoke that war and drag the Americans into it, which for much of the Cold War period was of far greater concern to Washington than North Korea attacking southward.<br />
Today, those constraints no longer exist. There are certainly still constraints — neither the United States nor China wants war on the peninsula. But current tensions are quickly escalating to a level unprecedented in the post-Cold War period, and the constraints that do exist have never been tested in the way they might be if the situation escalates much further. <br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Chinese cooperation on sanctioning North Korea is the only way to solve de-nuclearization</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Oh 10—PhD from Korea University in North Korean studies, researcher at the Sejong Institute (Gyeong-seob, Sejong Policy Studies, Vol. 6, No. 2, 2010, “International Cooperation for the Denuclearization of North Korea: Limitations and Alternatives,” RBatra)</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">To force North Korea to abandon its nuclear programs, the international community has to consider the fact that the North has developed nuclear weapons as a means of survival. It should therefore either make it too costly for the North to continue its nuclear programs – to the extent that possessing nuclear arms threatens the existence of the regime – or collectively guarantee its survival. The international community, however, has failed to increase the cost for the North’s nuclear armament due to the limitations of applied sanctions. On the other hand, under the anarchistic system of the international community, it also is difficult for nations to provide comprehensive security measures to protect North Korea, let alone carry them out, because nations are afraid of being deceived by others.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Those are the two key obstacles to international cooperation in the denuclearization of North Korea.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">2) Limitations of the Sanctions</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">For successful international cooperation in denuclearizing North Korea, the cost of possessing nuclear weapons and subsequent disadvantage should be so immense as to make the North’s regime feel a serious threat of its demise. To arouse such a sense of vulnerability, concerned nations should take military options or enforce strong punitive sanctions. But a military strike has been excluded from feasible options since the first North Korean nuclear crisis of the early 1990s. At the height of the first nuclear crisis, Washington had prepared phased military action as well as economic sanctions, but the military option was shelved after former President Jimmy Carter’s visit to Pyongyang. Both South Korean and Chinese authorities also strongly objected to taking military actions against the North: Seoul feared the possibility of an all-out war with the North while China was worried about the destabilization of the regional situation. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Therefore, from the first nuclear crisis, North Korea perceived that the United States was unable to take military steps and consequently, the international community faced serious limitations in reining in North Korea. In the following years, the North test-fired long-range missiles, conducted nuclear tests twice and disclosed a uranium enrichment program to boldly escalate the crisis, and finally declared its being a nuclear-possessing power.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">During the second North Korean nuclear crisis, South Korea and China opposed the U.S.-led economic sanctions against the North, which they argued would only aggravate the security situation on the Korean peninsula. Beginning in the late 1990s, South Korea promoted an engagement policy with the North, asserting that the South could induce the North to abandon its nuclear programs through dialogue if the international community eased pressure on the Pyongyang regime. The Roh Moo-hyun administration in Seoul did not take strong punitive actions even after the North conducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 but instead increased economic aid and expanded economic cooperation.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">China took a lukewarm attitude at the time of the North’s first nuclear test, and then agreed to the U.N. Security Council resolution after the second test, but without joining sanctions against Pyongyang. In other words, the international community failed to deliver a clear message to North Korea that its possession of nuclear weapons could lead to the collapse of its present regime. And there also was no dramatic rise in the North’s cost of possessing nuclear arms.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The UNSC adopted Resolution 1718 after North Korea conducted its first nuclear test on October 9, 2006, and Resolution 1874 after the second nuclear test on May 25, 2009. Under these U.N. resolutions, North Korea is being subjected to international sanctions that include bans on financial transactions related to weapons of mass destruction and arms trade, search of suspected ships and seizure of banned items, and prohibition on exporting luxury goods to the North. But these measures have exposed fundamental limitations in threatening the survival of the North Korean regime.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">3) Concerns about Deception among Nations</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Some experts have claimed that North Korea would give up its nuclear programs when a peace treaty is concluded between the North and the United States and other nations concerned. This argument ignores the reality of international politics, however. When we review the events related to the North Korean nuclear issue over the past two decades, both the United States and North Korea were unable to reach an agreement because of their mutual distrust and they exhibited very little possibility of implementing any agreement because of their mutual worries of being deceived by the other side.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">During the past 20 years, North Korea has deceived the international community by vowing nonproliferation but at the same time taking strenuous steps to obtain nuclear materials. At the time of the first nuclear crisis, North Korea broke its promise to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and unilaterally declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. The 1994 Agreed Framework, an accord between the United States and North Korea signed after months of negotiations in Geneva, was scrapped under mutual distrust prompted by the North’s acts of deception.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Pyongyang secretly carried out a uranium enrichment program after the signing of the Geneva accord, which provided a freeze of the North’s nuclear programs in exchange for energy aid by the United States, South Korea and other nations. The six-party talks to settle the second North Korean nuclear crisis have produced agreements and promises, none of which have been faithfully implemented. The two nuclear tests by North Korea have proved that the North has been cheating the international community.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">A review of the first and second nuclear crises suggests an extremely low possibility that the international community and North Korea can reach an agreement through dialogue. Even if an agreement is reached, the chances are very low that the agreement will be honored, and there is no way of verifying its implementation if Pyongyang promises to do so.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The international community suspects that North Korea could break any promise and resume nuclear programs; on the other hand, the North would not completely trust the international community’s guarantee of the security of the regime. National security is a matter of survival and any mistake is irreversible. It is unrealistic to expect North Korea to forsake its nuclear programs on the back of international assurances.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Even if the United States and South Korea make good their assurance of North Korea’s security following complete denuclearization of the country, there still can be serious problems. Suppose the North Korean system is so durable that it can withstand external influences; the Pyongyang regime could quicken its economic openness and adopt reforms – and be unthreatened.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">But, Pyongyang leaders know how vulnerable their system is. Since the collapse of the socialist system, North Korea has remained a pariah, pursuing “socialism of our own” and defying reform and openness. It is therefore unimaginable that North Korea would trust non-interference by the world in its domestic affairs. Summing up, North Korea’s demand for an international guarantee of its security is nothing but a ploy to justify its nuclear arsenal and to delay multilateral denuclearization talks.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">2. China’s Non-participation in International Sanctions</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">International efforts to disarm North Korea have failed because of China’s reluctance to participate in sanctions on the North. Following North Korea’s second nuclear test in May 2009, there were heated debates between China’s “strategists” and “traditionalists.” The former argued that the Chinese government should strongly push for the North’s denuclearization by fully utilizing its political and economic leverage on Pyongyang, pointing to changes in the two countries’ bilateral relations. The traditionalists emphasized the importance of the Beijing-Pyongyang alliance. They called for substantial economic aid to the North, which they said was necessary to stabilize the North Korean situation and prevent provocative activities against South Korea and the United States.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The traditionalists won the debate. The Chinese government decided that the stabilization of the North Korean regime was more important than the denuclearization of the North. In order to prevent the fall of the North Korean regime, China started economic aid to the North.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">When special relations between nations cause a crack in international sanctions against a targeted country, the measures are destined to lose their effect. China resisted sanctions on North Korea because of its unstable relations with the United States. In the post-Cold War era, the ideological and systemic differences between the United States and China and their economic and psychological conflicts have produced a roller-coaster relationship that alternates between competition and cooperation.</span></span><br />
North Korean prolif risks nuclear strikes and broad Asian prolif<br />

The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious, not only for the Northeast Asian region but for the whole international community.<br />
At worst, there is the possibility of nuclear attack1, whether by intention, miscalculation, or merely accident, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities. On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust of unprecedented proportions.<br />
But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: <br />
That is not global winter, but the nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years. The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow…The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger…To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.4<br />
These, of course, are not the only consequences. Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. The direct impacts, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, could make the present global financial crisis pale by comparison. How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. There could be many unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with subsequent nuclear breakout and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, and aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant states. The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community. <br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">North Korea is currently believed to have sufficient plutonium stocks to produce up to 12 nuclear weapons.6 If and when it is successful in implementing a uranium enrichment program - having announced publicly that it is experimenting with enrichment technology on September 4, 20097 in a communication with the UN Security Council - it would likely acquire the capacity to produce over 100 such weapons. Although some may dismiss Korean Peninsula proliferation risks on the assumption that the North Korean regime will implode as a result of its own economic problems, food problems, and treatment of its own populace, there is little to suggest that this is imminent. If this were to happen, there would be the risk of nuclear weapons falling into hands of non-state actors in the disorder and chaos that would ensue. Even without the outbreak of nuclear hostilities on the Korean Peninsula in either the near or longer term, North Korea has every financial incentive under current economic sanctions and the needs of its military command economy to export its nuclear and missile technologies to other states. Indeed, it has already been doing this for some time. The Proliferation Security Initiative may conceivably prove effective in intercepting ship-borne nuclear exports, but it is by no means clear how air-transported materials could similarly be intercepted.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Given the high stakes involved, North Korean proliferation, if unaddressed and unreversed, has the potential to destabilize the whole East Asian region and beyond. Even if a nuclear exchange does not occur in the short term, the acute sense of nuclear threat that has been experienced for over five decades by North Koreans as a result of US strategic deterrence is now likely to be keenly felt by fellow Koreans south of the 38th Parallel and Japanese across the waters of the Sea of Japan. China, too, must surely feel itself to be at risk from North Korean nuclear weapons, or from escalation that might ensue from next-use in the Korean Peninsula resulting not only in the environmental consequences noted above, but in regime collapse and massive refugee flows. South Korea and Japan appear willing to rely on their respective bilateral security pacts with the United States to deter North Korean nuclear attack for the time being. However, should South Korea and/or Japan acquire nuclear weapons, the outcome would be destabilizing, especially if this resulted from rupture of their alliance relationships with the United States. Both have the technical capability to do so very rapidly. South Korea has previously engaged in nuclear weapons research but desisted after US pressure. Japan still proclaims its adherence to the three Non-Nuclear Principles although recent confirmation that the United States routinely transited nuclear weapons through Japan and retains the right of emergency reintroduction of nuclear weapons has tarnished Japan’s non-nuclear image. Moreover, it has large stockpiles of plutonium that could rapidly be used to produce nuclear warheads. Such responses, already advocated by conservative and nationalist groups within South Korea and Japan, could trigger a regional nuclear arms race involving the Koreas, Japan, Taiwan, and China, with incalculable wider consequences for Southeast Asia, South Asia and the whole Pacific and beyond. These developments would spell the demise of the current global non-proliferation regime as underpinned by the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Failure to reverse the DPRK’s nuclear breakout is also an important factor driving a general malaise in the exercise of American power which one of the authors has characterized elsewhere as “the end of American nuclear hegemony.”8</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Escalates to nuclear war</span></span><br />
Cimbala 10 - Prof. of Political Science @ Penn State, (Stephen, Nuclear Weapons and Cooperative Security in the 21st Century, p. 117-8)<br />
Failure to contain proliferation in Pyongyang could spread nuclear fever throughout Asia. Japan and South Korea might seek nuclear weapons and missile defenses. A pentagonal configuration of nuclear powers in the Pacific basis (Russia, China, Japan, and the two Koreas – not including the United States, with its own Pacific interests) could put deterrence at risk and create enormous temptation toward nuclear preemption. Apart from actual use or threat of use, North Korea could exploit the mere existence of an assumed nuclear capability in order to support its coercive diplomacy. As George H. Quester has noted:<br />
If the Pyongyang regime plays its cards sensibly and well, therefore, the world will not see its nuclear weapons being used against Japan or South Korea or anyone else, but will rather see this new nuclear arsenal held in reserve (just as the putative Israeli nuclear arsenal has been held in reserve), as a deterrent against the outside world’s applying maximal pressure on Pyongyang and as a bargaining chip to extract the economic and political concessions that the DPRK needs if it wishes to avoid giving up its peculiar approach to social engineering.<br />
A five-sided nuclear competition in the Pacific would be linked, in geopolitical deterrence and proliferation space, to the existing nuclear deterrents in India and Pakistan, and to the emerging nuclear weapons status of Iran. An arc of nuclear instability from Tehran to Tokyo could place U.S. proliferation strategies into the ash heap of history and call for more drastic military options, not excluding preemptive war, defenses, and counter-deterrent special operations. In addition, an eight-sided nuclear arms race in Asia would increase the likelihood of accidental or inadvertent nuclear war. It would do so because: (1) some of these states already have histories of protracted conflict; (2) states may have politically unreliable or immature command and control systems, especially during a crisis involving a decision for nuclear first strike or retaliation; unreliable or immature systems might permit a technical malfunction that caused an unintended launch, or a deliberate but unauthorized launch by rogue commanders; (3) faulty intelligence and warning systems might cause one side to misinterpret the other’s defensive moves to forestall attack as offensive preparations for attack, thus triggering a mistaken preemption.<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Disputes over North Korea mean there’s no chance of a cooperative relationship with China in the status quo—a new U.S. military posture is necessary</span></span><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">But in Beijing, both Chinese and American officials and analysts have another explanation: the long silence epitomizes the speed with which relations between Washington and Beijing have plunged into a freeze. This year has witnessed the longest period of tension between the two capitals in a decade. And if anything, both sides appear to be hardening their positions.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">“The issues that used to be on the positive side of the ledger are increasingly on the negative side of the ledger, starting with North Korea,” Bonnie Glaser, a China scholar at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview last week. “I don’t think this is easily repairable, and I think we’re going to have a fairly cold relationship over the next two years, and potentially longer.”</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Mr. Obama came into office seeking just the opposite: a new rapprochement with a rising power whose deep economic ties with the United States all but demand closer diplomatic ones. But the days when the White House spoke of a “G-2” that would manage the world economy and more, a phrase that preceded the first meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu in the depths of the financial crisis in early 2009, are long over.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Instead, he faces a problem very similar to the one Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton described in March 2009 during a lunch with Kevin Rudd, a China expert who was then Australia’s prime minister, according to a cable recounting their conversation that was in a newly released trove of WikiLeaks documents.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Mrs. Clinton was said to have asked Mr. Rudd, “How do you deal toughly with your banker?”‘</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The latest bad sign is that cooperation on managing North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, which began with considerable promise in 2009, appears to have disintegrated.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">On Monday, Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to convene an emergency meeting in Washington with her Japanese and South Korean counterparts about both the North’s shelling of a South Korean island last month, and its recent disclosure of a new nuclear facility that potentially expands its nuclear arsenal. China, the only nation with real sway over the North Korean leadership, will not be there.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">To the contrary, China’s strategy on North Korea is at odds with that of Washington and its allies. In Monday’s telephone call with Mr. Hu, the White House said, Mr. Obama said North Korea’s new enrichment facility flouted commitments it made during the six-party talks on curbing its nuclear program, and urged China’s help in sending “a clear message to North Korea that its provocations are unacceptable.”</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">One former Chinese official with close ties to the government dismissed the American approach last week as characteristically legalistic. The former official, who would not be named because he is not authorized to speak on the topic, said China’s strategy is to reassure the Koreans about their security, not lecture them about diplomatic obligations.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Indeed, China’s strongest public reaction to last month’s shelling of South Korea has not been to condemn the North, but to criticize Washington’s response — joint war games with South Korea that put the American carrier George Washington and its strike force in the Yellow Sea, off China’s borders.</span></span><br />

But American engagement may not be enough. The PRC could play a particularly important role in dissuading the North from its nuclear course. Indeed, H.D.S. Greenway of the Boston Globe has advocated building on &quot;the new climate of U.S.-Chinese cooperation of late.&quot; 94 Such a strategy would offer at least one additional benefit. Working together to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis successfully would make it easier to resolve other disputes between Washington and Beijing, thereby laying the groundwork for a wide-ranging partnership in the years and decades ahead. Nevertheless, the most important and immediate goal remains halting nuclear proliferation in Northeast Asia. <br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The stakes on the Korean peninsula could not be higher. If Presidents Hu and Obama are able to return to the cooperation of 2009, their joint efforts will impart to Pyongyang the clear costs of its actions, as well as inhibit additional risk taking by North Korea. It will also demonstrate that U.S.-China cooperation on crucial regional security issues is possible. If the leaders fail in these efforts, the dangers of 2010 will continue and deepen, and the risks of a wider conflict will grow.</span></span><br />
Sphere of influence concessions are key to relations<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Obama administration has explicitly sought to “reset” the relationship with Russia, which had become quite dysfunctional during the final years of the Bush administration. Although Washington has not used the reset terminology with respect to the troubled U.S. relationship with China, the substantive goal appears to be similar. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates’ effort to restore the dialogue between the militaries of the two countries is one indication of that intent.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Both goals, however, are encountering headwinds for a key reason. Policy makers seem unwilling to accept the reality that any great power in the international system expects, and will seek to enforce, a sphere of influence in its immediate region. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice famously (or infamously) insisted that the concept of a sphere of influence was both obsolete and pernicious. But that viewpoint is dangerously erroneous. The tensions between the United States and Russia and those between the United States and China confirm that point.</span></span><br />

The evolution of Sino-U.S. relations over the next months, years, and decades has the potential to have a greater impact on global security and prosperity than any other bilateral or multilateral arrangement. In this sense, many analysts consider the US.-China diplomatic relationship to be the most influential in the world. Without question, strong and stable U.S. alliances provide the foundation for the protection and promotion of U.S. and global interests. Yet within that broad framework, the trajectory of U.S.-China relations will determine the success, or failure, of efforts to address the toughest global challenges: global financial stability, energy security and climate change, nonproliferation, and terrorism, among other pressing issues. Shepherding that trajectory in the most constructive direction possible must therefore be a priority for Washington and Beijing. Virtually no major global challenge can be met without U.S.-China cooperation. The uncertainty of that future trajectory and the &quot;strategic mistrust&quot; between leaders in Washington and Beijing necessarily concerns many experts and policymakers in both countries. Although some U.S. analysts see China as a strategic competitor—deliberately vying with the United States for energy resources, military superiority, and international political influence alike— analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has generally found that China uses its soft power to pursue its own, largely economic, international agenda primarily to achieve its domestic objectives of economic growth and social stability.1 Although Beijing certainly has an eye on Washington, not all of its actions are undertaken as a counterpoint to the United States. In addition, CSIS research suggests that growing Chinese soft power in developing countries may have influenced recent U.S. decisions to engage more actively and reinvest in soft-power tools that have atrophied during the past decade. To the extent that there exists a competition between the United States and China, therefore, it may be mobilizing both countries to strengthen their ability to solve global problems. To be sure, U.S. and Chinese policy decisions toward the respective other power will be determined in large part by the choices that leaders make about their own nations interests at home and overseas, which in turn are shaped by their respective domestic contexts. Both parties must recognize—and accept—that the other will pursue a foreign policy approach that is in its own national interest. Yet, in a globalized world, challenges are increasingly transnational, and so too must be their solutions. As demonstrated by the rapid spread of SARS from China in 2003, pandemic flu can be spread rapidly through air and via international travel. Dust particulates from Asia settle in Lake Tahoe. An economic downturn in one country can and does trigger an economic slowdown in another. These challenges can no longer be addressed by either containment or isolation. What constitutes the national interest today necessarily encompasses a broader and more complex set of considerations than it did in the past As a general principle, the United States seeks to promote its national interest while it simultaneously pursues what the CSIS Commission on Smart Power called in its November 2007 report the &quot;global good.&quot;3 This approach is not always practical or achievable, of course. But neither is it pure benevolence. Instead, a strategic pursuit of the global good accrues concrete benefits for the United States (and others) in the form of building confidence, legitimacy, and political influence in key countries and regions around the world in ways that enable the United States to better confront global and transnational challenges. In short, the global good comprises those things that all people and governments want but have traditionally not been able to attain in the absence of U.S. leadership. Despite historical, cultural, and political differences between the United States and China, Beijing's newfound ability, owing to its recent economic successes, to contribute to the global good is a matter for common ground between the two countries. Today there is increasing recognition that no major global challenge can be addressed effectively, much less resolved, without the active engagement of—and cooperation between—the United States and China. The United States and China—the worlds first- and third-largest economies—are inextricably linked, a fact made ever more evident in the midst of the current global financial crisis. Weak demand in both the United States and China, previously the twin engines of global growth, has contributed to the global economic downturn and threatens to ignite simmering trade tensions between the two countries. Nowhere is the interconnectedness of the United States and China more clear than in international finance. China has $2 trillion worth of largely U.S. dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves and is the world's largest holder—by far—of U.S. government debt. Former treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson and others have suggested that the structural imbalances created by this dynamic fueled the current economic crisis. Yet. China will almost certainly be called on to purchase the lion's share of new U.S. debt instruments issued in connection with the U.S. stimulus and recovery package. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's February 23.2009, reassurance to Beijing that U.S. markets remain safe and her call for continued Chinese investment in the U.S. bond market as a means to help both countries, and the world, emerge from global recession underscored the shared interest—and central role—that both countries have in turning around the global economy quickly. Although China's considerable holdings of U.S. debt have been seen as a troubling problem, they are now being perceived as a necessary part of a global solution. Similarly, as the worlds two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and the United States share not only the collateral damage of energy-inefficient economic growth, but a primary responsibility to shape any ultimate global solutions to climate change. To date, cooperation has been elusive, owing as much to Washington's reluctance as to Beijing's intransigence. Painting China as the environmental bogeyman as an excuse for foot-dragging in policymaking is no longer an option; for its part, China, as the world's top polluter, must cease playing the developing-economy card. Yet energy security and climate change remain an area of genuine opportunity for joint achievement. Indeed, U.S.-China cooperation in this field is a sine qua non of any response to the energy and climate challenges. The sheer size of the Chinese economy means that collaboration with the United States could set the de facto global standards for etficiency and emissions in key economic sectors such as industry and transportation. Climate change also provides an area for cooperation in previously uncharted policy waters, as in emerging Arctic navigational and energy exploration opportunities. Washington and Beijing also share a deep and urgent interest in international peace and stability. The resumption of U.S.-China military contacts is a positive development. As two nuclear powers with worldwide economic and strategic interests, both countries want to minimize instability and enhance maritime security, as seen by parallel antipiracy missions in the waters otT Somalia. Joint efforts in support of United Nations peacekeeping, nonproliferation, and counterterrorism offer critical areas for bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Certainly, regional and global security institutions such as the Six-Party Talks concerning North Korea or the UN Security Council require the active engagement of both Washington and Beijing. Even more broadly, crisis management in geographic regions of mutual strategic interest like the Korean peninsula, Iran, or Burma require much more Sino-U.S. communication if the two countries are to avoid miscalculation and maximize opportunities to minimize human sutfering. Increasing the number of mid-level military-to-military exchanges would help in this regard. The United States and China could do more to cooperate on law enforcement to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in Western China. Afghanistan is competing with Burma as the main provider of narcotics to China; Washington could use its influence with the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul to develop a joint antinarcotics program. This could potentially build networks and joint capabilities that might be useful for U.S.-China cooperation on the issue of Pakistan. In addition, Washington should also encourage NATO-China cooperation along the Afghan border. Collaborating under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) might provide an additional framework for Beijing and Washington to address Central Asian security issues in a cooperative manner. 1he SCO, which includes Pakistan as an observer and will convene a multinational conference on Afghanistan in March 2009, has long made curbing narcoterrorism in Afghanistan a priority. In addition, the VS. Drug Enforcement Agency and the Chinese Anti-Narcotics Bureau should expand cooperation on interdiction and prosecution of heroin and meth traffickers. To be sure, there are a number of areas of serious divergence between Washington and Beijing. This should surprise no one. The United States has disagreements with even its allies. Two large powers with vastly dilferent histories, cultures, and political systems are bound to have challenges. History has shown, however, that the most effective way of addressing issues is for the U.S. and Chinese governments to engage in quiet diplomacy rather than public recrimination. In the U.S.-China context, there is often little to be gained—and much to be lost in terms of trust and respect—by a polarizing debate. Any differences, moreover, must not necessarily impede Sino-U.S. cooperation when both sides share strong mutual interests. I;. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that &quot;the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.&quot;3 Effective policy toward China by the United States, and vice versa, will require this kind of dual-minded intelligence. Moreover, working together on areas of mutual and global interest will help promote strategic trust between China and the United States, facilitating possible cooperation in other areas. Even limited cooperation on specific areas will help construct additional mechanisms for bilateral communication on issues of irreconcilable disagreement. In fact, many of the toughest challenges in U.S.-China relations in recent years have been the result of unforeseen events, such as the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999 and the EP-3 reconnaissance plane collision in April 2001. Building trust and finding workable solutions to tough problems is the premise behind the Obama administrations foreign policy of smart power, as articulated by Secretary of State Clinton. Smart power is based on, as Secretary Clinton outlined in her confirmation hearing, the fundamental belief that 'We must use... the full range of tools at our disposal—diplomatic, economic, military, political and cultural—picking the right tool, or combination of tools, for each situation.&quot;' As the CS1S Commission on Smart Power noted in November 2007, &quot;Smart Power is neither hard nor soft—it is the skillful combination of bothIt is an approach that underscores the necessity of a strong military, but also invests heavily in alliances, partnerships and institutions at all levels... .°5 As such, smart power necessarily mandates a major investment in a U.S.-China partnership on key issues. 'The concept enjoys broad support among the Chinese and American people and, by promoting the global good, it reaps concrete results around the world. There should be no expectation that Washington and Beijing will or should agree on all, or even most, questions. But the American and Chinese people should expect their leaders to come together on those vital issues that require their cooperation. U.S.-China partnership, though not inevitable, is indispensable.<br />

Opportunities for collaboration in fighting climate change are plentiful, but moving forward at the scale needed will require high-level political support in two very different societies, each with considerable suspicion of the other. This report recommends ways to win such support and sustain it for the long term.<br />
Chapter 1 of the report provides a primer on two topics: climate change and U.S.-China relations. It describes the climate change threat, concluding that every year of delay in responding to it puts both countries—and the planet—at greater risk. Because the United States and China are the world’s top two greenhouse gas emitters, together accounting for more than 40% of annual emissions, any solution requires both countries to transition to low-carbon economies. U.S.-China cooperation on climate change would have not only bilateral but global benefits.<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Finally, there is one major existential threat to American security (as well as prosperity) of a nonviolent nature, which, though far in the future, demands urgent action. It is the threat of global warming to the stability of the climate upon which all earthly life depends. Scientists worldwide have been observing the gathering of this threat for three decades now, and what was once a mere possibility has passed through probability to near certainty. Indeed not one of more than 900 articles on climate change published in refereed scientific journals from 1993 to 2003 doubted that anthropogenic warming is occurring. “In legitimate scientific circles,” writes Elizabeth Kolbert, “it is virtually impossible to find evidence of disagreement over the fundamentals of global warming.” Evidence from a vast international scientific monitoring effort accumulates almost weekly, as this sample of newspaper reports shows: an international panel predicts “brutal droughts, floods and violent storms across the planet over the next century”; climate change could “literally alter ocean currents, wipe away huge portions of Alpine Snowcaps and aid the spread of cholera and malaria”; “glaciers in the Antarctic and in Greenland are melting much faster than expected, and…worldwide, plants are blooming several days earlier than a decade ago”; “rising sea temperatures have been accompanied by a significant global increase in the most destructive hurricanes”; “NASA scientists have concluded from direct temperature measurements that 2005 was the hottest year on record, with 1998 a close second”; “Earth’s warming climate is estimated to contribute to more than 150,000 deaths and 5 million illnesses each year” as disease spreads; “widespread bleaching from Texas to Trinidad…killed broad swaths of corals” due to a 2-degree rise in sea temperatures. “The world is slowly disintegrating,” concluded Inuit hunter Noah Metuq, who lives 30 miles from the Arctic Circle. “They call it climate change…but we just call it breaking up.” From the founding of the first cities some 6,000 years ago until the beginning of the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere remained relatively constant at about 280 parts per million (ppm). At present they are accelerating toward 400 ppm, and by 2050 they will reach 500 ppm, about double pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, atmospheric CO2 lasts about a century, so there is no way immediately to reduce levels, only to slow their increase, we are thus in for significant global warming; the only debate is how much and how serious the effects will be. As the newspaper stories quoted above show, we are already experiencing the effects of 1-2 degree warming in more violent storms, spread of disease, mass die offs of plants and animals, species extinction, and threatened inundation of low-lying countries like the Pacific nation of Kiribati and the Netherlands at a warming of 5 degrees or less the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could disintegrate, leading to a sea level of rise of 20 feet that would cover North Carolina’s outer banks, swamp the southern third of Florida, and inundate Manhattan up to the middle of Greenwich Village. Another catastrophic effect would be the collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation that keeps the winter weather in Europe far warmer than its latitude would otherwise allow. Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. But the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures. Past ice age transitions, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, took place in just decades, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “humankind’s continuing enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and humanity’s life support system. At worst, says physics professor Marty Hoffert of New York University, “we’re just going to burn everything up; we’re going to heat the atmosphere to the temperature it was in the Cretaceous when there were crocodiles at the poles, and then everything will collapse.” During the Cold War, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized a theory of nuclear winter to describe how a thermonuclear war between the Untied States and the Soviet Union would not only destroy both countries but possibly end life on this planet. Global warming is the post-Cold War era’s equivalent of nuclear winter at least as serious and considerably better supported scientifically. Over the long run it puts dangers from terrorism and traditional military challenges to shame. It is a threat not only to the security and prosperity to the United States, but potentially to the continued existence of life on this planet.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Arms races are inevitable now – U.S. deterrence is ineffective</span></span><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">At Mazagon Dock near the southern tip of Mumbai, hidden behind high concrete walls, hundreds of Indian workers are putting the finishing touches on the hulls of two 217-foot Scorpène-class attack submarines, the first of six slated to be built over the next few years. Nearby, workers are adding to India's fleet of stealth frigates and guided-missile destroyers. One big reason India is beefing up its arsenal: China. &quot;It goes without saying that India must be seriously concerned with the rise of China's strategic power, including its military and economic power,&quot; says Ashwani Kumar, member of parliament from India's ruling Congress party. &quot;India has consistently opposed an arms race—but India will not be found wanting in taking all measures necessary for the effective safeguarding of its territorial integrity and national interests.&quot; From the Arabian Sea to the Pacific Ocean, countries fearful of China's growing economic and military might—and worried that the U.S. will be less likely to intervene in the region—are hurtling into a new arms race. In December, Japan overhauled its defense guidelines, laying plans to purchase five submarines, three destroyers, 12 fighters jets, 10 patrol planes and 39 helicopters. South Korea and Vietnam are adding subs. Arms imports are on the rise in Malaysia. The tiny city-state of Singapore, which plans to add two subs, is now among the world's top 10 arms importers. Australia plans to spend as much as $279 billion over the next 20 years on new subs, destroyers and fighter planes. Together, these efforts amount to a simultaneous buildup of advanced weaponry in the Asia-Pacific region on a scale and at a speed not seen since the Cold War arms race between America and the Soviet Union. The buildup is unfolding as the world's military balance appears to be shifting in tandem with its economic balance. China is beginning to build a military to match its powerful economy. This is happening as the U.S. and its staunchest allies, including Britain, are looking at flat or falling military spending—and as Russia is struggling to revive its armed forces in the post-Soviet era. China is still far from challenging the U.S. for global military supremacy. But its recent actions have countries in the region planning for a much different future. In Australia, a report published Monday by an influential defense think tank concludes that the China threat has sparked an &quot;urgent need to refocus&quot; military development &quot;to offset and deter the rapidly expanding People's Liberation Army.&quot; The report by the Kokoda Foundation, prepared with input from senior defense officials, says Australia &quot;cannot overlook the way that the scale, pattern and speed of the PLA's development is altering security in the Western Pacific.&quot; &quot;This is potentially the most demanding security situation faced since the Second World War,&quot; says Ross Babbage, author of the report. &quot;This is not Mickey Mouse. This is dead serious stuff.&quot; In Washington, a new &quot;National Military Strategy&quot; released Tuesday says that the U.S. &quot;strategic priorities and interests&quot; will increasingly be in the Asia-Pacific region. The Pentagon strategy paper says the U.S. intends to &quot;invest new attention and resources&quot; in South and Southeast Asia, and will look for new ways to increase cooperation among American allies as they build up their own military power. &quot;We remain concerned about the extent and strategic intent of China's military modernization, and its assertiveness in space, cyberspace, in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea,&quot; the Pentagon paper says. Both the U.S. and Australia have expressed particular concern about the vulnerability of military computer systems to cyberattack by China. The Australian report warned that in a crisis, such systems might not be secure. China has said that its military modernization is not directed at any other country, and that its military spending is much lower than that of the U.S. &quot;We do not engage in an arms race. We are not a military threat to any country,&quot; said President Hu Jintao during a visit to the U.S. last month. &quot;China will never seek to dominate or pursue an expansionist policy.&quot; The region's newly bristling arsenals have stoked concerns that more powerful militaries could lead nations to pick fights over long-held territorial grudges, threatening to destabilize an area whose waters carry much of the world's cargo containers and oil. &quot;Little incidents could easily escalate into bigger incidents, and then little nasty wars,&quot; says Siemon Wezeman, a senior fellow at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks defense spending. China, to be sure, isn't the only catalyst for the arms buildup. Many Asian militaries delayed modernizing their armed forces because of the regional financial crisis in the late 1990s. Some countries are worried about threats from Islamist or separatist insurgencies. Others fear hostilities with longtime foes, such as India with Pakistan, and South Korea with North Korea. But China's buildup looms large. China's total defense spending was $78 billion in 2010, up from $17 billion in 2001, according to government reports. Western defense officials say those totals don't include arms imports. The U.S. Defense Department has estimated that China's total military-related spending in 2009 was $150 billion. China doesn't disclose details about arms purchases. Figures made public by the Russian government indicate that China spent more than $17 billion on Russian arms imports between 2001 and 2010. Adding that figure to Chinese spending on domestic-arms procurement, Western defense experts estimate that China has spent about $150 billion on new weapons over the past decade. China's first aircraft carrier, a diesel-powered vessel, is expected to be deployed this year or next. A prototype of a new J-20 stealth jet fighter—it appears designed to rival the U.S. F-22—made its first test flight on Jan. 11, just hours before U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates met in Beijing with President Hu to mend frayed relations. The U.S., for its part, announced Jan. 6 that it would cut defense spending by $78 billion over the next five years. For the fiscal year ended in September, Congress appropriated $531 billion for the armed forces, not including costs related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Pentagon officials contend they will continue to invest in new technologies intended to counter such Chinese advances as antiship ballistic missiles. Since World War II, America's allies in the Asia-Pacific region have counted on the U.S. to provide a security umbrella. &quot;Until recently, countries in the region would expect U.S. carriers to arrive in the event of a regional conflict,&quot; says Mr. Wezeman of the Stockholm peace institute. &quot;Clearly some countries will soon start to think: 'Is the carrier really coming?'&quot; Pentagon officials say the U.S. remains fully committed to security in the region. &quot;We will continue to maintain the military strength necessary to protect our interests, defend our allies and deter potential adversaries from acts of aggression and intimidation,&quot; says Michael Schiffer, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia. The U.S., he adds, doesn't view China as an adversary. A region-wide submarine-buying binge shows the extent to which smaller nations are moving to bolster their defenses. Compared with aircraft carriers and other large vessels, submarines are relatively cheap. Just the suspicion that submarines are patrolling can keep hostile navies at bay. They're also considered the best weapon to counter another sub. China has about 62 subs now and is expected to add 15 in coming years, according to the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence. India, South Korea and Vietnam are expected to get six more subs apiece by 2020. Australia plans to add 12 over the next 20 years. Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia are each adding two. Together, the moves constitute one of the largest buildups of submarines since the early years of the Cold War. Asian nations are expected to buy as many as 111 subs over the next 20 years, according to AMI International, which provides market research to governments and shipbuilders. India had long focused its military planning on Pakistan, its foe to the northwest, and Pakistan-based militants remain a major concern. India also has feuded with China for years over the border they share in the Himalayas, where China continues to claim land that is now governed by India. But India now is growing more worried about China's potential influence over key shipping lanes. Beijing has been financing and building ports in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh—analysts have dubbed it China's &quot;string of pearls&quot; strategy for the Indian Ocean. China's goal, in part, is to secure sea lanes for its energy and mineral supplies from the Middle East and Africa, which must pass through the Indian Ocean and the Straits of Malacca, a shipping bottleneck in Southeast Asia. Like the rising powers of previous centuries—Great Britain, Spain, Portugal—the Chinese are using military power to ensure access to key natural resources. India sees that as a threat. &quot;India's lifeline of oil comes from far-off places,&quot; says Sureesh Mehta, former chief of the Indian navy and currently India's high commissioner to New Zealand. &quot;There are times when it may need protection.&quot; India is the fourth-largest consumer of oil in the world, and it relies on crude shipments from Middle Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia and Iran. It also imports large amounts of coal from Indonesia and Australia. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a remote Indian archipelago in the Bay of Bengal about 745 miles off India's southeastern coast, has been buzzing with military activity as India bolsters its maritime defenses. The cluster of 572 islands lies just 175 miles south of mainland Myanmar, a close ally of China. The navy controls half the port area of the territory's capital, Port Blair. The air force takes over the airport every afternoon, and it is lengthening several airstrips on the islands to handle night landings by fighter jets—a critical capability given that India only has one aging aircraft carrier in operation. India's defense budget, which is roughly $32 billion for the year ending March 31, has increased 151% in the last decade. The government expects military spending to grow at about 8.33% annually in coming years. The new Scorpène submarines, which can stay submerged for about a week, are being built with technology from France's state-owned DCNS for an estimated total cost of $4.6 billion. India's shopping list extends far beyond subs. It purchased eight maritime-reconnaissance and antisubmarine aircraft from Boeing Co. for $2.1 billion in 2009, and the government recently approved an order for another four, says an Indian navy spokesman. The goal is to upgrade India's snooping capabilities and replace outdated Russian planes. &quot;This really gives them strategic reach in the Indian Ocean,&quot; says Vivek Lall, vice president in charge of Boeing's defense, space and security operations in India. Boeing and several other aerospace firms are also in the running for an estimated $10.5 billion contract for 126 fighter jets, India's largest-ever defense order. &quot;It's an unsaid thing, but clearly China is a big issue,&quot; says Mr. Lall. Not many countries have benefited more from China's economic rise than Australia. China is its largest commercial partner. It buys enormous amounts of Australian coal and iron ore, which has fueled a natural-resources boom. But that hasn't blunted concern that China's military buildup is a threat to Australian security. The report published Monday says China is close to attaining enough military muscle to deny the U.S. and allied forces access to much of the Western Pacific rim. &quot;The assumption that U.S. and allied naval surface vessels can operate with high security in all parts of the Western Pacific is no longer valid,&quot; the report said. U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups, it said, are becoming &quot;increasingly vulnerable&quot; to Chinese surveillance and weaponry up to 1,200 nautical miles from China's coast. Mr. Babbage, author of the report, contends that Australia can no longer afford to maintain a military focused mainly on participating in peacekeeping operations, as it is doing in East Timor, and on training foreign military forces, as it is in Afghanistan. Australia's planned $279 billion of military spending over the next 20 years will fund the biggest expansion of its military since World War II. The report touches on a development that is especially worrisome to nations that host permanent U.S. military bases, such as Japan and South Korea. It says China is fielding ballistic and cruise missiles capable of destroying U.S. bases in Guam, Japan and elsewhere &quot;within a few hours.&quot; In December, Japan overhauled its defense guidelines, drawn up in the Cold War and directed principally at the Soviet Union, to focus more on China. The new guidelines call for spending as much as $284 billion between 2011 and 2015 to modernize Japan's Self-Defense Forces. Japan proposed deploying more U.S. Patriot missiles, prompting China to protest that such a move would trigger a regional arms race. South Korea is worried about China's continued support for North Korea, and that growing Chinese military power will limit U.S. capacity to intervene if war breaks out on the Korean peninsula. In 2006, South Korea launched a 15-year military-modernization program projected to cost about $550 billion, with about one-third slated for arms purchases. The program has since been reviewed after two attacks on the South by the North last year. Military analysts expect South Korea to spend more on conventional weapons designed to defend it against the North, including subs, destroyers, F-15 fighter jets and possibly F-35s. Vietnam and China, once steadfast allies against the U.S, are now feuding over Chinese territorial claims in the oil-and-gas-rich South China Sea. Vietnam doesn't have an economy or budget big enough to go toe-to-toe with China procuring weapons. In lieu of a big arms buildup, it is opening up a prized military asset, its deep-water port in Cam Ranh Bay, in the hopes that foreign navies will steam into the South China Sea and help secure the region's shipping lanes. &quot;Offering Cam Ranh Bay to foreign navies is a master stroke,&quot; says Carlyle Thayer, a professor at the Australian Defence Force Academy at the University of New South Wales. &quot;It will attract precisely those navies that can be expected to keep China's naval ambitions in check.&quot; </span></span><br />

The US-ROK joint military exercises not merely prepare for a possible invasion of North Korea but they also serve as weapons of attrition. They force North Korea to devote much more of its resources to the military than it would if there were no palpable threat. An important component of the exercise is their element of ambiguity. The Korean People’s Army (KPA) can never be sure when a feint might become the real thing, so every exercise has to be taken very seriously. The translation of this commentary from the Rodong Sinmun on the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises in 2009 may be fractured but the underling fear of attack is clear: The said largest-scale saber rattling kicked off by the U.S. imperialists against the DPRK at a time when their scenario for the second Korean war is at the final stage of completion is a very adventurous and dangerous military provocation that can be seen only on the eve of a war, and this is an undisguised military threat and a sort of <strong>declaration of war against the DPRK</strong>. No one can vouch that the U.S. imperialist bellicose elements will not ignite a war against the DPRK by surprise while reinforcing armed forces and staging war maneuvers in south Korea and its vicinity as they did in Iraq.[18] It is important to note that the clash at Yeonpyeong Island coincided with a substantial military exercise, the Hoguk (‘Safeguarding the Nation’): North Korea fired the artillery during South Korea’s military drill called the Hoguk Exercise on Nov. 22-30 that involves 70,000 South Korean military troops, 50 warships, 90 helicopters and 500 planes. The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) of U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Seventh Air Force will also participate in the exercise.[19] The scheduled participation of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is particularly significant.[20] The 31st MEU is based in Okinawa and it is America’s ‘forward deployed rapid-response’ unit in East Asia. It trains with the ROK marines practicing beach landings, but its major specialism appears to be urban warfare. [21] One of its possible functions is to mount a commando type raid on the DPRK. A Japanese scholar writing in the authoritative PACNET newsletter of Pacific Forum CSIS (the Honolulu branch of the Washington think tank Center for Strategic and International studies rather gave the game away about the ‘North Korean threat’ by putting it thus: As a collapse of North Korea -- rather than a North Korean invasion of South Korea -- has become a more likely scenario, the 31st MEU can search and seize the North Korean nuclear arsenal, and prevent proliferation of those weapons[22] It is not surprising therefore that the KPA was concerned about the Hoguk exercise and responded to the ROK live firing in line with the ‘zero tolerance’ strategy. However, concerns extend beyond specific military exercises, to <strong>the whole policy of building up of tension in preparation for a crisis that would lead to an invasion of the North</strong>. The KPA barrage can be seen as a message that an attack would be met by a devastating counteroffensive which would, at the very least, imperil Seoul; it was a reminder that ‘Seoul [is] not safe from artillery attacks’.[23] The DPRK’s ‘zero tolerance’ strategy The DPRK’s ‘zero tolerance’ policy long predates the Lee Myung-bak administration, let alone the present crisis. Basically this strategy is to reiterate than no infringement of DPRK territory will be tolerated, and any intrusion will be met by force. There has been flexibility and restraint in implementing this strategy, especially in respect of the NLL (see below), but the underlying strategic calculation is that any sign of weakness will lead to further US and ROK moves against the DPRK. The case of the US invasion of Iraq is often cited by the North Koreans of the dangers of an appeasement policy. This is often raised in respect of the nuclear deterrent. For instance, Alexander Frolov, writing recently in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs journal International Affairs on lessons from the Iraq war made the point: The leadership in N. Korea also realized that <strong>nothing less than a nuclear status can guarantee the country against US aggression</strong>. [24] However, the relevance of Iraq to the non-appeasement policy goes beyond developing a nuclear deterrent. For instance, in May 2003 after a breakdown in US-DPRK negotiations, the official Korea Central News Agency (KCNA) in a lengthy statement included a reference to Iraq: On March 20 this year the U.S. provoked a war of aggression against Iraq under the pretext of &quot;finding out weapons of mass destruction&quot; in a bid to topple the Saddam government. The Iraqi war taught the lesson that &quot;nuclear suspicion,&quot; &quot;suspected development of weapons of mass destruction&quot; and suspected &quot;sponsorship of terrorism&quot; touted by the U.S. were all aimed to find a pretext for war and one would fall victim to a war when one meekly responds to the IAEA's inspection for disarmament. Neither strong international public opinion nor big countries' opposition to war nor the UN Charter could prevent the U.S. from launching the Iraqi war. It is a serious lesson the world has drawn from the Iraqi war that a war can be averted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation can be protected only when a country has a physical deterrent force, a strong military deterrent force capable of decisively repelling any attack to be made by any types of sophisticated weapons. The reality indicates that building up a physical deterrent force is urgently required for preventing the outbreak of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring peace and security of the world, now that the U.S. does not show any political intention and will to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK. The DPRK will increase its self-defensive capacity strong enough to destroy aggressors at a single stroke. Any U.S. aerial attack will be decisively countered with aerial attack and its land strategy will be coped with land strategy. [25] In reality, a North Korean counter offensive would not match like with like - ‘aerial attack will be decisively countered with aerial attack and its land strategy will be coped with land strategy.’ The DPRK cannot hope to match US military power (especially in the air) so its offensive would be asymmetrical, drawing on its strengths.[26] It would probably utilise its special forces, submarines, and in particular its artillery[27] As noted, the frequent war exercises, the integration of the ROK military into the US command structure, and the associated operational plans, are <strong>seen by the DPRK as very threatening</strong>: [The United States] made public &quot;strategic guideline No. 1&quot; in November 1978 and thus officially announced the formation of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; in south Korea. It saw to it that the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; took over the &quot;UN Forces Command's&quot; Operation Control of the U.S. forces in south Korea and puppet army. The organization of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; deepened the <strong>military dependence of south Korea on the U</strong>nited <strong>S</strong>tates and <strong>increased the danger for an outbreak of a new war on the Korean Peninsula</strong>. The Team Spirit joint military exercises for invading the north had been escalated as a large-scale war exercises involving huge armed forces over100,000-200,000 strong from 1978. Such joint military exercises as the Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI), Ulji Focus Lens and Foal Eagle have been staged almost every day as planned and directed by the command. The aggressive and bellicose nature of the command has remained unchanged even after the June 15 era [the 2000 North-South summit], a new era of reconciliation and cooperation, was ushered in on the Korean Peninsula. Many war scenarios against the north including &quot;OPLAN 5030&quot;, &quot;New OPLAN 5026&quot; and &quot;OPLAN 8022-02&quot; have been worked out and war exercises to carry them into practice conducted in a more frenzied way. This year the command changed the codenames of the RSOI and Ulji Focus Lens with Key Resolve and Ulji Freedom Guardian and is holding actual maneuvers to hurl U.S. imperialist aggression forces in the mainland and abroad into Korean front. It goes without saying that such war exercises and arms buildup had have negative effect on the north-south relations and chilled the ardent desire for the Korean people for reunification. The south Korean people thus press for the dissolution of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; disturbing peace in Korea and obstructing her reunification. The south Korea-U.S. &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot;, a tool for war of aggression and a source of permanent atmosphere of war and tension on the Korean Peninsula, should be disbanded without delay. [28] The most famous example of the efficacy of the strategy is the reported argument between President Kim Young-sam and President Bill Clinton in 1994. According to Kim, Clinton wanted to bomb the North Korea nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. A 2003 BBC report recounted the tale: &quot;Clinton told me that he would launch an immediate bombardment on the Yongbyon area. Clinton was very determined about it, but I argued to him that such an attack should never take place,&quot; said Mr Kim. &quot;So there was quite an argument between him and me. Sometimes the phone conversations lasted more than 40 minutes,&quot; he said. Mr Clinton first revealed the 1994 plan to attack North Korea last month, but said nothing of the alleged dispute with the South. Mr Kim said that a US attack would have led to a tremendous loss of life, and would have turned Seoul into a &quot;sea of fire&quot;. &quot;Finally I told him that if the United States attacks North Korea, I cannot send one single member of South Korea's 650,000 armed forces into battle.&quot; [29] Kim’s version of events was contradicted by Tong Kim (Kim Dong-hyun) a Korean-American who worked as an interpreter for the State Department for over 30 years. According to him, It simply is not the case [...]. There was no discussion about a possible U.S. attack on North Korea between the two presidents via phone. Such discussions indeed took place between their defense ministers Kwon Young-hae and William Perry with the South Korean minister obviously opposed to the military action.[30] The consequences of a Northern counterattack, and specifically an artillery offense against Seoul, was not the only consideration, although it was the main one. A South Korean simulation exercise predicted that ‘bombing of North Korea’s nuclear facilities could in the worst case make the whole of Korea uninhabitable for a decade’.[31] The bombing of Yongbyon was but one variant of the ‘military option’ that the United States has been examining, albeit the favoured one.[32] The release of radioactivity aside, an US attack would mean war with immense devastation of the Korea peninsula, so it is to be expected that there has been, in the past, opposition across the political spectrum, from progressive President Roh Moo-hyun to conservative legislator Park Jin.[33] The exception to that have been those, such as Lee Myung-bak, who pin their hopes on a collapse that would prevent the North from making a counterattack. This is an ongoing issue but as long as the DPRK functions as a viable state, committed and able, to retaliate, then there will be no attack. Part of the reason for the vigorous response at Yeonpyeong was presumably to demonstrate that the KPA was still in business. The DPRK has been threatened, and blockaded, by the United States for decades, but unlike various other countries, it has not been invaded, or bombed. To that degree the zero-tolerance strategy can be said to work. But it has its disadvantages. It is a high-risk strategy. If there is a miscalculation or a misunderstanding, or ‘maverick’ action by soldiers on the front line, then the situation could rapidly whirl out of control. War would be disastrous for North Korea, despite the brave words. It would have grave consequences for the South, and Japan. If it spread to China the results are incalculable, but <strong>it might mean the end of the U</strong>nited <strong>S</strong>tates, <strong>that ‘fragile empire’ as Niall Ferguson recently termed it</strong>.[34] It is a variant of the mutually assured destruction of the Cold War period, a bluff that is effective because it is credible, but a bluff that if put into action would be catastrophic. In this case, the destruction would not be equivalent. The DPRK would suffer more than other countries, but the ROK and the US would suffer unacceptable damage and that could be considered sufficient to keep the peace. The strategy has other disadvantages. It allows the DPRK to be portrayed as belligerent, and certainly the coverage of the Yeonpyeong incident, within South Korea, and internationally has been virtually uniformly hostile. Not everyone has jumped on to the bandwagon and there are those, in particular Korean-Americans, who oppose the drift towards war and call for engagement.[35] But these are only a tiny minority. The strategy also runs counter to the main thrust of DPRK strategy which is to negotiate the United States into accepting peaceful coexistence. Recourse to confrontation, and military action, makes that more difficult to prosecute. Finally, it gives a hostage to fortune. The other side (here South Korea but in other circumstances it could be the US) can construct a provocation knowing that it will trigger a response that can be labelled as belligerent. The trick here is to do something which the DPRK regards as provocative but which can be disguised as normal and legitimate. The military exercises in general fall within this category. For the DPRK (and China) they are intimidating and provocative, but that is not how they are described in the Western media. No doubt if the tables were turned and it was a North Korean carrier stalking up the American coast, perceptions would be different. In the particular case of Yeonpyeong the ROK did something that was portrayed as legitimate and non-threatening but which the DPRK found intolerable. To understand why that was so we must turn to the curious case of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) Northern Limit Line The Northern Limit Line is a very strange beast, as a glance at the map shows (fig 1). Fig 1: Contested seas: The NLL and the MDL 1.Yeonpyeong Island (artillery clash) 2.Baengnyeong Island (Cheonan sinking) 3.Daecheong Island 4. Incheon Airport 5.Seoul 6.Incheon 7.Haeju 8.Kaesong 9.Ganghwa County 10.Bukdo Myeon 11.Deokjeok Myeon 12.Jawol Myeon 13.Yeongheung Myeon On this map #1 indicates Yeonpyeong Island where the artillery clash took place, and #2 Baengnyeong Island, off which the Cheonan sank. The upper(blue) line represents the Northern Limit Line (NLL) and the lower (red) one the West Sea Military Demarcation Line (MDL) claimed by the DPRK. The NLL was unilaterally established by the Americans (officially the United Nations Command) in August 1953.[36] The NLL, instead of striking out directly from the coast at the end of the land Military Demarcation Line (MDL), snakes up the west coast of North Korea, through rice crab fish grounds, and taking in various islands the main three of which are .Yeonpyeong (1) , Baengnyeong (2), and Daecheong (3). It has been argued that it was set up to prevent Southern incursions into Northern waters (Syngman Rhee had not signed the Armistice Agreement and wanted the war to continue), although it would be more plausible to see it also as affording bases for inserting intelligence and commando teams. Be that as it may, by the 1990s commando raids were a thing of the past, and yet the ROK refused to negotiate. This despite two major incidents in 1999 and 2002 which were a distinct threat to the ‘Sunshine Policy of then president Kim Dae-jung.[37] There was a further clash in November 2009 under the presidency of Lee Myung-bak.[38] This 2009 incident may have owed something to the more assertive North Korea policy of the Lee administration.[39] The NLL did not receive much international attention until the Cheonan incident of March 2010. There were a number of reasons for this. Most of the causalities in the past were Northern and so, in the eyes of most of the international media, perhaps warranted less attention. The Cheonan was the largest single disaster for the ROK navy. Many commentators were quick to point out what a dangerous situation the sinking of the Cheonan illustrated. Typical was Nicole Finnegan of the Washington-based Korea Economic Institute: Regardless of what we learn the true cause of the tragedy to be, the sinking of the Cheonan has revived fear and debates on how easily North and South Korea could lurch into war unexpectedly.[40] There is nothing new in these concerns. The NLL by its unilateral nature, its configuration close to the North Korean coast, and running through highly prized crab grounds, is a recipe for conflict. Fishing boats from both South and North sometimes ignore the NLL during the crab season and their respective navies tend to follow them. The NLL is also at variance with the now standard territorial sea limit of 12 nautical miles.[41] Writing in 2002, after the clash of June that year, John Barry Kotch and Michael Abbey, point out that: If the two Koreas are genuinely committed to reconciliation, these differences can be resolved through negotiation, thereby preventing future incidents. A line that was drawn more than a half-century ago for an entirely different purpose should no longer be allowed to fester as a source of conflict, thereby retarding the peace process.[42] The differences were not resolved, so the question is why? If this failure to negotiate a resolution had just occurred during the Lee Myung-bak administration it might not have been surprising. But this was during the time of Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun. It is clear that a resolution would have meant the South abandoning the NLL and agreeing to something approximating the North’s line. It seems extremely unlikely that anyone in the DPRK would have opposed that. Although the NLL was established by the UNC, it appears that it is not longer involved, officially at least. It may well be that unofficially it is very much involved; the relationship between the US and ROK military seems to be unexplored territory. Whatever the role of Americans behind the scenes it seems clear that resolution of the NLL was opposed, successfully, by the ROK military. This opposition presumably was partly due to natural inertia – nobody likes giving up territory – but it must have gone deeper than that. The logical conclusion is that there were strong forces in the ROK political elite, revolving around the military, who wanted to keep the NLL precisely because it would “to fester as a source of conflict, thereby retarding the peace process” Fig 2: measuring policy change: KCNA mentions of the NLL over two administrations All of the previous conflicts around the NLL had been at sea, and the artillery duel at Yeonpyeong was the first one on land. To understand how that came about we must return to the map. It appears that the DPRK acknowledges ROK control over the islands, but claims these are its territorial waters, except for the access channels shown on the map.[43] Whilst the NLL has long been a bone of contention, the situation has greatly worsened since the Lee Myung-bak administration came into office. One rough way of measuring that is to calculate the number of times the official KCNA news agency mentions the North Limit Line. Roh Moo-hyun was in office from 25 February 2003 to 25 February 2008 when Lee Myung-bak took over. Fig 2 shows the monthly average of NLL stories over those two administrations. This is admittedly an imperfect metric but the difference between the two administrations is compelling: under Lee Myung-bak the number of North Korean complaints rose nearly three-fold. In March 2008, for instance, the KPA navy warned: Combined firepower drills for &quot;striking and destroying&quot; warships of the Navy of the Korean People's Army and drills for tactical naval maneuvers are staged on Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong Islets and in waters around them almost everyday. A situation in which an armed conflict may break out any moment is prevailing in the frontline waters in the West Sea due to the reckless military provocations of the south Korean military warmongers. Any attempt on the part of the south Korean military authorities to &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;northern limit line&quot; at any cost would only spark off a clash in the said waters.[44] The following year, as the Lee administration moved to join the US-led Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) the KPA navy issued another warning: 3. For the present, we will not guarantee the legal status of the five islands under the south side's control (Paekryong, Taechong, Sochong, Yonphyong [ and U islands) in our side's territorial waters northwest of the extension of the Military Demarcation Line in the West Sea of Korea and safe sailing of warships of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the south Korean puppet navy and civilian ships operating in the waters around there.[45] The PSI is in many ways similar to the NLL. It is unilateral and illegal. The PSI claims that a set of nations – the US and its clients – are above international law and may stop and search ships on the high seas. Ostensibly this is to stop the shipping of weapons of mass destruction which given the United States pre-eminence in the international arms trade smacks of a certain degree of chutzpah.[46] Indeed, as Hazel Smith has documented, ‘There is little hard evidence that the government of North Korea is involved in the illicit shipping of WMD or components of WMD’.[47] The PSI seems to be really about harassing the DPRK and stoking tension, and that also holds for the NLL. The NLL seems to have been much more successful in attaining these objectives so far than the PSI. The NLL was perhaps only peripheral to the Cheonan incident. True the ship sank in disputed waters, and had the NLL not existed, but the two Koreas had been separated by a mutually agreed maritime border, the sinking would probably not have occurred. It appears that it ran aground in shallow waters and in an attempt to extricate itself was sunk by one of the South’s mines.[48] Nevertheless, the actual sinking of the Cheonan appears to have been an accident; it was the subsequent investigation that was deliberately fraudulent. The Yeonpyeong incident is different in that it occurred because of a deliberate provocation by the South. The artillery duel at Yeonpyeong As to be expected there is much that is uncertain and contested about this incident. But the essentials can be traced. The media tends to give the impression that the North Korean barrage against the marine base on Yeonpyeong island on 23 November came out of the blue, with nothing preceding it. The Chosun Ilbo specifically makes that claim: … the latest artillery bombardment on Yeonpyeong Island came completely out of the blue, and there is no way of telling when, where and how North Korea will strike next.[49] A rather more nuanced version is the Washington Post narrative, with the North launching a barrage and the South responding: North Korea launched a massive artillery barrage on a South Korean island Tuesday, killing two South Korean marines, wounding at least 19 other people and setting more than 60 buildings ablaze in the most serious confrontation since the North's sinking of a South Korean warship in March. South Korea immediately responded with its own artillery fire and put its fighter jets on high alert, bringing the two sides - which technically have remained in a state of war since the Korean armistice in 1953 - close to the brink of a major conflagration[50] No mention here of the South’s arms buildup on the island, the North’s warnings, the provocative nature of the Northern Limit Line, or the threatening military exercises. Back in 2008 the KPA complained about the ROK introducing new weaponry into the NLL islands: They also issued an order to batteries of 155 mm caliber howitzers and various type guided weapons deployed on the above-said five islets to be ready to go into action.[51] The KPA statement also claimed that: Combined firepower drills for &quot;striking and destroying&quot; warships of the Navy of the Korean People's Army and drills for tactical naval maneuvers are staged on Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong Islets and in waters around them [take place] almost everyday. A situation in which an armed conflict may break out any moment is prevailing in the frontline waters in the West Sea due to the reckless military provocations of the south Korean military warmongers. Any attempt on the part of the south Korean military authorities to &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;northern limit line&quot; at any cost would only spark off a clash in the said waters. [52] The live fire drills that the ROK conducted on 23 November were not just artillery practice; they were specifically focussed on possible combat against KPA ships in waters around the island. However, it was the specific contested status of those waters, in a tense situation exacerbated by the military exercises since the Cheonan incident, which sparked the North Korean response. It appears that the North warned the South against the drills, but the warnings were disregarded. The Seoul newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported on 24 November that: North Korea in a telegram on Tuesday morning [23 November] criticized an annual South Korean defense drill now underway. The same afternoon the North Korean military fired on Yeonpyeong Island. An official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, &quot;At around 8:20 am. on Tuesday, North Korea sent a telegram that said they would not sit idly by and watch if South Korea fire at North Korean waters during the military training.&quot; North Korea already criticized the drill on Nov. 17 on the website of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland and again on Monday when the drill began. But the military dismissed North Korea's claims, saying an artillery firing drill by the Marine Corps that took place in Yeonpyeong Island on Tuesday had nothing to do with the annual drill but was a part of monthly training there. Moreover, the drill the North cited as an excuse for the attack is an annual routine drill which has been conducted by the South Korean military since 1996. A spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, &quot;The training was directed at South Korean waters to the southwest of Yeonpyeong Island, and the training site had been announced already through the international network of communication of merchant ships.[53] To say that the marine artillery drills had nothing to do with the Hoguk exercise seems to be a sophism. Moreover, the warnings stretched further back. The information available on the English-language KCNA website is only a portion of the published Korean-language material, and on top of that there are the direct communications between North and South (such as the telegram mentioned above). However, there is enough English-language for us to get a certain picture of preceding events, even though often the English translation is of poor quality.’ Fig3: Smoke from rocket fire over Yeonpyeong island This picture taken on November 23, 2010 by a South Korean tourist shows huge plumes of smoke rising from Yeonpyeong island in the disputed waters of the Yellow Sea on November 23, 2010. North Korea fired dozens of artillery shells onto a South Korean island on November 23, 2010, killing four people, setting homes ablaze and triggering an exchange of fire as the South's military went on top alert. (STR/AFP/Getty Images) On the 4th of June 2010 a Rodong Sinmun editorial headed ‘S. Korean Accused of Dangerous Provocations’ warned that: The puppet military is massively amassing offensive forces in the waters off five islets of the West Sea including Paekryong and Yonphyong [Yeonpyeong] islets while vociferating about &quot;defence of the northern limit line&quot; and ceaselessly infiltrating its warships into the territorial waters of the DPRK for the purpose of sparking off a new armed conflict. It is needless to say that the large-scale &quot;demonstration of military muscle&quot; and war maneuvers taking place under this situation are as dangerous acts as <strong>playing with fire by the side of a powder magazine. These moves are, in fact, a prelude to an all-out war.</strong> The DPRK loves peace and does not want a war. But it is the DPRK's spirit and mettle to react to fire with fire and punish the provocateurs with a merciless retaliation of justice. If the puppet group finally opts for starting a war of aggression against the DPRK in league with foreign forces, defying its warnings, the group will not be able to escape a thousand-fold indiscriminate retaliatory blow, warns the article. [54] This is a generalised warning about <strong>retaliation ‘for starting a war of aggression’</strong> rather than specifically threatening a response to military exercises at Yeonpyeong. ‘Indiscriminate’ in this context presumably means ‘all-out war’. This warning was followed by another on 3 August which specifically threatened retaliation for ‘naval firing maneuvers’ from Yeonpyeong and other islands in the area: The Command of Forces of the Korean People's Army in the western sector of the front issued on Tuesday the following notice in this connection: The naval firing maneuvers to be staged by the above-said warmongers in the waters near Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong islets in August with all ground, naval and submarine attack means involved are not simple drills but undisguised military intrusion into the inviolable territorial waters of the DPRK and reckless politically motivated provocation to preserve the illegal &quot;northern limit line&quot; to the last. …. In view of the prevailing situation, the Command of Forces of the Korean People's Army in the western sector of the front made a decisive resolution to counter the reckless naval firing projected by the group of traitors with strong physical retaliation. …. As regards the expected DPRK's counteraction for self-defence, the command warns in advance all the civilian ships including fishing boats not to enter the theatre of naval firing fixed by the group of traitors in the waters close to the five islets in the West Sea of Korea. It is the unshakable will and steadfast resolution of the army and people of the DPRK to return fire for fire. [55] Whether the ROK marines carried out any firing exercises after that warning is unknown. The Chosun Ilbo report quoted above says the drills were held ‘monthly’ but the [London] Telegraph talks about ‘monthly air raid drills’, so the exercises on 23 November may have been the first since the August threat. The island, lined with tank traps and trenches, and equipped with 19 fully-stocked bomb shelters in which residents conduct monthly air raid drills, is permanently ready for war.[56] The South Koreans admitted carrying live firing exercises on 23 November but justified these by saying they were fired into the sea, away from the direction of the North Korean mainland. There seems no doubt they were firing into the sea (on the technical level it was presumably an anti-ship exercise), though the actual direction of fire is unclear. One report says southward.[57] Another says to the west. [58] Yet another has it to the southwest.[59] In fact, as far as the North was concerned, the direction was irrelevant because in any case the shells landed in their territorial waters. And therein lies the rub. The DPRK argues that if it tolerated the exercise it would be relinquishing its claim to the waters. The enemy fired shells from the islet which is so close to the territory of the DPRK that it is within each other's eyeshot despite the fact that there are so many mountains and rivers, sea waters and islets in south Korea. This powder-reeking saber-rattling cannot be construed otherwise than a politically motivated provocation. The enemy is claiming that they fired shells southward from the islet in a bid not to get on the nerves of the DPRK but Yonphyong Islet is located deep inside the territorial waters of the DPRK away from the maritime military demarcation line. If live shells are fired from the islet, they are bound to drop inside the territorial waters of the DPRK side no matter in which direction they are fired because of such geographical features. The ulterior aim sought by the enemy is to create the impression that the DPRK side recognized the waters off the islet as their &quot;territorial waters&quot;, in case that there was no physical counter-action on the part of the former. Herein lies the crafty and vicious nature of the enemy's provocation. The army of the DPRK took such a self-defensive measure as making a prompt powerful strike at the artillery positions from which the enemy fired the shells as it does not make an empty talk. [emphasis added].[60] As can be seen from the map (fig 1), the DPRK seems to accept ROK control of the island (but not necessarily sovereignty) but it does not recognise any claim over the surrounding sea. It would appear that the DPRK claim to these waters has much to justify it; the Northern Limit Line is manifestly iniquitous; it is unilateral and provocative and should have been abolished years ago. But does that justify the DPRK artillery barrage? An important point here is the number of warnings that were given. We have already quoted the public statements, and mentioned a telegram, but the North also claims it made a telephone call to the South: The south Korean puppet warmongers' firing of shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side in the West Sea of Korea on Nov. 23 was a premeditated and deliberate military provocation from A to Z and a war action in fact. On Nov. 22, the south Korean puppet forces made no scruple of announcing that they would fire shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side with artillery pieces they deployed on Yonphyong Island while staging Hoguk exercises for a war of aggression against the DPRK, straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula. In this connection the DPRK side sent a telephone notice to the south Korean puppet military at 8 a.m. on Nov. 23, strongly urging it to immediately cancel the plan for firing shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side. In the notice the DPRK side seriously warned that if it paid no heed to this demand, it would face a resolute physical counter-strike and would be held fully responsible for all the ensuing consequences.[61] This telephone call, and the previous public warnings, have received very little coverage in the Western media, but there is no doubt that it took place, since it was reported by the Seoul newspaper Korea Herald: In the morning [of the clash], the North sent a telephone message to the South, saying “The North would not just sit back if the South fired shots into the North Korean territorial waters,” according to JCS [South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff] officials.[62] We do not know how explicit that warning was, but since it was a telephone call, the Southern officer could presumably have sought clarification. Moreover, we have other reports that the ROK military was aware that that DPRK had moved artillery into position. This was then followed by practice shooting: A senior military said several hours before the shelling began the North Korean military deployed one battery of six 122-mm MLRS shells and later two batteries of 12 112-mm MLRS shells. It also carried out preparatory shooting practice just before the attack. &quot;As far as I know the South Korean military was aware of this,&quot; he said.[63] It seems fair to assume that the local ROK military commander knew what would happen if the firing exercise went ahead. Whether he relayed this to higher levels and asked for confirmation to go ahead we do not know, but it seems likely. There was no great time pressure and taking action which would result in the first artillery exchange since the Korean War would surely have been referred up to higher levels. The warning/foreknowledge issue become even more convoluted with revelations on 1 December that South Korean intelligence had known since August that the North would respond. The Director of the National Intelligence Service [NIS] gave testimony to a closed-door session of a committee of the National Assembly. Members of the National Assembly Intelligence Committee quoted NIS Director Won Sei-hoon as saying the agency knew from wiretapping that the North Korean regime ordered the military to prepare to attack the five islands in the West Sea. He said the NIS submitted the intelligence report to President Lee Myung-bak.[emphasis added] [64] The phrase ‘prepare to attack’ implies, and is meant to imply, a Northern provocation, an unprovoked assault. In fact, we have from another story a much more plausible phrase: The[Asahi Shimbun]quoted the source, who is familiar with North Korea-China relations, as saying, &quot;Early last month, the North Korean military issued instructions in Kim Jong-un's name to senior military commanders to get ready to counter the enemy's provocations any time.&quot; The source quoted an unnamed North Korean Army officer as commenting on the artillery attack on Yeonpyeong. &quot;It had been planned. We had been preparing for that for a long time.&quot; [emphasis added][65] This countering of what the North regarded as a Southern provocation is consistent with the published and telephone warnings. It gives a quite different take on who was provoking whom. This did not prevent the Chosun Ilbo, which ran the story, from heading it ‘Kim Jong-un 'Ordered Attack in Early November'. Not the first time a newspaper has mendaciously given a headline which is contradicted by the actual story under it. In fact, the Chosun Ilbo, which has a very virulent ideological position, often does it. On 3 December it ran a story about an interview Russian Prime Minister Putin gave in the United States in which it was reported that ‘Putin said that he finds the situation in the Korean Peninsula &quot;very acute and disturbing&quot;’. The headline was ‘N.Korean Attack 'Acute and Disturbing,' Says Putin’. The assertion that the NIS submitted the intelligence report to President Lee Myung-bak has to be taken cautiously. From the public account we do not know whether he was given it personally, and the warning drawn to his attention. It may have just been passed to his office, and he never got to read it. That is a generous interpretation. Whether Lee was aware personally it is clear that the North Korean warning that they would retaliate if the exercises took place was known at the highest levels of the South Korean command. Events of the day The actual sequence of events is more complex than most press reports and commentaries suggest. According to the Korea Herald report the Northern shelling started at 2.34pm, but was perhaps not the ‘massive onslaught’ that it was often called: “As the North fired coastal artillery shells at around 2:34 p.m. into waters off the Yeonpyeong Island as well as on the island, we immediately fired back in full accordance with combat rules,” said Lee Hong-kee, chief director for joint operations at the JCS, in a press briefing. [emphasis added][66] Either the accuracy of the Northern artillery was poor, or firing into the water was deliberate. According to the report, here is the sequence of events After 8.00am and before 2.34 pm South fires into sea 2.34 pm North starts firing into sea (and land?) 2.47 pm South starts firing at Northern coastal batteries – ‘strong, concentrated’ counterattack causing ‘considerable damage’ 2.55 pm North ceases firing 3.11 pm North recommences firing 3.42 pm North ceases firing 3.48 pm South telephones North urging it to stop its ‘provocative acts’ By 9.30 pm 2 marines killed; while six others were seriously injured. Ten other soldiers and three civilians suffered minor injuries This raises some intriguing questions. • Did the North fire simultaneously at the island and into the sea, or did the land fire come later? • Did the North fire onto the island only after the Southern counterattack on its positions? • Why did the South make a telephone call asking the North to stop if it had already done so? • Did the North recommence firing sometime after 3.42 pm? • As of 9.30 pm we have three civilians reported with minor injuries but subsequent reports give two dead. Were the dead amongst these three, or were they discovered later? The ‘fog of war’ no doubt produces confusion but these discrepancies suggest that we have not had the full story by any means. The quite erroneous claim that this was an ‘unprovoked attack’ by the North has been repeated so many times by ROK officials, and by the media, that even liberals such as the American investigative journalist Tim Shorrock have been taken in.[67] The other main canard in the official narrative concerns civilians. The theme is set at the top with statements from Lee Myung-bak. On 29 November he gave a short address to the nation: During a seven-minute speech Lee expressed outrage over the North's ruthless attack on civilians, calling it an &quot;inhumane&quot; crime [emphasis added].[68] Others were more circumspect. A JCS spokesman called the firing ‘indiscriminate’: “This provocation is a premeditated, intentional illegal attack in violation of the U.N. Convention, the Armistice Agreement and the inter-Korean non-aggression accord. It is also an inhumane atrocity, in which it indiscriminately fired shells into unarmed civilian residential areas.”[69] Song Min-soon, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade and currently a Democratic Party (i.e. opposition) member of the National Assembly attacked what he called an: outrageous indiscriminate artillery attack against civilians and military alike.[70] The American liberal John Feffer wrote of a ‘disproportionate response’ which killed ‘two civilians and two soldiers’. [71] Early reports (such as the Korea Herald one above) mention only minor civilian injuries, though they talk of a ’civilian area’: ..killing two South Korean marines, wounding 16 soldiers and three civilians, and damaging homes and facilities. This was the first time since the Korean War that the North has fired artillery shells on a civilian area in South Korea.[72] ‘Civilian area’ is a rather elastic term. Most military bases have civilians living in the vicinity, some more than others. The giant US headquarters in South Korea, Yongsan Garrison occupies 2.5 sq km in the centre of this city of 10 million people; the site was originally developed by the Japanese Imperial Army. By 24 November the casualties changed to four – two military and two civilians. In addition to the two marines killed, the bodies of two men, believed in their 60s, were pulled from a destroyed construction site, the coast guard said. At least 18 people - most of them troops - were injured.[73] It was not stated where this construction site was in relation to the marine camp. If it were on the other side of the island, then that would indicate fire that was either indiscriminate or very inaccurate. If it were close by, or even on the camp, then this would put a different complexion on things. It is clear that the main target was the marine camp, as this quotation from the JCS indicates Many landed on a military camp but others on a civilian village on the island. Flames and thick columns of smoke were seen rising above the village and a nearby mountain. &quot;The North must have carefully premeditated the provocation against the camp,&quot; a JCS officer speculated. [74] Fig 4: Damage at the marine base A K-9 Marine artillery base on Yeonpyeong Island under attack by North Korea on Tuesday /Courtesy of the Ministry of Defense [&quot;N.Korean Shelling 'Aimed for Maximum Damage to Lives, Property'.&quot; Chosun Ilbo, 26 November 2010. The Washington Post went one step further and reported that: Most of the shells landed on a military base on Yeonpyeong island [emphasis added][75] However, most reports either did not mention the marine base, or gave no details. For instance, another Washington Post article talked of ‘civilian-inhabited Yeonpyeong Island’ without any reference to the marine base.[76] In fact the military installations were very significant as a New York Times article makes evident. … [Yeonpyeong Island] houses a garrison of about 1,000 South Korean marines, and the navy has deployed its newest class of “patrol killer” guided-missile ships in the Western Sea, as the Yellow Sea is also known. [77] This NY Times article gave the civilian population as 1,600 but this was later revised down to 1,350. [78] Most appear to be connected, as one might expect, to fishing (this area is especially famous for crabs); how many work on the base is unclear. The most detailed, technical, assessment of the artillery duel is given by the US ‘geopolitical intelligence’ company STRATFOR. It released a report, accompanied by a pdf file showing satellite images taken after what it called the ‘North Korean attack on Yeonpyeong Island’. The STRATFOR reports are interesting partly for what they reveal but also what they hide or obscure and for what might be considered a surprising lack of geopolitical intelligence in an organisation in the business of selling the stuff. It admits that: A [South Korean] battery of six K9 155 mm self-propelled howitzers, which was conducting live-fire drills on a Yeonpyeong Island military base, fired some 80 rounds. And then, a bit further down: Significantly, the South claims its Yeonpyeong Island drill was not part of the larger Hoguk exercises under way simultaneously throughout South Korea. North Korea has occasionally protested these drills — including recently — and claims dozens of shells fell in North Korean waters near the island, provoking it to fire. However, as the North does not recognize the Northern Limit Line and considers the entire island and its surrounding water to be North Korean territory, it does not seem to be clear that this particular incident was any more provocative than any other drill.[79] This is a curious argument. Hoguk and the other military exercises over the decades have taken place in South Korean territory or international waters. This one was being held in what the North considered to be DPRK territory. It was not merely provocative from a military point of view, but as they made clear in their statement of 24 November, from a legal one as well. That is a very important distinction which differentiated the Yeonpyeong exercise from others. Although the STRAFOR report mentions the military base in passing, it is absent from the satellite images document. We have satellite photos of destroyed houses, but nothing about the base, which is not even identified. Since the base was the main target of attack, and early reports focused on military dead and wounded, this is a rather suspicious omission. The STRATFOR report, and images, do however throw considerable light, albeit inadvertently, on the issue of the civilian casualties. It would appear from this, and other sources, that the North Korean fire was not very accurate. The North Koreans either exclusively, or mainly (it is not clear which) used Multiple Launch Rocket System [MLRS] artillery These are, as the name suggests, basically a bundle of tubes which can fire rockets. Interestingly it is said that they can be traced back to the 15th century Korean hwacha (‘fire vehicle’) which could fire a hundred or more projectiles in one salvo.[80] The most famous example in modern times was the Soviet Katyusha, used in the Second World War and nicknamed the ‘Stalin organ’.[81] The Americans used them in 1991 in the Gulf War, and the ROK military is equipped with them.[82] MLRS can deliver formidable devastation but are not very accurate, especially the older versions with which the KPA is equipped: The initial barrage consisted of 150 rounds, followed by 20 more intermittently — meaning that while a full battalion appeared to be in position, a fully armed single battery could have conducted the entire attack. Of these 170 rounds, 80 struck Yeonpyeong Island, though 20 failed to detonate….. With a few modern exceptions, artillery rockets are unguided and achieve results through massed fires rather than exceptional accuracy. Here, North Korea had no opportunity to register targets or adjust fire based on input from forward observers; South Korea has subsequently conjectured based on the targets that the North’s maps of military positions on the island may have been dated. The failure of so many rounds to reach the island and a dud rate of roughly a quarter of those that did suggest issues of quality control in manufacture and/or poorly controlled storage, as well as the potential for there to have been issues in the fire direction or on the gunline.[83] So it would appear that the reason that shells fell on the town was not so much that that the firing was indiscriminate, but that it was inaccurate. The North Koreans do not have a monopoly on this, and there was anger in the National Assembly Intelligence Committee when they were presented with the satellite photo (Fig 5) which showed that Southern shells fired from their much more accurate howitzers had missed their target, the North Korean artillery positions Committee members reportedly reacted angrily since they show impact points scattered mainly in paddy and dry fields.[84] Fig 5: Evidence of inaccurate fire In this satellite photo released by the U.S. private intelligence agency Stratfor, rice paddies and fields in North Korea bear traces of South Korean artillery shells [&quot;Spies Intercepted Plans for Yeonpyeong Attack in August &quot;. Chosun Ilbo, 2 December 2010. There was also much dispute about the damage suffered by the North. The DPRK has not released any statement about casualties. In the South, some pointed out that their military equipment was far superior and more deadly and hence there must have been many casualties, and others pointed to the various satellite photos showing hits off target.[85] Sometimes military action is intended primarily to terrorise and demoralise the civilian population – the London blitz, the firebombing of Tokyo, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the ‘shock and awe’ bombing of Bagdad prior to invasion – are just a few examples. If the DPRK fired on Seoul to unleash ‘a sea of fire’ it would be the civilian population that would be hit, and the military impact would be secondary. However, much military action is aimed primarily at the enemy military, and if this happens in a populated area, civilians become, in the US euphemism, ‘collateral damage’. Clearly the distinction between the two is often blurred in practice, and it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to be sure, but it appears from the available evidence that the target for the North Korean fire was the marine base and that civilian casualties and damage were accidental. There are several reasons for assuming this. Firstly, the inaccuracy of the MLRS. Secondly, if the intention had been to cause civilian causalities as a warning about the consequences of Lee Myung-bak’s confrontational policy – ‘today Yeonpyeong, tomorrow Seoul’ – we would expect that point to be made. There is little point in giving a warning unless it is reasonably explicit. I can find no indication that the DPRK has made any suggestion that the Yeonpyeong incident carried such a lesson for the people of the ROK. On the contrary, the public statement expressed regret for civilian casualties and laid the blame on the Southern side: The DPRK side warned several times against the enemy's plan for shelling in the sensitive areas around Yonphyong Island and sent a telephone notice on the morning of the very day the incident occurred as part of its superhuman efforts to prevent the clash to the last moment, but the south side preempted the firing of shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side. The enemy side, however, has kept silent about all these facts. Moreover, it is now working hard to dramatize &quot;civilian casualties&quot; as part of its propaganda campaign, creating the impression that the defenceless civilians were exposed to &quot;indiscriminate shelling&quot; all of a sudden from the DPRK side. If that is true, it is very regrettable but the enemy should be held responsible for the incident as it took such inhuman action as creating &quot;a human shield&quot; by deploying civilians around artillery positions and inside military facilities before the launch of the provocation. The fact that there were human casualties inside the military base clearly proves itself the ulterior intention of the enemy. The U.S. regarded the death of innocent civilians as a common practice in the past in a bid to serve its military purposes in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and other parts of the world. This inhuman atrocity of the US. repeated itself on the Korean Peninsula this time. While the incident occurred, the shells indiscriminately fired by the enemy dropped in the area close to civilian houses far from the artillery positions of the Korean People's Army.[emphasis added][86] This statement brings up a third factor. The claim about a ‘human shield’ doesn’t carry much weight. Civilians live on the island for historical and economic reasons and there is no reason to suppose that they were used to shield the military. However, the claim that civilian casualties occurred within the camp is not implausible. Civilians must have worked at the camp. Indeed, one report from the United States said of the shelling that ‘this resulted in the killing of two South Korean soldiers and two civilian contractors working on a military base’ [emphasis added].[87] As with the Cheonan incident we need a proper, impartial, investigation if we are to draw any firm conclusions, but as with the Cheonan no such investigation is likely. It is interesting to note that the DPRK statement does not claim that it suffered any civilian causalities, merely that enemy shells ‘dropped in the area close to civilian houses’. North Korean propaganda is frequently portrayed as dishonest and deceitful. Here is surely a case where it would have been to their advantage to fabricate civilian casualties, but they did not do so. Finally, it should be remembered that the ROK military on Yeonpyeong Island are not just ordinary soldiers, they are marines, an elite force trained for amphibious assault. Indeed, back in 2009 Rodong Sinmun commented on the buildup up in the area The puppet military reinforced warships and armed forces along and near the &quot;northern limit line in the West Sea&quot; and formed a &quot;task force to be ready to go into action in half an hour&quot; and deployed it on Yonphyong Islet[emphasis added][88] The road behind, the road ahead The fire fight at Yeonpyeong Island seems to have been a manufactured crisis. It appears to be the first time that South Korea, alone or in tandem with the United States, has carried out a military exercise in territory claimed by the North.[89] There have been frequent naval clashes around the Northern Limit Line and it is fairly certain that it has been preserved for that purpose. If’ Seoul’ had really been anxious to avoid incidents and preserve peace then the NLL would have gone long ago. President Roh moo-hyun and Chairman Kim Jong Il, at their summit on 4 October 2007 agreed to ‘special peace and cooperation zone in the West Sea’, but this peace initiative was overturned, as so many others, by incoming president Lee Myung-bak.[90] Preserving the NLL as an area where incidents were likely is one thing, but utilising the NLL deliberately to create an incident is another Warnings and intelligence reports aside, it must have been known that a military exercise within the NLL area would be provocative. On top of which, the legal implications made it intolerably provocative. This suggests that the crisis was planned, not necessarily in great detail, but with sufficient surety of outcome. This reading is quite consistent with Lee Myung-bak’s policy, which is one of building up tension through tension in order to precipitate a crisis on the peninsula, a collapse of the DRPK, and its absorption by the ROK. The DPRK is well aware of this, hence the reaffirmation of the zero tolerance policy at Yeonpyeong. On 23 November, in the aftermath of the clash, the KPA issued a communiqué which reiterated the policy: It is a traditional mode of counter-action of the army of the DPRK to counter the firing of the provocateurs with merciless strikes. Should the south Korean puppet group dare intrude into the territorial waters of the DPRK even 0.001 mm, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will unhesitatingly continue taking merciless military counter-actions against it.[91] This is a calculated policy of brinkmanship, designed to avert war, by threatening war. The danger is, of course, that <strong>the momentum of events will bring war about. That, unfortunately, is becoming ever more likely.</strong> Lee Myung-bak is a consummate politician. He has set things in motion to produce, and replicate crisis, while giving the appearance of being reluctant. His address to the nation on 29 November used the same rhetorical device as Antony’s speech about Julius Caesar, where he claims to be burying Caesar, not praising him, but of course is doing just that. Lee combined ‘humility’ with an aggressive stance in such a way as to suggest he was reluctant to exacerbate the situation but was being forced into it. President Lee Myung-bak’s address Monday is being summarized as consisting mainly of “humility toward the people of South Korea” and an “ultra-hardline response to North Korea.” Analysts say it shows the president’s perception of the current crisis facing him and its solution following the North Korean artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island. Although even North Korea acknowledged the attack to be a “provocation,” President Lee has faced harsh criticism domestically. Surveys show that more than 70 percent of South Koreans, conservative and progressive alike, feel that the military and Lee Myung-bak administration did not respond appropriately at the time of the attack. The fact that the president began his address Monday with what amounted to an apology to the people of South Korea reflected a consideration of this situation. [emphasis added] The performance so impressed the reporter from the liberal Hankyoreh that we get manifestly false statement that ‘North Korea acknowledged the attack to be a ‘provocation’. Throughout the crises of 2001, especially over Cheonan and then Yeonpyeong, Lee Myung-bak has been very adroit in fanning the flames while give the impression that he was attempting to put them out. In respect of the Cheonan incident President Obama was reported as saying &quot;I think President Lee has shown extraordinary restraint given these circumstances.’[92] It may be objected that this was a public statement and should not be taken too literally; politicians often say in public the opposite of what they think in private. However, there does seem to be a consensus among Western observers at least that Lee is a reluctant warrior being driven into taking steps by the provocative obduracy of the North.[93] Take, for instance, this STRATFOR interview where the interviewer comments: I talked to three former [US?] envoys to Seoul this week and all of them agreed that South Korea had handled this in a pretty cool and sensible fashion[94] The South Korea public is rather more sceptical. One of the WikiLeaks cables [09SEOUL59] illustrates the confusion in the minds of US officials: President Lee is determined not to give in to North Korean pressure. Our Blue House contacts have told us on several occasions that President Lee remained quite comfortable with his North Korea policy and that he is prepared leave the inter-Korean relations frozen until the end of his term in office, if necessary. It is also our assessment that Lee's more conservative advisors and supporters see the current standoff as a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the North, even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship.[95] On the one hand we have Lee facing up to North Korean pressure, but we also get the admission that the ‘current standoff’ ( this was in 2009) is seen as ‘ a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the North, even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship’. Lee’s brinkmanship is, in fact, far more profound and aggressive than the US diplomat realised. Both North and South are engaging in brinkmanship, but the nature of the two is very different. Pyongyang is far poorer and weaker than its adversaries, which include not merely South Korea but the United States, and Japan.[96] North Korea’s brinkmanship is therefore inherently defensive. It is designed to protect the country (or regime if you prefer that) from attack and conquest. That does not mean that it is wise, or will be successful, that is a matter of debate. But it is important to recognise its essential characteristic of defensiveness. South Korea’s brinkmanship, on the other hand, is offensive. It is designed to bring about the collapse of the DPRK and its takeover by the ROK. Lee Myung-bak does not have to do this. His immediate predecessors (Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun) had very different policies. Indeed, his aggressive brinkmanship is arguably a new development because even in the days of the military dictatorships while there was hostility towards the North because the balance of forces if anything favoured the North, there was not such an ambitious policy. However, Lee Myung-bak is reputedly pragmatic and opportunistic. Soon after he won the presidency he was described in the New York Times thus: Mr. Lee has a reputation as a pragmatist who, in contrast to President Roh Moo-hyun, holds few strong ideological positions. As mayor, he created parks and reformed the public transportation system. As president, he said, his main agenda would be to revive the country’s economy.[97] If that is correct, his brinkmanship has been a response to events and opportunities, rather than a considered strategy. In addition, we may discern three factors which may be propelling him to accelerate the buildup of tension on the peninsula. • A desire to renew the anti-North momentum after the relative failure of the Cheonan incident. His setback in the May elections, the widespread public scepticism about the investigation, and the failure to get the UN Security Council to condemn North Korea must rankle. The Yeonpyeong incident is seen as away to rekindle anti-North Korea sentiment In his address on 29 November he specifically made the point: There was a split in public opinion over the torpedoing of the Cheonan. Unlike that time, our people have united as one this time.[98] Despite the frequent assertions of implosion and crisis, the DPRK is not facing collapse. Whilst sanctions must have caused huge damage it appears that the economy is recovering. Certainly Pyongyang, from personal observation on a visit in November 2010, is manifestly economically improved over my last visit three years ago, with more motor vehicles, bicycles, and shops. The electricity supply is much better and there is a very noticeable increase in street lighting. These observations are broadly corroborated by series of recent American visitors.[99] If the South is to take over the North then something must be done to reverse this recovery. Time is not on Lee Myung-bak’s side. His term of office comes to an end on 25 February 2013 and under the present constitution he is ineligible to run again. Moreover, there are suggestions that because of demographic changes the conservative ascendancy represented by the Lee administration may not be sustainable and that South Korea will move to more progressive administrations.[100] Since the North’s brinkmanship is defensive, it is reactive and this leaves the initiative in the hands of the South. Seoul has reinforced its forces on the NLL island and has announced that there will be artillery exercises from Daecheong Island, and again on Yeonpyeong. [101] <strong>It seems inevitable that Pyongyang will feel compelled to respond.</strong> The new ROK Defence Minister, Kim Kwan-jin, has threatened what he calls ‘self-defense air raids’ in the event of another clash; ‘self defense’ being used in the Japanese sense.[102] It will be recalled that clause 9 of the Japanese constitution prohibits the establishment of armed forces, so the Japanese army, navy and air forces all have ‘self-defense’ in their titles thus solving the constitutional problem. Kim Kwan-jin’s air strike policy is all part of what the New York Times rather approvingly, and with a professional use of euphemism, called a new ‘muscular military posture’.[103] The implications of this new policy are obvious. Not merely has the South great superiority in aircraft, but the new rules allow great flexibility for escalation. However, there are limits to the ROK military’s freedom of action. There is the legal issue of operational control – when would war be deemed a war and thus trigger US control of the ROK military ? But before that stage is reached, the ROK air force is dependent on US intelligence to operate. Thus <strong>any serious escalation of the situation on the Korean peninsula would require US endorsement.</strong> Would this be forthcoming? Unfortunately it looks as if it would. The Obama administration has termed its policy towards Korea as one of ‘strategic patience’. [104] It might be better described as ‘strategic paralysis’. Not merely has it ignored that calls of a many Korea experts to engage with the DPRK, but it has effectively relinquished control of events to Lee Myung-bak.[105] It might be said that ‘strategic paralysis’ is not confined to US Korea policy but is the defining characteristic of Obama foreign policy, and that would be true, but nowhere is it more perilous than in Korea. Because ultimately Korea is China. A second Korean war would, like the first, <strong>soon become a Sino-American war.</strong><br />
<strong>North Korea doesn’t take U.S. deterrence seriously anymore</strong><br />
<strong>Fenenko 12/8</strong>—leading research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of International Security, PhD (Alexei, 8 December 2010, “North Korea no longer takes the U.S. security guarantees seriously”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4011:http://en.rian.ru/valdai_op/20101208/161686288.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.rian.ru/valdai_op/20101208/161686288.html" rel="nofollow">http://en.rian.ru/valdai_op/20101208/161686288.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4011 -->, RBatra)<br />
The current crisis reveals yet another negative trend: North Korea no longer takes American security guarantees seriously. The United States is bound by a set of obligations to protect its two allies – Japan and South Korea; therefore, it is conventionally accepted that the United States would initiate the conflict. Now that the Obama administration has shown that, unlike the previous Republican administration, it <strong>does not necessarily take so robust stance on defending its allies</strong>, North Korea has begun to “vet” the United States to see if, under certain circumstances, they would be prepared to abandon their allies in the Pacific, especially since the United States already has serious ongoing commitments to <strong>two theaters of conflict: Iraq and Afghanistan.</strong><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Despite intermittent crises and many deadly clashes, nearly six decades have passed since the armistice agreement “ending” the Korean War was signed without there being a serious resumption of military hostilities. Though the armed standoff in Korea is hardly a desirable state of affairs, this record can be taken as a reassuring sign of its underlying stability. But how sanguine should we be that the current crisis will recede in much the same way that earlier ones have and that the deterrent relationship will hold? In fact, recent events raise some troubling questions about the volatility of the situation in Korea today.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">First, the November 23, 2010 shelling of Yeongpyeong Island by North Korean artillery clearly caught many experts by surprise. North-South relations had been thawing after a summer of heightened tensions following the sinking of the ROK naval ship Cheonan in March. Even the revelation of new nuclear enrichment facilities immediately prior to the attack had seemed to accomplish its putative goal of convincing the outside world that North Korea could not be left to stew in its own juices and that engagement was now imperative. So why would North Korea set back its coercive diplomatic campaign by launching yet another deadly provocation that antagonized everyone—including its principal patron China—just when the wind was clearly beginning to blow in its favor? Did North Korea fail to see this or did it miscalculate the impact of its actions? Did other factors, notably the succession process underway in Pyongyang, affect the calculus or tip the scales in some decisive way?</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Second, the attack on Yeongpyeong Island was also surprising in that it targeted areas inhabited by civilians for the first time since the Korean War. This was no accident, but a carefully cho</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">reographed and well executed attack as Joe Bermudez’s excellent account of what happened indicates. Yes, the numbers killed were still less than previous incidents. And yes, one can infer that the choice of Yeongpyeong still signaled restraint by North Korea as the military base on the island had been the source of offending live fire drills and, moreover, represented an “off peninsula” target and thus less likely to trigger wider escalation. But why would North Korea decide to brazenly disregard such an established “red line,” to say nothing of a cardinal international norm, at this time? Can we infer from this a growing willingness <strong>to breach other red lines</strong> and engage in still more risky behavior?</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Third, <strong>the rapid change in South Korean public opinion from being largely pacifist</strong> and unwilling to countenance a forceful response against North Korea to the situation today where a majority now favor military retaliation if provoked has <strong>introduced a new element into the crisis</strong>. Tough statements by senior ROK officials—including President Lee Myung Bak—that South Korea will use force in the event of another aggressive act suggest that the days of Southern forbearance are over. This is completely understandable and, to many, a necessary prerequisite to deter future provocations. Yet, how confident can we be—especially in light of recent events—that North Korea will take the threat of South Korean retaliation seriously? Might it only goad them further? And should we worry that South Korea might take preemptive action if it had credible indications of another provocation?</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Remarkably, despite all the commentary on the current crisis, to say nothing of the obvious stakes involved, scant attention has been given to how tensions might actually escalate rather than dissipate contrary to past experience. Certainly plenty of commentators have warned about how “miscalculation,” “loss of control” and “unintended escalation” could trigger a new Korean war, but rarely beyond such broad generalizations and assertions. Conversely, those who discount the likelihood of significant escalation should the South retaliate militarily in the future have been no more forthcoming in explaining why the risk remains low other than repeating the broad conviction that it is in neither side’s interests to go to war. As we have seen in many cases, however, an expectation of rational behavior—especially for decision makers under conditions of stress and incomplete information­­—is not something that can be reliably assumed.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The propensity of another major clash on or around the peninsula to escalate militarily depends on numerous complex factors. Understanding them may seem like an arcane or academic exercise, but it is in fact critically important to considering how best to manage the current crisis and prevent the very outcome that everyone—including presumably the North Koreans—wishes to avoid. Four interrelated variables are likely to be the critical ingredients to how another deadly clash might escalate. These can be simplified as the “who, where, what and why” factors:</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Who’s Involved: In the most recent provocations, North Korea has evidently been careful to confine their operations to South Korean targets. A future incident that either intentionally or accidentally involves U.S. forces or citizens in Korea would clearly raise the stakes. It is has been some time since this has happened and one could infer that North Korea understands that the risks have grown too high and thus they will continue to refrain from any direct or harmful interactions with the United States. The decision to carry out joint U.S.-ROK naval exercises in the vicinity of the recent provocations presumably had this in mind to help deter further attacks. Yet, how sure can we really be that North Korea would not target U.S. forces in the future? <strong>Might they make the same calculation that the U.S. will be just as risk averse</strong> to taking retaliatory action as the ROK has been to date? And even if they do continue to avoid provocations that may involve the U.S., how confident are we that they would know when U.S. forces or citizens are not in harm’s way? Finally, while <strong>the involvement of the U.S. would clearly increase the risk of military escalation</strong>, we should also not overlook the potential role of Japan. It too has been the target of past provocations and its tolerance for aggressive North Korean behavior has lessened considerably in recent years while its capacity for military retaliation has manifestly increased.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Where the Interactions Take Place: As several analysts have pointed out, the Cheonan and Yeongpyeong incidents are the latest in a decade-long sequence of military clashes along the disputed Northern Limit Line (NLL)—all of which have stayed localized. Were additional incidents to occur in this same general area, the supposition is that South Korea would retaliate in the proximate vicinity and in a proportional way to reduce the risk of further escalation. This raises the question of whether North Korea would view South Korean retaliation against mainland, i.e. “on peninsular” targets—which are reportedly now being considered—as a qualitatively different and therefore disproportionate response regardless of how discrete or contained they were? There is no assurance, in any case, that North Korea would confine any future provocations to the NLL/Yellow Sea area. Meddling with the Kaesong Industrial Complex, including the detention of South Koreans who work there, has been mentioned as a possibility. Insertion of special forces into the South if only for reconnaissance purposes is also not out of the question. There have been plenty of precedents after all. Neither should Seoul be viewed as off limits as demonstrated by the failed assassination attempt in late 2009 by a North Korean “hit team” against their most senior defector Hwang Jang Yop. How South Korea would respond proportionately to these or similar types of activities are not immediately clear, though one can anticipate considerable public agitation to retaliate promptly.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">What Type of Interactions Take Place: The scale, intensity, and nature of any further military interactions clearly have a major bearing on how a crisis would subsequently escalate. Intermittent artillery duels across the NLL and even the DMZ would probably not precipitate a major outbreak of hostilities. The use of airpower, however, which has been raised as a possible retaliatory option by the new ROK Defense Minister, introduces a new, more uncertain element since it entails the direct incursion of sovereign territory and thus represents a clearer political affront to the North. (It also introduces the possibility of downed and captured pilots that could also complicate matters). Targeting major symbols of national power such as nuclear facilities and missile bases—however surgically undertaken—would undoubtedly represent a still greater challenge to the North which we can reliably assume would not go unanswered. The most important variable, however, will be the perceived operational status of each side’s main offensive capabilities. If either North or South Korea perceives that opposing forces are being readied to engage in large scale offensive operations, the incentives to strike first will inevitably increase. For the North the reason would be to avert the almost certain demise of the regime and for the South it would be to minimize the risk to Seoul. But, as has often been observed, <strong>precautionary defensive measures designed to bolster deterrence are not easily distinguishable from offensive preparations and thus the potential for miscalculation exists.</strong> Here changes to the size, disposition, and alert status of U.S. forces in and around Korea, including the potential activation of reinforcements and the evacuation of non-combatants from forward areas, will be absolutely critical to perceptions of intent.</span></span><br />

Beijing's record during 2010 was far more disconcerting. In March, North Korea sank a South Korean corvette, killing forty-six sailors. In November, it revealed the existence of a facility for enriching uranium, providing Pyongyang an additional prospective path for fissile material development apart from its existing plutonium capability. Later in the same month, it shelled a coastal island, killing South Korean soldiers and civilians. Yet China declined to call Pyongyang to account for these outrages, and sought to protect North Korea from international opprobrium.<br />
China's responses diverged sharply from those of the United States, South Korea and Japan. It talked the talk of major-power cooperation but it did not walk the walk, even in the face of direct threats to regional stability and security about which Beijing has professed repeated concern. Moreover, Beijing openly chastised Washington for undertaking enhanced defense cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo to inhibit additional provocations by Pyongyang.<br />
South Korea has stated that it will no longer tolerate future provocations by the North. It also <strong>voices open doubt that Beijing will restrain Pyongyang. South Korean retaliation for additional North Korean actions is no longer a question of if, but of when. Even if Seoul responds in a focused and proportionate manner, such retaliation creates the danger of a cycle of escalation.</strong><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Korean Peninsula represents the immediate test case for Hu and Obama to &quot;reset&quot; U.S.-China relations</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: none;"> and address questions of immediate concern to both countries.

<strong>Chinese pressure on North Korea is key to maintain regional stability. However, the geopolitical rivalry with the U.S. on the peninsula dissuades them.</strong><br />
<strong>Putten 12/21</strong>—research fellow with the Clingendael Institue in The Hague, PhD in History (Frans-Paul van der Putten, 21 December 2010, “Sino-US geopolitical rivalry does not help Korean stability”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/21/sino-us-geopolitical-rivalry-does-not-help-korean-stability/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/21/sino-us-geopolitical-rivalry-does-not-help-korean-stability/</a>, RBatra)<br />
The United States government believes China needs to do more to contribute to stability on the Korean peninsula. According to this view, North Korea is highly dependent on Chinese support and Beijing should use its influence to moderate Pyongyang’s behavior. As some American and other Western observers have put it, it is time for China to start behaving like a responsible great power. But it is not likely that China will fundamentally alter its policies.<br />
The main reason for this is that geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States overshadows the situation on the Korean peninsula. Lately both Chinese and US actions have escalated this rivalry. As long as the two powers are more interested in keeping the other in check than in stabilising the peninsula <strong>no significant progress in terms of stabilising the region is possible.</strong><br />
North Korea recently shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong after a period of escalating tensions, killing two soldiers and two civilians. North Korea claims that it opened fire after being provoked by a South Korean exercise. In response to the shelling incident the US and South Korea have conducted joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea. These involved a US aircraft carrier and are regarded as threatening not only by North Korea but also by China.<br />
China’s economic and diplomatic support for North Korea undermines efforts by other countries to affect the behavior of the regime in Pyongyang. Even China is troubled by North Korean behavior. The North Korean nuclear program, and the risks Pyongyang is running in escalating tensions with South Korea and the US, are counter to China’s security interests. Theoretically, the Chinese government could therefore decide to put pressure on Pyongyang by limiting its economic support and by ending the diplomatic support it often gives in the United Nations Security Council. It is very unlikely that China’s policy towards North Korea will change much. The US diplomatic reports revealed by WikiLeaks are a confirmation of uneasy Sino-North Korean relations rather than an indication that this relationship is about to change.<br />
China will probably continue to give more support than any other country because it is highly vulnerable to the consequences of political or economic collapse in North Korea. The longest and most accessible border of North Korea is the one it shares with China. Chaos in North Korea would harm stability in China’s northeast, the region formerly known as Manchuria.<br />
Moreover, Beijing is less motivated to put pressure on the North Korean regime than other countries are. The US is primarily interested in preventing the proliferation of nuclear technologies from North Korea. South Korea and Japan are mainly worried about the military threat from the north. Compared with these countries, China is less concerned about such issues.<br />
<strong>The most fundamental element in China’s policy towards North Korea is that Beijing regards the US as a greater security threat than the situation on the Korean peninsula</strong>. Since neither China nor the US is by itself the predominant great power in Korean affairs, Beijing can only assume responsibility for regional stability if it does so jointly with the US. However, this will not happen since China and the US each regard one another as their main potential military adversary. They also have contrary interests on the Korean peninsula.<br />
While <strong>China regards the US military presence in South Korea as a potential threat</strong> that should eventually be removed, the US intends to maintain this presence as it helps to limit Chinese regional influence. The relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang cannot be seen apart from this context of geopolitical rivalry. It is desirable for China that the regime in North Korea continues to exist and that the Chinese government retains a certain degree of influence in Pyongyang.<br />
<strong>The recent meeting changed nothing—military presence prevents Chinese pressure and risks regional arms races and war</strong><br />
<strong>Klein-Ahlbrandt 1/21</strong>—China Adviser and North East Asia Project Director at Crisis Group, supervises the work of a small team of analysts responsible for high quality research and analysis on North East Asia (Stephanie Klein-Ahlbrandt, 21 January 2011, Despite Reports, “China's North Korea Policy Stays the Same,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-t-kleineahlbrandt/post_1614_b_812407.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-t-kleineahlbrandt/post_1614_b_812407.html</a>, RBatra)<br />
During Hu Jintao's visit, he penned a joint statement with President Obama in which -- for the first time -- he voiced concern about North Korea's new uranium enrichment. Many in the U.S. and South Korea are hailing this as support for their position, but they should know better. Despite tactical moves to smooth Hu Jintao's visit, <strong>little about China's North Korea policy has changed over the last few weeks nor is it likely to anytime soon.</strong><br />
In the past, a less strident Beijing's willingness to calibrate its responses to North Korean provocations was key to the West's strategy to moderate Pyongyang's behavior. But internal debates on North Korea policy have given way to traditionalist and conservative forces increasingly dictating the line, backed by nationalist public opinion. Over the past year and a half, China has strengthened its political, economic and military relationship with the North, refusing to hold Pyongyang to account for deadly attacks on the South which recently brought the peninsula the closest to war since 1953.<br />
China's top concern of instability on its border deepened in 2009 following reports of Kim Jong-Il's failing health, a disastrous currency reform, and uncertainties surrounding leadership transition. But <strong>Beijing's calculations are also increasingly shaped by rising concerns about a perceived U.S. strategic &quot;return to Asia&quot; and by opposition to American military and political presence in the region</strong>. China is using its close ties with Pyongyang as a bulwark against U.S. military dominance in the region, giving the rogue nation virtually unconditional diplomatic protection. The two presidents' joint statement this week glosses over all of these realities.<br />
When North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island on November 23 and after the sinking of the South Korean naval ship Cheonan on March 26, China's initial reaction was to dismiss international calls to pressure North Korea. Instead, it criticized U.S. and South Korea for military exercises held in response, which it viewed as <strong>more threatening to its security than North Korea's violent behavior</strong>. It felt the U.S. was using tensions on the Peninsula as a justification to expand its regional military presence. China also worried about the deepening military cooperation between the U.S., South Korea and Japan, seeing U.S. security assistance not only as an attempt to contain China but also as emboldening regional players against it. While weeks after the shelling, China toned down its criticism of the U.S. and sent an envoy to Pyongyang, <strong>it has made no changes to its fundamental economic, military and political support to Pyongyang. Beijing's tactical moves should not be confused with a broader shift in its approach towards North Korea.</strong><br />
Beijing's solidarity with Pyongyang has significantly strained relations with South Korea and Japan, which are strengthening their security alliances with the U.S. Their rejection of China's call for emergency consultations after the Yeonpyeong Island shelling was more than a display of frustration at Beijing's unwillingness to take concrete action. It showed a widening gap between the two camps' perceptions of the North Korean threat and the appropriate ways to manage it. There is a real danger that the North will continue its asymmetric attacks in the Yellow Sea or elsewhere in the South. In response, Japan and South Korea are significantly boosting their military capabilities, <strong>intensifying the risk of a regional arms race or of a miscalculation leading to war.</strong><br />
Beijing's stance on North Korea is only the latest example of its increasingly assertive foreign policy behavior. Over the past year, it has intensified sweeping claims to disputed territories in the South China Sea and Diaoyu Islands, escalated a minor incident at sea into a major confrontation with Japan, and showed off a new stealth fighter aircraft just as the U.S. and China were trying to restart their military relations. Beijing is more unwilling now to yield to external demands and increasingly expects quid pro quos from the West in return for cooperation on third country issues such as North Korea and Iran. A common question in Chinese policy circles is why continue to cooperate with the U.S. when it continues to sell arms to Taiwan.<br />
China needs to step up to the plate and assume the responsibilities that come with its rising power status. It has censured North Korea in the past after the 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. Its failure to do the same now -- for the Cheonan sinking, Yeonpyeong Island attack and Pyongyang's new uranium enrichment -- endangers not just the region but also its own security interests. Shielding Pyongyang and continuing unconditional engagement reduces all other countries' ability to deter North Korea. China's strategy leaves it vulnerable to accusation that it is responsible for enabling North Korea's next attack. Let's hope President Obama realizes the joint statement must be backed up with a stern message to President Hu that Beijing's increasingly cozy relationship with Pyongyang and insistence on <strong>backing the North's bad behavior only heightens the risk of regional conflict.</strong><br />
<strong>China is crucial to any solvency effort</strong><br />
<strong>Global Security 11/29</strong> (29 November 2010, “China Calls For Talks Over Korean Crisis, Parties Unresponsive”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://globalsecuritynewswire.org/siteservices/print_friendly.php?ID=nw_20101129_2947" rel="nofollow">http://globalsecuritynewswire.org/siteservices/print_friendly.php?ID=nw_20101129_2947</a>, RBatra)<br />
China yesterday called for emergency direct diplomacy with North Korea in order to lower escalating tensions following last week's artillery attack on South Korea (see GSN, Nov. 24).<br />
However, the United States and its allies said now is not the time to address Pyongyang's demands for new six-party talks.<br />
North Korea's shelling of the inhabited South Korean island of Yeonpyeong resulted in the deaths of several soldiers and civilians and injuries to nearly 20 more. The incident directly followed news from Washington that Pyongyang revealed to visiting U.S. experts earlier this month that it had covertly built a large-scale advanced uranium enrichment facility at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, the Wall Street Journal reported.<br />
The two events have renewed international attention on the North Korean nuclear impasse. Beijing dispatched its senior foreign affairs official to lead a delegation to Seoul over the weekend for talks on the crisis. However, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak told the Chinese visitors that it was not the &quot;right time&quot; to relaunch long-stalled six-nation talks aimed at the permament denuclearization of North Korea, according to an administration official.<br />
The nuclear talks involve China, Japan, the two Koreas, Russia and the United States. They were last held almost two years ago. Pyongyang withdrew from the negotiations in April 2009 and one month later carried out its second nuclear weapons test, an action for which it was punished with heightened U.N. Security Council sanctions.<br />
The North for some time has declared its willingness to return to the nuclear talks. However, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo are leery of returning to a negotiating framework that has been used by the North in the past as a means to win international concessions only to later resume work on its nuclear weapons program. The three allies have called on Pyongyang to demonstrate its &quot;sincere&quot; commitment to nuclear disarmament before they will agree to resume negotiations. <br />
<strong>China is North Korea's strongest foreign ally and chief economic benefactor</strong>. Beijing's continued support of the Kim Jong Il regime is frequently cited in Washington as the only thing keeping the Stalinist government from collapsing. Because of this, China has come under growing criticism from the international community <strong>to do more to press North Korea over its belligerent behavior.</strong><br />
&quot;It's hard to know why China doesn't push harder,&quot; Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a CNN interview aired yesterday. &quot;They clearly are interested in this -- in the region not spinning out of control -- so my sense is they try to control this guy, and I'm not sure he is controllable.&quot;<br />
Lee yesterday told Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo in blunt remarks that China must take a &quot;more fair and responsible position&quot; on peninsula affairs and leave Cold War-era considerations behind, according to presidential spokesman Hong Sang-pyo.<br />
In a television address today, Lee pledged North Korea &quot;would pay a price&quot; for any future hostilities and said that &quot;more endurance and forgiveness would only result in bigger provocations&quot; (Fairclough/Ramstad, Wall Street Journal I, Nov. 28).<br />
Japan today dismissed Beijing's call for direct talks with North Korea. Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said it would be &quot;unacceptable for us to hold six-party talks only because North Korea has gone amok,&quot; the Wall Street Journal reported (Yuka Hayashi, Wall Street Journal II, Nov. 29).<br />
The United States has yet to give a response to China's call for emergency talks, saying it would carry out discussions with the South Korean government first, Reuters reported.<br />
A high-ranking Pyongyang official voiced doubts about Beijing's initiative to engage in discussions. While the North has not responded to China's call, the unidentified official told Kyodo News that countries involved in the latest incident should meet for talks first (Laurence/Choonsik, Reuters, Nov. 29).<br />
While urging that the two Koreas to refrain from actions that would raise tensions on the peninsula, China has abstained from condemning Pyongyang's shelling of the South Korean island, indicating that Beijing will refuse the urging of Washington and other states to punish the North, the Los Angeles Times reported last Thursday.<br />
North Korea's presumed possession of the nuclear bomb, its large arsenal of chemical weapons and a massive standing army make a military assault on the isolated state an unattractive option, according to reports. The United States and much of the international community have already drastically curtailed trade relations with the Stalinist state. In the White House view, <strong>China remains the only nation to have sway over the North and the only hope of producing a change in the Korean nuclear impasse.</strong><br />
&quot;China is pivotal to moving North Korea in a fundamentally different direction,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said.<br />
&quot;You can go [to] the U.N. Security Council or call for a five-party meeting (minus North Korea). <strong>But first you've got to go after China</strong>,&quot; said Victor Cha, point man for North Korean policy during the Bush administration. <br />

<strong>Korea war goes global and nuclear</strong><br />
<strong>STRATFOR 10</strong> (5/26/10, “North Korea, South Korea: The Military Balance on the Peninsula,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100526_north_korea_south_korea_military_balance_peninsula" rel="nofollow">http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100526_north_korea_south_korea_military_balance_peninsula</a>, JMP)<br />
So the real issue is the potential for escalation — or an accident that could precipitate escalation — that would be beyond the control of Pyongyang or Seoul. With both sides on high alert, both adhering to their own national (and contradictory) definitions of where disputed boundaries lie and with rules of engagement loosened, <strong>the potential for sudden and rapid escalation is quite real.</strong><br />
Indeed, North Korea’s navy, though sizable on paper, is largely a hollow shell of old, laid-up vessels. What remains are small fast attack craft and submarines — mostly Sang-O “Shark” class boats and midget submersibles. These vessels are best employed in the cluttered littoral environment to bring asymmetric tactics to bear — not unlike those Iran has prepared for use in the Strait of Hormuz. These kinds of vessels and tactics — including, especially, the deployment of naval mines — are poorly controlled when dispersed in a crisis and are often impossible to recall.<br />
For nearly 40 years, tensions on the Korean Peninsula were managed within the context of the wider Cold War. During that time it was feared that a second Korean War could all too <strong>easily escalate into</strong> and <strong>a thermonuclear World War III</strong>, so both Pyongyang and Seoul were being heavily managed from their respective corners. In fact, USFK was long designed to ensure that South Korea could not independently provoke that war and drag the Americans into it, which for much of the Cold War period was of far greater concern to Washington than North Korea attacking southward.<br />
Today, those constraints no longer exist. There are certainly still constraints — neither the United States nor China wants war on the peninsula.

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">But in Beijing, both Chinese and American officials and analysts have another explanation: the long silence epitomizes the speed with which relations between Washington and Beijing have plunged into a freeze. This year has witnessed the longest period of tension between the two capitals in a decade. And if anything, both sides appear to be hardening their positions.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">“The issues that used to be on the positive side of the ledger are increasingly on the negative side of the ledger, </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">starting with North Korea</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">,” Bonnie Glaser, a China scholar at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview last week. “I don’t think this is easily repairable, and I think </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">we’re going to have a fairly cold relationship</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: none;"> over the next two years, and potentially longer.”</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Mr. Obama came into office seeking just the opposite: a new rapprochement with a rising power whose deep economic ties with the United States all but demand closer diplomatic ones. But the days when the White House spoke of a “G-2” that would manage the world economy and more, a phrase that preceded the first meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu in the depths of the financial crisis in early 2009, are long over.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Instead, he faces a problem very similar to the one Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton described in March 2009 during a lunch with Kevin Rudd, a China expert who was then Australia’s prime minister, according to a cable recounting their conversation that was in a newly released trove of WikiLeaks documents.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Mrs. Clinton was said to have asked Mr. Rudd, “How do you deal toughly with your banker?”‘</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The latest bad sign is that cooperation on managing North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, which began with considerable promise in 2009, appears to have disintegrated.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">On Monday, Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to convene an emergency meeting in Washington with her Japanese and South Korean counterparts about both the North’s shelling of a South Korean island last month, and its recent disclosure of a new nuclear facility that potentially expands its nuclear arsenal. China, the only nation with real sway over the North Korean leadership, will not be there.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">To the contrary, China’s strategy on North Korea is <strong>at odds with that of Washington</strong> and its allies. In Monday’s telephone call with Mr. Hu, the White House said, Mr. Obama said North Korea’s new enrichment facility flouted commitments it made during the six-party talks on curbing its nuclear program, and urged China’s help in sending “a clear message to North Korea that its provocations are unacceptable.”</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">One former Chinese official with close ties to the government dismissed the American approach last week as characteristically legalistic. The former official, who would not be named because he is not authorized to speak on the topic, said China’s strategy is to reassure the Koreans about their security, not lecture them about diplomatic obligations.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Indeed, China’s strongest public reaction to last month’s shelling of South Korea has not been to condemn the North, <strong>but to criticize Washington’s response</strong> — joint war games with South Korea that put the American carrier George Washington and its strike force in the Yellow Sea, off China’s borders.</span></span><br />

But American <strong>engagement may not be enough</strong>. The PRC could play a particularly important role in dissuading the North from its nuclear course. Indeed, H.D.S. Greenway of the Boston Globe has advocated building on &quot;the new climate of U.S.-Chinese cooperation of late.&quot; 94 Such a strategy would offer at least one additional benefit. Working together to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis successfully would make it easier to <strong>resolve other disputes</strong> between Washington and Beijing, thereby <strong>laying the groundwork for a wide-ranging partnership</strong> in the years and decades ahead.

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Obama administration has explicitly sought to “reset” the relationship with Russia, which had become quite dysfunctional during the final years of the Bush administration. Although Washington has not used the reset terminology with respect to the troubled U.S. relationship with China, the substantive goal appears to be similar.

<em>The evolution of Sino-U.S. relations over the next months, years, and decades has the potential to have a greater impact on global security and prosperity than any other bilateral or multilateral arrangement. In this sense, many analysts consider the US.-China diplomatic relationship to be the most influential in the world. Without question, strong and stable U.S. alliances provide the foundation for the protection and promotion of U.S. and global interests. Yet within that broad framework, the trajectory of U.S.-China relations will determine the success, or failure, of efforts to address the toughest global challenges: global financial stability, energy security and climate change, nonproliferation, and terrorism, among other pressing issues. Shepherding that trajectory in the most constructive direction possible must therefore be a priority for Washington and Beijing. Virtually <strong>no major global challenge can be met without U.S.-China cooperation.</strong> The uncertainty of that future trajectory and the &quot;strategic mistrust&quot; between leaders in Washington and Beijing necessarily concerns many experts and policymakers in both countries. Although some U.S. analysts see China as a strategic competitor—deliberately vying with the United States for energy resources, military superiority, and international political influence alike— analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has generally found that China uses its soft power to pursue its own, largely economic, international agenda primarily to achieve its domestic objectives of economic growth and social stability.1 Although Beijing certainly has an eye on Washington, not all of its actions are undertaken as a counterpoint to the United States. In addition, CSIS research suggests that growing Chinese soft power in developing countries may have influenced recent U.S. decisions to engage more actively and reinvest in soft-power tools that have atrophied during the past decade. To the extent that there exists a competition between the United States and China, therefore, it may be mobilizing both countries to strengthen their ability to solve global problems. To be sure, U.S. and Chinese policy decisions toward the respective other power will be determined in large part by the choices that leaders make about their own nations interests at home and overseas, which in turn are shaped by their respective domestic contexts. Both parties must recognize—and accept—that the other will pursue a foreign policy approach that is in its own national interest. Yet, in a globalized world, challenges are increasingly transnational, and so too must be their solutions. As demonstrated by the rapid spread of SARS from China in 2003, pandemic flu can be spread rapidly through air and via international travel. Dust particulates from Asia settle in Lake Tahoe. An economic downturn in one country can and does trigger an economic slowdown in another. These challenges can no longer be addressed by either containment or isolation. What constitutes the national interest today necessarily encompasses a broader and more complex set of considerations than it did in the past As a general principle, the United States seeks to promote its national interest while it simultaneously pursues what the CSIS Commission on Smart Power called in its November 2007 report the &quot;global good.&quot;3 This approach is not always practical or achievable, of course. But neither is it pure benevolence. Instead, a strategic pursuit of the global good accrues concrete benefits for the United States (and others) in the form of building confidence, legitimacy, and political influence in key countries and regions around the world in ways that enable the United States to better confront global and transnational challenges. In short, the global good comprises those things that all people and governments want but have traditionally not been able to attain in the absence of U.S. leadership. Despite historical, cultural, and political differences between the United States and China, Beijing's newfound ability, owing to its recent economic successes, to contribute to the global good is a matter for common ground between the two countries. Today there is increasing recognition that no major global challenge can be addressed effectively, much less resolved, without the active engagement of—and cooperation between—the United States and China. The United States and China—the worlds first- and third-largest economies—are inextricably linked, a fact made ever more evident in the midst of the current global financial crisis. Weak demand in both the United States and China, previously the twin engines of global growth, has contributed to the global economic downturn and threatens to ignite simmering trade tensions between the two countries. Nowhere is the interconnectedness of the United States and China more clear than in international finance. China has $2 trillion worth of largely U.S. dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves and is the world's largest holder—by far—of U.S. government debt. Former treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson and others have suggested that the structural imbalances created by this dynamic fueled the current economic crisis. Yet. China will almost certainly be called on to purchase the lion's share of new U.S. debt instruments issued in connection with the U.S. stimulus and recovery package. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's February 23.2009, reassurance to Beijing that U.S. markets remain safe and her call for continued Chinese investment in the U.S. bond market as a means to help both countries, and the world, emerge from global recession underscored the shared interest—and central role—that both countries have in turning around the global economy quickly. Although China's considerable holdings of U.S. debt have been seen as a troubling problem, they are now being perceived as a necessary part of a global solution. Similarly, as the worlds two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and the United States share not only the collateral damage of energy-inefficient economic growth, but a primary responsibility to shape any ultimate global solutions to climate change. To date, cooperation has been elusive, owing as much to Washington's reluctance as to Beijing's intransigence. Painting China as the environmental bogeyman as an excuse for foot-dragging in policymaking is no longer an option; for its part, China, as the world's top polluter, must cease playing the developing-economy card. Yet energy security and climate change remain an area of genuine opportunity for joint achievement. Indeed, U.S.-China cooperation in this field is a sine qua non of any response to the energy and climate challenges. The sheer size of the Chinese economy means that collaboration with the United States could set the de facto global standards for etficiency and emissions in key economic sectors such as industry and transportation. Climate change also provides an area for cooperation in previously uncharted policy waters, as in emerging Arctic navigational and energy exploration opportunities. Washington and Beijing also share a deep and urgent interest in international peace and stability. The resumption of U.S.-China military contacts is a positive development. As two nuclear powers with worldwide economic and strategic interests, both countries want to minimize instability and enhance maritime security, as seen by parallel antipiracy missions in the waters otT Somalia. Joint efforts in support of United Nations peacekeeping, nonproliferation, and counterterrorism offer critical areas for bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Certainly, regional and global security institutions such as the Six-Party Talks concerning North Korea or the UN Security Council require the active engagement of both Washington and Beijing. Even more broadly, crisis management in geographic regions of mutual strategic interest like the Korean peninsula, Iran, or Burma require much more Sino-U.S. communication if the two countries are to avoid miscalculation and maximize opportunities to minimize human sutfering. Increasing the number of mid-level military-to-military exchanges would help in this regard. The United States and China could do more to cooperate on law enforcement to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in Western China. Afghanistan is competing with Burma as the main provider of narcotics to China; Washington could use its influence with the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul to develop a joint antinarcotics program. This could potentially build networks and joint capabilities that might be useful for U.S.-China cooperation on the issue of Pakistan. In addition, Washington should also encourage NATO-China cooperation along the Afghan border. Collaborating under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) might provide an additional framework for Beijing and Washington to address Central Asian security issues in a cooperative manner. 1he SCO, which includes Pakistan as an observer and will convene a multinational conference on Afghanistan in March 2009, has long made curbing narcoterrorism in Afghanistan a priority. In addition, the VS. Drug Enforcement Agency and the Chinese Anti-Narcotics Bureau should expand cooperation on interdiction and prosecution of heroin and meth traffickers. To be sure, there are a number of areas of serious divergence between Washington and Beijing. This should surprise no one. The United States has disagreements with even its allies. Two large powers with vastly dilferent histories, cultures, and political systems are bound to have challenges. History has shown, however, that the most effective way of addressing issues is for the U.S. and Chinese governments to engage in quiet diplomacy rather than public recrimination. In the U.S.-China context, there is often little to be gained—and much to be lost in terms of trust and respect—by a polarizing debate. Any differences, moreover, must not necessarily impede Sino-U.S. cooperation when both sides share strong mutual interests. I;. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that &quot;the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.&quot;3 Effective policy toward China by the United States, and vice versa, will require this kind of dual-minded intelligence. Moreover, working together on areas of mutual and global interest will help promote strategic trust between China and the United States, facilitating possible cooperation in other areas. Even limited cooperation on specific areas will help construct additional mechanisms for bilateral communication on issues of irreconcilable disagreement. In fact, many of the toughest challenges in U.S.-China relations in recent years have been the result of unforeseen events, such as the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999 and the EP-3 reconnaissance plane collision in April 2001. Building trust and finding workable solutions to tough problems is the premise behind the Obama administrations foreign policy of smart power, as articulated by Secretary of State Clinton. Smart power is based on, as Secretary Clinton outlined in her confirmation hearing, the fundamental belief that 'We must use... the full range of tools at our disposal—diplomatic, economic, military, political and cultural—picking the right tool, or combination of tools, for each situation.&quot;' As the CS1S Commission on Smart Power noted in November 2007, &quot;Smart Power is neither hard nor soft—it is the skillful combination of bothIt is an approach that underscores the necessity of a strong military, but also invests heavily in alliances, partnerships and institutions at all levels... .°5 As such, smart power necessarily mandates a major investment in a U.S.-China partnership on key issues. 'The concept enjoys broad support among the Chinese and American people and, by promoting the global good, it reaps concrete results around the world. There should be no expectation that Washington and Beijing will or should agree on all, or even most, questions. But the American and Chinese people should expect their leaders to come together on those vital issues that require their cooperation. U.S.-China partnership, though not inevitable, is indispensable.</em><br />

<em>Chapter 1 of the report provides a primer on two topics: climate change and U.S.-China relations. It describes the climate change threat, concluding that every year of delay in responding to it puts both countries—and the planet—at greater risk. Because the United States and China are the world’s top two greenhouse gas emitters, together accounting for more than 40% of annual emissions, <strong>any solution requires both countries</strong> to transition to low-carbon economies.

<em>In 2004, Stephen Pacala and Robert Socolow at Princeton Uni­versity published an article in</em> Science <em>that showed how annual carbon emissions from fossil fuels could be held at 7 billion tons instead of rising to 14 billion tons over the next 50 years, as would occur with business as usual. The goal of Pacala, an ecol­ogist, and Socolow, an engineer, was to prevent atmospheric CO2 concentrations, then near 375 ppm, from rising above 500 ppm. They described</em> IS <em>ways, all using proven technologies, that by</em> 20S4// could each cut carbon emissions by 1 billion tons per year. Any seven of these options could be used together to pre­vent an increase in carbon emissions through 2054. Pacala and Socolow further theorize that advancing technology would allow for annual carbon emissions to be cut to 2 billion tons by 2104, a level that can be absorbed by natural carbon sinks in land and oceans. The Pacala/Socolow conceptualization has been extraordi­narily useful in helping to think about how to cut carbon emis­sions. During the three years since the article was written, the urgency of acting quickly and on a much larger scale has become obvious. We also need now to go beyond the conceptu­al approach that treats all potential methods of reducing carbon emissions equally and concentrate on those that are most prom­ising. Researchers such as James Hansen, a leading climate scien­tist at NASA, believe that global warming is accelerating and may be <strong>approaching a tipping point,</strong> a point at which climate change acquires a momentum that makes it irreversible. They think we may have a decade to turn the situation around before this threshold is crossed. I agree.?3 We often hear descriptions of what we need to do in the decades ahead or by 2050 to avoid &quot;dangerous climate change,&quot; but we are already facing this. Two thirds of the glaciers that feed the Yellow and Yangtze rivers of China will disappear by 2060 if even the current 7 percent annual rate of melting con­tinues. Glaciologists report that the Gangotri glacier, which supplies 70 percent of the ice melt that feeds the Ganges River during the dry season, could disappear entirely in a matter of decades.74 What could <strong>threaten world food security</strong> more than the melt­ing of the glaciers that feed the major rivers of Asia during the dry season, the rivers that irrigate the region's rice and wheat fields? In a region with half the world's people, this potential loss of water during the dry season could lead not just to hunger but to starvation on an unimaginable scale. Asian food security would take a second hit because its rice­-growing river deltas and floodplains would be under water. The World Bank tells us that a sea level rise of only 1 meter would inundate half of the riceland in Bangladesh. While a 1-meter rise in sea level will not happen overnight, what is worrisome is that if ice melting continues at today's rates, at some point such a rise in sea level will no longer be preventable. The melting that would cause this is not just what may happen if the earth's tem­perature rises further; this is something that is starting to hap­pen right now with the current temperature. As summer neared an end in 2007, reports from Greenland indicated that the flow of glaciers into the sea had accelerated beyond anything glaciologists had thought possible. Huge chunks of ice weighing several billion tons each were breaking off and sliding into the sea, causing minor earthquakes as they did so.!6 With melt-water lubricating the surface between the glaciers and the rocks on which they rested, ice flows were accelerating, flowing into the ocean at a pace of 2 meters an hour. This accel­erated flow, along with the earthquakes, shows the potential for the entire ice sheet to break up and collapse?? Beyond what is already happening, the world faces a risk that some of the feedback mechanisms will begin to kick in, fur­ther accelerating the warming process. Scientists who once thought that the Arctic Ocean could be free of ice during the summer by 2100 now see it occurring by 2030. Even this could turn out to be a conservative estimate.78 This is of particular concern to scientists because of the albedo effect, where the replacement of highly reflective sea ice with darker open water greatly increases heat absorbed from sunlight. This, of course, has the potential to further accelerate the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. A second feedback loop of concern is the melting of per­mafrost. This would release billions of tons of carbon, some as methane, a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming effect per ton 25 times that of carbon dioxide.79 The risk facing humanity is that <strong>climate change could spiral out of control</strong> and it will no longer be possible to arrest trends such as ice melting and rising sea level. At this point, the future of civilization would be at risk<strong>.</strong> This combination of melting glaciers, rising seas, and their effects on food security and low-lying coastal cities could over­whelm the capacity of governments to cope. Today it is largely weak states that begin to deteriorate under the pressures of mounting environmental stresses. But the changes just described could overwhelm <strong>even the strongest of states.</strong> Civilization itself could begin to unravel under these extreme stresses.<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The tilt away from the Six Party Talks structure including China </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">to a strengthened ROK-USA security condominium</span></strong> <span style="text-decoration: none;">is a signal that a Western response to instability on the peninsula, be it from &quot;provocations&quot; or the demise of Kim Jung Il, </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">will not include China as an equal partner</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The U.S. media has largely ignored the vitriolic response in the Chinese press to America's military moves, but the Chinese clearly see that the pendulum has swung away from stability--with the U.S. presence precluding a rush to rearmament by Japan---</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">to containment.</span></strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Containment, to China, implies that the U.S. will continue to fan fears of China's military ambitions to encourage the rise of India and the the creation of pro-American governments and policies throughout Asia and turn a blind eye or, even worse, extend an enabling hand to Asian states that develop adventurist ambitions in challenging China on the issue of the uninhabited but contested islands that dot the region.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">I guess we'll find out if the Obama administration has a long-term plan sees an upside in a near-open breach of relations with China beyond giving the opportunity for the U.S. to play to its military strength in Asia and cooperate with local political leaders like <strong>South Korea's Lee Myung-bak, who want to use Washington as a counterweight to Beijing.</strong> </span></span><br />
<strong>Containment causes a self-fulfilling prophecy that guarantees war throughout Asia</strong><br />

Accompanying all these diplomatic initiatives has been a vigorous, if largely unheralded, effort by the Department of Defense (DoD) to bolster US military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. The broad sweep of US strategy was first spelled out in the Pentagon's most recent policy assessment, the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), released on February 5. In discussing long-term threats to US security, the QDR begins with a reaffirmation of the overarching precept first articulated in the DPG of 1992: that the United States will not allow the rise of a competing superpower. This country &quot;will attempt to dissuade any military competitor from developing disruptive or other capabilities that could enable regional hegemony or hostile action against the United States&quot;, the document states. It then identifies <span class="il">China</span> as the most likely and dangerous competitor of this sort. &quot;Of the major and emerging powers, <span class="il">China</span> has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States and field disruptive military technologies that could over time offset traditional US military advantages&quot; - then adding the kicker - &quot;absent US counter-strategies.&quot; According to the Pentagon, the task of countering future Chinese military capabilities largely entails the development, and then procurement, of major weapons systems that would ensure US success in any full-scale military confrontation. &quot;The United States will develop capabilities that would present any adversary with complex and multidimensional challenges and complicate its offensive planning efforts,&quot; the QDR explains. These include the steady enhancement of such &quot;enduring US advantages&quot; as &quot;long-range strike, stealth, operational maneuver and sustainment of air, sea and ground forces at strategic distances, air dominance, and undersea warfare&quot;. Preparing for <span class="il">war</span> with <span class="il">China</span>, in other words, is to be the future cash cow for the giant US weapons-making corporations in the military-industrial complex. It will, for instance, be the primary justification for the acquisition of costly new weapons systems such as the F-22A Raptor fighter, the multi-service Joint Strike Fighter, the DDX destroyer, the Virginia-class nuclear attack submarine, and a new intercontinental penetrating bomber - weapons that would just have utility in an all-out encounter with another great-power adversary of a sort that only <span class="il">China</span> might someday become. In addition to these weapons programs, the QDR also calls for a stiffening of present US combat forces in Asia and the Pacific, with a particular emphasis on the US Navy (the arm of the military least used in the ongoing occupation of and <span class="il">war</span> in Iraq). &quot;The fleet will have a greater presence in the Pacific Ocean,&quot; the document notes. To achieve this, &quot;The navy plans to adjust its force posture and basing to provide at least six operationally available and sustainable [aircraft] carriers and 60% of its submarines in the Pacific to support engagement, presence and deterrence.&quot; Since each of these carriers is, in fact, but the core of a large array of support ships and protective aircraft, this move is sure to entail a truly vast buildup of US naval capabilities in the Western Pacific and will certainly necessitate a substantial expansion of the US basing complex in the region - a requirement that is already receiving close attention from Admiral Fallon and his staff at PACOM. To assess the operational demands of this buildup, moreover, this summer the US Navy will conduct its most extensive military maneuvers in the Western Pacific since the end of the Vietnam <span class="il">War</span>, with four aircraft-carrier battle groups and many support ships expected to participate. Add all of this together, and the resulting strategy cannot be viewed as anything but a systematic campaign of containment. No high administration official may say this in so many words, but it is impossible to interpret the recent moves of Rice and Rumsfeld in any other manner. From Beijing's perspective, the reality must be unmistakable: a steady buildup of US military power along <span class="il">China</span>'s eastern, southern and western boundaries. How will <span class="il">China</span> respond to this threat? For now, it appears to be relying on charm and the conspicuous blandishment of economic benefits to loosen Australian, South Korean, and even Indian ties with the United States. To a certain extent, this strategy is meeting with success, as these countries seek to profit from the extraordinary economic boom now under way in <span class="il">China</span> - fueled to a considerable extent by oil, gas, iron, timber, and other materials supplied by <span class="il">China</span>'s neighbors in Asia. A version of this strategy is also being employed by President Hu Jintao during his current visit to the United States. As <span class="il">China</span>'s money is sprinkled liberally among such influential firms as Boeing and Microsoft, Hu is reminding the corporate wing of the Republican Party that there are vast economic benefits still to be had by pursuing a non-threatening stance toward <span class="il">China</span>. <span class="il">China</span>, however, has always responded to perceived threats of encirclement in <strong>a vigorous and muscular fashion</strong> as well, and so we should assume that Beijing will balance all that charm with a military buildup of its own. Such a drive will not bring <span class="il">China</span> to the brink of military equality with the United States - that is not a condition it can realistically aspire to over the next few decades. But it will provide further justification for those in the United States who seek to accelerate the containment of <span class="il">China</span>, and so will <strong>produce a self-fulfilling loop of distrust, competition and crisis.</strong> This will make <strong>the amicable long-term settlement of the Taiwan problem</strong> and of North Korea's nuclear program that much more difficult, and increase <strong>the risk of unintended escalation to full-scale <span class="il">war</span> in Asia</strong>. There can be no victors from such a conflagration.<br />
<strong>U.S. influence is ineffective and dead – arms races are inevitable now – the advantages solve</strong><br />
<strong>Dyer 12/15</strong>—retired US Naval intelligence officer who served around the world, afloat and ashore, from 1983 to 2004 (J. E., 15 December 2010, “Hot Times in the Far East”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/j-e-dyer/384331" rel="nofollow">http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/j-e-dyer/384331</a>, RBatra)<br />
Japan’s announcements on defense this month figure collectively as the augury of a seminal shift. It’s not all that unusual for Tokyo to announce an increase in the size of the Japan Self-Defense Force (JSDF). But the reason invoked on this occasion amounts to <strong>a crack in the foundation of the U.S.-guaranteed security regime</strong> in the Far East. Japan plans to reorient its defense policy toward the emerging threat from China — and plans, in general, to defend its interests against Chinese and North Korean threats<br />
more proactively than at any time since 1945.<br />
<strong>The Japanese will officially abandon the Cold War–era “basic defense doctrine,”</strong> which provided for territorial defense but not for the projection of military power beyond Japan’s recognized borders. Besides adding more submarines to the fleet, they will look at a military build-up in the southern chain of Japanese islands, near the Senkaku archipelago disputed with China. And on Sunday, Prime Minister Naoto Kan startled South Koreans by telling an audience that Japan would consider changing JSDF policy to allow for the deploying of troops to South Korea to rescue Japanese citizens.<br />
The point here is not that any such move by Japan is suspicious. The point is that Japan perceives the need for a new, more active security posture. The tacit U.S. guarantee since World War II has been a balance in the Far East: the three great powers there — Russia, China, and Japan — held in check with a network of alliances and military presence. <strong>In the past two decades, however, the U.S. has failed to effectively counter what are arguably the most important threats to stability in the region: Chinese maritime aggression and the North Korean nuclear-weapons program</strong>. Against that backdrop, the Obama administration’s determined reliance on China to deal with North Korea looks — from the Asian side of the Pacific — like ceding China too much power. If America will not broker a balanced stasis, <strong>Russia and China will arm themselves for emerging opportunities, and everyone else will follow suit.</strong><br />
Meanwhile, Russia is probing and making shows of force wherever possible. The intrusion of Russian patrol aircraft in the naval exercise held by the U.S. and Japan last week was remarkable for the fact that it was an actual intrusion. Military aircraft monitor foreign exercises all the time, but usually from a distance. The Russian planes approached so closely last week that the exercise was suspended while fighters were scrambled to intercept them.<br />
The Nixon administration concluded a 1972 agreement with Soviet Russia to avoid such provocations in air and naval activity. Indeed, it was Nixon who, during the same period, re-established relations with China, returned Okinawa to Japan, and signed landmark defense agreements with Thailand and the Philippines. He hoped that these measures, desirable in their own right, would contribute to an environment of stabilized tension in which the two Vietnams could coexist. Although the hopes for Vietnam were dashed, his larger arrangements have stood for nearly 40 years. But they will not last much longer. The older pattern that obtains in the absence of U.S. power is reasserting itself.<br />
1AC South Korea<br />
<strong>Advantage Three: South Korea</strong><br />
<strong>Continuing the status quo will crush South Korea independence—U.S. military posture guarantees Korea gets drawn into wars</strong><br />
<strong>Bandow 10</strong>—senior fellow at the Cato Institute and former Special Assistant to Reagan (Doug, 14 July 2010, The U.S.-South Korea Alliance: Outdated, Unnecessary, and Dangerous, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/fpbriefs/fpb90.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pubs/fpbriefs/fpb90.pdf</a>, p. 3-4, RBatra)<br />
Throughout the controversy Seoul has consulted closely with Washington, as one would expect of alliance partners. The mutual defense treaty was negotiated in 1953, supposedly to make both the United States and the ROK more secure. Today, however, the alliance makes it more difficult for both countries to protect their interests when they see their interests differently.<br />
South Korea is the most obvious beneficiary of the security relationship. However, when the South places its defense in Washington’s hands it also places decisions over its defense in Washington’s hands. That arrangement worked well for Seoul in the past, when the ROK could not survive independently of the United States. It will work far less well in the future, when the two nations’ preferred policies are likely to increasingly differ.<br />
After the Cheonan sinking, the Obama administration reportedly urged caution and restraint on Seoul. Such a posture was inevitable since the United States, with much of its military tied down in Afghanistan and Iraq, could ill afford another war. From Washington’s standpoint the Obama administration had reason to insist on a peaceful response. It would be folly for the United States to go to war over the sinking of the Cheonan.<br />
It didn’t matter that the act was criminal; it didn’t matter that the deaths have greatly pained South Koreans; it didn’t matter that Seoul might calculate the costs and benefits of a tough response differently. Washington’s top priority is avoiding another conflict, one that likely would be costly, brutal, and bloody—and of no conceivable benefit to Americans.<br />
Of course, the ROK has even greater reason to avoid war—its territory would be the battlefield. A number of South Koreans also appear to retain some sympathy for the North, despite its dismal record on human rights and most other issues.9 In fact, polls taken after the incident show that a majority of South Koreans oppose military retaliation. 10 Moreover, some analysts point to evidence of regime weakness in North Korea.11 That preserves the hope, so far forlorn, of a peaceful collapse of the Kim regime.<br />
Nevertheless, the Seoul government could have reasonably believed that a larger conflict would ultimately become more likely if it did not respond militarily to the Cheonan sinking; to exhibit weakness in the face of the North’s provocation could be more dangerous than a continued downward spiral in relations. If the Kim regime believed that the South would again give way, even after the sinking of a South Korean warship, Pyongyang might be tempted to stage additional and more dangerous military strikes. The risk of war would rise even more if the Kim regime found itself in crisis and various factions battled for control. Although risky, there were numerous retaliatory options—seizing North Korean merchant vessels and bombing a North Korean naval installation are two obvious alternatives.<br />
Obviously, Seoul could decide that a military counter-strike would not be the best or even good policy. However, the alliance discouraged the ROK from considering such an approach even if the South Korean government and people had believed military retaliation to be the best policy. In effect, where the positions diverge between the two countries, decisions over South Korea’s security will still be made in Washington, not Seoul.<br />
The unhealthy patron-client relationship that has developed has another insidious impact on the South. The ROK risks being drawn into conflicts caused by the United States—such as the Clinton administration’s threat to attack North Korea in order to destroy the latter’s nuclear program, the Bush administration’s pressure for assistance in Afghanistan and Iraq, and a future administration’s possible desire to use the ROK as a base of operations against other nations, most likely China.12 Today Seoul faces <strong>painful humiliation at best</strong> and destructive war at worst as a result of decisions made by the U.S. government.<br />
<strong>South Korea is perceived as dependent – makes foreign policy leadership impossible</strong><br />
<span class="Heading2Char">Bandow 98</span> (Doug, Senior Fellow – Cato Institute and Robert A. Taft Fellow – American Conservative Defense Alliance, “America’s Obsolete Korean Commitment”, Orbis, 42(4), Fall, Ebsco)<br />
Are there risks from American disengagement from Korea and ultimately East Asia? Of course -anything is possible, however unlikely. As historian William Stueck observes, the original Korean war was “laden with miscalculation on all sides.“31 But that <span class="Heading3Char">record is all the more reason to disengage</span>. Mistakes were made between 1945 and 1950 that gave Americans little choice but to fight another war less than five years after the end of World War II. With the end of the Cold War, however, Washington need no longer bear the burden of other nations’ mistakes. In turn, South Korea and its neighbors would no longer have to help pay for America’s mistakes. The ROK and Japan, in particular, should ponder carefully the costs of their continuing security dependence on Big Brother. The first is the negative social impact, exemplified by the 1995 subway brawl in South Korea and rape in Okinawa involving American servicemen. Washington is used to having other nations treat its troops as occupying heroes, but tens of thousands of young American soldiers are not always going to act like gentlemen sensitive to a foreign culture. <span class="Heading3Char">The second is the question of respect accorded other nations, particularly the ROK</span>. “Most people in <span class="Heading3Char">South Korea</span> are beginning to feel more prestigious and self-confident,” says newspaper columnist Kil Jeong Woo. “These kinds of things should be respected by our American friends, not ignored.“32 But <span class="Heading3Char">they will be ignored so long as the South relies on what amounts to U.S. military charity</span>. <span class="Heading3Char">This issue may have consequences beyond simply wounding the national ego of its allies</span>. While Washington is generally benevolent, there is no reason to expect it to put anyone else’s interest before its own. Nor is this ever likely to change: <span class="Heading3Char">the U</span>nited <span class="Heading3Char">S</span>tates <span class="Heading3Char">has yet to establish a security partnership among equals</span>. As Ted Galen Carpenter puts it, “It is not in the best interest of the South Korean people for the ROK to have its national survival in the hands of decision makers in Washington.“33 Conclusion Americans will stay as long as South Koreans want us, according to the manna chanted by successive American presidents and defense secretaries. But such a policy makes no sense, even for Seoul. Indeed, the ROK’s Ministry of National Defense has acknowledged the importance of developing “a future oriented defense policy in preparation for the twenty-first century and the post-unification era.” <span class="Heading3Char">As South Korea emerges as a significant international player in economic and political terms, it needs to begin playing an equally influential and independent military role as well</span>. <br />
<strong>Perception of independence is key to effective South Korean diplomacy – solves extinction</strong><br />
<span class="Heading2Char">Robertson 8</span> (Jeffrey, Trade Research Specialist with the Foreign Affairs, Defence, and Trade Group – Australian Parliamentary Information and Research Service, “Middle Power: A New Strategy for Korea?”, Korea Herald, 3-28, Lexis)<br />
However, increasingly common definitions of <span class="Heading3Char">what constitutes a middle-power focus</span> not solely upon measurements of capacity, but also <span class="Heading3Char">on foreign policy behavior</span>. Once states attain a middle-power status in capacity terms, their foreign policy behavior is thought to evolve toward a distinct form of &quot;middle-power diplomacy&quot; or &quot;middlepowermanship.&quot; <span class="Heading3Char">Middle-power diplomacy is</span> marked by the tendency <span class="Heading3Char">to seek compromise in international disputes</span>, <span class="Heading3Char">to seek multilateral solutions to global issues and to demonstrate &quot;good international citizenship.&quot;</span> Reflecting its status as a middle-power in terms of capacity measurements, it could be expected that South Korea would begin to demonstrate middle-power foreign policy behavior. Accordingly, a new national strategy for Korea could well be the pursuit of middlepowermanship. What is a middle-power foreign policy? The tendency to seek compromise in international disputes, to seek multilateral solutions to global issues and to demonstrate good international citizenship revolve around the status quo. The central aim of any middle-power is to ensure the maintenance of the status quo, and in doing so, maintain its comfortable position in the upper echelons of the international hierarchy of states. Essentially, they seek to maintain the existing international order so that they may continue to derive benefit from entrenched inequalities in power and wealth. <span class="Heading3Char">South Korea has already demonstrated a tendency toward this</span>. During the late 1990s, with the collapse of the North Korean economy and uncertainty regarding its leadership transition, South Korea had the greatest potential to topple North Korea in the history of the peninsula's division. Despite this, South Korea sought to maintain the status quo. The Sunshine Policy with its key principles of coexistence and rejection of attempts to absorb or forcefully unify the peninsula was welcomed by a South Korean population accustomed to an advanced level of economic development and aware of the risk that change represented. The Sunshine Policy demonstrated a vested interest in both compromise and in the maintenance of the status quo. Middlepowermanship, however, goes further than just a preference for the status quo. <span class="Heading3Char">Middle-powers</span> must ensure that there are tools to maintain the status quo. They <span class="Heading3Char">have a strong stake in a rules-based international order</span>. Multilateralism is the middle-power's best friend. In multilateral forums <span class="Heading3Char">middle-powers can engage</span> with <span class="Heading3Char">lesser powers to constrain</span> the <span class="Heading3Char">actions</span> of major powers, <span class="Heading3Char">and</span> equally, they can <span class="Heading3Char">engage with major powers to ensure lesser powers do not upset the existing hierarchy</span>. <span class="Heading3Char">Whether it is in trade at the W</span>orld <span class="Heading3Char">T</span>rade <span class="Heading3Char">O</span>rganization, <span class="Heading3Char">arms control at the U</span>nited <span class="Heading3Char">N</span>ations <span class="Heading3Char">or economics at the OECD</span>, <span class="Heading3Char">the ability</span> of middle-powers <span class="Heading3Char">to achieve a favorable diplomatic outcome is greatly enhanced by multilateralism</span>. Middle-powers can achieve more in a multilateral setting than could possibly be achieved in a bilateral setting. <span class="Heading3Char">South Korea is yet to fully explore the potential that multilateralism holds for a middle-power</span>. Reflecting its history, the young South Korea did not have a chance to mold multilateralism as more established middle-powers did, but rather was molded by multilateralism. During the Cold War, its position at the frontline and its contested legitimacy as the representative of the Korean peninsula, severely constrained South Korean participation in multilateralism. While the Cold War is long past, to this day, there remains a certain level of cynicism regarding multilateralism in South Korea. Other more established middle-powers are marked by their active use of multilateralism to further diplomatic aims. <span class="Heading3Char">The classic example is Australia at the WTO</span>. After years of seeking adjustments to European Union and United States agricultural support in a bilateral context, Australia launched a campaign at the multilateral level, in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the forerunner of the WTO. Through active coalition building, Australia was instrumental in the creation of the Cairns Group - a coalition of 17 agricultural exporting states. As leader of the Cairns Group, Australia pushed its diplomatic agenda at a level that would have been impossible in a bilateral context. The Cairns Group allowed Australia access to high level meetings and greatly enhanced its negotiating position vis-a-vis its old negotiating foes in agricultural liberalization, the European Union and the United States. <span class="Heading3Char">Today, South Korea has the potential to play a much larger role in multilateral forums than ever before</span>. <span class="Heading3Char">As a middle-power with a substantial diplomatic capacity</span> (and a former foreign minister at the helm of the United Nations) <span class="Heading3Char">South Korea could play a much larger role</span>. Indeed, as a middle-power, it should. To strengthen multilateralism, middle-powers must also make commitments that sometimes seem less self-interested. <span class="Heading3Char">Middle-powers must adhere to</span> what former Australian Foreign Minister and current President of the International Crisis Group, Gareth Evans, coined <span class="Heading3Char">good international citizenship</span>. <span class="Heading3Char">This includes strengthening rules-based regimes, such as nonproliferation controls</span>, <span class="Heading3Char">environmental protection and human rights</span>, <span class="Heading3Char">and also increasing cooperation to tackle pandemics</span>, <span class="Heading3Char">transnational crime and terrorism</span>. Essentially, good international citizenship is a recognition of the interdependence between states and the need to address global problems in collaboration. Middle-powers also serve their own self-interest in promoting good international citizenship. By making commitments to peace-keeping, humanitarian operations, leading forums on tackling AIDS or combating environmental degradation, middle-powers gain credibility. <span class="Heading3Char">Middle-powers need to be viewed as credible and independent actors in international affairs in order to strengthen their capacity to build coalitions and wage successful diplomatic campaigns</span>. Middle-power challenges in Korea There are notable challenges to the pursuit of a middle-power <span class="term">foreign policy</span> in <span class="term">South Korea.</span> Firstly, reflecting its historical background, <span class="Heading3Char">South Korea often falls victim</span> to an internal policy debate between &quot;<span class="term">independence</span>&quot; and <span class="Heading3Char">&quot;reliance&quot;</span> that <span class="Heading3Char">can constrain its foreign policy choices</span>. Since its emergence as a modern state, <span class="Heading3Char">Korean foreign policy debate has centered on the question of independence versus reliance</span>. A long time before the terms &quot;sadaejuui&quot; (reliance on a greater power) and &quot;juche&quot; (self-reliance) were corrupted by communist propaganda, these and other analogous terms framed the nationalist debate on how Korea should develop and modernize, and what role it should play in the region. Indeed, the debate between independence and reliance continues in contemporary South Korean politics, as can be seen in the clash of <span class="term">foreign policy</span> aims between former President Roh Moo-hyun and current President Lee-Myung-bak. However, the question of <span class="term">independence</span> versus reliance constrains South Korean <span class="term">foreign policy.</span> In <span class="term">South Korea,</span> as a result of the security situation on the peninsula, <span class="term">independence</span> versus reliance is often framed as a debate between extremes and is further muddied by ideological overtones. This constrains <span class="term">South Korea's</span> capacity to use reliance and <span class="term">independence</span> as a means to achieve diplomatic aims.<br />

 Contention One: North Korea<br />
<br />
U.S. deterrence in Korea fails and only provokes the North. The root cause of all prior attacks as well as North Korean prolif is U.S. hostile policy. Only troop withdrawal prevents war with North Korea and China.<br />
Beal 12/13—Senior Lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington and the editor of The Pyongyang Report, PhD in China’s terms of trade, MA with Honors in modern Chinese studies (Tim, 13 December 2010, “A Second Korean War would become a Sino-American War”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4013:http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1012/S00127/a-second-korean-war-would-become-a-sino-american-war.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1012/S00127/a-second-korean-war-would-become-a-sino-american-war.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1012/S00127/a-second-korean-war-would-become-a-sino-american-war.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4013 -->, RBatra)<br />
The US-ROK joint military exercises not merely prepare for a possible invasion of North Korea but they also serve as weapons of attrition. They force North Korea to devote much more of its resources to the military than it would if there were no palpable threat. An important component of the exercise is their element of ambiguity. The Korean People’s Army (KPA) can never be sure when a feint might become the real thing, so every exercise has to be taken very seriously. The translation of this commentary from the Rodong Sinmun on the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises in 2009 may be fractured but the underling fear of attack is clear: The said largest-scale saber rattling kicked off by the U.S. imperialists against the DPRK at a time when their scenario for the second Korean war is at the final stage of completion is a very adventurous and dangerous military provocation that can be seen only on the eve of a war, and this is an undisguised military threat and a sort of declaration of war against the DPRK. No one can vouch that the U.S. imperialist bellicose elements will not ignite a war against the DPRK by surprise while reinforcing armed forces and staging war maneuvers in south Korea and its vicinity as they did in Iraq.[18] It is important to note that the clash at Yeonpyeong Island coincided with a substantial military exercise, the Hoguk (‘Safeguarding the Nation’): North Korea fired the artillery during South Korea’s military drill called the Hoguk Exercise on Nov. 22-30 that involves 70,000 South Korean military troops, 50 warships, 90 helicopters and 500 planes. The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) of U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Seventh Air Force will also participate in the exercise.[19] The scheduled participation of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is particularly significant.[20] The 31st MEU is based in Okinawa and it is America’s ‘forward deployed rapid-response’ unit in East Asia. It trains with the ROK marines practicing beach landings, but its major specialism appears to be urban warfare. [21] One of its possible functions is to mount a commando type raid on the DPRK. A Japanese scholar writing in the authoritative PACNET newsletter of Pacific Forum CSIS (the Honolulu branch of the Washington think tank Center for Strategic and International studies rather gave the game away about the ‘North Korean threat’ by putting it thus: As a collapse of North Korea -- rather than a North Korean invasion of South Korea -- has become a more likely scenario, the 31st MEU can search and seize the North Korean nuclear arsenal, and prevent proliferation of those weapons[22] It is not surprising therefore that the KPA was concerned about the Hoguk exercise and responded to the ROK live firing in line with the ‘zero tolerance’ strategy. However, concerns extend beyond specific military exercises, to the whole policy of building up of tension in preparation for a crisis that would lead to an invasion of the North. The KPA barrage can be seen as a message that an attack would be met by a devastating counteroffensive which would, at the very least, imperil Seoul; it was a reminder that ‘Seoul [is] not safe from artillery attacks’.[23] The DPRK’s ‘zero tolerance’ strategy The DPRK’s ‘zero tolerance’ policy long predates the Lee Myung-bak administration, let alone the present crisis. Basically this strategy is to reiterate than no infringement of DPRK territory will be tolerated, and any intrusion will be met by force. There has been flexibility and restraint in implementing this strategy, especially in respect of the NLL (see below), but the underlying strategic calculation is that any sign of weakness will lead to further US and ROK moves against the DPRK. The case of the US invasion of Iraq is often cited by the North Koreans of the dangers of an appeasement policy. This is often raised in respect of the nuclear deterrent. For instance, Alexander Frolov, writing recently in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs journal International Affairs on lessons from the Iraq war made the point: The leadership in N. Korea also realized that nothing less than a nuclear status can guarantee the country against US aggression. [24] However, the relevance of Iraq to the non-appeasement policy goes beyond developing a nuclear deterrent. For instance, in May 2003 after a breakdown in US-DPRK negotiations, the official Korea Central News Agency (KCNA) in a lengthy statement included a reference to Iraq: On March 20 this year the U.S. provoked a war of aggression against Iraq under the pretext of &quot;finding out weapons of mass destruction&quot; in a bid to topple the Saddam government. The Iraqi war taught the lesson that &quot;nuclear suspicion,&quot; &quot;suspected development of weapons of mass destruction&quot; and suspected &quot;sponsorship of terrorism&quot; touted by the U.S. were all aimed to find a pretext for war and one would fall victim to a war when one meekly responds to the IAEA's inspection for disarmament. Neither strong international public opinion nor big countries' opposition to war nor the UN Charter could prevent the U.S. from launching the Iraqi war. It is a serious lesson the world has drawn from the Iraqi war that a war can be averted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation can be protected only when a country has a physical deterrent force, a strong military deterrent force capable of decisively repelling any attack to be made by any types of sophisticated weapons. The reality indicates that building up a physical deterrent force is urgently required for preventing the outbreak of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring peace and security of the world, now that the U.S. does not show any political intention and will to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK. The DPRK will increase its self-defensive capacity strong enough to destroy aggressors at a single stroke. Any U.S. aerial attack will be decisively countered with aerial attack and its land strategy will be coped with land strategy. [25] In reality, a North Korean counter offensive would not match like with like - ‘aerial attack will be decisively countered with aerial attack and its land strategy will be coped with land strategy.’ The DPRK cannot hope to match US military power (especially in the air) so its offensive would be asymmetrical, drawing on its strengths.[26] It would probably utilise its special forces, submarines, and in particular its artillery[27] As noted, the frequent war exercises, the integration of the ROK military into the US command structure, and the associated operational plans, are seen by the DPRK as very threatening: [The United States] made public &quot;strategic guideline No. 1&quot; in November 1978 and thus officially announced the formation of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; in south Korea. It saw to it that the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; took over the &quot;UN Forces Command's&quot; Operation Control of the U.S. forces in south Korea and puppet army. The organization of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; deepened the military dependence of south Korea on the United States and increased the danger for an outbreak of a new war on the Korean Peninsula. The Team Spirit joint military exercises for invading the north had been escalated as a large-scale war exercises involving huge armed forces over100,000-200,000 strong from 1978. Such joint military exercises as the Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI), Ulji Focus Lens and Foal Eagle have been staged almost every day as planned and directed by the command. The aggressive and bellicose nature of the command has remained unchanged even after the June 15 era [the 2000 North-South summit], a new era of reconciliation and cooperation, was ushered in on the Korean Peninsula. Many war scenarios against the north including &quot;OPLAN 5030&quot;, &quot;New OPLAN 5026&quot; and &quot;OPLAN 8022-02&quot; have been worked out and war exercises to carry them into practice conducted in a more frenzied way. This year the command changed the codenames of the RSOI and Ulji Focus Lens with Key Resolve and Ulji Freedom Guardian and is holding actual maneuvers to hurl U.S. imperialist aggression forces in the mainland and abroad into Korean front. It goes without saying that such war exercises and arms buildup had have negative effect on the north-south relations and chilled the ardent desire for the Korean people for reunification. The south Korean people thus press for the dissolution of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; disturbing peace in Korea and obstructing her reunification. The south Korea-U.S. &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot;, a tool for war of aggression and a source of permanent atmosphere of war and tension on the Korean Peninsula, should be disbanded without delay. [28] The most famous example of the efficacy of the strategy is the reported argument between President Kim Young-sam and President Bill Clinton in 1994. According to Kim, Clinton wanted to bomb the North Korea nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. A 2003 BBC report recounted the tale: &quot;Clinton told me that he would launch an immediate bombardment on the Yongbyon area. Clinton was very determined about it, but I argued to him that such an attack should never take place,&quot; said Mr Kim. &quot;So there was quite an argument between him and me. Sometimes the phone conversations lasted more than 40 minutes,&quot; he said. Mr Clinton first revealed the 1994 plan to attack North Korea last month, but said nothing of the alleged dispute with the South. Mr Kim said that a US attack would have led to a tremendous loss of life, and would have turned Seoul into a &quot;sea of fire&quot;. &quot;Finally I told him that if the United States attacks North Korea, I cannot send one single member of South Korea's 650,000 armed forces into battle.&quot; [29] Kim’s version of events was contradicted by Tong Kim (Kim Dong-hyun) a Korean-American who worked as an interpreter for the State Department for over 30 years. According to him, It simply is not the case [...]. There was no discussion about a possible U.S. attack on North Korea between the two presidents via phone. Such discussions indeed took place between their defense ministers Kwon Young-hae and William Perry with the South Korean minister obviously opposed to the military action.[30] The consequences of a Northern counterattack, and specifically an artillery offense against Seoul, was not the only consideration, although it was the main one. A South Korean simulation exercise predicted that ‘bombing of North Korea’s nuclear facilities could in the worst case make the whole of Korea uninhabitable for a decade’.[31] The bombing of Yongbyon was but one variant of the ‘military option’ that the United States has been examining, albeit the favoured one.[32] The release of radioactivity aside, an US attack would mean war with immense devastation of the Korea peninsula, so it is to be expected that there has been, in the past, opposition across the political spectrum, from progressive President Roh Moo-hyun to conservative legislator Park Jin.[33] The exception to that have been those, such as Lee Myung-bak, who pin their hopes on a collapse that would prevent the North from making a counterattack. This is an ongoing issue but as long as the DPRK functions as a viable state, committed and able, to retaliate, then there will be no attack. Part of the reason for the vigorous response at Yeonpyeong was presumably to demonstrate that the KPA was still in business. The DPRK has been threatened, and blockaded, by the United States for decades, but unlike various other countries, it has not been invaded, or bombed. To that degree the zero-tolerance strategy can be said to work. But it has its disadvantages. It is a high-risk strategy. If there is a miscalculation or a misunderstanding, or ‘maverick’ action by soldiers on the front line, then the situation could rapidly whirl out of control. War would be disastrous for North Korea, despite the brave words. It would have grave consequences for the South, and Japan. If it spread to China the results are incalculable, but it might mean the end of the United States, that ‘fragile empire’ as Niall Ferguson recently termed it.[34] It is a variant of the mutually assured destruction of the Cold War period, a bluff that is effective because it is credible, but a bluff that if put into action would be catastrophic. In this case, the destruction would not be equivalent. The DPRK would suffer more than other countries, but the ROK and the US would suffer unacceptable damage and that could be considered sufficient to keep the peace. The strategy has other disadvantages. It allows the DPRK to be portrayed as belligerent, and certainly the coverage of the Yeonpyeong incident, within South Korea, and internationally has been virtually uniformly hostile. Not everyone has jumped on to the bandwagon and there are those, in particular Korean-Americans, who oppose the drift towards war and call for engagement.[35] But these are only a tiny minority. The strategy also runs counter to the main thrust of DPRK strategy which is to negotiate the United States into accepting peaceful coexistence. Recourse to confrontation, and military action, makes that more difficult to prosecute. Finally, it gives a hostage to fortune. The other side (here South Korea but in other circumstances it could be the US) can construct a provocation knowing that it will trigger a response that can be labelled as belligerent. The trick here is to do something which the DPRK regards as provocative but which can be disguised as normal and legitimate. The military exercises in general fall within this category. For the DPRK (and China) they are intimidating and provocative, but that is not how they are described in the Western media. No doubt if the tables were turned and it was a North Korean carrier stalking up the American coast, perceptions would be different. In the particular case of Yeonpyeong the ROK did something that was portrayed as legitimate and non-threatening but which the DPRK found intolerable. To understand why that was so we must turn to the curious case of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) Northern Limit Line The Northern Limit Line is a very strange beast, as a glance at the map shows (fig 1). Fig 1: Contested seas: The NLL and the MDL 1.Yeonpyeong Island (artillery clash) 2.Baengnyeong Island (Cheonan sinking) 3.Daecheong Island 4. Incheon Airport 5.Seoul 6.Incheon 7.Haeju 8.Kaesong 9.Ganghwa County 10.Bukdo Myeon 11.Deokjeok Myeon 12.Jawol Myeon 13.Yeongheung Myeon On this map #1 indicates Yeonpyeong Island where the artillery clash took place, and #2 Baengnyeong Island, off which the Cheonan sank. The upper(blue) line represents the Northern Limit Line (NLL) and the lower (red) one the West Sea Military Demarcation Line (MDL) claimed by the DPRK. The NLL was unilaterally established by the Americans (officially the United Nations Command) in August 1953.[36] The NLL, instead of striking out directly from the coast at the end of the land Military Demarcation Line (MDL), snakes up the west coast of North Korea, through rice crab fish grounds, and taking in various islands the main three of which are .Yeonpyeong (1) , Baengnyeong (2), and Daecheong (3). It has been argued that it was set up to prevent Southern incursions into Northern waters (Syngman Rhee had not signed the Armistice Agreement and wanted the war to continue), although it would be more plausible to see it also as affording bases for inserting intelligence and commando teams. Be that as it may, by the 1990s commando raids were a thing of the past, and yet the ROK refused to negotiate. This despite two major incidents in 1999 and 2002 which were a distinct threat to the ‘Sunshine Policy of then president Kim Dae-jung.[37] There was a further clash in November 2009 under the presidency of Lee Myung-bak.[38] This 2009 incident may have owed something to the more assertive North Korea policy of the Lee administration.[39] The NLL did not receive much international attention until the Cheonan incident of March 2010. There were a number of reasons for this. Most of the causalities in the past were Northern and so, in the eyes of most of the international media, perhaps warranted less attention. The Cheonan was the largest single disaster for the ROK navy. Many commentators were quick to point out what a dangerous situation the sinking of the Cheonan illustrated. Typical was Nicole Finnegan of the Washington-based Korea Economic Institute: Regardless of what we learn the true cause of the tragedy to be, the sinking of the Cheonan has revived fear and debates on how easily North and South Korea could lurch into war unexpectedly.[40] There is nothing new in these concerns. The NLL by its unilateral nature, its configuration close to the North Korean coast, and running through highly prized crab grounds, is a recipe for conflict. Fishing boats from both South and North sometimes ignore the NLL during the crab season and their respective navies tend to follow them. The NLL is also at variance with the now standard territorial sea limit of 12 nautical miles.[41] Writing in 2002, after the clash of June that year, John Barry Kotch and Michael Abbey, point out that: If the two Koreas are genuinely committed to reconciliation, these differences can be resolved through negotiation, thereby preventing future incidents. A line that was drawn more than a half-century ago for an entirely different purpose should no longer be allowed to fester as a source of conflict, thereby retarding the peace process.[42] The differences were not resolved, so the question is why? If this failure to negotiate a resolution had just occurred during the Lee Myung-bak administration it might not have been surprising. But this was during the time of Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun. It is clear that a resolution would have meant the South abandoning the NLL and agreeing to something approximating the North’s line. It seems extremely unlikely that anyone in the DPRK would have opposed that. Although the NLL was established by the UNC, it appears that it is not longer involved, officially at least. It may well be that unofficially it is very much involved; the relationship between the US and ROK military seems to be unexplored territory. Whatever the role of Americans behind the scenes it seems clear that resolution of the NLL was opposed, successfully, by the ROK military. This opposition presumably was partly due to natural inertia – nobody likes giving up territory – but it must have gone deeper than that. The logical conclusion is that there were strong forces in the ROK political elite, revolving around the military, who wanted to keep the NLL precisely because it would “to fester as a source of conflict, thereby retarding the peace process” Fig 2: measuring policy change: KCNA mentions of the NLL over two administrations All of the previous conflicts around the NLL had been at sea, and the artillery duel at Yeonpyeong was the first one on land. To understand how that came about we must return to the map. It appears that the DPRK acknowledges ROK control over the islands, but claims these are its territorial waters, except for the access channels shown on the map.[43] Whilst the NLL has long been a bone of contention, the situation has greatly worsened since the Lee Myung-bak administration came into office. One rough way of measuring that is to calculate the number of times the official KCNA news agency mentions the North Limit Line. Roh Moo-hyun was in office from 25 February 2003 to 25 February 2008 when Lee Myung-bak took over. Fig 2 shows the monthly average of NLL stories over those two administrations. This is admittedly an imperfect metric but the difference between the two administrations is compelling: under Lee Myung-bak the number of North Korean complaints rose nearly three-fold. In March 2008, for instance, the KPA navy warned: Combined firepower drills for &quot;striking and destroying&quot; warships of the Navy of the Korean People's Army and drills for tactical naval maneuvers are staged on Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong Islets and in waters around them almost everyday. A situation in which an armed conflict may break out any moment is prevailing in the frontline waters in the West Sea due to the reckless military provocations of the south Korean military warmongers. Any attempt on the part of the south Korean military authorities to &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;northern limit line&quot; at any cost would only spark off a clash in the said waters.[44] The following year, as the Lee administration moved to join the US-led Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) the KPA navy issued another warning: 3. For the present, we will not guarantee the legal status of the five islands under the south side's control (Paekryong, Taechong, Sochong, Yonphyong [ and U islands) in our side's territorial waters northwest of the extension of the Military Demarcation Line in the West Sea of Korea and safe sailing of warships of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the south Korean puppet navy and civilian ships operating in the waters around there.[45] The PSI is in many ways similar to the NLL. It is unilateral and illegal. The PSI claims that a set of nations – the US and its clients – are above international law and may stop and search ships on the high seas. Ostensibly this is to stop the shipping of weapons of mass destruction which given the United States pre-eminence in the international arms trade smacks of a certain degree of chutzpah.[46] Indeed, as Hazel Smith has documented, ‘There is little hard evidence that the government of North Korea is involved in the illicit shipping of WMD or components of WMD’.[47] The PSI seems to be really about harassing the DPRK and stoking tension, and that also holds for the NLL. The NLL seems to have been much more successful in attaining these objectives so far than the PSI. The NLL was perhaps only peripheral to the Cheonan incident. True the ship sank in disputed waters, and had the NLL not existed, but the two Koreas had been separated by a mutually agreed maritime border, the sinking would probably not have occurred. It appears that it ran aground in shallow waters and in an attempt to extricate itself was sunk by one of the South’s mines.[48] Nevertheless, the actual sinking of the Cheonan appears to have been an accident; it was the subsequent investigation that was deliberately fraudulent. The Yeonpyeong incident is different in that it occurred because of a deliberate provocation by the South. The artillery duel at Yeonpyeong As to be expected there is much that is uncertain and contested about this incident. But the essentials can be traced. The media tends to give the impression that the North Korean barrage against the marine base on Yeonpyeong island on 23 November came out of the blue, with nothing preceding it. The Chosun Ilbo specifically makes that claim: … the latest artillery bombardment on Yeonpyeong Island came completely out of the blue, and there is no way of telling when, where and how North Korea will strike next.[49] A rather more nuanced version is the Washington Post narrative, with the North launching a barrage and the South responding: North Korea launched a massive artillery barrage on a South Korean island Tuesday, killing two South Korean marines, wounding at least 19 other people and setting more than 60 buildings ablaze in the most serious confrontation since the North's sinking of a South Korean warship in March. South Korea immediately responded with its own artillery fire and put its fighter jets on high alert, bringing the two sides - which technically have remained in a state of war since the Korean armistice in 1953 - close to the brink of a major conflagration[50] No mention here of the South’s arms buildup on the island, the North’s warnings, the provocative nature of the Northern Limit Line, or the threatening military exercises. Back in 2008 the KPA complained about the ROK introducing new weaponry into the NLL islands: They also issued an order to batteries of 155 mm caliber howitzers and various type guided weapons deployed on the above-said five islets to be ready to go into action.[51] The KPA statement also claimed that: Combined firepower drills for &quot;striking and destroying&quot; warships of the Navy of the Korean People's Army and drills for tactical naval maneuvers are staged on Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong Islets and in waters around them [take place] almost everyday. A situation in which an armed conflict may break out any moment is prevailing in the frontline waters in the West Sea due to the reckless military provocations of the south Korean military warmongers. Any attempt on the part of the south Korean military authorities to &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;northern limit line&quot; at any cost would only spark off a clash in the said waters. [52] The live fire drills that the ROK conducted on 23 November were not just artillery practice; they were specifically focussed on possible combat against KPA ships in waters around the island. However, it was the specific contested status of those waters, in a tense situation exacerbated by the military exercises since the Cheonan incident, which sparked the North Korean response. It appears that the North warned the South against the drills, but the warnings were disregarded. The Seoul newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported on 24 November that: North Korea in a telegram on Tuesday morning [23 November] criticized an annual South Korean defense drill now underway. The same afternoon the North Korean military fired on Yeonpyeong Island. An official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, &quot;At around 8:20 am. on Tuesday, North Korea sent a telegram that said they would not sit idly by and watch if South Korea fire at North Korean waters during the military training.&quot; North Korea already criticized the drill on Nov. 17 on the website of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland and again on Monday when the drill began. But the military dismissed North Korea's claims, saying an artillery firing drill by the Marine Corps that took place in Yeonpyeong Island on Tuesday had nothing to do with the annual drill but was a part of monthly training there. Moreover, the drill the North cited as an excuse for the attack is an annual routine drill which has been conducted by the South Korean military since 1996. A spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, &quot;The training was directed at South Korean waters to the southwest of Yeonpyeong Island, and the training site had been announced already through the international network of communication of merchant ships.[53] To say that the marine artillery drills had nothing to do with the Hoguk exercise seems to be a sophism. Moreover, the warnings stretched further back. The information available on the English-language KCNA website is only a portion of the published Korean-language material, and on top of that there are the direct communications between North and South (such as the telegram mentioned above). However, there is enough English-language for us to get a certain picture of preceding events, even though often the English translation is of poor quality.’ Fig3: Smoke from rocket fire over Yeonpyeong island This picture taken on November 23, 2010 by a South Korean tourist shows huge plumes of smoke rising from Yeonpyeong island in the disputed waters of the Yellow Sea on November 23, 2010. North Korea fired dozens of artillery shells onto a South Korean island on November 23, 2010, killing four people, setting homes ablaze and triggering an exchange of fire as the South's military went on top alert. (STR/AFP/Getty Images) On the 4th of June 2010 a Rodong Sinmun editorial headed ‘S. Korean Accused of Dangerous Provocations’ warned that: The puppet military is massively amassing offensive forces in the waters off five islets of the West Sea including Paekryong and Yonphyong [Yeonpyeong] islets while vociferating about &quot;defence of the northern limit line&quot; and ceaselessly infiltrating its warships into the territorial waters of the DPRK for the purpose of sparking off a new armed conflict. It is needless to say that the large-scale &quot;demonstration of military muscle&quot; and war maneuvers taking place under this situation are as dangerous acts as playing with fire by the side of a powder magazine. These moves are, in fact, a prelude to an all-out war. The DPRK loves peace and does not want a war. But it is the DPRK's spirit and mettle to react to fire with fire and punish the provocateurs with a merciless retaliation of justice. If the puppet group finally opts for starting a war of aggression against the DPRK in league with foreign forces, defying its warnings, the group will not be able to escape a thousand-fold indiscriminate retaliatory blow, warns the article. [54] This is a generalised warning about retaliation ‘for starting a war of aggression’ rather than specifically threatening a response to military exercises at Yeonpyeong. ‘Indiscriminate’ in this context presumably means ‘all-out war’. This warning was followed by another on 3 August which specifically threatened retaliation for ‘naval firing maneuvers’ from Yeonpyeong and other islands in the area: The Command of Forces of the Korean People's Army in the western sector of the front issued on Tuesday the following notice in this connection: The naval firing maneuvers to be staged by the above-said warmongers in the waters near Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong islets in August with all ground, naval and submarine attack means involved are not simple drills but undisguised military intrusion into the inviolable territorial waters of the DPRK and reckless politically motivated provocation to preserve the illegal &quot;northern limit line&quot; to the last. …. In view of the prevailing situation, the Command of Forces of the Korean People's Army in the western sector of the front made a decisive resolution to counter the reckless naval firing projected by the group of traitors with strong physical retaliation. …. As regards the expected DPRK's counteraction for self-defence, the command warns in advance all the civilian ships including fishing boats not to enter the theatre of naval firing fixed by the group of traitors in the waters close to the five islets in the West Sea of Korea. It is the unshakable will and steadfast resolution of the army and people of the DPRK to return fire for fire. [55] Whether the ROK marines carried out any firing exercises after that warning is unknown. The Chosun Ilbo report quoted above says the drills were held ‘monthly’ but the [London] Telegraph talks about ‘monthly air raid drills’, so the exercises on 23 November may have been the first since the August threat. The island, lined with tank traps and trenches, and equipped with 19 fully-stocked bomb shelters in which residents conduct monthly air raid drills, is permanently ready for war.[56] The South Koreans admitted carrying live firing exercises on 23 November but justified these by saying they were fired into the sea, away from the direction of the North Korean mainland. There seems no doubt they were firing into the sea (on the technical level it was presumably an anti-ship exercise), though the actual direction of fire is unclear. One report says southward.[57] Another says to the west. [58] Yet another has it to the southwest.[59] In fact, as far as the North was concerned, the direction was irrelevant because in any case the shells landed in their territorial waters. And therein lies the rub. The DPRK argues that if it tolerated the exercise it would be relinquishing its claim to the waters. The enemy fired shells from the islet which is so close to the territory of the DPRK that it is within each other's eyeshot despite the fact that there are so many mountains and rivers, sea waters and islets in south Korea. This powder-reeking saber-rattling cannot be construed otherwise than a politically motivated provocation. The enemy is claiming that they fired shells southward from the islet in a bid not to get on the nerves of the DPRK but Yonphyong Islet is located deep inside the territorial waters of the DPRK away from the maritime military demarcation line. If live shells are fired from the islet, they are bound to drop inside the territorial waters of the DPRK side no matter in which direction they are fired because of such geographical features. The ulterior aim sought by the enemy is to create the impression that the DPRK side recognized the waters off the islet as their &quot;territorial waters&quot;, in case that there was no physical counter-action on the part of the former. Herein lies the crafty and vicious nature of the enemy's provocation. The army of the DPRK took such a self-defensive measure as making a prompt powerful strike at the artillery positions from which the enemy fired the shells as it does not make an empty talk. [emphasis added].[60] As can be seen from the map (fig 1), the DPRK seems to accept ROK control of the island (but not necessarily sovereignty) but it does not recognise any claim over the surrounding sea. It would appear that the DPRK claim to these waters has much to justify it; the Northern Limit Line is manifestly iniquitous; it is unilateral and provocative and should have been abolished years ago. But does that justify the DPRK artillery barrage? An important point here is the number of warnings that were given. We have already quoted the public statements, and mentioned a telegram, but the North also claims it made a telephone call to the South: The south Korean puppet warmongers' firing of shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side in the West Sea of Korea on Nov. 23 was a premeditated and deliberate military provocation from A to Z and a war action in fact. On Nov. 22, the south Korean puppet forces made no scruple of announcing that they would fire shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side with artillery pieces they deployed on Yonphyong Island while staging Hoguk exercises for a war of aggression against the DPRK, straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula. In this connection the DPRK side sent a telephone notice to the south Korean puppet military at 8 a.m. on Nov. 23, strongly urging it to immediately cancel the plan for firing shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side. In the notice the DPRK side seriously warned that if it paid no heed to this demand, it would face a resolute physical counter-strike and would be held fully responsible for all the ensuing consequences.[61] This telephone call, and the previous public warnings, have received very little coverage in the Western media, but there is no doubt that it took place, since it was reported by the Seoul newspaper Korea Herald: In the morning [of the clash], the North sent a telephone message to the South, saying “The North would not just sit back if the South fired shots into the North Korean territorial waters,” according to JCS [South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff] officials.[62] We do not know how explicit that warning was, but since it was a telephone call, the Southern officer could presumably have sought clarification. Moreover, we have other reports that the ROK military was aware that that DPRK had moved artillery into position. This was then followed by practice shooting: A senior military said several hours before the shelling began the North Korean military deployed one battery of six 122-mm MLRS shells and later two batteries of 12 112-mm MLRS shells. It also carried out preparatory shooting practice just before the attack. &quot;As far as I know the South Korean military was aware of this,&quot; he said.[63] It seems fair to assume that the local ROK military commander knew what would happen if the firing exercise went ahead. Whether he relayed this to higher levels and asked for confirmation to go ahead we do not know, but it seems likely. There was no great time pressure and taking action which would result in the first artillery exchange since the Korean War would surely have been referred up to higher levels. The warning/foreknowledge issue become even more convoluted with revelations on 1 December that South Korean intelligence had known since August that the North would respond. The Director of the National Intelligence Service [NIS] gave testimony to a closed-door session of a committee of the National Assembly. Members of the National Assembly Intelligence Committee quoted NIS Director Won Sei-hoon as saying the agency knew from wiretapping that the North Korean regime ordered the military to prepare to attack the five islands in the West Sea. He said the NIS submitted the intelligence report to President Lee Myung-bak.[emphasis added] [64] The phrase ‘prepare to attack’ implies, and is meant to imply, a Northern provocation, an unprovoked assault. In fact, we have from another story a much more plausible phrase: The[Asahi Shimbun]quoted the source, who is familiar with North Korea-China relations, as saying, &quot;Early last month, the North Korean military issued instructions in Kim Jong-un's name to senior military commanders to get ready to counter the enemy's provocations any time.&quot; The source quoted an unnamed North Korean Army officer as commenting on the artillery attack on Yeonpyeong. &quot;It had been planned. We had been preparing for that for a long time.&quot; [emphasis added][65] This countering of what the North regarded as a Southern provocation is consistent with the published and telephone warnings. It gives a quite different take on who was provoking whom. This did not prevent the Chosun Ilbo, which ran the story, from heading it ‘Kim Jong-un 'Ordered Attack in Early November'. Not the first time a newspaper has mendaciously given a headline which is contradicted by the actual story under it. In fact, the Chosun Ilbo, which has a very virulent ideological position, often does it. On 3 December it ran a story about an interview Russian Prime Minister Putin gave in the United States in which it was reported that ‘Putin said that he finds the situation in the Korean Peninsula &quot;very acute and disturbing&quot;’. The headline was ‘N.Korean Attack 'Acute and Disturbing,' Says Putin’. The assertion that the NIS submitted the intelligence report to President Lee Myung-bak has to be taken cautiously. From the public account we do not know whether he was given it personally, and the warning drawn to his attention. It may have just been passed to his office, and he never got to read it. That is a generous interpretation. Whether Lee was aware personally it is clear that the North Korean warning that they would retaliate if the exercises took place was known at the highest levels of the South Korean command. Events of the day The actual sequence of events is more complex than most press reports and commentaries suggest. According to the Korea Herald report the Northern shelling started at 2.34pm, but was perhaps not the ‘massive onslaught’ that it was often called: “As the North fired coastal artillery shells at around 2:34 p.m. into waters off the Yeonpyeong Island as well as on the island, we immediately fired back in full accordance with combat rules,” said Lee Hong-kee, chief director for joint operations at the JCS, in a press briefing. [emphasis added][66] Either the accuracy of the Northern artillery was poor, or firing into the water was deliberate. According to the report, here is the sequence of events After 8.00am and before 2.34 pm South fires into sea 2.34 pm North starts firing into sea (and land?) 2.47 pm South starts firing at Northern coastal batteries – ‘strong, concentrated’ counterattack causing ‘considerable damage’ 2.55 pm North ceases firing 3.11 pm North recommences firing 3.42 pm North ceases firing 3.48 pm South telephones North urging it to stop its ‘provocative acts’ By 9.30 pm 2 marines killed; while six others were seriously injured. Ten other soldiers and three civilians suffered minor injuries This raises some intriguing questions. • Did the North fire simultaneously at the island and into the sea, or did the land fire come later? • Did the North fire onto the island only after the Southern counterattack on its positions? • Why did the South make a telephone call asking the North to stop if it had already done so? • Did the North recommence firing sometime after 3.42 pm? • As of 9.30 pm we have three civilians reported with minor injuries but subsequent reports give two dead. Were the dead amongst these three, or were they discovered later? The ‘fog of war’ no doubt produces confusion but these discrepancies suggest that we have not had the full story by any means. The quite erroneous claim that this was an ‘unprovoked attack’ by the North has been repeated so many times by ROK officials, and by the media, that even liberals such as the American investigative journalist Tim Shorrock have been taken in.[67] The other main canard in the official narrative concerns civilians. The theme is set at the top with statements from Lee Myung-bak. On 29 November he gave a short address to the nation: During a seven-minute speech Lee expressed outrage over the North's ruthless attack on civilians, calling it an &quot;inhumane&quot; crime [emphasis added].[68] Others were more circumspect. A JCS spokesman called the firing ‘indiscriminate’: “This provocation is a premeditated, intentional illegal attack in violation of the U.N. Convention, the Armistice Agreement and the inter-Korean non-aggression accord. It is also an inhumane atrocity, in which it indiscriminately fired shells into unarmed civilian residential areas.”[69] Song Min-soon, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade and currently a Democratic Party (i.e. opposition) member of the National Assembly attacked what he called an: outrageous indiscriminate artillery attack against civilians and military alike.[70] The American liberal John Feffer wrote of a ‘disproportionate response’ which killed ‘two civilians and two soldiers’. [71] Early reports (such as the Korea Herald one above) mention only minor civilian injuries, though they talk of a ’civilian area’: ..killing two South Korean marines, wounding 16 soldiers and three civilians, and damaging homes and facilities. This was the first time since the Korean War that the North has fired artillery shells on a civilian area in South Korea.[72] ‘Civilian area’ is a rather elastic term. Most military bases have civilians living in the vicinity, some more than others. The giant US headquarters in South Korea, Yongsan Garrison occupies 2.5 sq km in the centre of this city of 10 million people; the site was originally developed by the Japanese Imperial Army. By 24 November the casualties changed to four – two military and two civilians. In addition to the two marines killed, the bodies of two men, believed in their 60s, were pulled from a destroyed construction site, the coast guard said. At least 18 people - most of them troops - were injured.[73] It was not stated where this construction site was in relation to the marine camp. If it were on the other side of the island, then that would indicate fire that was either indiscriminate or very inaccurate. If it were close by, or even on the camp, then this would put a different complexion on things. It is clear that the main target was the marine camp, as this quotation from the JCS indicates Many landed on a military camp but others on a civilian village on the island. Flames and thick columns of smoke were seen rising above the village and a nearby mountain. &quot;The North must have carefully premeditated the provocation against the camp,&quot; a JCS officer speculated. [74] Fig 4: Damage at the marine base A K-9 Marine artillery base on Yeonpyeong Island under attack by North Korea on Tuesday /Courtesy of the Ministry of Defense [&quot;N.Korean Shelling 'Aimed for Maximum Damage to Lives, Property'.&quot; Chosun Ilbo, 26 November 2010. The Washington Post went one step further and reported that: Most of the shells landed on a military base on Yeonpyeong island [emphasis added][75] However, most reports either did not mention the marine base, or gave no details. For instance, another Washington Post article talked of ‘civilian-inhabited Yeonpyeong Island’ without any reference to the marine base.[76] In fact the military installations were very significant as a New York Times article makes evident. … [Yeonpyeong Island] houses a garrison of about 1,000 South Korean marines, and the navy has deployed its newest class of “patrol killer” guided-missile ships in the Western Sea, as the Yellow Sea is also known. [77] This NY Times article gave the civilian population as 1,600 but this was later revised down to 1,350. [78] Most appear to be connected, as one might expect, to fishing (this area is especially famous for crabs); how many work on the base is unclear. The most detailed, technical, assessment of the artillery duel is given by the US ‘geopolitical intelligence’ company STRATFOR. It released a report, accompanied by a pdf file showing satellite images taken after what it called the ‘North Korean attack on Yeonpyeong Island’. The STRATFOR reports are interesting partly for what they reveal but also what they hide or obscure and for what might be considered a surprising lack of geopolitical intelligence in an organisation in the business of selling the stuff. It admits that: A [South Korean] battery of six K9 155 mm self-propelled howitzers, which was conducting live-fire drills on a Yeonpyeong Island military base, fired some 80 rounds. And then, a bit further down: Significantly, the South claims its Yeonpyeong Island drill was not part of the larger Hoguk exercises under way simultaneously throughout South Korea. North Korea has occasionally protested these drills — including recently — and claims dozens of shells fell in North Korean waters near the island, provoking it to fire. However, as the North does not recognize the Northern Limit Line and considers the entire island and its surrounding water to be North Korean territory, it does not seem to be clear that this particular incident was any more provocative than any other drill.[79] This is a curious argument. Hoguk and the other military exercises over the decades have taken place in South Korean territory or international waters. This one was being held in what the North considered to be DPRK territory. It was not merely provocative from a military point of view, but as they made clear in their statement of 24 November, from a legal one as well. That is a very important distinction which differentiated the Yeonpyeong exercise from others. Although the STRAFOR report mentions the military base in passing, it is absent from the satellite images document. We have satellite photos of destroyed houses, but nothing about the base, which is not even identified. Since the base was the main target of attack, and early reports focused on military dead and wounded, this is a rather suspicious omission. The STRATFOR report, and images, do however throw considerable light, albeit inadvertently, on the issue of the civilian casualties. It would appear from this, and other sources, that the North Korean fire was not very accurate. The North Koreans either exclusively, or mainly (it is not clear which) used Multiple Launch Rocket System [MLRS] artillery These are, as the name suggests, basically a bundle of tubes which can fire rockets. Interestingly it is said that they can be traced back to the 15th century Korean hwacha (‘fire vehicle’) which could fire a hundred or more projectiles in one salvo.[80] The most famous example in modern times was the Soviet Katyusha, used in the Second World War and nicknamed the ‘Stalin organ’.[81] The Americans used them in 1991 in the Gulf War, and the ROK military is equipped with them.[82] MLRS can deliver formidable devastation but are not very accurate, especially the older versions with which the KPA is equipped: The initial barrage consisted of 150 rounds, followed by 20 more intermittently — meaning that while a full battalion appeared to be in position, a fully armed single battery could have conducted the entire attack. Of these 170 rounds, 80 struck Yeonpyeong Island, though 20 failed to detonate….. With a few modern exceptions, artillery rockets are unguided and achieve results through massed fires rather than exceptional accuracy. Here, North Korea had no opportunity to register targets or adjust fire based on input from forward observers; South Korea has subsequently conjectured based on the targets that the North’s maps of military positions on the island may have been dated. The failure of so many rounds to reach the island and a dud rate of roughly a quarter of those that did suggest issues of quality control in manufacture and/or poorly controlled storage, as well as the potential for there to have been issues in the fire direction or on the gunline.[83] So it would appear that the reason that shells fell on the town was not so much that that the firing was indiscriminate, but that it was inaccurate. The North Koreans do not have a monopoly on this, and there was anger in the National Assembly Intelligence Committee when they were presented with the satellite photo (Fig 5) which showed that Southern shells fired from their much more accurate howitzers had missed their target, the North Korean artillery positions Committee members reportedly reacted angrily since they show impact points scattered mainly in paddy and dry fields.[84] Fig 5: Evidence of inaccurate fire In this satellite photo released by the U.S. private intelligence agency Stratfor, rice paddies and fields in North Korea bear traces of South Korean artillery shells [&quot;Spies Intercepted Plans for Yeonpyeong Attack in August &quot;. Chosun Ilbo, 2 December 2010. There was also much dispute about the damage suffered by the North. The DPRK has not released any statement about casualties. In the South, some pointed out that their military equipment was far superior and more deadly and hence there must have been many casualties, and others pointed to the various satellite photos showing hits off target.[85] Sometimes military action is intended primarily to terrorise and demoralise the civilian population – the London blitz, the firebombing of Tokyo, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the ‘shock and awe’ bombing of Bagdad prior to invasion – are just a few examples. If the DPRK fired on Seoul to unleash ‘a sea of fire’ it would be the civilian population that would be hit, and the military impact would be secondary. However, much military action is aimed primarily at the enemy military, and if this happens in a populated area, civilians become, in the US euphemism, ‘collateral damage’. Clearly the distinction between the two is often blurred in practice, and it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to be sure, but it appears from the available evidence that the target for the North Korean fire was the marine base and that civilian casualties and damage were accidental. There are several reasons for assuming this. Firstly, the inaccuracy of the MLRS. Secondly, if the intention had been to cause civilian causalities as a warning about the consequences of Lee Myung-bak’s confrontational policy – ‘today Yeonpyeong, tomorrow Seoul’ – we would expect that point to be made. There is little point in giving a warning unless it is reasonably explicit. I can find no indication that the DPRK has made any suggestion that the Yeonpyeong incident carried such a lesson for the people of the ROK. On the contrary, the public statement expressed regret for civilian casualties and laid the blame on the Southern side: The DPRK side warned several times against the enemy's plan for shelling in the sensitive areas around Yonphyong Island and sent a telephone notice on the morning of the very day the incident occurred as part of its superhuman efforts to prevent the clash to the last moment, but the south side preempted the firing of shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side. The enemy side, however, has kept silent about all these facts. Moreover, it is now working hard to dramatize &quot;civilian casualties&quot; as part of its propaganda campaign, creating the impression that the defenceless civilians were exposed to &quot;indiscriminate shelling&quot; all of a sudden from the DPRK side. If that is true, it is very regrettable but the enemy should be held responsible for the incident as it took such inhuman action as creating &quot;a human shield&quot; by deploying civilians around artillery positions and inside military facilities before the launch of the provocation. The fact that there were human casualties inside the military base clearly proves itself the ulterior intention of the enemy. The U.S. regarded the death of innocent civilians as a common practice in the past in a bid to serve its military purposes in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and other parts of the world. This inhuman atrocity of the US. repeated itself on the Korean Peninsula this time. While the incident occurred, the shells indiscriminately fired by the enemy dropped in the area close to civilian houses far from the artillery positions of the Korean People's Army.[emphasis added][86] This statement brings up a third factor. The claim about a ‘human shield’ doesn’t carry much weight. Civilians live on the island for historical and economic reasons and there is no reason to suppose that they were used to shield the military. However, the claim that civilian casualties occurred within the camp is not implausible. Civilians must have worked at the camp. Indeed, one report from the United States said of the shelling that ‘this resulted in the killing of two South Korean soldiers and two civilian contractors working on a military base’ [emphasis added].[87] As with the Cheonan incident we need a proper, impartial, investigation if we are to draw any firm conclusions, but as with the Cheonan no such investigation is likely. It is interesting to note that the DPRK statement does not claim that it suffered any civilian causalities, merely that enemy shells ‘dropped in the area close to civilian houses’. North Korean propaganda is frequently portrayed as dishonest and deceitful. Here is surely a case where it would have been to their advantage to fabricate civilian casualties, but they did not do so. Finally, it should be remembered that the ROK military on Yeonpyeong Island are not just ordinary soldiers, they are marines, an elite force trained for amphibious assault. Indeed, back in 2009 Rodong Sinmun commented on the buildup up in the area The puppet military reinforced warships and armed forces along and near the &quot;northern limit line in the West Sea&quot; and formed a &quot;task force to be ready to go into action in half an hour&quot; and deployed it on Yonphyong Islet[emphasis added][88] The road behind, the road ahead The fire fight at Yeonpyeong Island seems to have been a manufactured crisis. It appears to be the first time that South Korea, alone or in tandem with the United States, has carried out a military exercise in territory claimed by the North.[89] There have been frequent naval clashes around the Northern Limit Line and it is fairly certain that it has been preserved for that purpose. If’ Seoul’ had really been anxious to avoid incidents and preserve peace then the NLL would have gone long ago. President Roh moo-hyun and Chairman Kim Jong Il, at their summit on 4 October 2007 agreed to ‘special peace and cooperation zone in the West Sea’, but this peace initiative was overturned, as so many others, by incoming president Lee Myung-bak.[90] Preserving the NLL as an area where incidents were likely is one thing, but utilising the NLL deliberately to create an incident is another Warnings and intelligence reports aside, it must have been known that a military exercise within the NLL area would be provocative. On top of which, the legal implications made it intolerably provocative. This suggests that the crisis was planned, not necessarily in great detail, but with sufficient surety of outcome. This reading is quite consistent with Lee Myung-bak’s policy, which is one of building up tension through tension in order to precipitate a crisis on the peninsula, a collapse of the DRPK, and its absorption by the ROK. The DPRK is well aware of this, hence the reaffirmation of the zero tolerance policy at Yeonpyeong. On 23 November, in the aftermath of the clash, the KPA issued a communiqué which reiterated the policy: It is a traditional mode of counter-action of the army of the DPRK to counter the firing of the provocateurs with merciless strikes. Should the south Korean puppet group dare intrude into the territorial waters of the DPRK even 0.001 mm, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will unhesitatingly continue taking merciless military counter-actions against it.[91] This is a calculated policy of brinkmanship, designed to avert war, by threatening war. The danger is, of course, that the momentum of events will bring war about. That, unfortunately, is becoming ever more likely. Lee Myung-bak is a consummate politician. He has set things in motion to produce, and replicate crisis, while giving the appearance of being reluctant. His address to the nation on 29 November used the same rhetorical device as Antony’s speech about Julius Caesar, where he claims to be burying Caesar, not praising him, but of course is doing just that. Lee combined ‘humility’ with an aggressive stance in such a way as to suggest he was reluctant to exacerbate the situation but was being forced into it. President Lee Myung-bak’s address Monday is being summarized as consisting mainly of “humility toward the people of South Korea” and an “ultra-hardline response to North Korea.” Analysts say it shows the president’s perception of the current crisis facing him and its solution following the North Korean artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island. Although even North Korea acknowledged the attack to be a “provocation,” President Lee has faced harsh criticism domestically. Surveys show that more than 70 percent of South Koreans, conservative and progressive alike, feel that the military and Lee Myung-bak administration did not respond appropriately at the time of the attack. The fact that the president began his address Monday with what amounted to an apology to the people of South Korea reflected a consideration of this situation. [emphasis added] The performance so impressed the reporter from the liberal Hankyoreh that we get manifestly false statement that ‘North Korea acknowledged the attack to be a ‘provocation’. Throughout the crises of 2001, especially over Cheonan and then Yeonpyeong, Lee Myung-bak has been very adroit in fanning the flames while give the impression that he was attempting to put them out. In respect of the Cheonan incident President Obama was reported as saying &quot;I think President Lee has shown extraordinary restraint given these circumstances.’[92] It may be objected that this was a public statement and should not be taken too literally; politicians often say in public the opposite of what they think in private. However, there does seem to be a consensus among Western observers at least that Lee is a reluctant warrior being driven into taking steps by the provocative obduracy of the North.[93] Take, for instance, this STRATFOR interview where the interviewer comments: I talked to three former [US?] envoys to Seoul this week and all of them agreed that South Korea had handled this in a pretty cool and sensible fashion[94] The South Korea public is rather more sceptical. One of the WikiLeaks cables [09SEOUL59] illustrates the confusion in the minds of US officials: President Lee is determined not to give in to North Korean pressure. Our Blue House contacts have told us on several occasions that President Lee remained quite comfortable with his North Korea policy and that he is prepared leave the inter-Korean relations frozen until the end of his term in office, if necessary. It is also our assessment that Lee's more conservative advisors and supporters see the current standoff as a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the North, even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship.[95] On the one hand we have Lee facing up to North Korean pressure, but we also get the admission that the ‘current standoff’ ( this was in 2009) is seen as ‘ a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the North, even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship’. Lee’s brinkmanship is, in fact, far more profound and aggressive than the US diplomat realised. Both North and South are engaging in brinkmanship, but the nature of the two is very different. Pyongyang is far poorer and weaker than its adversaries, which include not merely South Korea but the United States, and Japan.[96] North Korea’s brinkmanship is therefore inherently defensive. It is designed to protect the country (or regime if you prefer that) from attack and conquest. That does not mean that it is wise, or will be successful, that is a matter of debate. But it is important to recognise its essential characteristic of defensiveness. South Korea’s brinkmanship, on the other hand, is offensive. It is designed to bring about the collapse of the DPRK and its takeover by the ROK. Lee Myung-bak does not have to do this. His immediate predecessors (Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun) had very different policies. Indeed, his aggressive brinkmanship is arguably a new development because even in the days of the military dictatorships while there was hostility towards the North because the balance of forces if anything favoured the North, there was not such an ambitious policy. However, Lee Myung-bak is reputedly pragmatic and opportunistic. Soon after he won the presidency he was described in the New York Times thus: Mr. Lee has a reputation as a pragmatist who, in contrast to President Roh Moo-hyun, holds few strong ideological positions. As mayor, he created parks and reformed the public transportation system. As president, he said, his main agenda would be to revive the country’s economy.[97] If that is correct, his brinkmanship has been a response to events and opportunities, rather than a considered strategy. In addition, we may discern three factors which may be propelling him to accelerate the buildup of tension on the peninsula. • A desire to renew the anti-North momentum after the relative failure of the Cheonan incident. His setback in the May elections, the widespread public scepticism about the investigation, and the failure to get the UN Security Council to condemn North Korea must rankle. The Yeonpyeong incident is seen as away to rekindle anti-North Korea sentiment In his address on 29 November he specifically made the point: There was a split in public opinion over the torpedoing of the Cheonan. Unlike that time, our people have united as one this time.[98] Despite the frequent assertions of implosion and crisis, the DPRK is not facing collapse. Whilst sanctions must have caused huge damage it appears that the economy is recovering. Certainly Pyongyang, from personal observation on a visit in November 2010, is manifestly economically improved over my last visit three years ago, with more motor vehicles, bicycles, and shops. The electricity supply is much better and there is a very noticeable increase in street lighting. These observations are broadly corroborated by series of recent American visitors.[99] If the South is to take over the North then something must be done to reverse this recovery. Time is not on Lee Myung-bak’s side. His term of office comes to an end on 25 February 2013 and under the present constitution he is ineligible to run again. Moreover, there are suggestions that because of demographic changes the conservative ascendancy represented by the Lee administration may not be sustainable and that South Korea will move to more progressive administrations.[100] Since the North’s brinkmanship is defensive, it is reactive and this leaves the initiative in the hands of the South. Seoul has reinforced its forces on the NLL island and has announced that there will be artillery exercises from Daecheong Island, and again on Yeonpyeong. [101] It seems inevitable that Pyongyang will feel compelled to respond. The new ROK Defence Minister, Kim Kwan-jin, has threatened what he calls ‘self-defense air raids’ in the event of another clash; ‘self defense’ being used in the Japanese sense.[102] It will be recalled that clause 9 of the Japanese constitution prohibits the establishment of armed forces, so the Japanese army, navy and air forces all have ‘self-defense’ in their titles thus solving the constitutional problem. Kim Kwan-jin’s air strike policy is all part of what the New York Times rather approvingly, and with a professional use of euphemism, called a new ‘muscular military posture’.[103] The implications of this new policy are obvious. Not merely has the South great superiority in aircraft, but the new rules allow great flexibility for escalation. However, there are limits to the ROK military’s freedom of action. There is the legal issue of operational control – when would war be deemed a war and thus trigger US control of the ROK military ? But before that stage is reached, the ROK air force is dependent on US intelligence to operate. Thus any serious escalation of the situation on the Korean peninsula would require US endorsement. Would this be forthcoming? Unfortunately it looks as if it would. The Obama administration has termed its policy towards Korea as one of ‘strategic patience’. [104] It might be better described as ‘strategic paralysis’. Not merely has it ignored that calls of a many Korea experts to engage with the DPRK, but it has effectively relinquished control of events to Lee Myung-bak.[105] It might be said that ‘strategic paralysis’ is not confined to US Korea policy but is the defining characteristic of Obama foreign policy, and that would be true, but nowhere is it more perilous than in Korea. Because ultimately Korea is China. A second Korean war would, like the first, soon become a Sino-American war.<br />

North Korea doesn’t take U.S. deterrence seriously anymore<br />
Fenenko 12/8—leading research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of International Security, PhD (Alexei, 8 December 2010, “North Korea no longer takes the U.S. security guarantees seriously”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4014:http://en.rian.ru/valdai_op/20101208/161686288.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.rian.ru/valdai_op/20101208/161686288.html" rel="nofollow">http://en.rian.ru/valdai_op/20101208/161686288.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4014 -->, RBatra)<br />
The current crisis reveals yet another negative trend: North Korea no longer takes American security guarantees seriously. The United States is bound by a set of obligations to protect its two allies – Japan and South Korea; therefore, it is conventionally accepted that the United States would initiate the conflict. Now that the Obama administration has shown that, unlike the previous Republican administration, it does not necessarily take so robust stance on defending its allies, North Korea has begun to “vet” the United States to see if, under certain circumstances, they would be prepared to abandon their allies in the Pacific, especially since the United States already has serious ongoing commitments to two theaters of conflict: Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">North Korean provocations are likely—U.S. involvement risks rapid escalation and pre-emptive strikes—deterrence only enrages the North</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Stares 1/13—General John W. Vessey Senior Fellow for Conflict Prevention and Director of the Center for Preventive Action @ CFR, Adjunct Professor, Georgetown University, PhD (Paul B., 13 January 2011, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://38north.org/2011/01/on-escalation-in-korea/" rel="nofollow">http://38north.org/2011/01/on-escalation-in-korea/</a>, RBatra)</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Despite intermittent crises and many deadly clashes, nearly six decades have passed since the armistice agreement “ending” the Korean War was signed without there being a serious resumption of military hostilities. Though the armed standoff in Korea is hardly a desirable state of affairs, this record can be taken as a reassuring sign of its underlying stability. But how sanguine should we be that the current crisis will recede in much the same way that earlier ones have and that the deterrent relationship will hold? In fact, recent events raise some troubling questions about the volatility of the situation in Korea today.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">First, the November 23, 2010 shelling of Yeongpyeong Island by North Korean artillery clearly caught many experts by surprise. North-South relations had been thawing after a summer of heightened tensions following the sinking of the ROK naval ship Cheonan in March. Even the revelation of new nuclear enrichment facilities immediately prior to the attack had seemed to accomplish its putative goal of convincing the outside world that North Korea could not be left to stew in its own juices and that engagement was now imperative. So why would North Korea set back its coercive diplomatic campaign by launching yet another deadly provocation that antagonized everyone—including its principal patron China—just when the wind was clearly beginning to blow in its favor? Did North Korea fail to see this or did it miscalculate the impact of its actions? Did other factors, notably the succession process underway in Pyongyang, affect the calculus or tip the scales in some decisive way?</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Second, the attack on Yeongpyeong Island was also surprising in that it targeted areas inhabited by civilians for the first time since the Korean War. This was no accident, but a carefully cho</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">reographed and well executed attack as Joe Bermudez’s excellent account of what happened indicates. Yes, the numbers killed were still less than previous incidents. And yes, one can infer that the choice of Yeongpyeong still signaled restraint by North Korea as the military base on the island had been the source of offending live fire drills and, moreover, represented an “off peninsula” target and thus less likely to trigger wider escalation. But why would North Korea decide to brazenly disregard such an established “red line,” to say nothing of a cardinal international norm, at this time? Can we infer from this a growing willingness to breach other red lines and engage in still more risky behavior?</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Third, the rapid change in South Korean public opinion from being largely pacifist and unwilling to countenance a forceful response against North Korea to the situation today where a majority now favor military retaliation if provoked has introduced a new element into the crisis. Tough statements by senior ROK officials—including President Lee Myung Bak—that South Korea will use force in the event of another aggressive act suggest that the days of Southern forbearance are over. This is completely understandable and, to many, a necessary prerequisite to deter future provocations. Yet, how confident can we be—especially in light of recent events—that North Korea will take the threat of South Korean retaliation seriously? Might it only goad them further? And should we worry that South Korea might take preemptive action if it had credible indications of another provocation?</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Remarkably, despite all the commentary on the current crisis, to say nothing of the obvious stakes involved, scant attention has been given to how tensions might actually escalate rather than dissipate contrary to past experience. Certainly plenty of commentators have warned about how “miscalculation,” “loss of control” and “unintended escalation” could trigger a new Korean war, but rarely beyond such broad generalizations and assertions. Conversely, those who discount the likelihood of significant escalation should the South retaliate militarily in the future have been no more forthcoming in explaining why the risk remains low other than repeating the broad conviction that it is in neither side’s interests to go to war. As we have seen in many cases, however, an expectation of rational behavior—especially for decision makers under conditions of stress and incomplete information­­—is not something that can be reliably assumed.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The propensity of another major clash on or around the peninsula to escalate militarily depends on numerous complex factors. Understanding them may seem like an arcane or academic exercise, but it is in fact critically important to considering how best to manage the current crisis and prevent the very outcome that everyone—including presumably the North Koreans—wishes to avoid. Four interrelated variables are likely to be the critical ingredients to how another deadly clash might escalate. These can be simplified as the “who, where, what and why” factors:</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Who’s Involved: In the most recent provocations, North Korea has evidently been careful to confine their operations to South Korean targets. A future incident that either intentionally or accidentally involves U.S. forces or citizens in Korea would clearly raise the stakes. It is has been some time since this has happened and one could infer that North Korea understands that the risks have grown too high and thus they will continue to refrain from any direct or harmful interactions with the United States. The decision to carry out joint U.S.-ROK naval exercises in the vicinity of the recent provocations presumably had this in mind to help deter further attacks. Yet, how sure can we really be that North Korea would not target U.S. forces in the future? Might they make the same calculation that the U.S. will be just as risk averse to taking retaliatory action as the ROK has been to date? And even if they do continue to avoid provocations that may involve the U.S., how confident are we that they would know when U.S. forces or citizens are not in harm’s way? Finally, while the involvement of the U.S. would clearly increase the risk of military escalation, we should also not overlook the potential role of Japan. It too has been the target of past provocations and its tolerance for aggressive North Korean behavior has lessened considerably in recent years while its capacity for military retaliation has manifestly increased.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Where the Interactions Take Place: As several analysts have pointed out, the Cheonan and Yeongpyeong incidents are the latest in a decade-long sequence of military clashes along the disputed Northern Limit Line (NLL)—all of which have stayed localized. Were additional incidents to occur in this same general area, the supposition is that South Korea would retaliate in the proximate vicinity and in a proportional way to reduce the risk of further escalation. This raises the question of whether North Korea would view South Korean retaliation against mainland, i.e. “on peninsular” targets—which are reportedly now being considered—as a qualitatively different and therefore disproportionate response regardless of how discrete or contained they were? There is no assurance, in any case, that North Korea would confine any future provocations to the NLL/Yellow Sea area. Meddling with the Kaesong Industrial Complex, including the detention of South Koreans who work there, has been mentioned as a possibility. Insertion of special forces into the South if only for reconnaissance purposes is also not out of the question. There have been plenty of precedents after all. Neither should Seoul be viewed as off limits as demonstrated by the failed assassination attempt in late 2009 by a North Korean “hit team” against their most senior defector Hwang Jang Yop. How South Korea would respond proportionately to these or similar types of activities are not immediately clear, though one can anticipate considerable public agitation to retaliate promptly.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">What Type of Interactions Take Place: The scale, intensity, and nature of any further military interactions clearly have a major bearing on how a crisis would subsequently escalate. Intermittent artillery duels across the NLL and even the DMZ would probably not precipitate a major outbreak of hostilities. The use of airpower, however, which has been raised as a possible retaliatory option by the new ROK Defense Minister, introduces a new, more uncertain element since it entails the direct incursion of sovereign territory and thus represents a clearer political affront to the North. (It also introduces the possibility of downed and captured pilots that could also complicate matters). Targeting major symbols of national power such as nuclear facilities and missile bases—however surgically undertaken—would undoubtedly represent a still greater challenge to the North which we can reliably assume would not go unanswered. The most important variable, however, will be the perceived operational status of each side’s main offensive capabilities. If either North or South Korea perceives that opposing forces are being readied to engage in large scale offensive operations, the incentives to strike first will inevitably increase. For the North the reason would be to avert the almost certain demise of the regime and for the South it would be to minimize the risk to Seoul. But, as has often been observed, precautionary defensive measures designed to bolster deterrence are not easily distinguishable from offensive preparations and thus the potential for miscalculation exists. Here changes to the size, disposition, and alert status of U.S. forces in and around Korea, including the potential activation of reinforcements and the evacuation of non-combatants from forward areas, will be absolutely critical to perceptions of intent.</span></span><br />

Beijing's record during 2010 was far more disconcerting. In March, North Korea sank a South Korean corvette, killing forty-six sailors. In November, it revealed the existence of a facility for enriching uranium, providing Pyongyang an additional prospective path for fissile material development apart from its existing plutonium capability. Later in the same month, it shelled a coastal island, killing South Korean soldiers and civilians. Yet China declined to call Pyongyang to account for these outrages, and sought to protect North Korea from international opprobrium.<br />
China's responses diverged sharply from those of the United States, South Korea and Japan. It talked the talk of major-power cooperation but it did not walk the walk, even in the face of direct threats to regional stability and security about which Beijing has professed repeated concern. Moreover, Beijing openly chastised Washington for undertaking enhanced defense cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo to inhibit additional provocations by Pyongyang.<br />
South Korea has stated that it will no longer tolerate future provocations by the North. It also voices open doubt that Beijing will restrain Pyongyang. South Korean retaliation for additional North Korean actions is no longer a question of if, but of when. Even if Seoul responds in a focused and proportionate manner, such retaliation creates the danger of a cycle of escalation. <br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Korean Peninsula represents the immediate test case for Hu and Obama to &quot;reset&quot; U.S.-China relations and address questions of immediate concern to both countries.

<br />
Chinese pressure on North Korea is key to maintain regional stability. However, the geopolitical rivalry with the U.S. on the peninsula dissuades them.<br />
Putten 12/21—research fellow with the Clingendael Institue in The Hague, PhD in History (Frans-Paul van der Putten, 21 December 2010, “Sino-US geopolitical rivalry does not help Korean stability”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/21/sino-us-geopolitical-rivalry-does-not-help-korean-stability/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/21/sino-us-geopolitical-rivalry-does-not-help-korean-stability/</a>, RBatra)<br />
The United States government believes China needs to do more to contribute to stability on the Korean peninsula. According to this view, North Korea is highly dependent on Chinese support and Beijing should use its influence to moderate Pyongyang’s behavior. As some American and other Western observers have put it, it is time for China to start behaving like a responsible great power. But it is not likely that China will fundamentally alter its policies.<br />
The main reason for this is that geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States overshadows the situation on the Korean peninsula. Lately both Chinese and US actions have escalated this rivalry. As long as the two powers are more interested in keeping the other in check than in stabilising the peninsula no significant progress in terms of stabilising the region is possible.<br />
North Korea recently shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong after a period of escalating tensions, killing two soldiers and two civilians. North Korea claims that it opened fire after being provoked by a South Korean exercise. In response to the shelling incident the US and South Korea have conducted joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea. These involved a US aircraft carrier and are regarded as threatening not only by North Korea but also by China.<br />
China’s economic and diplomatic support for North Korea undermines efforts by other countries to affect the behavior of the regime in Pyongyang. Even China is troubled by North Korean behavior. The North Korean nuclear program, and the risks Pyongyang is running in escalating tensions with South Korea and the US, are counter to China’s security interests. Theoretically, the Chinese government could therefore decide to put pressure on Pyongyang by limiting its economic support and by ending the diplomatic support it often gives in the United Nations Security Council. It is very unlikely that China’s policy towards North Korea will change much. The US diplomatic reports revealed by WikiLeaks are a confirmation of uneasy Sino-North Korean relations rather than an indication that this relationship is about to change.<br />
China will probably continue to give more support than any other country because it is highly vulnerable to the consequences of political or economic collapse in North Korea. The longest and most accessible border of North Korea is the one it shares with China. Chaos in North Korea would harm stability in China’s northeast, the region formerly known as Manchuria.<br />
Moreover, Beijing is less motivated to put pressure on the North Korean regime than other countries are. The US is primarily interested in preventing the proliferation of nuclear technologies from North Korea. South Korea and Japan are mainly worried about the military threat from the north. Compared with these countries, China is less concerned about such issues.<br />
The most fundamental element in China’s policy towards North Korea is that Beijing regards the US as a greater security threat than the situation on the Korean peninsula. Since neither China nor the US is by itself the predominant great power in Korean affairs, Beijing can only assume responsibility for regional stability if it does so jointly with the US. However, this will not happen since China and the US each regard one another as their main potential military adversary. They also have contrary interests on the Korean peninsula.<br />
While China regards the US military presence in South Korea as a potential threat that should eventually be removed, the US intends to maintain this presence as it helps to limit Chinese regional influence. The relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang cannot be seen apart from this context of geopolitical rivalry. It is desirable for China that the regime in North Korea continues to exist and that the Chinese government retains a certain degree of influence in Pyongyang.<br />
<br />
The recent meeting changed nothing—military presence prevents Chinese pressure and risks regional arms races and war<br />
Klein-Ahlbrandt 1/21—China Adviser and North East Asia Project Director at Crisis Group, supervises the work of a small team of analysts responsible for high quality research and analysis on North East Asia (Stephanie Klein-Ahlbrandt, 21 January 2011, Despite Reports, “China's North Korea Policy Stays the Same,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-t-kleineahlbrandt/post_1614_b_812407.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-t-kleineahlbrandt/post_1614_b_812407.html</a>, RBatra)<br />
During Hu Jintao's visit, he penned a joint statement with President Obama in which -- for the first time -- he voiced concern about North Korea's new uranium enrichment. Many in the U.S. and South Korea are hailing this as support for their position, but they should know better. Despite tactical moves to smooth Hu Jintao's visit, little about China's North Korea policy has changed over the last few weeks nor is it likely to anytime soon.<br />
In the past, a less strident Beijing's willingness to calibrate its responses to North Korean provocations was key to the West's strategy to moderate Pyongyang's behavior. But internal debates on North Korea policy have given way to traditionalist and conservative forces increasingly dictating the line, backed by nationalist public opinion. Over the past year and a half, China has strengthened its political, economic and military relationship with the North, refusing to hold Pyongyang to account for deadly attacks on the South which recently brought the peninsula the closest to war since 1953.<br />
China's top concern of instability on its border deepened in 2009 following reports of Kim Jong-Il's failing health, a disastrous currency reform, and uncertainties surrounding leadership transition. But Beijing's calculations are also increasingly shaped by rising concerns about a perceived U.S. strategic &quot;return to Asia&quot; and by opposition to American military and political presence in the region. China is using its close ties with Pyongyang as a bulwark against U.S. military dominance in the region, giving the rogue nation virtually unconditional diplomatic protection. The two presidents' joint statement this week glosses over all of these realities.<br />
When North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island on November 23 and after the sinking of the South Korean naval ship Cheonan on March 26, China's initial reaction was to dismiss international calls to pressure North Korea. Instead, it criticized U.S. and South Korea for military exercises held in response, which it viewed as more threatening to its security than North Korea's violent behavior. It felt the U.S. was using tensions on the Peninsula as a justification to expand its regional military presence. China also worried about the deepening military cooperation between the U.S., South Korea and Japan, seeing U.S. security assistance not only as an attempt to contain China but also as emboldening regional players against it. While weeks after the shelling, China toned down its criticism of the U.S. and sent an envoy to Pyongyang, it has made no changes to its fundamental economic, military and political support to Pyongyang. Beijing's tactical moves should not be confused with a broader shift in its approach towards North Korea.<br />
Beijing's solidarity with Pyongyang has significantly strained relations with South Korea and Japan, which are strengthening their security alliances with the U.S. Their rejection of China's call for emergency consultations after the Yeonpyeong Island shelling was more than a display of frustration at Beijing's unwillingness to take concrete action. It showed a widening gap between the two camps' perceptions of the North Korean threat and the appropriate ways to manage it. There is a real danger that the North will continue its asymmetric attacks in the Yellow Sea or elsewhere in the South. In response, Japan and South Korea are significantly boosting their military capabilities, intensifying the risk of a regional arms race or of a miscalculation leading to war.<br />
Beijing's stance on North Korea is only the latest example of its increasingly assertive foreign policy behavior. Over the past year, it has intensified sweeping claims to disputed territories in the South China Sea and Diaoyu Islands, escalated a minor incident at sea into a major confrontation with Japan, and showed off a new stealth fighter aircraft just as the U.S. and China were trying to restart their military relations. Beijing is more unwilling now to yield to external demands and increasingly expects quid pro quos from the West in return for cooperation on third country issues such as North Korea and Iran. A common question in Chinese policy circles is why continue to cooperate with the U.S. when it continues to sell arms to Taiwan.<br />
China needs to step up to the plate and assume the responsibilities that come with its rising power status. It has censured North Korea in the past after the 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. Its failure to do the same now -- for the Cheonan sinking, Yeonpyeong Island attack and Pyongyang's new uranium enrichment -- endangers not just the region but also its own security interests. Shielding Pyongyang and continuing unconditional engagement reduces all other countries' ability to deter North Korea. China's strategy leaves it vulnerable to accusation that it is responsible for enabling North Korea's next attack. Let's hope President Obama realizes the joint statement must be backed up with a stern message to President Hu that Beijing's increasingly cozy relationship with Pyongyang and insistence on backing the North's bad behavior only heightens the risk of regional conflict.<br />

Maintaining the non-nuclear status quo on the Korean Peninsula may be a significant Chinese objective, but it is not their most important one.5 Beijing's top priority is to preserve the North Korean state as a buffer between China and the US sphere of influence in Northeast Asia. Chinese leaders probably fear that rigorous sanctions would increase the danger of the North Korean state imploding, much as East Germany did in 1989. Such a development could lead to a unified Korea allied to the United States right on China's doorsteps-probably with the continued presence of American military bases on the Korean Peninsula. It might lead to a massive flow of North Korean refugees into China. Uneasiness over these scenarios limits the amount of pressure that Beijing is willing to exert on Pyongyang. <br />
In theory, China might be able to use its economic leverage as North Korea's principal source of energy, food, and other vital commodities to compel Kim Jong Il's regime to halt its nuclear weapons program. Without Chinese cooperation, coercive economic measures would have little impact on Pyongyang. And given Washington's dependence on Beijing's willingness to continue funding the soaring US Treasury debt, American officials are not in a good bargaining position to pressure China into endorsing robust sanctions.<br />

China is crucial to any solvency effort<br />
Global Security 11/29 (29 November 2010, “China Calls For Talks Over Korean Crisis, Parties Unresponsive”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://globalsecuritynewswire.org/siteservices/print_friendly.php?ID=nw_20101129_2947" rel="nofollow">http://globalsecuritynewswire.org/siteservices/print_friendly.php?ID=nw_20101129_2947</a>, RBatra)<br />
China yesterday called for emergency direct diplomacy with North Korea in order to lower escalating tensions following last week's artillery attack on South Korea (see GSN, Nov. 24).<br />
However, the United States and its allies said now is not the time to address Pyongyang's demands for new six-party talks.<br />
North Korea's shelling of the inhabited South Korean island of Yeonpyeong resulted in the deaths of several soldiers and civilians and injuries to nearly 20 more. The incident directly followed news from Washington that Pyongyang revealed to visiting U.S. experts earlier this month that it had covertly built a large-scale advanced uranium enrichment facility at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, the Wall Street Journal reported.<br />
The two events have renewed international attention on the North Korean nuclear impasse. Beijing dispatched its senior foreign affairs official to lead a delegation to Seoul over the weekend for talks on the crisis. However, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak told the Chinese visitors that it was not the &quot;right time&quot; to relaunch long-stalled six-nation talks aimed at the permament denuclearization of North Korea, according to an administration official.<br />
The nuclear talks involve China, Japan, the two Koreas, Russia and the United States. They were last held almost two years ago. Pyongyang withdrew from the negotiations in April 2009 and one month later carried out its second nuclear weapons test, an action for which it was punished with heightened U.N. Security Council sanctions.<br />
The North for some time has declared its willingness to return to the nuclear talks. However, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo are leery of returning to a negotiating framework that has been used by the North in the past as a means to win international concessions only to later resume work on its nuclear weapons program. The three allies have called on Pyongyang to demonstrate its &quot;sincere&quot; commitment to nuclear disarmament before they will agree to resume negotiations. <br />
China is North Korea's strongest foreign ally and chief economic benefactor. Beijing's continued support of the Kim Jong Il regime is frequently cited in Washington as the only thing keeping the Stalinist government from collapsing. Because of this, China has come under growing criticism from the international community to do more to press North Korea over its belligerent behavior.<br />
&quot;It's hard to know why China doesn't push harder,&quot; Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a CNN interview aired yesterday. &quot;They clearly are interested in this -- in the region not spinning out of control -- so my sense is they try to control this guy, and I'm not sure he is controllable.&quot;<br />
Lee yesterday told Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo in blunt remarks that China must take a &quot;more fair and responsible position&quot; on peninsula affairs and leave Cold War-era considerations behind, according to presidential spokesman Hong Sang-pyo.<br />
In a television address today, Lee pledged North Korea &quot;would pay a price&quot; for any future hostilities and said that &quot;more endurance and forgiveness would only result in bigger provocations&quot; (Fairclough/Ramstad, Wall Street Journal I, Nov. 28).<br />
Japan today dismissed Beijing's call for direct talks with North Korea. Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said it would be &quot;unacceptable for us to hold six-party talks only because North Korea has gone amok,&quot; the Wall Street Journal reported (Yuka Hayashi, Wall Street Journal II, Nov. 29).<br />
The United States has yet to give a response to China's call for emergency talks, saying it would carry out discussions with the South Korean government first, Reuters reported.<br />
A high-ranking Pyongyang official voiced doubts about Beijing's initiative to engage in discussions. While the North has not responded to China's call, the unidentified official told Kyodo News that countries involved in the latest incident should meet for talks first (Laurence/Choonsik, Reuters, Nov. 29).<br />
While urging that the two Koreas to refrain from actions that would raise tensions on the peninsula, China has abstained from condemning Pyongyang's shelling of the South Korean island, indicating that Beijing will refuse the urging of Washington and other states to punish the North, the Los Angeles Times reported last Thursday.<br />
North Korea's presumed possession of the nuclear bomb, its large arsenal of chemical weapons and a massive standing army make a military assault on the isolated state an unattractive option, according to reports. The United States and much of the international community have already drastically curtailed trade relations with the Stalinist state. In the White House view, China remains the only nation to have sway over the North and the only hope of producing a change in the Korean nuclear impasse.<br />
&quot;China is pivotal to moving North Korea in a fundamentally different direction,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said.<br />
&quot;You can go [to] the U.N. Security Council or call for a five-party meeting (minus North Korea). But first you've got to go after China,&quot; said Victor Cha, point man for North Korean policy during the Bush administration. <br />

Korea war goes global and nuclear<br />
STRATFOR 10 (5/26/10, “North Korea, South Korea: The Military Balance on the Peninsula,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100526_north_korea_south_korea_military_balance_peninsula" rel="nofollow">http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100526_north_korea_south_korea_military_balance_peninsula</a>, JMP)<br />
So the real issue is the potential for escalation — or an accident that could precipitate escalation — that would be beyond the control of Pyongyang or Seoul. With both sides on high alert, both adhering to their own national (and contradictory) definitions of where disputed boundaries lie and with rules of engagement loosened, the potential for sudden and rapid escalation is quite real.<br />
Indeed, North Korea’s navy, though sizable on paper, is largely a hollow shell of old, laid-up vessels. What remains are small fast attack craft and submarines — mostly Sang-O “Shark” class boats and midget submersibles. These vessels are best employed in the cluttered littoral environment to bring asymmetric tactics to bear — not unlike those Iran has prepared for use in the Strait of Hormuz. These kinds of vessels and tactics — including, especially, the deployment of naval mines — are poorly controlled when dispersed in a crisis and are often impossible to recall.<br />
For nearly 40 years, tensions on the Korean Peninsula were managed within the context of the wider Cold War. During that time it was feared that a second Korean War could all too easily escalate into and a thermonuclear World War III, so both Pyongyang and Seoul were being heavily managed from their respective corners. In fact, USFK was long designed to ensure that South Korea could not independently provoke that war and drag the Americans into it, which for much of the Cold War period was of far greater concern to Washington than North Korea attacking southward.<br />
Today, those constraints no longer exist. There are certainly still constraints — neither the United States nor China wants war on the peninsula. But current tensions are quickly escalating to a level unprecedented in the post-Cold War period, and the constraints that do exist have never been tested in the way they might be if the situation escalates much further. <br />

North Korean prolif risks nuclear strikes and broad Asian prolif<br />

The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious, not only for the Northeast Asian region but for the whole international community.<br />
At worst, there is the possibility of nuclear attack1, whether by intention, miscalculation, or merely accident, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities. On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust of unprecedented proportions.<br />
But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: <br />
That is not global winter, but the nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years. The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow…The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger…To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.4<br />
These, of course, are not the only consequences. Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. The direct impacts, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, could make the present global financial crisis pale by comparison. How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. There could be many unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with subsequent nuclear breakout and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, and aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant states. The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community. <br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">North Korea is currently believed to have sufficient plutonium stocks to produce up to 12 nuclear weapons.6 If and when it is successful in implementing a uranium enrichment program - having announced publicly that it is experimenting with enrichment technology on September 4, 20097 in a communication with the UN Security Council - it would likely acquire the capacity to produce over 100 such weapons. Although some may dismiss Korean Peninsula proliferation risks on the assumption that the North Korean regime will implode as a result of its own economic problems, food problems, and treatment of its own populace, there is little to suggest that this is imminent. If this were to happen, there would be the risk of nuclear weapons falling into hands of non-state actors in the disorder and chaos that would ensue. Even without the outbreak of nuclear hostilities on the Korean Peninsula in either the near or longer term, North Korea has every financial incentive under current economic sanctions and the needs of its military command economy to export its nuclear and missile technologies to other states. Indeed, it has already been doing this for some time. The Proliferation Security Initiative may conceivably prove effective in intercepting ship-borne nuclear exports, but it is by no means clear how air-transported materials could similarly be intercepted.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Given the high stakes involved, North Korean proliferation, if unaddressed and unreversed, has the potential to destabilize the whole East Asian region and beyond. Even if a nuclear exchange does not occur in the short term, the acute sense of nuclear threat that has been experienced for over five decades by North Koreans as a result of US strategic deterrence is now likely to be keenly felt by fellow Koreans south of the 38th Parallel and Japanese across the waters of the Sea of Japan. China, too, must surely feel itself to be at risk from North Korean nuclear weapons, or from escalation that might ensue from next-use in the Korean Peninsula resulting not only in the environmental consequences noted above, but in regime collapse and massive refugee flows. South Korea and Japan appear willing to rely on their respective bilateral security pacts with the United States to deter North Korean nuclear attack for the time being. However, should South Korea and/or Japan acquire nuclear weapons, the outcome would be destabilizing, especially if this resulted from rupture of their alliance relationships with the United States. Both have the technical capability to do so very rapidly. South Korea has previously engaged in nuclear weapons research but desisted after US pressure. Japan still proclaims its adherence to the three Non-Nuclear Principles although recent confirmation that the United States routinely transited nuclear weapons through Japan and retains the right of emergency reintroduction of nuclear weapons has tarnished Japan’s non-nuclear image. Moreover, it has large stockpiles of plutonium that could rapidly be used to produce nuclear warheads. Such responses, already advocated by conservative and nationalist groups within South Korea and Japan, could trigger a regional nuclear arms race involving the Koreas, Japan, Taiwan, and China, with incalculable wider consequences for Southeast Asia, South Asia and the whole Pacific and beyond. These developments would spell the demise of the current global non-proliferation regime as underpinned by the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Failure to reverse the DPRK’s nuclear breakout is also an important factor driving a general malaise in the exercise of American power which one of the authors has characterized elsewhere as “the end of American nuclear hegemony.”8</span></span><br />

Cimbala 10 - Prof. of Political Science @ Penn State, (Stephen, Nuclear Weapons and Cooperative Security in the 21st Century, p. 117-8)<br />
Failure to contain proliferation in Pyongyang could spread nuclear fever throughout Asia. Japan and South Korea might seek nuclear weapons and missile defenses. A pentagonal configuration of nuclear powers in the Pacific basis (Russia, China, Japan, and the two Koreas – not including the United States, with its own Pacific interests) could put deterrence at risk and create enormous temptation toward nuclear preemption. Apart from actual use or threat of use, North Korea could exploit the mere existence of an assumed nuclear capability in order to support its coercive diplomacy. As George H. Quester has noted:<br />
If the Pyongyang regime plays its cards sensibly and well, therefore, the world will not see its nuclear weapons being used against Japan or South Korea or anyone else, but will rather see this new nuclear arsenal held in reserve (just as the putative Israeli nuclear arsenal has been held in reserve), as a deterrent against the outside world’s applying maximal pressure on Pyongyang and as a bargaining chip to extract the economic and political concessions that the DPRK needs if it wishes to avoid giving up its peculiar approach to social engineering.<br />
A five-sided nuclear competition in the Pacific would be linked, in geopolitical deterrence and proliferation space, to the existing nuclear deterrents in India and Pakistan, and to the emerging nuclear weapons status of Iran. An arc of nuclear instability from Tehran to Tokyo could place U.S. proliferation strategies into the ash heap of history and call for more drastic military options, not excluding preemptive war, defenses, and counter-deterrent special operations. In addition, an eight-sided nuclear arms race in Asia would increase the likelihood of accidental or inadvertent nuclear war. It would do so because: (1) some of these states already have histories of protracted conflict; (2) states may have politically unreliable or immature command and control systems, especially during a crisis involving a decision for nuclear first strike or retaliation; unreliable or immature systems might permit a technical malfunction that caused an unintended launch, or a deliberate but unauthorized launch by rogue commanders; (3) faulty intelligence and warning systems might cause one side to misinterpret the other’s defensive moves to forestall attack as offensive preparations for attack, thus triggering a mistaken preemption.<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">But in Beijing, both Chinese and American officials and analysts have another explanation: the long silence epitomizes the speed with which relations between Washington and Beijing have plunged into a freeze. This year has witnessed the longest period of tension between the two capitals in a decade. And if anything, both sides appear to be hardening their positions.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">“The issues that used to be on the positive side of the ledger are increasingly on the negative side of the ledger, starting with North Korea,” Bonnie Glaser, a China scholar at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview last week. “I don’t think this is easily repairable, and I think we’re going to have a fairly cold relationship over the next two years, and potentially longer.”</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Mr. Obama came into office seeking just the opposite: a new rapprochement with a rising power whose deep economic ties with the United States all but demand closer diplomatic ones. But the days when the White House spoke of a “G-2” that would manage the world economy and more, a phrase that preceded the first meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu in the depths of the financial crisis in early 2009, are long over.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Instead, he faces a problem very similar to the one Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton described in March 2009 during a lunch with Kevin Rudd, a China expert who was then Australia’s prime minister, according to a cable recounting their conversation that was in a newly released trove of WikiLeaks documents.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Mrs. Clinton was said to have asked Mr. Rudd, “How do you deal toughly with your banker?”‘</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The latest bad sign is that cooperation on managing North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, which began with considerable promise in 2009, appears to have disintegrated.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">On Monday, Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to convene an emergency meeting in Washington with her Japanese and South Korean counterparts about both the North’s shelling of a South Korean island last month, and its recent disclosure of a new nuclear facility that potentially expands its nuclear arsenal. China, the only nation with real sway over the North Korean leadership, will not be there.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">To the contrary, China’s strategy on North Korea is at odds with that of Washington and its allies. In Monday’s telephone call with Mr. Hu, the White House said, Mr. Obama said North Korea’s new enrichment facility flouted commitments it made during the six-party talks on curbing its nuclear program, and urged China’s help in sending “a clear message to North Korea that its provocations are unacceptable.”</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">One former Chinese official with close ties to the government dismissed the American approach last week as characteristically legalistic. The former official, who would not be named because he is not authorized to speak on the topic, said China’s strategy is to reassure the Koreans about their security, not lecture them about diplomatic obligations.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Indeed, China’s strongest public reaction to last month’s shelling of South Korea has not been to condemn the North, but to criticize Washington’s response — joint war games with South Korea that put the American carrier George Washington and its strike force in the Yellow Sea, off China’s borders.</span></span><br />

But American engagement may not be enough. The PRC could play a particularly important role in dissuading the North from its nuclear course. Indeed, H.D.S. Greenway of the Boston Globe has advocated building on &quot;the new climate of U.S.-Chinese cooperation of late.&quot; 94 Such a strategy would offer at least one additional benefit. Working together to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis successfully would make it easier to resolve other disputes between Washington and Beijing, thereby laying the groundwork for a wide-ranging partnership in the years and decades ahead. Nevertheless, the most important and immediate goal remains halting nuclear proliferation in Northeast Asia. <br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The stakes on the Korean peninsula could not be higher. If Presidents Hu and Obama are able to return to the cooperation of 2009, their joint efforts will impart to Pyongyang the clear costs of its actions, as well as inhibit additional risk taking by North Korea. It will also demonstrate that U.S.-China cooperation on crucial regional security issues is possible. If the leaders fail in these efforts, the dangers of 2010 will continue and deepen, and the risks of a wider conflict will grow.</span></span><br />

Sphere of influence concessions are key to relations<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Obama administration has explicitly sought to “reset” the relationship with Russia, which had become quite dysfunctional during the final years of the Bush administration. Although Washington has not used the reset terminology with respect to the troubled U.S. relationship with China, the substantive goal appears to be similar. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates’ effort to restore the dialogue between the militaries of the two countries is one indication of that intent.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Both goals, however, are encountering headwinds for a key reason. Policy makers seem unwilling to accept the reality that any great power in the international system expects, and will seek to enforce, a sphere of influence in its immediate region. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice famously (or infamously) insisted that the concept of a sphere of influence was both obsolete and pernicious. But that viewpoint is dangerously erroneous. The tensions between the United States and Russia and those between the United States and China confirm that point.</span></span><br />

<em>The evolution of Sino-U.S. relations over the next months, years, and decades has the potential to have a greater impact on global security and prosperity than any other bilateral or multilateral arrangement. In this sense, many analysts consider the US.-China diplomatic relationship to be the most influential in the world. Without question, strong and stable U.S. alliances provide the foundation for the protection and promotion of U.S. and global interests. Yet within that broad framework, the trajectory of U.S.-China relations will determine the success, or failure, of efforts to address the toughest global challenges: global financial stability, energy security and climate change, nonproliferation, and terrorism, among other pressing issues. Shepherding that trajectory in the most constructive direction possible must therefore be a priority for Washington and Beijing. Virtually no major global challenge can be met without U.S.-China cooperation. The uncertainty of that future trajectory and the &quot;strategic mistrust&quot; between leaders in Washington and Beijing necessarily concerns many experts and policymakers in both countries. Although some U.S. analysts see China as a strategic competitor—deliberately vying with the United States for energy resources, military superiority, and international political influence alike— analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has generally found that China uses its soft power to pursue its own, largely economic, international agenda primarily to achieve its domestic objectives of economic growth and social stability.1 Although Beijing certainly has an eye on Washington, not all of its actions are undertaken as a counterpoint to the United States. In addition, CSIS research suggests that growing Chinese soft power in developing countries may have influenced recent U.S. decisions to engage more actively and reinvest in soft-power tools that have atrophied during the past decade. To the extent that there exists a competition between the United States and China, therefore, it may be mobilizing both countries to strengthen their ability to solve global problems. To be sure, U.S. and Chinese policy decisions toward the respective other power will be determined in large part by the choices that leaders make about their own nations interests at home and overseas, which in turn are shaped by their respective domestic contexts. Both parties must recognize—and accept—that the other will pursue a foreign policy approach that is in its own national interest. Yet, in a globalized world, challenges are increasingly transnational, and so too must be their solutions. As demonstrated by the rapid spread of SARS from China in 2003, pandemic flu can be spread rapidly through air and via international travel. Dust particulates from Asia settle in Lake Tahoe. An economic downturn in one country can and does trigger an economic slowdown in another. These challenges can no longer be addressed by either containment or isolation. What constitutes the national interest today necessarily encompasses a broader and more complex set of considerations than it did in the past As a general principle, the United States seeks to promote its national interest while it simultaneously pursues what the CSIS Commission on Smart Power called in its November 2007 report the &quot;global good.&quot;3 This approach is not always practical or achievable, of course. But neither is it pure benevolence. Instead, a strategic pursuit of the global good accrues concrete benefits for the United States (and others) in the form of building confidence, legitimacy, and political influence in key countries and regions around the world in ways that enable the United States to better confront global and transnational challenges. In short, the global good comprises those things that all people and governments want but have traditionally not been able to attain in the absence of U.S. leadership. Despite historical, cultural, and political differences between the United States and China, Beijing's newfound ability, owing to its recent economic successes, to contribute to the global good is a matter for common ground between the two countries. Today there is increasing recognition that no major global challenge can be addressed effectively, much less resolved, without the active engagement of—and cooperation between—the United States and China. The United States and China—the worlds first- and third-largest economies—are inextricably linked, a fact made ever more evident in the midst of the current global financial crisis. Weak demand in both the United States and China, previously the twin engines of global growth, has contributed to the global economic downturn and threatens to ignite simmering trade tensions between the two countries. Nowhere is the interconnectedness of the United States and China more clear than in international finance. China has $2 trillion worth of largely U.S. dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves and is the world's largest holder—by far—of U.S. government debt. Former treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson and others have suggested that the structural imbalances created by this dynamic fueled the current economic crisis. Yet. China will almost certainly be called on to purchase the lion's share of new U.S. debt instruments issued in connection with the U.S. stimulus and recovery package. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's February 23.2009, reassurance to Beijing that U.S. markets remain safe and her call for continued Chinese investment in the U.S. bond market as a means to help both countries, and the world, emerge from global recession underscored the shared interest—and central role—that both countries have in turning around the global economy quickly. Although China's considerable holdings of U.S. debt have been seen as a troubling problem, they are now being perceived as a necessary part of a global solution. Similarly, as the worlds two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and the United States share not only the collateral damage of energy-inefficient economic growth, but a primary responsibility to shape any ultimate global solutions to climate change. To date, cooperation has been elusive, owing as much to Washington's reluctance as to Beijing's intransigence. Painting China as the environmental bogeyman as an excuse for foot-dragging in policymaking is no longer an option; for its part, China, as the world's top polluter, must cease playing the developing-economy card. Yet energy security and climate change remain an area of genuine opportunity for joint achievement. Indeed, U.S.-China cooperation in this field is a sine qua non of any response to the energy and climate challenges. The sheer size of the Chinese economy means that collaboration with the United States could set the de facto global standards for etficiency and emissions in key economic sectors such as industry and transportation. Climate change also provides an area for cooperation in previously uncharted policy waters, as in emerging Arctic navigational and energy exploration opportunities. Washington and Beijing also share a deep and urgent interest in international peace and stability. The resumption of U.S.-China military contacts is a positive development. As two nuclear powers with worldwide economic and strategic interests, both countries want to minimize instability and enhance maritime security, as seen by parallel antipiracy missions in the waters otT Somalia. Joint efforts in support of United Nations peacekeeping, nonproliferation, and counterterrorism offer critical areas for bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Certainly, regional and global security institutions such as the Six-Party Talks concerning North Korea or the UN Security Council require the active engagement of both Washington and Beijing. Even more broadly, crisis management in geographic regions of mutual strategic interest like the Korean peninsula, Iran, or Burma require much more Sino-U.S. communication if the two countries are to avoid miscalculation and maximize opportunities to minimize human sutfering. Increasing the number of mid-level military-to-military exchanges would help in this regard. The United States and China could do more to cooperate on law enforcement to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in Western China. Afghanistan is competing with Burma as the main provider of narcotics to China; Washington could use its influence with the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul to develop a joint antinarcotics program. This could potentially build networks and joint capabilities that might be useful for U.S.-China cooperation on the issue of Pakistan. In addition, Washington should also encourage NATO-China cooperation along the Afghan border. Collaborating under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) might provide an additional framework for Beijing and Washington to address Central Asian security issues in a cooperative manner. 1he SCO, which includes Pakistan as an observer and will convene a multinational conference on Afghanistan in March 2009, has long made curbing narcoterrorism in Afghanistan a priority. In addition, the VS. Drug Enforcement Agency and the Chinese Anti-Narcotics Bureau should expand cooperation on interdiction and prosecution of heroin and meth traffickers. To be sure, there are a number of areas of serious divergence between Washington and Beijing. This should surprise no one. The United States has disagreements with even its allies. Two large powers with vastly dilferent histories, cultures, and political systems are bound to have challenges. History has shown, however, that the most effective way of addressing issues is for the U.S. and Chinese governments to engage in quiet diplomacy rather than public recrimination. In the U.S.-China context, there is often little to be gained—and much to be lost in terms of trust and respect—by a polarizing debate. Any differences, moreover, must not necessarily impede Sino-U.S. cooperation when both sides share strong mutual interests. I;. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that &quot;the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.&quot;3 Effective policy toward China by the United States, and vice versa, will require this kind of dual-minded intelligence. Moreover, working together on areas of mutual and global interest will help promote strategic trust between China and the United States, facilitating possible cooperation in other areas. Even limited cooperation on specific areas will help construct additional mechanisms for bilateral communication on issues of irreconcilable disagreement. In fact, many of the toughest challenges in U.S.-China relations in recent years have been the result of unforeseen events, such as the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999 and the EP-3 reconnaissance plane collision in April 2001. Building trust and finding workable solutions to tough problems is the premise behind the Obama administrations foreign policy of smart power, as articulated by Secretary of State Clinton. Smart power is based on, as Secretary Clinton outlined in her confirmation hearing, the fundamental belief that 'We must use... the full range of tools at our disposal—diplomatic, economic, military, political and cultural—picking the right tool, or combination of tools, for each situation.&quot;' As the CS1S Commission on Smart Power noted in November 2007, &quot;Smart Power is neither hard nor soft—it is the skillful combination of bothIt is an approach that underscores the necessity of a strong military, but also invests heavily in alliances, partnerships and institutions at all levels... .°5 As such, smart power necessarily mandates a major investment in a U.S.-China partnership on key issues. 'The concept enjoys broad support among the Chinese and American people and, by promoting the global good, it reaps concrete results around the world. There should be no expectation that Washington and Beijing will or should agree on all, or even most, questions. But the American and Chinese people should expect their leaders to come together on those vital issues that require their cooperation. U.S.-China partnership, though not inevitable, is indispensable.</em><br />

Because the United States and China are the world’s top two greenhouse gas emitters, together accounting for more than 40% of annual emissions, any solution requires both countries to transition to low-carbon economies.

<em>In 2004, Stephen Pacala and Robert Socolow at Princeton Uni­versity published an article in</em> Science <em>that showed how annual carbon emissions from fossil fuels could be held at 7 billion tons instead of rising to 14 billion tons over the next 50 years, as would occur with business as usual. The goal of Pacala, an ecol­ogist, and Socolow, an engineer, was to prevent atmospheric CO2 concentrations, then near 375 ppm, from rising above 500 ppm. They described</em> IS <em>ways, all using proven technologies, that by</em> 20S4// could each cut carbon emissions by 1 billion tons per year. Any seven of these options could be used together to pre­vent an increase in carbon emissions through 2054. Pacala and Socolow further theorize that advancing technology would allow for annual carbon emissions to be cut to 2 billion tons by 2104, a level that can be absorbed by natural carbon sinks in land and oceans. The Pacala/Socolow conceptualization has been extraordi­narily useful in helping to think about how to cut carbon emis­sions. During the three years since the article was written, the urgency of acting quickly and on a much larger scale has become obvious. We also need now to go beyond the conceptu­al approach that treats all potential methods of reducing carbon emissions equally and concentrate on those that are most prom­ising. Researchers such as James Hansen, a leading climate scien­tist at NASA, believe that global warming is accelerating and may be approaching a tipping point, a point at which climate change acquires a momentum that makes it irreversible. They think we may have a decade to turn the situation around before this threshold is crossed. I agree.?3 We often hear descriptions of what we need to do in the decades ahead or by 2050 to avoid &quot;dangerous climate change,&quot; but we are already facing this. Two thirds of the glaciers that feed the Yellow and Yangtze rivers of China will disappear by 2060 if even the current 7 percent annual rate of melting con­tinues. Glaciologists report that the Gangotri glacier, which supplies 70 percent of the ice melt that feeds the Ganges River during the dry season, could disappear entirely in a matter of decades.74 What could threaten world food security more than the melt­ing of the glaciers that feed the major rivers of Asia during the dry season, the rivers that irrigate the region's rice and wheat fields? In a region with half the world's people, this potential loss of water during the dry season could lead not just to hunger but to starvation on an unimaginable scale. Asian food security would take a second hit because its rice­-growing river deltas and floodplains would be under water. The World Bank tells us that a sea level rise of only 1 meter would inundate half of the riceland in Bangladesh. While a 1-meter rise in sea level will not happen overnight, what is worrisome is that if ice melting continues at today's rates, at some point such a rise in sea level will no longer be preventable. The melting that would cause this is not just what may happen if the earth's tem­perature rises further; this is something that is starting to hap­pen right now with the current temperature. As summer neared an end in 2007, reports from Greenland indicated that the flow of glaciers into the sea had accelerated beyond anything glaciologists had thought possible. Huge chunks of ice weighing several billion tons each were breaking off and sliding into the sea, causing minor earthquakes as they did so.!6 With melt-water lubricating the surface between the glaciers and the rocks on which they rested, ice flows were accelerating, flowing into the ocean at a pace of 2 meters an hour. This accel­erated flow, along with the earthquakes, shows the potential for the entire ice sheet to break up and collapse?? Beyond what is already happening, the world faces a risk that some of the feedback mechanisms will begin to kick in, fur­ther accelerating the warming process. Scientists who once thought that the Arctic Ocean could be free of ice during the summer by 2100 now see it occurring by 2030. Even this could turn out to be a conservative estimate.78 This is of particular concern to scientists because of the albedo effect, where the replacement of highly reflective sea ice with darker open water greatly increases heat absorbed from sunlight. This, of course, has the potential to further accelerate the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. A second feedback loop of concern is the melting of per­mafrost. This would release billions of tons of carbon, some as methane, a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming effect per ton 25 times that of carbon dioxide.79 The risk facing humanity is that climate change could spiral out of control and it will no longer be possible to arrest trends such as ice melting and rising sea level. At this point, the future of civilization would be at risk. This combination of melting glaciers, rising seas, and their effects on food security and low-lying coastal cities could over­whelm the capacity of governments to cope. Today it is largely weak states that begin to deteriorate under the pressures of mounting environmental stresses. But the changes just described could overwhelm even the strongest of states. Civilization itself could begin to unravel under these extreme stresses.<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The U.S.-South Korea alliance forms the cornerstone of the South's national security and diplomacy. But China is South Korea's largest trading partner, and it also has a huge influence on peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula. The time has come for Seoul to factor into its diplomacy and security policies both China and its intensifying competition with the U.S.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The code word for &quot;containment&quot; in the Asian press, by the way, is &quot;Cold War atmosphere&quot;.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The message that the Time article was meant to send was that the U.S. Navy are now devoted to defining, countering, and to some extent creating a Chinese threat in the Pacific in order to preserve the scale of its forces and protect its budget. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Chinese government, given the concerted efforts by the Obama adminstration to rollback China's influence throughout the world diplomatically and economically as well as militarily, will undoubtedly draw more sweeping conclusions.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">I would take issue with two statements in Williams' article.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">First, especially but not exclusively on the issue of the Korean peninsula, the U.S. is there as an unbalancer, not a &quot;balancer&quot; as Bonnie Glaser put it. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The tilt away from the Six Party Talks structure including China to a strengthened ROK-USA security condominium is a signal that a Western response to instability on the peninsula, be it from &quot;provocations&quot; or the demise of Kim Jung Il, will not include China as an equal partner.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The U.S. media has largely ignored the vitriolic response in the Chinese press to America's military moves, but the Chinese clearly see that the pendulum has swung away from stability--with the U.S. presence precluding a rush to rearmament by Japan---to containment.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Containment, to China, implies that the U.S. will continue to fan fears of China's military ambitions to encourage the rise of India and the the creation of pro-American governments and policies throughout Asia and turn a blind eye or, even worse, extend an enabling hand to Asian states that develop adventurist ambitions in challenging China on the issue of the uninhabited but contested islands that dot the region.</span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">I guess we'll find out if the Obama administration has a long-term plan sees an upside in a near-open breach of relations with China beyond giving the opportunity for the U.S. to play to its military strength in Asia and cooperate with local political leaders like South Korea's Lee Myung-bak, who want to use Washington as a counterweight to Beijing. </span></span><br />

Containment causes a self-fulfilling prophecy that guarantees war throughout Asia<br />

Accompanying all these diplomatic initiatives has been a vigorous, if largely unheralded, effort by the Department of Defense (DoD) to bolster US military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. The broad sweep of US strategy was first spelled out in the Pentagon's most recent policy assessment, the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), released on February 5. In discussing long-term threats to US security, the QDR begins with a reaffirmation of the overarching precept first articulated in the DPG of 1992: that the United States will not allow the rise of a competing superpower. This country &quot;will attempt to dissuade any military competitor from developing disruptive or other capabilities that could enable regional hegemony or hostile action against the United States&quot;, the document states. It then identifies <span class="il">China</span> as the most likely and dangerous competitor of this sort. &quot;Of the major and emerging powers, <span class="il">China</span> has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States and field disruptive military technologies that could over time offset traditional US military advantages&quot; - then adding the kicker - &quot;absent US counter-strategies.&quot; According to the Pentagon, the task of countering future Chinese military capabilities largely entails the development, and then procurement, of major weapons systems that would ensure US success in any full-scale military confrontation. &quot;The United States will develop capabilities that would present any adversary with complex and multidimensional challenges and complicate its offensive planning efforts,&quot; the QDR explains. These include the steady enhancement of such &quot;enduring US advantages&quot; as &quot;long-range strike, stealth, operational maneuver and sustainment of air, sea and ground forces at strategic distances, air dominance, and undersea warfare&quot;. Preparing for <span class="il">war</span> with <span class="il">China</span>, in other words, is to be the future cash cow for the giant US weapons-making corporations in the military-industrial complex. It will, for instance, be the primary justification for the acquisition of costly new weapons systems such as the F-22A Raptor fighter, the multi-service Joint Strike Fighter, the DDX destroyer, the Virginia-class nuclear attack submarine, and a new intercontinental penetrating bomber - weapons that would just have utility in an all-out encounter with another great-power adversary of a sort that only <span class="il">China</span> might someday become. In addition to these weapons programs, the QDR also calls for a stiffening of present US combat forces in Asia and the Pacific, with a particular emphasis on the US Navy (the arm of the military least used in the ongoing occupation of and <span class="il">war</span> in Iraq). &quot;The fleet will have a greater presence in the Pacific Ocean,&quot; the document notes. To achieve this, &quot;The navy plans to adjust its force posture and basing to provide at least six operationally available and sustainable [aircraft] carriers and 60% of its submarines in the Pacific to support engagement, presence and deterrence.&quot; Since each of these carriers is, in fact, but the core of a large array of support ships and protective aircraft, this move is sure to entail a truly vast buildup of US naval capabilities in the Western Pacific and will certainly necessitate a substantial expansion of the US basing complex in the region - a requirement that is already receiving close attention from Admiral Fallon and his staff at PACOM. To assess the operational demands of this buildup, moreover, this summer the US Navy will conduct its most extensive military maneuvers in the Western Pacific since the end of the Vietnam <span class="il">War</span>, with four aircraft-carrier battle groups and many support ships expected to participate. Add all of this together, and the resulting strategy cannot be viewed as anything but a systematic campaign of containment. No high administration official may say this in so many words, but it is impossible to interpret the recent moves of Rice and Rumsfeld in any other manner. From Beijing's perspective, the reality must be unmistakable: a steady buildup of US military power along <span class="il">China</span>'s eastern, southern and western boundaries. How will <span class="il">China</span> respond to this threat? For now, it appears to be relying on charm and the conspicuous blandishment of economic benefits to loosen Australian, South Korean, and even Indian ties with the United States. To a certain extent, this strategy is meeting with success, as these countries seek to profit from the extraordinary economic boom now under way in <span class="il">China</span> - fueled to a considerable extent by oil, gas, iron, timber, and other materials supplied by <span class="il">China</span>'s neighbors in Asia. A version of this strategy is also being employed by President Hu Jintao during his current visit to the United States. As <span class="il">China</span>'s money is sprinkled liberally among such influential firms as Boeing and Microsoft, Hu is reminding the corporate wing of the Republican Party that there are vast economic benefits still to be had by pursuing a non-threatening stance toward <span class="il">China</span>. <span class="il">China</span>, however, has always responded to perceived threats of encirclement in a vigorous and muscular fashion as well, and so we should assume that Beijing will balance all that charm with a military buildup of its own. Such a drive will not bring <span class="il">China</span> to the brink of military equality with the United States - that is not a condition it can realistically aspire to over the next few decades. But it will provide further justification for those in the United States who seek to accelerate the containment of <span class="il">China</span>, and so will produce a self-fulfilling loop of distrust, competition and crisis. This will make the amicable long-term settlement of the Taiwan problem and of North Korea's nuclear program that much more difficult, and increase the risk of unintended escalation to full-scale <span class="il">war</span> in Asia. There can be no victors from such a conflagration.<br />

U.S. influence is ineffective and dead – arms races are inevitable now – the advantages solve<br />
Dyer 12/15—retired US Naval intelligence officer who served around the world, afloat and ashore, from 1983 to 2004 (J. E., 15 December 2010, “Hot Times in the Far East”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/j-e-dyer/384331" rel="nofollow">http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/j-e-dyer/384331</a>, RBatra)<br />
Japan’s announcements on defense this month figure collectively as the augury of a seminal shift. It’s not all that unusual for Tokyo to announce an increase in the size of the Japan Self-Defense Force (JSDF). But the reason invoked on this occasion amounts to a crack in the foundation of the U.S.-guaranteed security regime in the Far East. Japan plans to reorient its defense policy toward the emerging threat from China — and plans, in general, to defend its interests against Chinese and North Korean threats<br />
more proactively than at any time since 1945.<br />
The Japanese will officially abandon the Cold War–era “basic defense doctrine,” which provided for territorial defense but not for the projection of military power beyond Japan’s recognized borders. Besides adding more submarines to the fleet, they will look at a military build-up in the southern chain of Japanese islands, near the Senkaku archipelago disputed with China. And on Sunday, Prime Minister Naoto Kan startled South Koreans by telling an audience that Japan would consider changing JSDF policy to allow for the deploying of troops to South Korea to rescue Japanese citizens.<br />
The point here is not that any such move by Japan is suspicious. The point is that Japan perceives the need for a new, more active security posture. The tacit U.S. guarantee since World War II has been a balance in the Far East: the three great powers there — Russia, China, and Japan — held in check with a network of alliances and military presence. In the past two decades, however, the U.S. has failed to effectively counter what are arguably the most important threats to stability in the region: Chinese maritime aggression and the North Korean nuclear-weapons program. Against that backdrop, the Obama administration’s determined reliance on China to deal with North Korea looks — from the Asian side of the Pacific — like ceding China too much power. If America will not broker a balanced stasis, Russia and China will arm themselves for emerging opportunities, and everyone else will follow suit.<br />
Meanwhile, Russia is probing and making shows of force wherever possible. The intrusion of Russian patrol aircraft in the naval exercise held by the U.S. and Japan last week was remarkable for the fact that it was an actual intrusion. Military aircraft monitor foreign exercises all the time, but usually from a distance. The Russian planes approached so closely last week that the exercise was suspended while fighters were scrambled to intercept them.<br />
The Nixon administration concluded a 1972 agreement with Soviet Russia to avoid such provocations in air and naval activity. Indeed, it was Nixon who, during the same period, re-established relations with China, returned Okinawa to Japan, and signed landmark defense agreements with Thailand and the Philippines. He hoped that these measures, desirable in their own right, would contribute to an environment of stabilized tension in which the two Vietnams could coexist. Although the hopes for Vietnam were dashed, his larger arrangements have stood for nearly 40 years. But they will not last much longer. The older pattern that obtains in the absence of U.S. power is reasserting itself.<br />

Contention One<br />
<br />
Contention one is an examination of the construction of identity. We are situating this debate in the heart of a genealogy of gender, race, and desire—these categories are inherently the effects of institutions, practices, and discourses with multiple points of origin. However, Rishee and I begin its deconstruction from a specific, local situation—the military connection with identity construction in the Asian Pacific occurs within a unique cultural context<br />

<br />
An examination of the prostitution around U.S. bases in the Asian Pacific and the way the soldier/prostitute relationships are constructed is helpful at this point in at least two ways. First, it allows us to see how the Asian Pacific woman and &quot;Military Man&quot; archetypes function together, in a context where the archetypal qualities of each construct are likely to be most apparent. Second, such systems of prostitution are examples of the dysfunctional social policy that results from the &quot;Military Man&quot; construct and the culture that has evolved to sustain it. Thus, the following section will provide a brief overview of the <br />
historical connection between prostitution and the U.S. military in this century. n118 Next, the Article will focus on prostitution around U.S. bases in the Asian Pacific in particular. n119 Finally, the Article will briefly highlight how the colonialistic context of prostitution around U.S. bases in the Asian Pacific exacerbates the cultural dynamics already reflected in military prostitution. 1. &quot;A Dirty Racket&quot; n121 Prostitution and the military have a long mutual history. n122 From the early 1900s until the United States' participation in World War I, the U.S. Army was undeniably connected to prostitution and brothels around its bases on the Mexico/U.S. border. n123 For example, Army officers on the U.S. side of the border required local prostitutes to be inspected once every two weeks or so by Army medical officers. n124 After each inspection, the women received certificates attesting to their sexual health. n125 Army officers of troops stationed in Mexico went even further by creating an Army-sponsored prostitution district. n126 Thus, the Army deliberately provided its soldiers with access to (hetero)sexual services, &quot;on the assumption that it was necessary for the contentment and well-being of the men.&quot; n127 During this same time period, a similar situation existed around U.S. military posts in the Philippines. n128 In 1902, every military post in the Philippines had brothels, and the women who worked there were required to undergo weekly VD inspections by military doctors. n129 While such systems of regulated military prostitution may be more the norm than the exception, n130 such prostitution has not always had the blessing of the U.S. military. n131 In fact, earlier in this century, some military and government officials worked hard, albeit unsuccessfully, to stamp out prostitution around military bases for health and morality reasons. n132 In the end, however, the &quot;traditional military attitude that men required sex to be good soldiers&quot; could not be eradicated. That attitude is readily apparent today in and around U.S. bases everywhere, n134 but particularly in Asia. n135 2. The Rest and Recreation Racket The place where I spent many an evening when I could get away from the war was the Hung Dao Hotel, a three-story, dilapidated shack in ... Saigon. [On t]he first floor ... [the hotel's owners] had rolled about ten beds into it. The second floor was the kinkier stuff, so they had little rooms. That was also for officers or people who just wanted to fuck alone. The whores cooked and lived on the third floor .... There was one girl who was about twelve years old who was great. She was one of my favorites. n136 He [Navy Seaman Marcus Gill] said they cruised the streets [in the rental car] ... looking for a woman to rape .... The sailor said [Marine Pfc. Rodrico] Harp spotted the girl going into a stationary store, and that [Marine Pfc. Kendrick] Ledet suggested ambushing her. Gill also said the two Marines bound the girl with tape, and pulled her shorts and underwear down to her ankles.... Gill said that after he raped the girl, Ledet asked, &quot;How was she?&quot; ... then made a remark suggesting that the girl had enjoyed it. Police later found a plastic bag in a trash can containing three pairs of bloodstained men's underwear, a notebook and duct tape. n137 I think it was absolutely stupid ... I've said several times, for the price they paid to rent the car, they could have had a girl. n138 Despite a history that includes efforts to promote celibacy among its soldiers, the U.S. military's policy on prostitution is fairly apparent. n139 As described above, U.S. military prostitution has existed in the Philippines since the turn of the century. n140 In addition, both the Korean and Vietnam wars contributed significantly to the proliferation of such prostitution. n141 During the Vietnam War, the United States signed &quot;Rest and Recreation&quot; or &quot;Rest and Recuperation&quot; (R&amp;R) n142 agreements with Thailand, Hong Kong and the Philippines, in which the governments of these countries agreed to provide R&amp;R centers for U.S. military personnel. n143 As one researcher noted, &quot;the connection between prostitution and the armed forces reached its zenith&quot; with the establishment of large U.S. bases in Thailand and the Philippines. n144 The case of the Philippines is particularly illustrative. n145 In the Philippines, prostitution is illegal and was illegal when the U.S. operated bases there. n146 The U.S. closed the last of its bases in the Philippines in 1992. n147 Prior to that time, however, in Olongapo City, for example (neighboring city to Subic Naval Base), there were approximately 9,000 women registered with the Social Hygiene Clinic (SHC) as &quot;hospitality women,&quot; a euphemism for women who sell sexual labor, n148 and an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 more unregistered workers. n149 The SHC itself was a joint project of the Olongapo City Health Department, which provided the facilities and paid the employees, and the U.S. Navy, which provided medicine and technical assistance. The system worked as follows. When a woman was hired to work in the &quot;entertainment industry&quot; (in a bar, massage parlor, or other establishment), she was required to register for a &quot;Mayor's Permit&quot; that indicated she was healthy, allowing her to work legally. If more than 25% of the women at any given establishment were unregistered, the establishment was declared off-limits to Navy servicemen by military authorities. n152 Military police also enforced the system by preventing women from soliciting servicemen on their own, ensuring that women would have to work through the system. n153 Further, women were required to produce their permits on demand by the military police and customers. n154 Many of the bars and entertainment establishments were owned by Navy retirees. n155 A similar registration system exists in South Korea (where prostitution is also illegal). n156 There, each bar area serving U.S. servicemen has a VD clinic, operated by the Korean Ministry of Health. n157 Ostensibly, the U.S. military has nothing to do with the operations of the Korean VD clinics and does not fund them. n158 However, when one researcher wanted to interview someone from the clinic administration in Tong Du Chun (which is near Camp Casey), she had to get permission from U.S. military officials at the base, and two U.S. military personnel monitored the interview. n159 During the Vietnam War, &quot;as the American presence ... multiplied, the unspoken military theory of women's bodies as not only a reward of war but as a necessary provision ... turned into routine practice.&quot; A system of military brothels had already been implemented by the French before Americans arrived. Just as the United States inherited the war from the French, it also inherited its military brothel system. One war correspondent saw the United States' gradual takeover of military-controlled and regulated brothels as a natural consequence of what he called the &quot;McNamara theory&quot;: U.S. troops should be kept happy and satisfied with ice cream, movies, pizza, laundry service, and maids who often doubled as prostitutes. By 1966, three Army divisions had established official military brothels within their bases, in the areas of An Khe (1st Calvary Division), Lai Khe (1st Infantry Division), and Pleiku (4th Infantry Division). n165 Similar &quot;strips&quot; sprang up wherever there were U.S. bases. n166 The involvement of high ranking Army officers in the building of these brothels demonstrates that they existed with the blessing of the Department of Defense. n167 Furthermore, similar to the set-up in the Philippines, the U.S. military &quot;kept its hands partially clean&quot; by only dealing with the control and regulation of health and security features of the trade in women that supplied its brothels (Army medics weekly swabbed and checked the women for VD). n168 Procurement was left to Vietnamese civilians, n169 who &quot;recruited&quot; women who were war refugees or who were from the Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) bar trade. n170 However, the U.S. military was directly involved in fee control, at least at the Pleiku site. n171 There, if the women tried to charge more than the official rate of about $ 3.00 per day, the military police would declare the establishment off-limits. n172 In addition to the military prostitution systems described above, the United States also had bases and R&amp;R agreements with Thailand and Japan. While the U.S. military may not control or regulate prostitution in Thailand, there is no doubt that the Thai military is deeply implicated. In addition, the case of Thailand shows two of the far-reaching ramifications of military prostitution: sex tourism and child prostitution. When the Vietnam War ended, the withdrawal of American troops left behind an R&amp;R industry with insufficient customers. Thus, Thailand re-oriented its &quot;leisure policies&quot; towards a wider international market of increasingly globally mobile corporate professionals. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - n177. See Vicki F. Li, Child Sex Tourism to Thailand: The Role of the United States as a Consumer Country, 4 Pac. Rim L. &amp; Pol'y J. 505, 510-11 (1995). Just as sex tourism has been an outgrowth of the R&amp;R phenomenon, so has increased child prostitution been the outgrowth of sex tourism. See id. Tellingly, both the Philippines and Thailand, areas where U.S. military-related prostitution had strong presences, are internationally known for their child prostitution industry. See Dunn, supra note 144, at 17. At least in the case of Thailand, there is a general concurrence by non-governmental organizations that the United States is one of the three major sources of sex tourists and pedophiles. See Li, supra, at 505 n.4. The other two countries are Germany and Australia. See id. Child prostitution is also a legacy of the Navy's presence in the Philippines. See Edward A. Gargan, Traffic in Children Is Brisk (Legacy of the Navy?), N.Y. Times, Dec. 11, 1997, at A3 (describing efforts to end child prostitution in the Philippines). <br />

The category of “Man” is unstable – yet military institutions and practices vigilantly police the category of what and who meets the criteria for manhood – this causes lashouts of racial and sexual exploitation and constructs others in order to do violence onto them<br />

As the above demonstrates, the construction of the military masculine identity is largely based on the exclusion of others who are perceived to be &quot;nonmale&quot; in some crucial way. Because this identity requires the juxtaposition of some other identity (e.g., female, gay male, Black male) in order to define itself, it cannot stand alone. It is an inherently unstable identity and requires vigilant policing. In this way, it is also an inherently oppressive identity, not only to those used as the &quot;others&quot; to negatively define the &quot;Military Man,&quot; but also to those who appear to fit the bill - those straight, white males. In developing this identity, military culture tries to establish that there are clear boundaries between who is &quot;in&quot; and who is &quot;out,&quot; - if you are a &quot;man,&quot; then you are definitively not a &quot;queer,&quot; or a &quot;girl,&quot; or a &quot;sissy,&quot; or a &quot;boy&quot; (i.e., Black), or a &quot;gook.&quot; In reality, however, these boundaries are unclear and cannot be consistently relied upon, leading such men to act in inappropriate or dysfunctional ways. As one writer phrased it, &quot;Men, taken as a whole, do not treat women very well, but they do not treat each other very well either.&quot; n88 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - n83. See, e.g., Francke, supra note 11, at 158 &amp; n.31 (describing a study that showed boys on Little League teams &quot;proved their budding heterosexual identities&quot; by using sexist, homophobic, and racist language about girls and other boys not in the group); Kimmel, supra note 19, at 44 (noting that exclusion of others is a dominant theme in the history of American masculinity); Exclusion, supra note 13, at 169-70 (noting that distinguishing a sub-group of soldiers as some kind of &quot;other&quot; (e.g., as fat, gay or drug users) is a way for the larger group to reaffirm its identity as &quot;real soldiers&quot;); Benecke &amp; Dodge, supra note 68, at 217-21 (discussing the link between discrimination against women in the military with discrimination between gays and lesbians); Morris, supra note 16, at 716-17 (&quot;The masculinity that is definitive of the military in-group is, not surprisingly, defined in contrast to the &quot;other' .... An unmistakable hostility is directed toward this other.&quot;). n84. Kimmel describes the function served by non-white men, working class men, immigrant men, gay men and women as that of a screen against which &quot;true&quot; manhood has been constructed by the projections of men's fears about their masculinity; with the removal of this &quot;screen,&quot; Kimmel suggests this construction has become incoherent. See Kimmel, supra note 19, at 6, 280. Together feminism, black liberation, and gay liberation provided a frontal assault on the traditional way that men had defined their manhood - against an other who was excluded from full humanity by being excluded from those places where men were real men. It was as if the screen against which American men had for generations projected their manhood had suddenly grown dark, and men were left to sort out the meaning of masculinity all by themselves. Id. Hamamoto notes that Asian characters in television programs often fulfill this &quot;screen&quot;-like function vis-a-vis white characters, serving as &quot;semantic markers that reflect upon and reveal telling aspects of the Euro-American characters alone.&quot; Hamamoto, supra note 34, at 206. n85. See Beneke, supra note 16, at 43 (describing the need to prove one's manhood as a need that can never be fully satisfied, because doubts constantly resurface). n86. For example, a common initiation procedure on Navy ships called the &quot;shellback ritual&quot; involves men feigning anal sex with new male initiates, the pressing of new male initiates' faces into the groins of higher-ranking sailors, and ends with the new male initiates being stripped nude. Shilts, supra note 13, at 400-02. These activities are not considered &quot;gay,&quot; but are an accepted part of the male Navy experience. See id. There is also an inherent tension between &quot;gookism&quot; and the presence of Asian Pacific Americans in the military. See Yoshimura, supra note 51, at 28-29 (describing the efforts of one Asian Pacific American soldier to get approval to marry a Vietnamese woman from his superior officers, who sought to discourage him by telling him he would regret the marriage after he returned to the United States and could see &quot;round-eyed&quot; white women again; and describing how this same soldier was &quot;called a gook and was made to stand in front of his platoon as an example of &quot;what the enemy ... looked like.'&quot;). n87. For example, the instability of these boundaries leads some men to sexually harass women under their command; to abuse and exploit prostitutes; to fear and hate lesbian/bi/gay people; to use racial epithets or view people of other races or ethnicities as inferior. See Kimmel, supra note 19, at 330-31 (describing men's responses to civil rights activism by women, men of color, and immigrants as ranging from &quot;angry resistance&quot; to &quot;defensive retreat,&quot; often accompanied by emphasis on male sexual prowess). One commentator suggests that sexism and masculinity have been a &quot;catastrophe&quot; for men because they hamper the ability of men to acknowledge how their own lives have been limited by sexism. Beneke, supra note 16, at xii. He also notes that homophobia limits the ability of straight men to live full lives because of the effort required to ensure that they appear sufficiently masculine and thus not gay. See id. at 154-55; see also Kimmel, supra note 19, at 333-34. <br />

There is no “doer behind this deed” – the doer is in fact produced by the deed. In producing the identity of “Asian Pacific Women” as a binary other the identity of “Military Man” itself is produced.<br />

Asian Pacific women are usually depicted as the ideal counterpoint/counterpart to the Western white male. This depiction is based on stereotypes that simultaneously emphasize race, culture and sex, linking them to create a purely (hetero)sexual persona with overtones of cultural inferiority and inherent, natural subordination. In short, the Asian Pacific woman is the &quot;exotic erotic&quot; whose purpose is to serve, support and sacrifice for the man at the center of her universe. n98 Asian Pacific women tend to be stereotyped in two main ways: as either &quot;duplicitous &quot;dragon ladies'&quot; or &quot;Lotus Blossom Babies&quot;; the latter includes such images as the China Doll, Geisha Girl, and the &quot;pretty prostitute[ ] performing hara-kiri for [her] white lord.&quot; Generally, the latter image (Asian woman as &quot;sexual-romantic object&quot;) is the most prominent one. In this version of the stereotype, Asian Pacific women are &quot;for the most part, passive figures who exist to serve men.&quot; In addition, this stereotype embodies extreme notions of patriarchal femininity: &quot;These &quot;Oriental Flowers' are utterly feminine, delicate, and welcome respites from their often loud, independent American counterparts.&quot; One sees this image particularly in mail-order bride literature, and among mail-order bride customers. In a discussion of Asian images in the media, Darrell Hamamoto describes the character of Soon-Lee in the television series AfterMash. n106 Soon-Lee represents the &quot;now familiar social type&quot; of the Asian War Bride. n107 She is the ideal companion or wife for white American males who prefer &quot;traditional&quot; women .... In recent years ... any number of &quot;dating&quot; and marriage services [have appeared] that promise to deliver compliant overseas Asian women to men in search of alternatives to native-born Americans who might have been exposed to the virus of feminism. n108 Whether she is an &quot;Oriental flower&quot; or a &quot;dragon lady,&quot; however, the stereotypical Asian woman's existence is completely male-centered. The Asian woman is either serving and pleasing her (white) man, as with the geisha girl image; or she is in cahoots with him (in this case, usually an Asian man) in some diabolical plot, often while manipulating him for her own needs, as in the &quot;dragon lady&quot; image. n109 Furthermore, both types of images incorporate a highly (hetero)sexualized element, or &quot;variations on the exotic erotic.&quot; &quot;Bad&quot; Asian women are &quot;sexual provocateurs&quot;; &quot;good&quot; Asian women are &quot;childlike, submissive, silent, and eager for sex&quot; - with men. The Asian Pacific woman is as male-centered in her sexual preference as she is in the other aspects of her existence, so that she becomes the ultra-heterosexual representation of female sexuality. In the eyes of the white Western world, her &quot;social existence is subsumed by her heterosexual being.&quot; In short, the stereotype of the Asian woman is built around the presence of a man - whether she is serving him, seducing him, loving him or simply part of the context in which he acts, the key ingredient is the man, especially a white, Western man. Finally, one of the most telling aspects of the Asian woman stereotype for the purposes of this Article is that she is often depicted as a &quot;spoil[ ] of the last three wars fought in Asia.&quot; As one Asian Pacific American scholar explains: Because of several wars between the United States and Asian countries and the subsequent military occupation centers, American G.I.s have extensive experience with Asian prostitutes. Even though many kinds of Asian women inhabit the world around military bases, the stereotype is pervasive that all young Asian women are prostitutes, and that stereotype is projected even onto Asian Americans. Deconstructing the stereotypes of Asian Pacific women provides a better understanding of the extent to which stereotypes of Asian women are intimately linked to the &quot;Military Man,&quot; for this deconstruction reveals that in a real sense, as the above quotation exemplifies, these stereotypes are the constructions of military men. Soldiers' experiences with Asian Pacific women as prostitutes both generate and reinforce these stereotypes. In turn, these stereotypes facilitate the perpetuation of systems of military prostitution around U.S. bases in the Asian Pacific because the military is accustomed to viewing the local women as prostitutes. The existence of these systems, however, also demonstrates that the military is accustomed to viewing its soldiers as men who use prostitutes. These systems reveal that the process of construction is not uni-dimensional: at the same time that military culture constructs Asian Pacific women as prostitutes, it also constructs its soldiers in the image of the &quot;Military Man.&quot; As I demonstrate below, these two constructions are necessarily interdependent. <br />

The other defines the subject—especially in the context of Asian Pacific women<br />

<br />
In this way, the Asian Pacific (prostituted) woman serves as the antithesis to the thesis of military masculinity. Constructions of bi/gay/lesbians serve a different but compatible oppressive function. Stereotypes of both Asian Pacific women and lesbians/gays/bis serve to maintain the outer boundaries of military masculinity, for both groups represent &quot;not men&quot; within military culture. Asian Pacific women are the epitome of &quot;not men&quot; because they represent &quot;ultra women,&quot; (i.e., they are female, non-white, receptive, weak, submissive and oriented towards men - white men in particular - both sexually and emotionally). Gays are &quot;not men&quot; because they are gay; lesbians are &quot;not men&quot; because they are female, and furthermore they are unnatural females because they also exhibit the &quot;male&quot; characteristic of being sexually attracted to women. Thus, all of these groups can be and are used to shape the military masculine identity through contrast - they are the &quot;others&quot; that define the subject. <br />
<br />
“Asian Pacific Prostitute” and “Military Man” identities are effects of a phallogo-centric institution – these identities are intimately tied to enforcement of “compulsory heterosexuality” and causes submission to the “Military Man”.<br />
Ralston ’98, B.A. in East Asian Studies from Yale, J.D. from Iowa (Julie Yuki, Law and Inequality, Summer, p. 661, twm) <br />
<br />
As the prototypical woman - small, fragile, submissive, predominately heterosexual and completely male-centered and male-dominated - the stereotypical Asian woman is the perfect foil for the exaggerated masculinity of the American &quot;Military Man.&quot; She is small, weak, submissive and erotically alluring. Her purpose is to serve men and to be sexually consumed by them. This perception of Asian Pacific women is exaggerated by the systems of prostitution perpetuated around U.S. military bases in Asian Pacific countries, where Asian Pacific women may be registered and tagged like domestic pets. In short, the Asian Pacific woman becomes the archetypal sexual object. This relationship between military masculinity and the Asian Pacific (prostituted) woman reveals the extent to which the &quot;Military Man&quot; is defined by his power to sexually dominate and conquer others. In the archetypal world, when the &quot;Military Man&quot; has sex with an Asian Pacific (prostituted) woman, his masculinity is both reinforced and defined within and against her &quot;otherness.&quot; She represents the racial inferiority of non-whites, the sexual inferiority of women, and the heterosexuality that makes her sexual submission to the &quot;Military Man&quot; natural and justified. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br />

The United States military presence in South Korea and Japan reify the “Military Man” identity and enforce hyper-masculinity—colonialism, race, gender, and class are all implicated. This oppression is historically linked to the Indian male, as compared to British masculinity during the colonialist period—in this debate, Rishee himself represents the victim of “Military Man” identities.<br />

IDENTITIES: RACIALIZATION OF MASCULINITIES AND FEMININITIES<br />
Ashis Nandy has written on the impact of British colonialism on colonizer and colonized alike.52 An underdeveloped heart, he discovered, chilled both parties. The colonizer aimed to justify his violence against the Other, while the colonized sought to prove his manhood to the former. The resulting exaggerated or hyper-masculinity denigrated all associations with femininity: women, feelings, intellection, welfare, and homosexuality. The interaction between British colonialism and Indian culture, Nandy emphasized, brought out recessive strains in each. Within Indian culture, hyper-masculinity brought to the foreground a stylized, warrior esthete that elites used to mimic British manhood. Within British culture, hyper-masculinity heightened undercurrents of sexism, racism, and a false sense of cultural homogeneity that invariably spilled into “banal” violence for release. Over time, these recessive strains became dominant and naturalized in both cultures. So, too, peacekeeping shares with colonialism the capacity to reconstruct identities. Peacekeeping not only “keeps the peace”—that is, ensures the containment of violence—but it also configures race, gender, class, and culture to suit the hyper-masculine, propertied classes of the neo-liberal world order. Jan Jindy Pettman, for instance, notes the re-masculinization of the Australian government vis-à-vis Asia when sending peacekeeping troops to East Timor.53 She cites an interview with Prime Minister John Howard in which he celebrates Australia’s renewed military muscle in East Timor, thereby shaking off the previous administration’s pro-Asian, “appeasement” policies even while serving as “deputy sheriff” in the region for the United States. (Howard later retracted this statement.) “We are European,” Howard stated, “[We are part of] Western civilization with strong links to North America but here we are in Asia...”54 Indeed, the fantasy of a Western, hyper-masculinized Self rescuing the Native, (frequently a feminized Other), has long preoccupied colonial imagery.55 Historically, White men have “liberated” native women, to justify Western colonialism and imperialism in the guise of virile benevolence.56 One oft-cited motivation for the Bush administration to “liberate” Afghanistan and Iraq, for example, is to improve the lives and welfare of the local women. Interestingly, the administration made no such commitment to women in the United States or those in Afghanistan and Iraq before 9/11.57 Because such “liberation” typically conflates conquest with desire – whether it is defined as national security, monetary reward, or sexual release—prostitution and sex trafficking become an almost logical conduit. As Cynthia Enloe and Louise Olsson have argued, peacekeepers use prostitutes and exploit women like any other soldier during wartime, although international conventions distinguish regular soldiers from UN peacekeepers.58 For example, the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC)—a peacekeeping mission to Cambodia from 1992-1993—increased local prostitution in Phnom Penh 3.5 times during its stay, with 25 percent of its peacekeepers returning home HIV positive.59 During UN missions to Somalia, the local community broadcast all over the world pictures of a Somali woman who seemed “too friendly” to the French soldiers.60 Race, class, and sexuality figure centrally in peacekeepers’ constructions of power and sex in the field. When UN peacekeepers find themselves in receiving countries, they “draw on and sustain ... a national mythology in which bodies of color [women and men] are imagined as outside the nation and white men become the normative citizens.”For some peacekeepers, “race is a form of pleasure in one’s body that is articulated by [and] through humiliation of the Other.”62 Many have critiqued peacekeeping’s colonialist logic. Partha Chatterjee highlights peacekeeping’s normative underpinnings. Like other transnational projects, such as women’s rights, these projects stem from a “moral-cultural drive to spread ‘modernity’ throughout the world.”Indeed, Chatterjee claims, peacekeeping serves “as an external check on the sovereign powers of the nation-state...[Peacekeeping constitutes] a global civil society assessing the incomplete modernity of particular national political formations.”Sherene Razack bluntly calls peacekeeping a “civilizing mission” whose “moral terrain” is firmly anchored in the first world. Despite this, most peacekeepers fervently believe in their role as containing the chaos wrought by natives in their localities, especially in post-conflict societies. “[We saw our mission as] putting the region of Somalia back on the path to a normal lifestyle” admitted, Colonel Labbe, a Canadian peacekeeper. Humanitarian efforts easily turn into naked aggression when the recipients of peacekeeping do not seem duly grateful. Canadian peacekeepers, commenting on why they killed so many Somalis, the very people they were sent to protect, reveal the violence behind peacekeeping: “I never saw a starving Somali. I never saw a grateful Somali.” “We were sent to help them, and they did nothing to help us.” “They were not even appreciative of the work we were doing for them. They just kept destroying everything [we] were building and I think that was the turning point really, for me anyhow. It was one of the big turning points against the Somalis, around mid February. I went from feeling sorry for them down to being fed up, thinking, ‘Let’s get out’. They brought it all on themselves.” Even within this construct of the Self as Peacekeeper “white mythologies” operate. Peacekeepers who were men of color felt pressure to conform to the implicit white standard in the field (“we are superior, you are barbaric”). An Aboriginal peacekeeper in the Canadian mission rationalized his killing of Somalis through two orders of racialized masculinity: “The white man feared the Indian. So, too, will the black man.” For these peacekeepers with uncertain access to dominance in the hierarchy of racialized masculinities and sexualities, their enactment of violence shows that they, too, qualify as men.<br />
<br />
The ideal of peace is simply the latest justifications for the “Military Man” identity and makes the negative complicit in its construction. The politicizing of rape and violence wages a total war upon the Orient and projects gendered notions of culture onto Asian Pacific women, masking the root causes of oppression.<br />

Where there are soldiers, there are women who exist for them. This is practically a cliché. History is filled with examples of women as war booty and “camp followers,” their bodies being used for service labor of various kinds, including sex. Contrary to common assumptions in the West, prostitution is not “part of Asian culture.” Just about every culture under the sun has some version of it during times of war and times of peace. In some ways, military prostitution (prostitution catering to, and sometimes organized by, the military) has been so commonplace that people rarely stop to think about how and why it is created, sustained, and incorporated into military life and warfare. Academic interest and analysis of this issue gained momentum only in the last twenty years and still remains scant and sporadic. Even as interest in women and gender as categories of analysis has increased in many academic disciplines, there is still a question of intellectual “legitimacy,” that is, whether prostitutes, prostitution, and sex work warrant “serious” scholarly attention and resources, especially for students of international politics. After all, it is a highly “personal” and therefore “subjective” matter and prone toward the proverbial “he said/she said” contestation. To boot, many have turned the feminist emphasis on women and agency on its head by glibly claiming that most military prostitutes sought out the work and life of their own free will and therefore are exercising their agency. In this view, it is primarily about women’s personal decisions and responsibility to face the consequences; governments and other institutions of society need not be held accountable. Filipino activists from the Gabriela women's organization wearing cut-outs of the four accused US Marines of rape, pose standing behind bars in Manila, 23 November 2006. For decades, key leaders of Asian women’s movements such as Takazato Suzuyo of Okinawa and Matsui Yayori, the well-known Japanese journalist and feminist activist, Aida Santos and women’s organizations like GABRIELA of the Philippines have argued to the contrary. They documented and insisted that U.S. military prostitution in Okinawa/Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines involve a complex “system” of central and local government policies, political repression, economic inequalities and oppression of the underclass, police corruption, debt bondage of women by bar owners, in addition to pervasive sexist norms and attitudes in both the U.S. military and the respective Asian society. In the 1970s and 1980s, when Asian feminists raised these connections, they tended to fault patriarchal and sexist values together with power inequalities emanating from them and the economic and political disparities among nations. Such individuals and organizations also emphasized the compromised sovereignty of their own governments in relationship with the more powerful U.S. government and military, resulting in the compromised rights and dignity of the Korean, Okinawan, Filipina and other women who “serviced” American military (male) personnel. Aida Santos, a long-time activist opposing U.S. military bases in the Philippines (and later the Visiting Forces Agreement) wrote in the early 1990s that in the Philippines, “[r]acism and sexism are now seen as a fulcrum in the issue of national sovereignty.”[1] Such activists made the case that the personal is indeed political and international. [2] “Olongapo Rose,” a 1988 documentary film by the British Broadcasting Corporation about U.S. military prostitution in the Philippines graphically depicts the various political, economic, cultural, and racial “systems” at work. Even under authoritarian rule in the 1970s, Filipinas did not hesitate to speak up and campaign nationally and internationally against the Philippines authorities and the U.S. military for abetting and condoning the physical, sexual, and economic exploitation and violence against women who worked in the R&amp;R industry along Olongapo and Subic Bay, where U.S. forces had been stationed until the early 1990s. But in Korea, even progressive activists of the 1970s and 1980s, who fought against military dictatorship, labor repression, and the violation of human rights overlooked military prostitution as a political issue. For one, they had their plates full, challenging the Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo Hwan regimes. Second, as much as some activists criticized the dominant role of the United States in the alliance relationship, others were loath to attack a fundamental institution that safeguarded Korean security. Of course, the legal system was stacked against them. With the National Security Law squarely in place, critics of the U.S. military or the alliance could be thrown into prison, tortured, or killed. Third, military prostitutes were so beneath the political radar screen of most progressives because the women themselves were viewed as “dirty,” lowest of the low, and “tainted” because they slept with foreign soldiers. A highly puritanical and moralistic sense of ethnonationalism among most Koreans had exiled Korean military prostitutes from the larger Korean society and political arena. It is common knowledge among military prostitutes and their advocates that the formers’ family often disowned them upon learning of their “shameful” lives. But in 1988, Yu Boknim, a Korean democracy activist, and Faye Moon, an American missionary and social activist became mavericks even among progressive dissidents by paying attention to the plight of the Korean gijichon (camptown) women. Together with the assistance of a handful of student activists and the financial support of some Protestant churches, they established Durebang (My Sister’s Place) in 1988 as a counseling center, shelter, and later bakery (to generate income for older women who had left the sex business and younger women who wanted to get out). But despite their efforts to raise awareness of the relationship between the presence of U.S. bases and the growth of this underclass of women and their Amerasian children, most of Korean society continued to ignore the women and their needs. Rather, Yu and Moon found increasing solidarity with their activist counterparts from the Philippines, Okinawa/Japan, and the United States as women began to organize around issues of sexual violence and slavery, militarism, and human rights in the Asia-Pacific. Currently, military prostitution in Korea has been transformed in line with global economic and migration trends. Foreign nationals, primarily from the Philippines and the former Soviet Union, have become the majority of sex-providers and “entertainers” for the U.S. troops. Young Korean women, with better education and economic and social opportunities than their mothers or grandmothers, are not available for such work. And they are not as easily duped by traffickers. In a more complex, globalized and multicultural sex industry environment, however, political and legal accountability for various problems and conflicts that both the prostitutes and the servicemen encounter become even more difficult to understand and more difficult for activists to target effectively. Nevertheless, on a day-to-day basis, hardworking advocacy organizations on behalf of the women, such as Saewoomtuh, continue to offer shelter, counseling, and health and legal assistance to the best of their ability.

I have learned through this project that it is possible to do contextual liberation theology of complex global problems. To do this at all, however, one must submit this work to those who experience these problems, and directly I have been gifted by several former sex workers in their willingness to read drafts of this book. I have changed what they wanted changed; I hold very dear several times when someone who has worked in the sex industry has read what we have written and looked at me in astonishment, ‘How could you know this?’ they ask. How can we know what anyone else suffers? It is possible to connect across considerable difference in sometimes unanticipated ways. We must also live with the knowledge that we can never completely bridge difference and fully know the pain and the joys of another.<br />

Sex Trafficking Narrative<br />

It has been asserted by studies that the growing share of women in foreign employment reflects the dynamics of demand in the host country. The presence of U.S. military bases in Korea is certainly a magnet for trafficking of Filipinas. There are reports that Filipinas are concentrated around the bases in Dongduchon-shi and and Pyont’aekshi where around 50 military recreation centers are established in each, and where American military service men usually go. These centers are locally called “foreigners club” but are actually, bars. An unwritten policy within the U.S. military force is to “keep the men happy,” as it considers sexualized recreation vital for the “morale” of troops. Studies in 1992 show that there are about 18,000 registered and 9,000 unregistered Korean women around the U.S. bases.<br />

Sex trafficking exists on the outer-most limits of human cruelty—only voting against this horrendous institution can preserve human dignity. Never again should anyone be subjected to the torture and humiliation experienced by Long Pross<br />
Kristof 9 (Nicholas D., 4 January 2009, “If This Isn’t Slavery, What Is?”, Lexis, RBatra)<br />
<br />
Anyone who thinks it is hyperbole to describe sex trafficking as slavery should look at the maimed face of a teenage girl, Long Pross.<br />
Glance at Pross from her left, and she looks like a normal, fun-loving girl, with a pretty face and a joyous smile. Then move around, and you see where her brothel owner gouged out her right eye.<br />
Yes, I know it's hard to read this. But it's infinitely more painful for Pross to recount the humiliations she suffered, yet she summoned the strength to do so -- and to appear in a video posted online with this column -- because she wants people to understand how brutal sex trafficking can be.<br />
Pross was 13 and hadn't even had her first period when a young woman kidnapped her and sold her to a brothel in Phnom Penh. The brothel owner, a woman as is typical, beat Pross and tortured her with electric current until finally the girl acquiesced.<br />
She was kept locked deep inside the brothel, her hands tied behind her back at all times except when with customers.<br />
Brothel owners can charge large sums for sex with a virgin, and like many girls, Pross was painfully stitched up so she could be resold as a virgin. In all, the brothel owner sold her virginity four times.<br />
Pross paid savagely each time she let a potential customer slip away after looking her over.<br />
''I was beaten every day, sometimes two or three times a day,'' she said, adding that she was sometimes also subjected to electric shocks twice in the same day.<br />
The business model of forced prostitution is remarkably similar from Pakistan to Vietnam -- and, sometimes, in the United States as well. Pimps use violence, humiliation and narcotics to shatter girls' self-esteem and terrorize them into unquestioning, instantaneous obedience.<br />
One girl working with Pross was beaten to death after she tried to escape. The brothels figure that occasional losses to torture are more than made up by the increased productivity of the remaining inventory.<br />
After my last column, I heard from skeptical readers doubting that conditions are truly so abusive. It's true that prostitutes work voluntarily in many brothels in Cambodia and elsewhere. But there are also many brothels where teenage girls are slave laborers.<br />
Young girls and foreigners without legal papers are particularly vulnerable. In Thailand's brothels, for example, Thai girls usually work voluntarily, while Burmese and Cambodian girls are regularly imprisoned. The career trajectory is often for a girl in her early teens to be trafficked into prostitution by force, but eventually to resign herself and stay in the brothel even when she is given the freedom to leave. In my blog, www.nytimes.com/ontheground, I respond to the skeptics and offer some ideas for readers who want to help.<br />
Pross herself was never paid, and she had no right to insist on condoms (she has not yet been tested for HIV, because the results might be too much for her fragile emotional state). Twice she became pregnant and was subjected to crude abortions.<br />
The second abortion left Pross in great pain, and she pleaded with her owner for time to recuperate<br />
<br />
. ''I was begging, hanging on to her feet, and asking for rest,'' Pross remembered. ''She got mad.''<br />
That's when the woman gouged out Pross's right eye with a piece of metal. At that point in telling her story, Pross broke down and we had to suspend the interview.<br />
Pross's eye grew infected and monstrous, spraying blood and pus on customers, she later recounted. The owner discarded her, and she is now recuperating with the help of Sina Vann, the young woman I wrote about in my last column.<br />

<strong>But the most far-fetched myth that I've encountered recently is that the wealth of the modern Western world, especially that of the United States, is the product of slavery. I first encountered this notion during a talk I gave in Toronto. I explained to the college-age audience how extraordinarily wealthy all of us are today compared to our preindustrial ancestors. I wanted them to understand the great benefits of capitalism. During the Q-&amp;-A session, a young woman informed me that the wealth we enjoy today is the product of slavery. At first I thought she was speaking figuratively, as in &quot;workers under capitalism really are slaves.&quot; Having heard such an argument before, I was half-expecting it. But no. What she meant is that the modern world's prosperity is the product of the pre-20th-century enslavement of Africans in the Americas. &quot;But slavery ended in the United States in 1863!&quot; I responded. &quot;Look at all the wealth produced since then -- telephones, automobiles, antibiotics, computers. None was built with slave labor.&quot; She anticipated my response. &quot;Not directly. But the capital that made these innovations possible was extracted from slave labor. The wealth accumulated by slaveholders is what financed the industrialization that makes today's wealth possible.&quot; I looked at her in raw disbelief. (Not a good strategy, by the way, for a public speaker.) Collecting my thoughts, I pointed out that slavery had been an ever-present institution throughout human history until just about 200 years ago. Why didn't slaveholders of 2,000 years ago in Europe or 500 years ago in Asia accumulate wealth that triggered economic growth comparable to ours? Why is Latin America so much poorer today than the United States, given that the Spaniards and Portuguese who settled that part of the world were enthusiastic slavers? Indeed, the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery was Brazil -- in 1888, a quarter-century after U.S. abolition. By American and western European standards, Brazil remains impoverished. And why, having abolished slavery decades before their Southern neighbors, were Northern U.S. states wealthier than Southern states before the Civil War?</strong><br />

<strong>Specifically, hip-hop fails to create social change—it just placates the population while elites take over</strong><br />
<strong>Gitlin 97—sociology, Columbia (Todd, The anti-political populism of cultural studies, Dissent; Spring, Vol. 44, Iss. 2; p 77, ProQuest, AMiles)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>From the late 1960s onward, as I have said, the insurgent energy was to be found in movements that aimed to politicize specific identities-racial minorities, women, gays. If the &quot;collective behavior&quot; school of once-conventional sociology had grouped movements in behalf of justice and democratic rights together with fads and fashions, cultural studies now set out to separate movements from fads, to take seriously the accounts of movement participants themselves, and thereby to restore the dignity of the movementsonly to end up, in the 1980s, linking movements with fads by finding equivalent dignity in both spheres, so that, for example, dressing like Madonna might be upgraded to an act of&quot;resistance&quot; equivalent to demonstrating in behalf of the right to abortion, and watching a talk show on family violence was positioned on the same plane. In this way, cultural studies extended the New Left symbiosis with popular culture. Eventually, the popular culture of marginal groups (punk, reggae, disco, feminist poetry, hip-hop) was promoted to a sort of counterstructure of feeling, and even, at the edges, a surrogate politics-a sphere of thought and sensibility thought to be insulated from the pressures of hegemonic discourse, of instrumental reason, of economic rationality, of class, gender, and sexual subordination. The other move in cultural studies was to claim that culture continued radical politics by other means. The idea was that cultural innovation was daily insinuating itself into the activity of ordinary people. Perhaps the millions had not actually been absorbed into the hegemonic sponge of mainstream popular culture. Perhaps they were freely dissenting. If &quot;the revolution&quot; had receded to the point of invisibility, it would be depressing to contemplate the victory of a hegemonic culture imposed by strong, virtually irresistible media. How much more reassuring to detect &quot;resistance&quot; saturating the pores of everyday life! In this spirit, there emerged a welter of studies purporting to discover not only the &quot;active&quot; participation of audiences in shaping the meaning of popular culture, but the &quot;resistance&quot; of those audiences to hegemonic frames of interpretation in a variety of forms-news broadcasts (Dave Morley, The `Nationwide ' Audience, 1980); romance fiction (Janice Radway, Reading the Romance, 1984); television fiction (Tamar Liebes and Elihu Katz, The Export of Meaning, 1990; Andrea Press, Women Watching Television, 1991); television in general (John Fiske, Television Culture, 1987); and many others. Thus, too, the feminist fascination with the fictions and talk shows of daytime &quot;women's television&quot;-in this view, the dismissal of these shows as &quot;trivial,&quot; &quot;banal,&quot; &quot;soap opera,&quot; and so on, follows from the patriarchal premise that what takes place within the four walls of the home matters less than what takes place in a public sphere established (not coincidentally) for the convenience of men. Observing the immensity of the audiences for Oprah Winfrey and her legions of imitators, many in cultural studies upended the phenomenon by turning the definitions around. The largely female audiences for these shows would no longer be dismissed as distracted voyeurs, but praised as active participants in the exposure and therefore politicizing of crimes like incest, spousal abuse, and sexual molestation. These audiences would no longer be seen simply as confirming their &quot;normality&quot; with a safe, brief, wellbounded, vicarious acquaintanceship with deviance. They could be understood as an avant-garde social movement. Above all, in a word, cultural studies has veered into populism. Against the unabashed elitism of conventional literary and art studies, cultural studies affirms an unabashed populism in which all social activities matter, all can be understood, all contain cues to the social nature of human beings. The object of attention is certified as worthy of such not by being &quot;the best that has been thought and said in the world&quot; but by having been thought and said by or for &quot;the people&quot;-period. The popularity of popular culture is what makes it interesting-and not only as an object of study. It is the populism if not the taste of the analyst that has determined the object of attention in the first place. The sociological judgment that popular culture is important to people blurs into a critical judgment that popular culture must therefore be valuable. To use one of the buzzwords of &quot;theory,&quot; there is a &quot;slippage&quot; from analysis to advocacy, defense, upward &quot;positioning.&quot; Cultural studies often claims to have overthrown hierarchy, but what it actually does is invert it. What now certifies worthiness is the popularity of the object, not its formal qualities. If the people are on the right side, then what they like is good. This tendency in cultural studies-I think it remains the main line-lacks irony. One purports to stand four-square for the people against capitalism, and comes to echo the logic of capitalism. The consumer sovereignty touted by a capitalist society as the grandest possible means for judging merit finds a reverberation among its ostensible adversaries. Where the market flatters the individual, cultural studies flatters the group. What the group wants, buys, demands is ipso facto the voice of the people. Where once Marxists looked to factory organization as the prefiguration of &quot;a new society in the shell of the old,&quot; today they tend to look to sovereign culture consumers. David Morley, one of the key researchers in cultural studies, and one of the most reflective, has himself deplored this tendency in recent audience studies. He maintains that to understand that &quot;the commercial world succeeds in producing objects. . . which do connect with the lived desires of popular audiences&quot; is &quot;by no means necessarily to fall into the trap . . . of an uncritical celebration of popular culture.&quot; But it is not clear where to draw the line against the celebratory tendency when one is inhibited from doing so by a reluctance to criticize the cultural dispositions of the groups of which one approves. Unabashedly, the populism of cultural studies prides itself on being political. In the prevailing schools of cultural studies, to study culture is not so much to try to grasp cultural processes but to choose sides or, more subtly, to determine whether a particular cultural process belongs on the side of society's angels. An aura of hope surrounds the enterprise, the hope (even against hope) of an affirmative answer to the inevitable question: Will culture ride to the rescue of the cause of liberation? There is defiance, too, as much as hope. The discipline means to cultivate insubordination. On this view, marginalized groups in the populace continue to resist the hegemonic culture. By taking defiant popular culture seriously, one takes the defiers seriously and furthers their defiance. Cultural studies becomes &quot;cult studs.&quot; It is charged with surveying the culture, assessing the hegemonic import of cultural practices and pinpointing their potentials for &quot;resistance.&quot; Is this musical style or that literary form &quot;feminist&quot; or &quot;authentically Latino&quot;? The field of possibilities is frequently reduced to two: for or against the hegemonic. But the nature of that hegemony, in its turn, is usually defined tautologically: that culture is hegemonic that is promoted by &quot;the ruling group&quot; or &quot;the hegemonic bloc,&quot; and by the same token, that culture is &quot;resistant&quot; that is affirmed by groups assumed (because of class position, gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on) to be &quot;marginalized&quot; or &quot;resistant.&quot; The process of labeling is circular, since it has been predetermined whether a particular group is, in fact, hegemonic or resistant. The populism of cultural studies is fundamental to its allure, and to the political meaning its adherents find there, for cultural studies bespeaks an affirmation of popularity tout court. To say that popular culture is &quot;worth attention&quot; in the scholarly sense is, for cultural studies, to say something pointed: that the people who render it popular are not misguided when they do so, not fooled, not dominated, not distracted, not passive. If anything, the reverse: the premise is that popular culture is popular because and only because the people find in it channels of desire pleasure, initiative, freedom. It is this premise that gives cultural studies its aura of political engagement-or at least political consolation. To unearth reason and value, brilliance and energy in popular culture is to affirm that the people have not been defeated. The cultural student, singing their songs, analyzing their lyrics, at the same time sings their praises. However unfavorable the balance of political forces, people succeed in living lives of vigorous resistance! Are the communities of African-Americans or AfroCaribbeans suffering? Well, they have rap! (Leave aside the question of whether all of them want rap.) The right may have taken possession of 10 Downing Street, the White House, and Congress-and as a result of elections, embarrassingly enough!-but at least one is engage in cultural studies. Consolation: here is an explanation for the rise of academic cultural studies during precisely the years when the right has held political and economic power longer and more consistently than at any other time in more than a half century. Now, in effect, &quot;the cultural is political,&quot; and more, it is regarded as central to the control of political and economic resources. The control of popular culture is held to have become decisive in the fate of contemporary societies-or at least it is the sphere in which opposition can find footing, find breathing space, rally the powerless, defy the grip of the dominant ideas, isolate the powers that be, and prepare for a &quot;war of position&quot; against their dwindling ramparts. On this view, to dwell on the centrality of popular culture is more than an academic's way of filling her hours; it is a useful certification of the people and their projects. To put it more neutrally, the political aura of cultural studies is supported by something like a &quot;false consciousness&quot; premise: the analytical assumption that what holds the ruling groups in power is their capacity to muffle, deform, paralyze, or destroy contrary tendencies of an emotional or ideological nature. By the same token, if there is to be a significant &quot;opposition,&quot; it must first find a base in popular culture-and first also turns out to be second, third, and fourth, since popular culture is so much more accessible, so much more porous, so much more changeable than the economic and political order. With time, what began as compensation hardened-became institutionalized-into a tradition. Younger scholars gravitated to cultural studies because it was to them incontestable that culture was politics. To do cultural studies, especially in connection with identity politics, was the politics they knew. The contrast with the rest of the West is illuminating. In varying degrees, left-wing intellectuals in France, Italy, Scandinavia, Germany, Spain and elsewhere retain energizing attachments to Social Democratic, Green, and other left-wing parties. There, the association of culture with excellence and traditional elites remains strong. But in the Anglo-American world, including Australia, these conditions scarcely obtain. Here, in a discouraging time, popular culture emerges as a consolation prize. (The same happened in Latin America, with the decline of left-wing hopes.) The sting fades from the fragmentation of the organized left, the metastasis of murderous nationalism, the twilight of socialist dreams virtually everywhere. Class inequality may have soared, ruthless individualism may have intensified, the conditions of life for the poor may have worsened, racial tensions may have mounted, unions and social democratic parties may have weakened or reached an impasse, but never mind. Attend to popular culture, study it with sympathy, and one need not dwell on unpleasant realities. One need not be unduly vexed by electoral defeats. One need not be preoccupied by the ways in which the political culture's center of gravity has moved rightward-or rather, one can put this down to the iron grip of the established media institutions. One need not even be rigorous about what one opposes and what one proposes in its place. Is capitalism the trouble? Is it the particular form of capitalism practiced by multinational corporations in a deregulatory era? Is it patriarchy (and is that the proper term for a society that has seen an upheaval in relations between women and men in the course of a half-century)? Racism? Antidemocracy? Practitioners of cultural studies, like the rest of the academic left, are frequently elusive. Speaking cavalierly of &quot;opposition&quot; and &quot;resistance&quot; permits-rather, cultivates-a certain sloppiness of thinking, making it possible to remain &quot;left&quot; without having to face the most difficult questions of political selfdefinition. The situation of cultural studies conforms to the contours of our political moment. It confirms-and reinforces-the current paralysis: the incapacity of social movements and dissonant sensibilities to imagine effective forms of public engagement. It substitutes an obsession with popular culture for coherent economic-political thought or a connection with mobilizable populations outside the academy and across identity lines. One must underscore that this is not simply because of cultural studies' default. The default is an effect more than a cause. It has its reasons. The odds are indeed stacked against serious forward motion in conventional politics. Political power is not only beyond reach, but functional majorities disdain it, finding the government and all its works contemptible. Few of the central problems of contemporary civilization are seriously contested within the narrow band of conventional discourse. Unconventional politics, such as it is, is mostly fragmented and self-contained along lines of racial, gender, and sexual identities. One cannot say that cultural studies diverts energy from a vigorous politics that is already in force. Still, insofar as cultural studies makes claims for itself as an insurgent politics, the field is presumptuous and misleading. Its attempt to legitimize the ecstasies of the moment confirms the collective withdrawal from democratic hope. Seeking to find political energies in audiences who function as audiences, rather than in citizens functioning as citizens, the dominant current in cultural studies is pressed willy-nilly toward an uncritical celebration of technological progress. It offers no resistance to the primacy of visual and nonlinear culture over the literary and linear. To the contrary: it embraces technological innovation as soon as the latest developments prove popular. It embraces the sufficiency of markets; its main idea of the intellect's democratic commitment is to flatter the audience. Is there a chance of a modest redemption? Perhaps, if we imagine a harder headed, less wishful cultural studies, free of the burden of imagining itself to be a political practice. A chastened, realistic cultural studies would divest itself of political pretensions. It would not claim to be politics. It would not mistake the academy for the larger society. It would be less romantic about the world-and about itself. Rigorous practitioners of cultural studies should be more curious about the world that remains to be researchedand changed. We would learn more about politics, economy, and society, and in the process, appreciate better what culture, and cultural study, do not accomplish. If we wish to do politics, let us organize groups, coalitions, demonstrations, lobbies, whatever; let us do politics. Let us not think that our academic work is already that.</strong><br />

<strong>In order for coalitions to be successful, there must be a clear understanding of what it means to be part of that particular group. Showing solidarity with the group does not merely mean sticking by one another. Individuals must coalesce around some notion of principled solidarity, a unity based on certain shared values and visions. As pointed out earlier, coalitions cannot be based on shared experience and certainly not on a shared fear of “the Man.” In a famous statement, the anti-Nazi peace activist Rev. Martin Niemöller states: When Hitler attacked the Jews I was not a Jew, therefore I was not concerned. And when Hitler attacked the Catholics, I was not a Catholic, and therefore, I was not concerned. And when Hitler attacked the unions and the industrialists, I was not a member of the unions and I was not concerned. Then Hitler attacked me and the Protestant church — and there was nobody left to be concerned.[1] Niemöller’s call to action is based on the fear that one could be the next target of oppression. We contend that this kind of fear may unite disparate groups of people for specific, short term campaigns, but it will not prove useful in the long run since it does not force individuals to see how an injury to one person affects everybody. Again, this is why we find empathy a really problematic concept. It does not force people to be personally invested in causes that do not immediately affect them, and thus will not take us very far. Chandra Talpade Mohanty beautifully articulates this same idea of principled solidarity in her introduction to Third World Women and the Politics of Feminism: I am suggesting, then, an ‘imagined community’ of third world oppositional struggles. ‘Imagined’ not because it is not ‘real’ but because it suggests potential alliances and collaborations across divisive boundaries, and ‘community’ because in spite of internal hierarchies within third world contexts, it nevertheless suggests a significant, deep commitment to what Benedict Anderson, in referring to the idea of the nation, calls ‘horizontal comradeship.’ … (I)t is not color or sex which constructs the ground for these struggles. Rather, it is the way we think about race, class, and gender – the political links we choose to make among and between struggles. (Mohanty 4) Coalitional politics, thus, must be based on a shared understanding of oppression.[2] Empathy (alone) cannot foster horizontal comradeship because it is, like sympathy, based on vertical, hierarchical power relations. What we need in lieu of empathy is a conscious disavowal of white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy.[3] Examining the ways in which we as individuals are constituted in and through interlocking, oppressive ideologies, as well as how we benefit from them, should lead to outrage and action on the part of all progressive individuals, not just those who are most obviously at the receiving end of the injustices. We must, furthermore, recognize that we are all disadvantaged by ideologies such as racism, sexism, and homophobia.</strong><br />

Once, US society was a nearly monolithic racial hierarchy, in which everyone knew &quot;his&quot; place. Today, nobody knows where he or she fits in the US racial order. Thirty years after the enactment of civil rights legislation, agreement about the continuing existence of racial subordination has vanished. The meaning of race has been deeply problematized. Why? Because the legacy of centuries of white supremacy lives on in the present, despite the partial victories of the 1960s. Because the idea of &quot;equality,&quot; it turned out, could be reinterpreted, rearticulated, reinserted in the business-as-usual framework of US politics and culture. Because that framework is extremely resilient and able to absorb political challenges, even fundamental and radical ones. Because the outlawing of formal discrimination, which was a crucial and immediate objective of the 1960s movements, did not mean that informal racist practices would be eradicated, or indeed even that anti-discrimination laws would be seriously enforced. And yet it would be inaccurate to say that the movement failed. In virtually every area of social life, the impact of the postwar racial mobilizations is plain to see (Jaynes and Williams 1989). Although in some sectors, like housing desegregation, massive efforts to transform an entrenched and complex pattern of racial discrimination were largely (though not entirely) defeated (Massey and Denton 1993), in other areas -- for example the desegregation of the armed forces (Moskos 1988, Butler 1980) -- really remarkable change occurred.<br />
<br />
Their argument elevates white supremacy to an all-pervasive force—this conceptual expansion hides the actual practice of racism and makes breaking it down more difficult<br />
<strong>*Andersen 3 – Margaret L. Andersen, Professor of Sociology and Women's Studies and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs at the University of Delaware, 2003, “Whitewashing Race: A Critical Perspective on Whiteness,” in White Out: The Continuing Significance of Racism, ed Doane &amp; Bonilla-Silva, p. 28</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Conceptually, one of the major problems in the whiteness literature is the reification of whiteness as a concept, as an experience, and as an identity. This practice not only leads to conceptual obfuscation but also impedes the possibility for empirical analysis. In this literature, &quot;whiteness&quot; comes to mean just about everything associated with racial domination. As such, whiteness becomes a slippery and elusive concept. Whiteness is presented as any or all of the following: identity, self-understanding, social practices, group beliefs, ideology, and a system of domination. As one critic writes, &quot;If historical actors are said to have behaved the way they did mainly because they were white, then there's little room left for more nuanced analysis of their motives and meanings&quot; (Stowe 1996:77). And Alastair Bonnett points out that whiteness &quot;emerges from this critique as an omnipresent and all-powerful historical force. Whiteness is seen to be responsible for the failure of socialism to develop in America, for racism, for the impoverishment of humanity. With the 'blame' comes a new kind of centering: Whiteness, and White people, are turned into the key agents of historical change, the shapers of contemporary America&quot; (1996b:153).</strong><br />
<strong>Despite noting that there is differentiation among whites and warning against using whiteness as a monolithic category, most of the literature still proceeds to do so, revealing a reductionist tendency. Even claiming to show its multiple forms, most writers essentialize and reify whiteness as something that directs most of Western history (Gallagher 2000). Hence while trying to &quot;deconstruct” whiteness and see the ubiquitousness of whiteness, the literature at the same time reasserts and reinstates it (Stowe 1996:77).</strong><br />
<strong>For example, Michael Eric Dyson suggests that whiteness is identity, ideology, and institution (Dyson, quoted in Chennault 1998:300). But if it is all these things, it becomes an analytically useless concept. Christine Clark and James O'Donnell write: &quot;to reference it reifies it, to refrain from referencing it obscures the persistent, pervasive, and seemingly permanent reality of racism&quot; (1999:2). Empirical investigation requires being able to identify and measure a concept— or at the very least to have a clear definition—but since whiteness has come to mean just about everything, it ends up meaning hardly anything.</strong><br />

<strong>Viewing white supremacy and the legacy of slavery as the inevitable historical drivers of oppression is counterproductive for black liberation</strong><br />
*Shelby 7 – Tommie Shelby, Professor of African and African American Studies and of Philosophy at Harvard, 2007, We Who Are Dark: The Philosophical Foundations of Black Solidarity<br />
<br />
One such pitfall deserves further comment. Many conceptions of black identity include, if only implicitly, an account of the nature of black oppression. In the black nationalist tradition, these narratives generally emphasize the pervasiveness of white supremacy. The legacy of slavery and current racism are treated as the primary obstacles to black flourishing, and shared narratives about racial oppression are reproduced as a part of black cultural heritage. To the extent that this cultural inheritance is embraced as an essential core of black identity itself, it could prove to be a self-imposed obstacle to black emancipation. Thus, for example, when a person accepts a particular analysis of the black condition as a black person as a feature of who he is and not just what he believes—this can lead him to be stubbornly resistant to changing his view of the nature and causes of the black condition in the face of overwhelming evidence. To change his mind about such fundamental social matters would be to him (though he may not consciously recognize it as such) not just a shift in opinion based on evidence but a tragic loss of self-identity, which few are willing to consider, let alone seriously countenance. Now when a whole community accepts a particular analysis of their collective condition as a necessary component of who they are as a people, this can make it extremely difficult for them to reevaluate their shared standing or to recognize differences in standing between the various subgroups within the community. The point here is that an uncritical attachment to a particular conception of blackness where this includes a common narrative about the social status and material conditions of the group can undermine the group's ability to arrive at an objective assessment of their shared problems and possible solutions. Given the need to distinguish between the impact on blacks' life prospects of current racism, historical racism, and nonracial social dynamics, it is essential that blacks not embrace a collective ethnocultural identity that collapses these distinctions or misconstrues their current significance. <br />
<br />
White supremacy isn’t a monolithic root cause---proximate causes determined through empirics are more likely---and their arg shuts off productive debate over solutions <br />
Shelby 7 – Tommie Shelby, Professor of African and African American Studies and of Philosophy at Harvard, 2007, We Who Are Dark: The Philosophical Foundations of Black Solidarity<br />
<br />
Others might challenge the distinction between ideological and structural causes of black disadvantage, on the grounds that we are rarely, if ever, able to so neatly separate these factors, an epistemic situation that is only made worse by the fact that these causes interact in complex ways wih behavioral factors. These distinctions, while perhaps straightforward in the abstract, are difficult to employ in practice. For example, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the members of a poor black community to determine with any accuracy whether their impoverished condition is due primarily to institutional racism, the impact of past racial injustice, the increasing technological basis of the economy, shrinking state budgets, the vicissitudes of world trade, the ascendancy of conservative ideology, poorly funded schools, lack of personal initiative, a violent drug trade that deters business investment, some combination of these factors, or some other explanation altogether. Moreover, it is notoriously difficult to determine when the formulation of putatively race-neutral policies has been motivated by racism or when such policies are unfairly applied by racially biased public officials.<br />
There are very real empirical difficulties in determining the specific causal significance of the factors that create and perpetuate black disadvantage; nonetheless, it is clear that these factors exist and that justice will demand different practical remedies according to each factor's relative impact on blacks' life chances. We must acknowledge that our social world is complicated and not immediately transparent to common sense, and thus that systematic empirical inquiry, historical studies, and rigorous social analysis are required to reveal its systemic structure and sociocultural dynamics. There is, moreover, no mechanical or infallible procedure for determining which analyses are the soundest ones. In addition, given the inevitable bias that attends social inquiry, legislators and those they represent cannot simply defer to social-scientific experts. We must instead rely on open public debate—among politicians, scholars, policy makers, intellectuals, and ordinary citizens—with the aim of garnering rationally motivated and informed consensus. And even if our practical decision procedures rest on critical deliberative discourse and thus live up to our highest democratic ideals, some trial and error through actual practice is unavoidable.<br />
These difficulties and complications notwithstanding, a general recognition of the distinctions among the ideological and structural causes of black disadvantage could help blacks refocus their political energies and self-help strategies. Attention to these distinctions might help expose the superficiality of theories that seek to reduce all the social obstacles that blacks face to contemporary forms of racism or white supremacy. A more penetrating, subtle, and empirically grounded analysis is needed to comprehend the causes of racial inequality and black disadvantage. Indeed, these distinctions highlight the necessity to probe deeper to find the causes of contemporary forms of racism, as some racial conflict may be a symptom of broader problems or recent social developments (such as immigration policy or reduced federal funding for higher education).<br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>Military presence enrages China and causes them to sell U.S. treasury bonds</strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Siow 10</strong>—East Asia bureau chief at Channel NewsAsia (Maria, 27 August 2010, A game of ships and bargaining chips, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4021:http://www.todayonline.com/Commentary/EDC100827-0000028/A-game-of-ships-and-bargaining-chips --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.todayonline.com/Commentary/EDC100827-0000028/A-game-of-ships-and-bargaining-chips" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/Commentary/EDC100827-0000028/A-game-of-ships-and-bargaining-chips</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4021 -->, RBatra)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">Rather, China is keeping an apprehensive eye on what it sees as a growing and more strident erosion of its own strategic military interest, and America's continued efforts in encircling China.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The US said on Sunday that the USS George Washington aircraft carrier will not participate in the US-South Korean joint military exercise early next month.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The joint anti-submarine exercise was scheduled in the waters west of the Korean Peninsula in order to send &quot;a message of deterrence against provocation by North Korea&quot;.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The exercise will focus on anti-submarine warfare tactics, techniques and procedures. Even though the carrier will not be taking part, it will &quot;operate in the waters around the Korean Peninsula in future exercises&quot;.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Next month's exercise comes on the heels of two earlier joint exercises. The first was held at the end of last month in the eastern waters, or the Sea of Japan, while the second took place last week in both the eastern waters and western waters, or the Yellow Sea.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Predictably, China expressed persistent and firm opposition to the foreign military presence in or around its coastal waters.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">While the temporary backing-off of the USS George Washington might seem like a US reprieve from further &quot;provoking&quot; China, Chinese analysts see the move merely as a provisional bargaining chip in the ongoing rivalry that is characteristic of US-China relations.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Many say the high-level military manoeuvres are aimed at exerting pressure on China on issues ranging from US-China trade disputes to the Iranian nuclear standoff and the revaluation of the Chinese currency.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">There is also the perception that regardless of whether North Korea was responsible for sinking the South Korean warship Cheonan, the US has emerged as the biggest beneficiary in the aftermath of the sinking.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Not only did allies Korea and Japan inch closer to the US, Washington has also reasserted its importance and superiority in the region, while sending an unmistakable signal to China that the US also has a strategic stake in the South China Sea.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">CHINA'S 'GOLDEN CARD'</span><br />
<span class="Underline">To counter what many see as encroaching US influence or even &quot;meddling&quot;, many within China have called on its government to bring into play one of its strongest bargaining chips - the country's massive hold on US treasury bonds amounting to about US$850 million ($1.16 billion).</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Several analysts have pointed out that getting rid of US treasury bonds would be more effective than any verbal warning. &quot;By resorting to this golden card, we can deter and allow the US to have a taste of China's big stick,&quot; wrote analyst Yang Qiwei.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">But essentially, Beijing has to shoulder a large part of the responsibility for the heightened military tensions in the region.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">While China clearly has its domestic and strategic considerations for not taking a tougher stand on North Korea over the sinking of the Cheonan, the reticence has, for all intents and purposes, given Washington the excuse to make its military presence felt in the region - a move which, admittedly, is not unwelcomed by countries jittery about China's growing economic and military influence.</span><br />

American companies may have forgotten what Henry Ford propounded when he first built his Model T: If you do not pay high enough wages to your workers, they can't afford to buy your product. One simple basis for that Bush boom is that China is recycling its US$100 billion-plus trade surplus with the US back into dollars, and especially into US Treasury bonds. Almost half of the US Treasury bonds are now owned in Asia. So China is financing Bush's bold economic experiment: running two or more wars simultaneously with a huge budget and trade deficit, and equally huge tax handouts for the richest Americans.<br />
One has to question the long-term economic rationale for China of putting its long-term assets into very low-interest bonds in a currency that has already dropped recently by a third - and is going to drop even more. It certainly makes strategic sense: if push came to shove over, for example, the Taiwan Strait, all Beijing has to do is to mention the possibility of a sell order going down the wires. It would devastate the US economy more than any nuclear strike the Chinese could manage at the moment.<br />

Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul A. Samuelson, for example, raised the specter of a &quot;truly global financial panic&quot; if countries funding the U.S. deficit, particularly China, decide their investments in U.S. Treasury securities are no longer safe. Similarly, Warren Buffett warned in The New York Times that side-effects of the current fiscal intervention could be as dangerous as the financial crisis recently averted -- in the form of inflation eroding the dollar's purchasing power.<br />
Preserving the dollar's strength has importance far beyond protecting American tourists from the shock of paying the equivalent of $25 for a hamburger in London or Tokyo. The U.S. dollar exchange rate is a key indicator of the nation's economic health relative to other countries. A declining dollar leaves Americans worse off by driving up the cost of living, making imports of manufactured goods and commodities more expensive, and reducing the value of foreign investments when converted to dollars.<br />

<span style="color: black;">Until recently, China's rapid economic growth was seen by many as a force for stability, but now its economic strength allied with big military spending is prompting second thoughts. &quot;The only thing we had before was the economic intertwining, and we know from experience prior to World War One that this does not guarantee stability,&quot; said Andrew Horvat, director of the Stanford Japan Center in Kyoto, western Japan, although he played down any view of East Asia as a military powder keg.

Other legislated DA earmarks in the FY2005 appropriations bill are smaller and more targeted: plant biotechnology research and development ($25 million), the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad program ($20 million), women’s leadership capacity ($15 million), the International Fertilizer Development Center ($2.3 million), and clean water treatment ($2 million). Interestingly, in the wording of the bill, Congress uses the term <em>shall</em> in connection with only two of these eight earmarks; the others say that USAID <em>should</em> make the prescribed amount available. The difference between <em>shall</em> and <em>should</em> may have legal significance—one is clearly mandatory while the other is a strong admonition—but it makes little practical difference in USAID’s need to comply with the congressional directive to the best of its ability. <br />

<strong><span style="color: black;">Lambro, 10</span></strong> <span style="color: black;">- Chief Political Correspondent for the Washington Times (Donald, “Obama's Fiscal Task Force Has Too Much to Handle,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://townhall.com/columnists/DonaldLambro/2010/02/23/obamas_fiscal_task_force_has_too_much_to_handle" rel="nofollow">http://townhall.com/columnists/DonaldLambro/2010/02/23/obamas_fiscal_task_force_has_too_much_to_handle</a>)</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">When presidents can't make the tough decisions on the vexing problems that confront government, they pass the buck by appointing a commission to come up with some answers. That's what President Obama did with his executive order to create a bipartisan task force to cut the budget deficit, which is expected to hit $1.6 trillion this year and can only be expected to rise under his spending policies. The president is essentially admitting he can't stop his spending addiction and needs counseling from one of those debt-resolution services people use when they have maxed out their credit cards. His task force is doomed to fail for a number of reasons. First and foremost, Congress is under no obligation to accept any of its proposals and probably won't. Democrats pushed legislation to set up a similar congressionally mandated commission, but the bill failed to draw necessary support when a group of Republican senators turned against it, discovering that the panel would attempt to cut the deficit by raising taxes on what remains an anemic economy still struggling to recover. That was a nonstarter. Polls show that a majority of American people are deeply troubled by the massive pileup in debts by this administration and this Congress, and want deficit reduction to be a major priority. But the Democratic majority is seemingly incapable of saying no to more spending. The pending health care bill, tipping the scales at $1 trillion, is the latest manifestation of this. Second, the Constitution gives Congress sole power over the federal government's spending levels. No outside, unelected body is going to be able to step into the breach to do what the president and the majority party in Congress refuse to do: slow down the growth in federal spending while the economy gets back on its feet and tax revenues begin rising again as a result of sustained increases in the nation's economic growth. When Obama's proposed task force plan foundered on Capitol Hill for lack of support, he set up one of his own. It was a stunning admission of his own inabilities to exert executive leadership over the federal budget. And it didn't exactly win rave reviews. &quot;President Obama's budget deficit task force is clever politics but poor leadership. Instead of drafting a responsible budget, he seeks to force Republicans to endorse wasteful spending and higher taxes, or be cast as obstructionists,&quot; writes University of Maryland economist Peter Morici in a recent critique of Obama's budgetary shell game. It's worth noting that the deficit under former President Bush, who Morici notes was &quot;no model of austerity,&quot; fell in fiscal 2007 to a mere $161 billion from over $400 billion, just before federal tax revenues plunged as a result of the Great Recession. Sharply declining tax revenues, the $700 billion bank bailout, Obama's now nearly $900 billion so-called stimulus package, and the Democrats' record-shattering omnibus budget bill that was loaded with unprecedented pork-filled earmarks drove the budget deficits to $1.4 trillion last year and to repeat -- because it bears endless repeating -- $1.6 trillion this year. When he unveiled his fiscal 2011 budget, the news media made much of his proposed freeze on non-defense discretionary spending. But it was delayed until next year at the earliest and in the end, wouldn't make even a dent in the deficit -- maybe $25 billion -- if Congress accepts his proposals. Obama isn't into budget cutting. He's into budget growing, and he's made this clear many times when he tells Americans that this or that big spending plan is &quot;paid for.&quot; What he means is that he will raise taxes to bring in more revenue to spend and eventually that means higher taxes on the middle class. That's what he expects from this presidential commission, and he emphasized it earlier this month in an interview with Bloomberg BusinessWeek. Despite his repeated vow throughout his 2008 presidential campaign that he would not raise taxes on individuals making less than $200,000 or households making less than $250,000, Obama now says he's &quot;agnostic&quot; about raising taxes on people making less. &quot;The whole point of it is to make sure that all ideas are on the table&quot; and that every option is considered, including tax increases, he said. In the end, whatever Obama's task force comes up with, it's going to run into a fiscal brick wall called weak economic growth, which means lower tax revenue receipts, which in turn means higher deficits than are presently forecast. </span><br />

Deficit Reduction Commission. Instead of proposing policies to bring long-term fiscal sustainability, the President has endorsed a commission to make recommendations for reform. Although deficit commissions can be useful, one appointed by the President would suffer from three weaknesses: 1. The commission's recommendations would not be guaranteed legislative &quot;fast track&quot; protections--or even a congressional vote at all; 2. If Congress does vote on these recommendations, such a vote will likely be held after the November election with a lame duck Congress; and 3. There is no indication that this commission would include any public hearings and thus be more likely to create its recommendations in a back room without public input. Putting it all together, this commission would likely become a partisan exercise that fails to bring down deficits and instead kicks the can down the road.<br />

<strong>Counterplan kills the ROK alliance</strong><br />

<br />
<span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">The first phase</span></span> of this policy <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">would involve unilateral reductions in U.S. troops</span></span>. The United States and South Korea should make a virtue of necessity by announcing a joint decision to reduce the level of U.S. noncombatant forces stationed in Korea as a gesture of goodwill towards the North and to seek a reciprocal and positive North Korean response. Such an approach was taken by President Roh Tae Woo in his 1990 New Year's address when he stated that the scope of the annual U.S.–South Korean military exercise known as &quot;Team Spirit&quot; would be cut by 10 percent. So far the North Korean response has been encouraging. We should pursue a similar political approach to likely reductions this year in U.S. forces. Following this initial reduction, the second phase would tie further U.S. troop cuts to concrete and meaningful steps by the North to reduce tension and military confrontation on the penin­sula. At a minimum, such measures would include North Korean acceptance of international inspections of the nuclear enrichment facility now under construction north of Pyongyang, as well as steps aimed at reducing the fear of and capability for surprise attack along the demilitarized zone (DMZ). The heavy concentration of North Korean troops—along with ammunition, fuel and bridging equipment—forward deployed along the DMZ is particularly threat­ening. Specific confidence-building measures to reduce that offen­sively oriented threat and create greater warning time within which American forces might be reintroduced would provide an opportu­nity to reduce U.S. forces further. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">Such a</span></span> two-track <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">framework</span></span> would place the U.S.-South Korean security alliance in the context of a forward-looking policy towards the North.

There are three reasons why the ROK-U.S. strategic alliance system is needed. First, it can work as an effective countermeasure against the struggle for regional hegemony between China and Japan as well as against new security threats. South Korea and the U.S. should cooperate even after the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue to deal with security threats in the 21st century, including terrorism, proliferation of WMDs, the humanitarian crisis, energy security and in minimizing the possibility of struggle for hegemony between China and Japan.<br />

<strong>Samuels, 99</strong> (Richard, Professor of International Relations – MIT, The U.S.-Japan Alliance: Past, Present, and Future, p. 6-7)<br />
<br />
The same forces that lead China and Japan into an adversarial relationship in the first place might well push them to the brink of war. From a U.S. perspective, this would be disastrous, for several reasons: -War between two of America’s largest trading partners would be devastating to the U.S. economy -U.S. involvement would be difficult to avoid in a war between a former ally and a former enemy -War between a nuclear power and a threshold nuclear power would push the envelope in new and disconcerting ways -War between the two would be (another) humanitarian disaster -Nuclearization in Japan would press both Koreas to do the same, and perhaps pressure other Asian nations to follow suite. Even if China and Japan did not go to war, a Cold War between the two great powers could impose high costs on the region, and indeed the globe, if the last simmering conflict between two giants on the world scene has taught us anything. At a minimum, the remarkable (and hard-earned) domestic politics stability in Japan would further unravel, creating even greater uncertainties for its foreign policy and its evolving role as provider of global public goods.<br />

<strong>Strong presidential overreach is critical to the global economy and preventing global wars</strong><br />

A weak president with an unclear mandate is bad news for the rest of the world. For better or worse, the person who rules the United States influences events far beyond the shores of his own country. Both the global economy and international politics will feel the effect of political instability in the US. The first impact will be on American financial markets, which will have a ripple effect on markets and growth across the world. A weakened US presidency will also be felt in global hotspots across the world. The Middle East, the conflict between India and Pakistan, peace on the Korean peninsula, and even the way relations between China and Taiwan play out, will be influenced by the authority the next US president brings to his job. There are those who would welcome a weakening of US global influence. Many Palestinians, for example, feel they would benefit from a less interventionist American policy in the Middle East. Even within the Western alliance, there are those who would probably see opportunities in a weakened US presidency. France, for example, might feel that a less assertive US might force the European Union to be more outward looking. But the dangers of having a weak, insecure US presidency outweigh any benefits that it might bring. US global economic and military power cannot be wished away. A president with a shaky mandate will still command great power and influence, only he will be constrained by his domestic weakness and less certain about how to use his authority. This brings with it the risks of miscalculation and the use of US power in a way that heightens conflict. There are very few conflicts in the world today which can be solved without US influence. The rest of the world needs the United States to use its power deftly and decisively. <br />

<strong>National debt means U.S. credibility and leverage have already declined—withdrawal from Korea is key to stop a complete collapse of hegemony</strong><br />
<strong>Tycoon 10</strong>—quoting Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State, graduate of Yale Law (Tycoon Report, 13 September 2010, America &quot;Losing Ability To Chart Own Destiny&quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewarticle/articleid/4494335" rel="nofollow">http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewarticle/articleid/4494335</a>, RBatra)<br />
&quot;Our rising debt levels (pose) a national security threat,&quot; she said. &quot;It undermines our ability to act in our own interest. And it does constrain us where constraint may be undesirable. It also sends a message of weakness internationally. I mean, it is very troubling to me that we are losing the ability not only to chart our own destiny, but to, you know, have the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">leverage</span> that comes from this enormously effective economic engine that has powered American values and interests over so many years.&quot;<br />
What was so refreshing was that she wasn't punting on the issue of our debt. She wasn't kicking the can down the road, talking about something that may affect us in the distant future. She was speaking in present tense. And her words hit me in the gut &quot;...we are losing the ability to chart our own destiny...&quot;<br />
So there you have it, straight from the horse's mouth: this isn't something our children or grandchildren have to worry about. It's something that is happening right now, right before our very eyes. Right now, when our Secretary of State is on the road negotiating with foreign countries, she has the sense that &quot;we are losing the ability to chart our own destiny.&quot;<br />
How Our Debt Can Create a Nuclear World<br />
We cannot overstate what this means. Take Iran, for example. At the big table that decides these things, it seems we've lost a few notches of respect. Instead of jumping in line behind us to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, other countries aren't giving us the respect they've given us in the past.<br />
What does that mean? It means that we won't likely get everyone on the same page with respect to increased sanctions against Iran to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon. And, of course, that means that without an internationally united front against them, Iran will likely obtain a nuclear weapon at some point.<br />
Scary stuff. In fact, I happen to agree with John McCain when he says &quot;The only thing worse than war with Iran is an Iran with a nuclear weapon.&quot;<br />
Picture it: once Iran gets a nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia will need them to reacquire a balance of power in the region. And once Saudi Arabia gets one, Syria is going to get one. And once Syria gets one, Egypt will feel the need to get one. And so on and so forth.<br />
And once each of those countries get nuclear weapons, how long before terrorist organizations within those countries get them? Ten years? Twenty years? Only if we're lucky.<br />
A Smaller United States 'Footprint' Means a More Dangerous World<br />
Just as troubling is that the U.S will have to withdraw from many of our commitments overseas because we won't be able to afford them. Right now we keep bases in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and myriad other locations around the world.<br />
But just imagine for a moment that we can no longer afford to maintain our bases in South Korea. Or even Japan. That would mean that both of these nations would have to &quot;tool up&quot; to make sure they have the weaponry to defend themselves from their neighbors.<br />
Can you picture a world where China takes over the bases we used to keep in Asia? What about the Middle East? Europe? Just like a game of Risk, we're going to lose our ability to project our power (i.e. &quot;defend our commercial interests&quot;) one country and location at a time.<br />
Before you know it, China could be the country whose ships protect the shipping lanes oil passes through. Talk about a &quot;wake-up&quot; call for the deluded folks here who think China will act in a similar fashion to the United States: countries that don't have a Judeo-Christian framework for making decisions act very differently than countries that do.<br />
Isolationism 101<br />
Some folks believe the U.S. will be better off if we just did what we did after WWI and isolated ourselves from the rest of the world. I certainly know politicians like Ron Paul have become popular spouting that kind of thinking.<br />
Maybe, maybe not. One thing I know for certain is that in the next fifty, one hundred years, the global competition for resources is going to heat up hotter than an oven on Thanksgiving.<br />
Picture a world where the United States doesn't take care of its debt problems right here and right now. That will be a world where we have zero presence in Asia (and thus don't sell as many products to Asia as we do now). That will also be a world where we have little (if any) presence in Europe.<br />
Why? Because those countries will, over time, go where the money is. And as they continue to gain more from their friendship with China, China is going to &quot;own&quot; more territory on the board.<br />
I can see a day in the not-too-distant-future -- much like our last day in Vietnam -- when our last ship patrols the oil shipping lanes in the Middle East. On this particular day, we're going to hand over control of the &quot;tap&quot; to China. As of that day, their ships are going to control where Middle East oil goes. <br />
Mark my words: those ships won't be headed West -- they'll be headed East to China and her allies.<br />
And night will fall on the American empire, as it once did on Rome.<br />

<strong>Korea is not key to heg</strong><br />

More broadly, U.S. Troops are said to cement U.S. influence or prevent a regional arms race. However, there’s no evidence that the garrison in the South adds anything to the influence that comes naturally from being the globe’s sole superpower. Nor has America’s force presence stopped the People’s Republic of China from upgrading its military; better that front-line allied states take responsibility for their region’s security rather than rely on Washington.<br />

<strong>Plan doesn’t hurt the credibility or capability of security alliances</strong><br />

<br />
Seoul might object to a U.S. attempt to improve relations with the North, but America should not allow its policy to be held hostage by Seoul. Finally, Washington should use the prospect of an American troop withdrawal-something long demanded by Pyongyang-to challenge the North to respond in kind by demobilizing some troops and withdrawing others from their advanced positions along the Demilitarized Zone. The alternative to serious arms reductions would be an ROK military build-up and an arms race that the North could not afford. This program would not oblige the United States to disturb its other security relations in the region, nor would devolving defense responsibility onto the ROK itself prevent the basing of American aircraft, bases, fleets, and troops elsewhere in the region, such as Japan. Neighboring states might be displeased by the US. decision, but they would have to recognize its logic. Over the long term there would be no serious American loss of “credibility,” the all-purpose criticism of any proposed change in the status quo. Credibility is only lost when expectations are not met, but expectations can be changed. Japan, in particular, would have little choice but to accept the American decision, since it would presumably prefer to preserve its own relationship with Washington irrespective of the state of American ties with Seoul. U.S. defense commitments in East Asia survived the loss of Cambodia and Vietnam, earlier partial withdrawals from Korea, and departure from the Philippines. They would survive a pull-out from Korea.<br />

<br />
South Korean accommodation of the rise of China is also reflected in Seoul’s resistance to post-Cold War alliance cooperation with the United States. During the early 2000s, the United States began adjustment of its defense planning to stress ‘‘strategic flexibility,’’ whereby U.S. forces abroad are deployed not for a single local contingency but for deployment to wherever a contingency might arise. In this context, the Pentagon envisions that U.S. forces based in South Korea could be deployed anywhere in East Asia, suggesting planning for conflict with China. But Seoul has resisted cooperation with U.S. defense policy, insofar as it implies that South Korean territory could be used by the United States against China. Thus, in 2005 President Roh Moo- hyun declared that South Korea facilities could not be used by U.S. forces in a Taiwan conflict and since then the United States has been unable to reach agreement with Seoul to enable U.S. use of its South Korean bases for regional contingencies.13<br />

<span class="Underline">It is doubtful that the United States could deter a Russian invasion of the Baltics or Ukraine, or, several decades hence, a Chinese assault on Taiwan. To engage in such actions, Moscow or Beijing would have to be highly motivated; conversely, the objects of possible attack are unimportant strategically to the United States, which would cause the challenger to discount U.S. credibility. The spring 1996 crisis between China and Taiwan suggests the difficulties that U.S. extended deterrence strategy will face in coming decades. (China provoked the crisis by conducting intimidating military exercises in an attempt to influence Taiwan's presidential elections.) During the crisis a Chinese official said that China could use force against Taiwan without fear of U.S. intervention because American decision makers &quot;care more about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan.&quot;61 Although an empty threat today, as China becomes more powerful militarily and economically in coming decades, threats of this nature from Beijing will be more potent. </span><br />

Meanwhile, many officials and nongovernment experts have strong concerns about the longer term future. They wonder whether the United States can sustain its military and economic commitments to the region. The global economic crisis and US recession have resulted in massive government debt that raises questions about future US military spending. The crisis and recession also challenge US free trade policies and the sustainability of the US asymmetrical trade relationships with Asia.<br />
China, for its part, seems positioned to continue economic, military, and political advances. China’s military buildup has already raised serious questions about US ability to come to Taiwan’s defense in the event of a Chinese attack against the island. Chinese anti-access efforts might hamper US abilities to protect its interests in other areas along the Chinese periphery.<br />

<strong>Japan prolif is inevitable – plan’s the only way to solve</strong><br />
<strong>Madsen 10/8</strong>—Washington, DC-based investigative journalist, author and syndicated columnist, twenty years’ experience in security issues, former U.S. Naval Officer (Wayne, 8 October 2010, “A nuclear armed Japan may be around the corner”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://onlinejournal.com/artman/publish/article_6429.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://onlinejournal.com/artman/publish/article_6429.shtml</a>, RBatra)<br />
<br />
In 2005, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso reportedly told Vice President Dick Cheney in Washington that “India, Pakistan, and the DPRK all have nuclear weapons. <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">If the DPRK continues to develop nuclear weapons, Japan must also arm itself</span> with nuclear weapons.” In 2008, Aso became Prime Minister of Japan. In 2006, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone floated the notion of Japan acquiring its own nuclear weapons.<br />
Because China has always insisted Japan must not develop nuclear weapons, there is a powerful faction in Japan’s military and political establishment that wants to do exactly what China opposes as a way of throwing down a gauntlet to Beijing’s wider aspirations in Asia.<br />
The word from Tokyo is that it is no longer a question whether Japan will develop a nuclear weapons capability, but when. And “when” would now appear to be very close.<br />

<br />
The suggestion that U.S. troops in Korea could help contain a resurgent Tokyo is even more fanciful. Tokyo should be doing more militarily, despite disquiet among its neighbors, but to argue that Japan is about to embark on another imperialist rampage is to engage in scaremongering. Cohen’s worry that a conventional pullout from South Korea would spark Japan to develop nuclear weapons is equally implausible because it is predicated on a long daisy chain of events with all of the intermediate steps removed.110 Moreover, the hypothetical end result of a nuclear-armed Japan is still likely to be better than the alternative of American involvement in a regional confrontation involving the PRC. <br />

<strong>We solve the impact</strong><br />

<br />
What value, then, is the alliance?<br />
Some proponents view it as a useful tool of nonproliferation, discouraging South Korea from developing a nuclear weapon. However, that possibility remains remote. Although nuclear negotiations with the North hardly look promising, China might yet forcefully weigh in to halt the North Korean program. Moreover, the U.S. could maintain a nuclear umbrella over the ROK without keeping conventional forces on the ground in South Korea, which only act as nuclear hostages vulnerable to DPRK intimidation.<br />
Moreover, the most powerful incentive for Beijing to apply significant pressure on the North to denuclearize (and not just return to the Six-Party talks) is the threat of further proliferation. The People's Republic of China does not fear a North Korean atomic bomb. The PRC might not worry unduly about a South Korean weapon.<br />
But Japan and even Taiwan might consider joining a growing nuclear parade. That possibility should raise more than eyebrows in Beijing, encouraging a vigorous response to halt the process at the start. The best way to keep the ROK and neighboring states non-nuclear is to make the North non-nuclear. The best way to make North Korea non-nuclear is for the PRC to use its full array of diplomatic and economic tools on Pyongyang.<br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>Continued focus on defense and military spending will ensure a collapse of hegemony—we’re losing influence already every day</strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Cole 11/12</strong>—Richard P. Mitchell Professor of History and the director of the Center for South Asian Studies at the University of Michigan (Juan, 12 November 2010, “Obama in Asia Bumps into the New World Order”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/11/12/opinion/main7048150.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/11/12/opinion/main7048150.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody</a>, RBatra)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">Beyond being a goodwill ambassador for ten days, Obama is seeking sales of American-made durable and consumer goods, weapons deals, an expansion of trade, green energy cooperation, and the maintenance of a geopolitical balance in the region favorable to the United States. Just as the decline of the American economy hobbled him at home, however, the weakness of the United States on the world stage in the aftermath of Bush-era excesses has made real breakthroughs abroad unlikely. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Add to this the peculiar obsessions of the Washington power elite, with regard to Iran for instance, and you have an unpalatable mix. These all-American fixations are viewed as an inconvenience or worse in Asia, where powerful regional hegemons are increasingly determined to chart their own courses, even if in public they continue to humor a somewhat addled and infirm Uncle Sam.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Although the United States is still the world’s largest economy, it is shackled by enormous public and private debt as well as fundamental weaknesses. Rivaled by an increasingly integrated European Union, it is projected to be overtaken economically by China in just over a decade. While the president’s first stop, India, now has a nominal gross domestic product of only a little over a trillion dollars a year, it, too, is growing rapidly, even spectacularly, and its GDP may well quadruple by the early 2020s. The era of American dominance, in other words, is passing, and the time (just after World War II) when the U.S. accounted for half the world economy, a dim memory.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The odd American urge to invest heavily in perpetual war abroad, including “defense-related” spending of around a trillion dollars a year, has been a significant factor further weakening the country on the global stage. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Most of the conventional weapons on which the U.S. continues to splurge could not even be deployed against nuclear powers like Russia, China, and India, emerging as key competitors when it comes to global markets, resources, and regional force projection. Those same conventional weapons have proved hardly more useful (in the sense of achieving quick and decisive victory, or even victory at all) in the unconventional wars the U.S. has repeatedly plunged into -- a sad fact that Bush’s reckless attempt to occupy entire West Asian nations only demonstrated even more clearly to Washington’s bemused rivals. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">American weapons stockpiles (and copious plans for ever more high-tech versions of the same into the distant future) are therefore remarkably irrelevant to its situation, and known to be so. Meanwhile, its economy, burdened by debts incurred through wars and military spending sprees, and hollowed out by Wall Street shell games, is becoming a B-minus one in global terms.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">A Superpower With Feet of Clay</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Just how weakened the United States has been in Asia is easily demonstrated by the series of rebuffs its overtures have suffered from regional powers. When, for instance, a tiff broke out this fall between China and Japan over a collision at sea near the disputed Senkaku Islands, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton offered to mediate. The offer was rejected out of hand by the Chinese, who appear to have deliberately halted exports of strategic rare-earth metals to Japan and the United States as a hard-nosed bargaining ploy. In response, the Obama administration quickly turned mealy-mouthed, affirming that while the islands come under American commitments to defend Japan for the time being, it would take no position on the question of who ultimately owned them.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Likewise, Pakistani politicians and pundits were virtually unanimous in demanding that President Obama raise the issue of disputed Kashmir with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his Indian sojourn. The Indians, however, had already firmly rejected any internationalization of the controversy, which centers on the future of the Muslim-majority state, a majority of whose inhabitants say they want independence. Although Obama had expressed an interest in helping resolve the Kashmir dispute during his presidential campaign, by last March his administration was already backing away from any mediation role unless both sides asked for Washington’s help. In other words, Obama and Clinton promptly caved in to India’s insistence that it was the regional power in South Asia and would brook no external interference. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">This kind of regional near impotence is only reinforced by America’s perpetual (yet ever faltering) war machine. or, as Obama moves through Asia, can he completely sidestep controversies provoked by the Afghan War, his multiple-personality approach to Pakistan, and his administration’s obsessive attempt to isolate and punish Iran. As Obama arrives in Seoul, for instance, Iran will be on the agenda. This fall, South Korea, a close American ally, managed to play a game of one step forward, two steps back with regard to Washington-supported sanctions against that energy-rich country. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The government did close the Seoul branch of Iran’s Bank Milli, sanctioning it and other Iranian firms. Then, the South Koreans turned around and, according to the Financial Times, appointed two banks to handle payments involving trade between the two countries via the (unsanctioned) Tehran Central Bank. In doing so, the government insulated other South Korean banks from possible American sanctions, while finding a way for Iran to continue to purchase South Korean autos and other goods. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Before the latest round of U.N. Security Council sanctions South Korea was doing $10 billion a year in trade with Iran, involving some 2,142 Korean companies. Iran’s half of this trade -- it provides nearly 10% of South Korea’s petroleum imports -- has been largely unaffected. South Korea’s exports to Iran, on the other hand, have fallen precipitously under the pressure of the sanctions regime. Sanctions that hold Iran harmless but punish a key American ally by hurting its trade and creating a balance of payments problem are obviously foolish. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The Iranian press claims that South Korean firms are now planning to invest money in Iranian industrial towns. Given that Obama has expended political capital persuading South Korea to join a U.S.-organized free trade zone and change its tariffs to avoid harming the American auto industry, it is unlikely that he could now seek to punish South Korea for its quiet defiance on the issue of Iran.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">China is the last major country with a robust energy industry still actively investing in Iran, and Washington entertains dark suspicions that some of its firms are even transferring technology that might help the Iranians in their nuclear energy research projects. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">This bone of contention ws likely to form part of the conversation between Obama and President Hu Jintao before Thursday’s G20 meeting of the world’s wealthiest 20 countries. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Given tensions between Washington and Beijing over the massive balance of trade deficit the U.S. is running with China (which the Obama administration attributes, in part, to an overvalued Chinese currency), not to speak of other contentious issues, Iran may not loom large in their discussions. One reason for this may be that, frustrating as Chinese stonewalling on its currency may seem, they are likely to give even less ground on relations with Iran -- especially since they know that Washington can’t do much about it. Another fraught issue is China’s plan to build a nuclear reactor for Pakistan, something that also alarms Islamabad’s nuclear rival, India. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Rising Asia</span><br />
<span class="Underline">If you want to measure the scope of American decline since the height of the Cold War era, remember that back then Iran and Pakistan were American spheres of influence from which other great powers were excluded. Now, the best the U.S. can manage in Pakistan is the political (and military) equivalent of a condominium or perhaps a time-share -- and in Iran, nothing at all. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Despite his feel-good trip to India last weekend, during which he announced some important business deals for U.S. goods, Obama has remarkably little to offer the Indians. That undoubtedly is why the president unexpectedly announced Washington’s largely symbolic support for a coveted seat as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a ringing confirmation of India’s status as a rising power. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Some Indian politicians and policy-makers, however, are insisting that their country’s increasing demographic, military, and economic hegemony over South Asia be recognized by Washington, and that the U.S. cease its support of, and massive arms sales to, Pakistan. In addition, New Delhi is eager to expand its geopolitical position in Afghanistan, where it is a major funder of civilian reconstruction projects, and is apprehensive about any plans for a U.S. withdrawal from that country. An Indian-dominated Afghanistan is, of course, Pakistan’s worst fear. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In addition, India’s need for petroleum is expected to grow by 40% during the next decade and a half. Energy-hungry, like neighboring Pakistan, it can’t help glancing longingly at Iran’s natural gas and petroleum fields, despite Washington’s threats to slap third-party sanctions on any firm that helps develop them. American attempts to push India toward dirty energy sources, including nuclear power (the waste product of which is long-lived and problematic) and shale gas, as a way of reducing its interest in Iranian and Persian Gulf oil and gas, are another Washington “solution” for the region likely to be largely ignored, given how close at hand inexpensive Gulf hydrocarbons are.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">It is alarming to consider what exactly New Delhi imagines the planet’s former “sole superpower” has to offer at this juncture -- mostly U.S. troops fighting a perceived threat in Afghanistan and the removal of Congressional restrictions on sales of advanced weaponry to India. The U.S. military in Afghanistan is seen as a proxy for Indian interests in putting down the Taliban and preventing the reestablishment of Pakistani hegemony over Kabul. For purely self-interested reasons Prime Minister Singh has long taken the same position as the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives, urging Obama to postpone any plans to begin a drawdown in Afghanistan in the summer of 2011. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The most significant of the Indian purchases trumpeted by the president last weekend were military in character. Obama proclaimed that the $10 billion in deals he was inking would create 54,000 new American jobs. Right now, it’s hard to argue with job creation or multi-billion-dollar sales of U.S.-made goods abroad. As former secretary of labor Robert Reich has pointed out, however, jobs in the defense industry are expensive to create, while offering a form of artificial corporate welfare that distorts the American economy and diverts resources from far more crucial priorities. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">To think of this another way, President Obama is in danger of losing control of his South Asian foreign policy agenda to India, its Republican supporters in the House, and the military-industrial complex.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">As the most dynamic region in the world, Asia is the place where rapid change can create new dynamics. American trade with the European Union has grown over the past decade (as has the EU itself), but is unlikely to be capable of doubling in just a few years. After all, the populations of some European countries, like powerhouse Germany, will probably shrink in coming decades. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">India, by contrast, is projected to overtake China in population around 2030 and hit the billion-and-a-half-inhabitants mark by mid-century (up from 1.15 billion today). Its economy, like China’s, has been growing 8% to 9% a year, creating powerful new demand in the world market. President Obama is hoping to see U.S. exports to India double by 2015. Likewise, with its economy similarly booming, China is making its own ever more obvious bid to stride like a global colossus through the twenty-first century. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The Hessians of a Future Asia?</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Unsurprisingly, beneath the pomp and splendor of Obama’s journey through Asia has lurked a far tawdrier vision -- of a much weakened president presiding over a much weakened superpower, both looking somewhat desperately for succor abroad. If the United States is to remain a global power, it is important that Washington offer something to the world besides arms and soldiers.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Obama has been on the money when he’s promoted green-energy technology as a key field where the United States could make its mark (and possibly its fortune) globally. Unfortunately, as elsewhere, here too the United States is falling behind, and a Republican House as well as a bevy of new Republican governors and state legislatures are highly unlikely to effectively promote the greening of American technology. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In the end, Obama’s trip has proven a less than effective symbolic transition from George W. Bush’s muscular unilateralism to a new American-led multilateralism in Asia. Rather, at each stop, Obama has bumped up against the limits of American economic and diplomatic clout in the new Asian world order. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">George W. Bush and Dick Cheney thought in terms of expanding American conventional military weapons stockpiles and bases, occupying countries when necessary, and so ensuring that the U.S. would dominate key planetary resources for decades to come. Their worldview, however, was mired in mid-twentieth-century power politics. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">If they thought they were placing a marker down on another American century, they were actually gambling away the very houses we live in and reducing us to a debtor nation struggling to retain its once commanding superiority in the world economy. In the meantime, the multi-millionaires and billionaires created by neoliberal policies and tax cuts in the West will be as happy to invest in (and perhaps live in) Asia as in the United States.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">In the capitals of a rising Asia, Washington’s incessant campaign to strengthen sanctions against Iran, and in some quarters its eagerness for war with that country, is viewed as another piece of lunatic adventurism. The leaders of India, China, and South Korea, among other countries, are determined to do their best to sidestep this American obsession and integrate Iran into their energy and trading futures. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In some ways, the darkest vision of an American future arrived in 1991 thanks to President George H. W. Bush. At that time, he launched a war in the Persian Gulf to protect local oil producers from an aggressive Iraq. That war was largely paid for by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, rendering the U.S. military for the first time a sort of global mercenary force. Just as the poor in any society often join the military as a way of moving up in the world, so in the century of Asia, the U.S. could find itself in danger of being reduced to the role of impoverished foot soldier fighting for others’ interests, or of being the glorified ironsmiths making arsenals of weaponry for the great powers of the future.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Another argument for high military spending is that U.S. military hegemony underlies global stability. Our forces and alliance commitments dampen conflict between potential rivals like China and Japan, we are told, preventing them from fighting wars that would disrupt trade and cost us more than the military spending that would have prevented war. The theoretical and empirical foundation for this claim is weak. It overestimates both the American military's contribution to international stability and the danger that instability abroad poses to Americans. In Western Europe, U.S. forces now contribute little to peace, at best making the tiny odds of war among states there slightly more so.7 <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Even in Asia</span>, where there is more tension, the history of international relations suggests that without U.S. military deployments potential rivals, especially those separated by sea like Japan and China, will generally achieve a stable balance of power rather than fight. In other cases, as with our bases in Saudi Arabia between the Iraq wars, U.S. forces probably create more unrestthan they prevent. Our force deployments can also generate instability by prompting states to develop nuclear weapons. Even when wars occur, their economic impact is likely to be limited here.8 By linking markets, globalization provides supply alternatives for the goods we consume, including oil. If political upheaval disrupts supply in one location, suppliers elsewhere will take our orders. Prices may increase, but markets adjust. That makes American consumers less dependent on any particular supply source, undermining the claim that we need to use force to prevent unrest in supplier nations or secure trade routes.9 Part of the confusion about the value of hegemony comes from misunderstanding the Cold War. People tend to assume, falsely, that our activist foreign policy, with troops forward supporting allies, not only caused the Soviet Union's collapse but is obviously a good thing even without such a rival. Forgotten is the sensible notion that alliances are a necessary evil occasionally tolerated to balance a particularly threatening enemy. The main justification for creating our Cold War alliances was the fear that Communist nations could conquer or capture by insurrection the industrial centers in Western Europe and Japan and then harness enough of that wealth to threaten us — either directly or by forcing us to become a garrison state at ruinous cost. We kept troops in South Korea after 1953 for fear that the North would otherwise overrun it. But these alliances outlasted the conditions that caused them. During the Cold War, Japan, Western Europe and South Korea grew wealthy enough to defend themselves. We should let them. These alliances heighten our force requirements and threaten to drag us into wars, while providing no obvious benefit. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">So it's no wonder we don't want to give this up easily. But however much we want continuity, it's not our desires that will dictate the future -- it is hard realities. Power is not an absolute thing and it only makes sense to talk in terms of relative power. The US is showing signs of strain, economically, and this will in turn erode its ability to project military power globally. The conflict between aspiration and reality is playing out in the debate about the Afghan campaign.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The US is far from being in terminal decline. It still spends more on defence than the rest of the world combined, and has defence systems more capable than those of any other country. Its economy is three times larger than China's.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">So for those countries like Australia who are comfortable with US dominance, where's the problem? Globally, there isn't one -- it will be decades before China (or any other country) will be able muster anything like the capabilities that the US can project worldwide. But there is a big difference between being able to project power anywhere and being able to dictate terms anywhere.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">History shows that rising powers can challenge, and defeat, established major powers locally long before the former are serious contenders on the biggest stage. The US came to its position of dominance in the 20th century via this mechanism. In 1776, the colonists in North America had built an economy that was less than a third the size of Britain's and there was an even bigger difference in the level of industrialisation. Yet Washington's irregular forces managed to wrest some of the most valuable real estate on the globe from the British. The rest is (literally) history.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The War of Independence ended in the favour of the Americans because they had short supply lines, a single enemy (Britain had to remain alert to threats elsewhere) and employed what we would describe today as asymmetric tactics. They also cared more about the outcome.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The lessons of 1776 show reaching across the sea to take on an adversary whose core interests are at stake requires a big difference in strength to be successful. Another example of failure by the larger power to prevail in such circumstances is the Russia-Japanese War of 1905. Again, the difference in economic weight in favour of the loser was a factor of three.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Even successes come hard. Britain defeated Argentina in the Falklands War of 1982, but it was a near thing despite an economic differential of almost six to one in Britain's favour. The US had to put its entire economy on a war footing, and borrow on top of that, to defeat Japan in World War II, despite starting the conflict with an economy more than 10 times larger than its adversary.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">It's not hard to see how this applies to the Asia-Pacific or, more accurately, to the balance of power between China and the US in the western Pacific. The US continues to spend about 4 per cent of its GDP on defence. But China's economy is growing faster and it is rapidly building up its forces. So the relativities are changing in favour of the home team. All the historically significant factors apply: the differential in economic weight is only a factor of three (and reducing); China has the geographic advantage of shorter ranges; and is working assiduously at asymmetric tactics and capabilities that blunt US advantages. And, ultimately, it cares more about the approaches to its territory than the US does about a more distant region.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Given that, it's no surprise American scholars are coming to the realisation that conventional US military power is not unassailable. The Rand Corporation has calculated that there is a good chance that US/Taiwan forces would lose an air war over the Taiwan Strait. And scholars at the US Naval War College have written of China being on the verge of a &quot;game changer&quot; with its array of sea denial weapons.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">What does all that mean? Firstly, relying on conventional military force to underpin the position of the US and its allies is not a guaranteed winning strategy. There will have to be an accommodation of new powers at some level. This is not just true of China, but also India and others as they reach the stage where they can exert power at least locally. Given its economic growth, Indonesia will, in the not too distant future, be able to close the gap between its military capabilities and Australia's. So rather than getting into a debate about the desirability or otherwise of &quot;standing up&quot; to China, the debate should actually be about the outcomes that are possible and desirable with the power available to us and our allies, relatively speaking.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: black;">What is of more interest to me, however, is what her selection reveals about the basis of presidential power. Political scientists, like baseball writers evaluating hitters, have devised numerous means of measuring a president’s influence in Congress. I will devote a separate post to discussing these, but in brief, they often center on the creation of legislative “box scores” designed to measure how many times a president’s preferred piece of legislation, or nominee to the executive branch or the courts, is approved by Congress. That is, how many pieces of legislation that the president supports actually pass Congress? How often do members of Congress vote with the president’s preferences? How often is a president’s policy position supported by roll call outcomes? These measures, however, are a misleading gauge of presidential power – they are a better indicator of congressional power. This is because how members of Congress vote on a nominee or legislative item is rarely influenced by anything a president does. Although journalists (and political scientists) often focus on the legislative “endgame” to gauge presidential influence – will the President swing enough votes to get his preferred legislation enacted? – this mistakes an outcome with actual evidence of presidential influence. Once we control for other factors – a member of Congress’ ideological and partisan leanings, the political leanings of her constituency, whether she’s up for reelection or not – we can usually predict how she will vote without needing to know much of anything about what the president wants. (I am ignoring the importance of a president’s veto power for the moment.) Despite the much publicized and celebrated instances of presidential arm-twisting during the legislative endgame, then, most legislative outcomes don’t depend on presidential lobbying. But this is not to say that presidents lack influence. Instead, the primary means by which presidents influence what Congress does is through their ability to determine the alternatives from which Congress must choose. That is, presidential power is largely an exercise in agenda-setting – not arm-twisting. And we see this in the Sotomayer nomination. Barring a major scandal, she will almost certainly be confirmed to the Supreme Court whether Obama spends the confirmation hearings calling every Senator or instead spends the next few weeks ignoring the Senate debate in order to play Halo III on his Xbox. That is, how senators decide to vote on Sotomayor will have almost nothing to do with Obama’s lobbying from here on in (or lack thereof). His real influence has already occurred, in the decision to present Sotomayor as his nominee.</span><br />

The U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea alliances are two cornerstones of American foreign policy. These days, they do not get that much attention. Our national focus is largely on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where regional players and Europe are generally more involved. We are also focused of course on the health care debate, on President Obama's overall political standing, and the already looming November elections. And of course, the economy is a big issue too--but as it concerns Asia, China is discussed more often than either Japan or South Korea these days.<br />

This essay poses one basic question: is it values or interests that ultimately determine the strength of a relationship? With the trend toward greater emphasis on democracy, human rights, and other values as the basis of international politics, it could be argued that U.S.-R.O.K. relations are best served by emphasizing their similar values on a number of basic issues. That is, the larger U.S.-R.O.K. relationship will probably endure no matter what policies are taken, simply because the values of the two countries are so similar in so many ways. However, it is still possible that the security alliance may come under stress, because it is not clear that the basic interests of the U.S. and South Korea will continue to be in accord with each other. <br />

CBO estimates that returning the Army forces now in South Korea to the United States would save $175 million a year. Before it could realize those recurring savings, however, the Army would need to spend a total of $3.6 billion--including $3.0 billion to provide basing in CONUS for the returned units, $450 million to move them from South Korea, and $225 million to build a new consolidated base south of Seoul. At the same time, this option would avoid $300 million to $850 million in construction costs in South Korea, resulting in a net one-time cost of $2.8 billion to $3.3 billion (see Table 3-13).<br />

Korea’s economy succumbed to recession during the first half of 2009. The economy has bounced back beginning Q3 2009, expanding by 1% from a year earlier. Strong year-on-year rises were recorded since then- 6% in Q4 2009, 8.10% in Q1 2010 and 7.20% in Q2 2010. The economy is expected to grow by 6.1% by the end of 2010. The government played a big role in Korea’s quick economic recovery. The government has reduced taxes, as well as interest rates. In January 2009, the government announced KRW50 trillion (US$38 billion) investments over four years for major infrastructure and environmental projects to create 960,000 jobs. In February 2009 came a US$37 billion credit guarantee to firms, and tax cuts for homeowners. To stabilize the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of Korea supplied financial institutions with US$22.4 billion in Q1 2009 through swap transactions and foreign currency loans, using the proceeds of currency swaps with the US Federal Reserve. The government also injected US$30 billion worth of liquidity into the banking system. <br />

By 2002, the combined China-Hong Kong market became South Korea’s largest export market.1 For the first time since World War II, Seoul was not primarily dependent on the United States for economic growth, and the United States became second to China in determining South Korean prosperity, employment, and political stability. Moreover, South Korean annual exports to China increased by nearly 50 percent from 2001 to 2003. Between 2002 and 2003, South Korean exports to the United States, on the other hand, increased by less than one percent. In 2003, more than 31 percent of South Korean exports went to China. In contrast, Chinese exports to Korea amounted to only five percent of Chinese exports. By 2006 to 2009, after the onset of the global recession, the value of South Korean exports to China was over twice the value of its exports to the UnitedStates.2 <br />

South Korean shares closed down for a fifth consecutive session Thursday, weighed by continued worries about global economic growth going ahead. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index, or Kospi, was off 0.3% at 1729.77. Foreign investors sold a net KRW91.11 billion in shares, while domestic institutions bought a net KRW117.69 billion. Local retail investors bought a net KRW10.28 billion in shares. &quot;Worries about growth are persisting in the market,&quot; said SK Securities analyst Choi Seong-lak. &quot;It's hard to find the momentum for the market to rise, but at the same time the current levels are also triggering some bargain-hunting.&quot; Shinhan Investment analyst Han Beom-ho also said that market speculation about the reason for North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's trip to China also may have hurt sentiment. An official at South Korea's presidential office told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday that Kim is traveling to China but said he is unaware of the reason for the trip. Han said worries about potential problems in North Korea could have pressured the domestic market. <br />

<br />
Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- In order to realize the Koreans' desire for independent reunification, peace and prosperity they should get the U.S. forces withdrawn from south Korea as early as possible and put an end to its policy of colonial domination. Rodong Sinmun Friday observes this in a signed article. It goes on<span class="underline0"><span style="font-weight: normal;">: The withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea is an indispensable requirement for the</span></span> independent development <span class="underline0"><span style="font-weight: normal;">and democracy of the</span></span> south Korean<span class="underline0"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> society</span></span>, a precondition for ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula and a prerequisite to the independent reunification of the nation<span class="underline0"><span style="font-weight: normal;">. The U.S. presence and domination over south Korea are hurdles lying in the way of the</span></span> socio-political development and <span class="underline0"><span style="font-weight: normal;">democracy of south Korea</span></span> and the root cause of all sorts of misfortune and sufferings its people are now undergoing. There is neither independence nor human rights in south Korea which the U.S. imperialist aggressors lord it over. The U.S. forces are no more than aggressors and occupation forces that are implementing the U.S. policy of aggression toward the DPRK and its policy of domination over south Korea on the spot. The U.S. imperialist aggressor forces have never allowed the south Korean people to desire independence and democracy, progress and reunification. The U.S. has threatened the DPRK by force of arms and done harm to the peace on the peninsula with its racket for a war of aggression against the north. The U.S. helped ultra-right conservative forces come back to power in south Korea to block Korea's reunification. Had the U.S. imperialists pulled its forces out of south Korea according to the resolution of the 30th UN General Assembly, the Koreans would have achieved the country's reunification long ago through reconciliation and concerted efforts. The U.S. should unconditionally withdraw its aggressor forces from south Korea as unanimously demanded by the Koreans. <br />

<br />
<strong>America's cultural and economic ties with South Korea are valuable, but not critical. For instance, two-way trade in 2003 exceeded $60 billion (&quot; peaked at almost $67 billion in 2000), real money but small change for America's $10 trillion economy.26 Moreover, notes Stephen W. Bosworth, dean &quot;I the Fletcher School at Tufts University, &quot;The relative weights of the United States and South Korea in the increasingly global economic interests of the other are shrinking in relative terms.”The much-proclaimed “leverage” supposedly accompanying military deployments seems either absent or unused: few Koreans appear to buy GM cars out of gratitude to or in response to pressure from Washington. (In fact, lobbying Washington for trade liberalization has helped push Korean farmers and students together against the United States.)</strong><br />
<br />
Even an acrimonious breakup won’t undermine economic ties – investment and trade will endure <br />
Lim, 07 <strong>– Fellow at the Korea Development Institute (11/27/07, Wonhyuk, Nautilus Policy Forum Online 07-086A, “Economic Consequences of ROK-U.S. Separation,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/07086Lim.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/07086Lim.html</a>, JMP)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>An obvious reference case for this scenario is the turmoil in the ROK-U.S. alliance following an incident in the summer of 2002, when a U.S. armored vehicle accidentally killed two Korean middle school girls.(7) When the driver and navigator of the vehicle were both acquitted in spite of their conflicting statements in a U.S. court marshal, hundreds of thousands of Koreans took to the streets. Ordinary citizens joined candlelight vigils to protest the injustice of the verdict; some students even burned American flags to express their outrage. This, in turn, triggered negative U.S. reaction.</strong><br />
<strong>It may be argued that this reference case is of limited use for this scenario because cooler heads ultimately prevailed on both sides, especially with regard to the phased reduction of the USFK. However, in the present context of assessing the economic impact of ROK-U.S. separation under various scenarios, it is important to note that even the most acrimonious exchange of words between the allies in recent memory did not have a large spillover effect on bilateral economic relations. In fact, investment and trade ties between the U.S. and ROK have been the saving grace of the bilateral relationship over the past five years.</strong><br />
<strong>3. Security Impact</strong><br />
<strong>As noted earlier, the termination of the ROK-U.S. alliance means that ROK forces would have to deter DPRK attack without a credible U.S. commitment to wartime intervention. It also means that the ROK would have to deal with regional powers without the benefit of the insurance provided by the alliance. This would present considerable security and diplomatic challenges-but not necessarily economic difficulties.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span class="Heading2Char">No impact – even in the worst-case scenario </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Heading2Char">Bandow 92</span> (Doug, Senior Fellow – Cato Institute, The U.S.-South Korean Alliance, p. 4)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The belief that the Republic of Korea (ROK) is vital to America's security is more a product of obsolete Cold War assumptions combined with an emotional commitment resulting from the sacri¬fice of American blood and treasure during the Korean War than it is a rational assessment of current U.S. security interests or re¬quirements. Neither South Korea's economic nor strategic impor¬tance to the United States is sufficient to justify the costs and risks entailed by Washington's security commitment, especially the con¬tinued presence of U.S. forces on the peninsula.</strong><br />
<strong>True, the ROK is a significant trading partner; U.S.–South Ko¬rean trade came to nearly $32 billion in 1988.5 Disruption of that commerce would be costly and unpleasant, but even a worst-case scenario involving the total loss of trade with South Korea would hardly devastate America's $5.5 trillion-a-year economy.</strong><br />

<strong>Despite all the recent huffing and puffing from Pyongyang, U.S. officials say they’ve seen little physical evidence that North Korea might actually be preparing to go to war. Just hours after Seoul blamed the North for the March 26 sinking of the South Korean naval vessel Cheonan, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il publicly ordered his armed forces to get ready for military action, according to sources quoted in The Guardian. But two U.S. national security officials, asking for anonymity when discussing sensitive information, tell Declassified they’re not aware of any intelligence reporting on significant military mobilization or redeployments inside North Korea. The North Korean military is always on the move somewhere, one of the officials said, but at the moment whatever movements are being noted by Western intelligence agencies are regarded as not particularly threatening. A third U.S. foreign policy official, who also asked for anonymity, told Declassified that U.S. agencies are picking up “nothing of extreme concern” in what North Korean forces are currently up to. Pyongyang could still launch some form of surprise military action if it really wanted to. For one thing, South Korea’s capital and largest city, Seoul, is only 30 miles south of the Demilitarized Zone, within easy artillery range. The North Koreans keep their forward artillery batteries stocked with enough ammunition to do serious damage, one of the officials points out. But there are no indications that the North is preparing to embark on any such adventure, which would almost certainly risk a wider conflict. There’s also the possibility that Pyongyang might try to intimidate its neighbors by setting off another missile or nuclear test. And although the North might be able for the most part to conceal preparations for an underground nuclear explosion, the West’s detection equipment would probably pick up signs that the North was planning a major new missile test, and according to one of the officials, no such preparations appear to be under way.</strong><br />

<strong>The current administration has suggested a troop reduction as well as a troop reassignment in the region. In this day and age of new technology, why subject U.S. troops in the Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) when there are U.S. troops present in Japan as well as Okinawa that can respond to any Korean crisis? The military strategy whether to reduce the number of troops or re-assign their location (in Korea) has been an issue amongst the strategists and theorists. In fact, there is only a marginal difference if troops were present in South Korea or in other areas such as Japan (if North Korea attacked)…the U.S. would still prevail.17 To date, the National Security Strategy still calls for troop presence overseas to promote, deter, and defend allies</strong><br />

<strong>Yet since the fall of the Soviet Union and in the counterinsurgency wars that define Iraq and Afghanistan, air superiority has not been an issue. Unfortunately, the result is an increasing neglect of America's air forces. As much as the Navy, the Air Force provides a unique global reach and presence for America. Indeed, given the vast distances the U.S. must cover in order to fight wars, provide humanitarian assistance, and keep an eye on crisis spots, the Air Force is even more crucial in ensuring timely, nearly instantaneous response.</strong><br />
<strong>But in current defense plans, the Air Force has to keep flying 30-year old fighters until the new F-35 comes on line only slowly later in this decade. In the meantime, it will retire 250 F-15s and F-16s before they can be replaced by the F-35, putting further stress on combat readiness and ability to contribute in Afghanistan.</strong><br />
<strong>Last year, the White House killed the F-22 program, prematurely ending production of the most advanced fighter in the world, and leaving Air Force commanders with a fraction of the F-22s they need to ensure air superiority and to use as the most flexible intelligence asset in the sky.</strong><br />
<strong>Bombing runs are carried out by bombers built as long ago as the early 1960s, and our planes are refueled by half-century old tankers.</strong><br />
<strong>Secretary of Defense Robert Gates canceled, then restarted the next generation bomber program, meaning there will be no new bomber at least until 2025, and the Pentagon has been trying to kill the C-17, America's most advanced transport plane, even as demand for airlift operations is prematurely aging the fleet.</strong><br />
<strong>Some may question why the U.S. needs such a large air force, when no other country has even a fraction of our capabilities. But no other nation has America's global responsibilities, either.</strong><br />
<strong>A modern, balanced air force is a central ingredient in America's defense strategy, and is the prerequisite to being able to intervene in the earliest stages of a conflict.</strong><br />
<strong>Moreover, American airmen will soon face more capable adversaries, as other nations are building up their air forces, most notably China, which is introducing advanced fighter aircraft and new weapons designed to keep U.S. aircraft carriers at bay, and Russia, which has just test flown a fifth-generation challenger to America's F-22.</strong><br />
<strong>Even more worrisome, countries such as Iran and North Korea are installing integrated air defenses that only our tiny fleet of F-22s can be assured of penetrating. Our capability of entering any airspace we want to will be steadily degraded in coming years, reducing the credibility of our defensive alliances with countries such as South Korea and Japan.</strong><br />

U.S. troops are ineffective – also no risk of North Korean invasion <br />

<strong>Proceeding against the advice of my cardiologist, I must concede that for once, Ron Paul is actually on to something. The ground component of U.S. Forces Korea, which costs U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars a year to maintain, is an equally unaffordable political liability on the South Korean street. We should withdraw it. Every Saturday night off-post brawl is a headline in the muck-raking Korean press, for which the American soldier is inevitably blamed, and for which angry mobs perpetually demand renegotiations of the Status of Force Agreement to give Korea’s not-even-remotely-fair judicial system more jurisdiction over American soldiers.</strong><br />
<strong>The South Korean people do not appreciate the security our soldiers provide. The way some of them treat our soldiers ought to be a national scandal. Many off-post businesses don’t even let Americans through their front doors. The degree of anti-Americanism in South Korea is sufficient to be a significant force protection issue in the event of hostilities.</strong><br />
<strong>South Korea does not have our back. South Korea made much of the fact that it sent 3,000 soldiers to Iraq, where they sat behind concrete barriers in a secure Kurdish area of Iraq, protected by peshmerga, making no military contribution and taking no combat casualties. Their contribution to the effort in Afghanistan has been negligible, which is more than can be said of their contribution to the Taliban (previous President Roh Moo Hyun reportedly paid them a ransom of up to $20 million in 2007 to free South Korean hostages who took it upon themselves to charter a shiny new bus to bring Christianity to Kandahar). South Korea has been an equally unsteady ally against China.</strong><br />
<strong>The American security blanket has fostered a state of national adolescence by the South Korean public. Too many of them (some polls suggest most) see America as a barrier to reunification with their ethnic kindred in the North. Maybe nothing short of a North Korean attack on the South can encourage more sober thinking by South Koreans about their own security, but I suspect a greater sense of self-reliance and even vulnerability might.</strong><br />
<strong>During my service in Korea, as U.S. taxpayers subsidized South Korea’s defense, South Korea subsidized Kim Jong Il’s potential offense with billions of dollars in hard currency that sustained the very threat against which we were ostensibly helping to defend. South Korea never made North Korea’s disarmament a condition of this aid. Instead, that aid effectively undermined U.S. and U.N. sanctions meant to force North Korea to disarm. What does South Korea have to show for this colossal outlay now.</strong><br />
<strong>Because South Korea, now one the world’s wealthiest nations, expects up to 600,000 American soldiers to arrive protect it from any security contingency, successive South Korean governments actually cut their nation’s defense rather than modernizing it and building an effective independent defense. Consequently, South Korea still has a 1970-vintage force structure, designed around a 1970-vintage threat, equipped with 1970-vintage weapons.</strong><br />
<strong>This is partly the legacy of ten years of leftist administrations, but it’s also the legacy of military welfare that allowed South Korea to defer upgrading its equipment, building a professional volunteer army, and organizing an effective reserve force to deal with security contingencies. Worst of all, South Korea diverted billions of dollars that should have been spent on modernizing its military into regime-sustaining aid to Kim Jong Il, to be used, as far as anyone knows, for nukes, missiles, artillery, and pretty much everything but infant formula. To this day, South Korea continues to resist accepting operational control over its own forces in the event of war.</strong><br />
<strong>The U.S. Army presence in Korea is an anachronism, defending against the extinct threat of a conventional North Korean invasion. The far greater danger is that if Kim Jong Il assesses our current president as weak, he will choose more limited or less conventional means to strike at our soldiers and their families. Given the reported presence of Taliban operatives in Seoul, he might even plausibly deny responsibility for an attack.</strong><br />

<strong>U.S. troops based in South Korea don’t work as deterrents—military presence only causes instability and North Korean nuclearization</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>On the night of March 26 the South Korean 1,200-ton warship Cheonan patrolled the boundary waters between North and South Korea. At 10:45 an explosion near the bow rocked the vessel and sank the Cheonan, taking the lives of 46 crew members with it. Although the investigation is still ongoing, the South Korean Defense Minister has declared that a torpedo is the likeliest source of the blast. North Korea appears to have destroyed the South Korean warship.</strong><br />
<strong>Normally such an unprovoked attack would start a war, but the Korean peninsula is not a normal place. The Koreans, with their strong sense of nationalism, remain divided along the 38th parallel, with a 2.5 mile “demilitarized zone” between them. Meanwhile approximately 28,000 US troops still help guard the border. An armistice formally ended hostilities in Korea in 1953, but officially the war never ended. No peace treaty was ever signed. One year ago, the North formally and ominously withdrew from the armistice.</strong><br />
<strong>North Korea, a tiny country with the world’s 4th largest standing army, is the most militarized society in the world. It has a standing army of 1.2 million soldiers, and a peasant militia with as many as 4 million reserves. Some 13,000 artillery pieces, dug into the hills within range of the South Korean capital of Seoul, are poised to obliterate the South’s most important city upon “The Dear Leader’s” command. Some estimates suggest that as many as one million South Koreans could die under such an assault. Then there’s the matter of North Korea’s several nuclear weapons.</strong><br />
<strong>South Korea, officially the “Republic of Korea,” has about half as many soldiers as the North, but they are better trained and far better equipped. South Korea is wealthy and technologically advanced. North Korea has half the population and 1/30th the economy of the South. While the rulers of the North live lavishly, famine killed a million people in the 1990s, and the United Nation’s World Food Program is worried that this year may witness the worst food shortages since then. Starving people can be dangerous people. Historically North Korea uses its military, its only strength, as leverage to obtain outside assistance.</strong><br />
<strong>South Korea today might well be able to ultimately defend itself against the North, but the bloodshed would be horrific. A key factor in any future conflict is Seoul’s location so near the North. Experts suggest (See “Is Kim Jong-il Planning to Occupy Seoul?” ) that a recently revised North Korean military strategy consists of swiftly taking Seoul and holding the city’s millions of people as hostages.</strong><br />
<strong>All of this begs a couple of important questions. How many more South Korean ships can be torpedoed before the South retaliates, surely starting a larger war? And, what are 28,000 American troops doing in the middle of this Korean powder keg? As the sinking of the Cheonan clearly indicates, the sparks are already flying.</strong><br />
<strong>The permanent US military deployment in South Korea is a Cold War anachronism. There is absolutely no reason that a nation as advanced and prosperous as South Korea cannot defend itself from its pathetically backward northern brothers and sisters. A well-known night-time satellite image taken from space shows a brilliant South and a North languishing in the Dark Ages.</strong><br />
<strong>The US presence creates political dysfunction while it minimally protects South Korea. US soldiers on South Korean soil breed resentment. Thousands of nationalist South Korean students regularly take to the streets to protest the Americans soldiers in their country and to call for unification between North and South.</strong><br />
<strong>South Korean and US government policies are often awkwardly out of step with each other, with America often having the far more hawkish posture, as it did during the W. Bush years. American security guarantees have perhaps sometimes led the government of the South to engage in policies of inappropriate appeasement toward the North.</strong><br />
<strong>The threat of South Korea investing in nuclear weapons to counter the North might, for example, finally persuade China to put sufficient pressure of North Korea. A South Korea determined to match North Korean nuclear weapons development might paradoxically further the goal of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.</strong><br />
<strong>Most crucially, from an American point of view, the US Army is stretched too thin to play much of a role in protecting South Korea. As things stand, American soldiers are little more than targets for North Korean artillery and missiles. A defense of Seoul, its re-conquest, and forcible regime change in the North are all beyond US military capabilities at this time, given its commitments elsewhere. US participation on the ground in a new Korean War would also stress the US federal budget beyond the breaking point.</strong><br />
<strong>The United States never properly created a new foreign and defense policy when the Cold War ended. Instead, it has generally maintained its Cold War military posture, with bases and commitments strewn throughout the globe, even as new challenges since 911 have called American forces to new missions. The US military presence in Korea is a Cold War artifact that needs to be brought home before it’s too late.</strong><br />

U.S. policy makers were already annoyed at Beijing's long-standing reluctance to pressure its ally regarding its provocative nuclear program. But China's failure to condemn Pyongyang's rogue behavior in the Cheonan episode was seen as inexcusable. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Nevertheless, the Chinese government did not waver in its support of North Korea. Beijing insisted that the UN Security Council resolution condemning the Cheonan sinking not name Pyongyang as the perpetrator. Washington reluctantly accepted such language rather than risk a Chinese veto, but U.S. officials were not happy, and they publicly criticized China's stance. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">While that dispute was flaring, tensions erupted regarding the South China Sea. At an ASEAN Regional Forum meeting in Hanoi, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asserted that “the United States has a national interest in freedom of navigation, open access to Asia's maritime commons, and respect for international law in the South China Sea.” She went on to advocate a binding code of conduct for the various nations, including China, that make claims to disputed islands in that body of water. Clinton also proposed the development of an institutional process for resolving those disputes, and indicated that the United States wanted to participate in that process. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Beijing's reaction was swift and hostile. Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi portrayed Clinton's remarks as “an attack” on China. Questioning Washington's sincerity on the issue, he stated that “nobody believes there's anything threatening the region's peace and stability.” Finally, Chinese leaders made it very clear that they believed the United States had no legitimate role to play in resolving competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Beijing's uncooperative attitude has played into the hands of hawks in the United States. Writing in the pages of the Wall Street Journal, American Enterprise Institute scholar Daniel Blumenthal praised Clinton for standing up “to China's bullying.” But he regarded such surprising fortitude merely as a good beginning. He went on to propose that the United States orchestrate a de facto diplomatic and military containment policy against Beijing. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">China's behavior has become a matter of understandable concern. But the United States must pick its battles in terms of taking hard-line stances. We can't prevail on every issue. Many of the same experts and pundits who want the Obama administration to adopt an uncompromising attitude on territorial claims and navigation rights in the South China Sea and pressure China regarding its lack of effective help regarding North Korea also want Washington to confront Beijing on such matters as Taiwan, China's currency valuation, the treatment of domestic dissidents and the status of Tibet. There is a marked unwillingness to set priorities. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Beijing's failure to rein in an increasingly reckless Pyongyang is a legitimate security issue for the United States. So too are China's breathtakingly broad claims in the South China Sea. China regards virtually that entire sea as its territorial waters—something that, if enforced, would have profound implications for international navigation and commerce. As the world's leading maritime and trading power, the United States cannot tamely accept such a brazen attempt to change the status of international waters through which much of the world's commerce flows. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">But even on those issues, Washington needs to understand that some concessions may need to be made to secure Chinese cooperation. It is unrealistic to expect, for example, that China will incur the risks involved in pressuring North Korea if the United States offers nothing in return. Beijing worries that coercing Pyongyang could cause Kim Jong-il's regime to unravel—perhaps even cause the North Korean state itself to implode, much as East Germany did at the end of the 1980s. That development would produce massive refugee flows into China, and possibly result in the emergence of a united Korea closely allied to the United States and with a U.S. military presence on the peninsula. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">If we want China to take on serious risks to tame North Korea, we have to offer some incentives. Promising to assist Beijing in dealing with the probable refugee problem would seem to be the absolute minimum. In all likelihood, Chinese leaders would also want a commitment to phase out American military bases in Korea if the North Korean threat were neutralized. Yet Washington has not offered the slightest hint of concessions on either issue. U.S. officials implicitly expect Beijing to accept the risks entailed in getting tough with Pyongyang but receive nothing at all in return. </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span class="Underline">China is key to solve— </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span class="Underline">First, the plan allows Beijing to use its economic leverage </span></strong><br />
<strong>Carpenter 10—<span class="Underline">vice president for defense and foreign-policy studies at the Cato Institute (Ted Galen, Winter 2010, Plan B for Dealing with North Korea, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/Policy-TedGalenCarpenter.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pubs/Policy-TedGalenCarpenter.pdf</a>, RBatra) </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The strategy of imposing tighter economic sanctions also faces major hurdles. Both Beijing and Moscow have consistently opposed vigorous sanctions in the UN Security Council, arguing that they will make Pyongyang less rather than more cooperative. The Russians and Chinese (particularly the latter) were successful in dramatically diluting the 2009 sanctions that the United States and Japan wanted.</strong><br />
<strong>It is especially important to understand the reasons for China's reluctance to endorse truly robust sanctions. Although a few Sinophobes in the United States charge that China is in league with the North Koreans and would not mind a nuclear-armed North Korea, most evidence suggests that Beijing is not eager to see nuclear weapons introduced on the Korean Peninsula. Among other drawbacks, such a development may lead the Japanese to build nuclear deterrents of their own, which is the last thing China wants.</strong><br />
<strong>Maintaining the non-nuclear status quo on the Korean Peninsula may be a significant Chinese objective, but it is not their most important one.5 Beijing's top priority is to preserve the North Korean state as a buffer between China and the US sphere of influence in Northeast Asia. Chinese leaders probably fear that rigorous sanctions would increase the danger of the North Korean state imploding, much as East Germany did in 1989. Such a development could lead to a unified Korea allied to the United States right on China's doorsteps-probably with the continued presence of American military bases on the Korean Peninsula. It might lead to a massive flow of North Korean refugees into China. Uneasiness over these scenarios limits the amount of pressure that Beijing is willing to exert on Pyongyang.</strong><br />
<strong>In theory, China might be able to use its economic leverage as North Korea's principal source of energy, food, and other vital commodities to compel Kim Jong Il's regime to halt its nuclear weapons program. Without Chinese cooperation, coercive economic measures would have little impact on Pyongyang. And given Washington's dependence on Beijing's willingness to continue funding the soaring US Treasury debt, American officials are not in a good bargaining position to pressure China into endorsing robust sanctions.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Second, China is the only state that North Korea still trusts </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Foster-Carter 10—Honorary Senior Research Fellow in Sociology and Modern Korea, Leeds University (Aidan, 16 Steptember 2010, How North Korea was lost - to China, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/LI16Dg01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/LI16Dg01.html</a>, RBatra) *[ed] added in by RBatra </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Or worse, it may be too little too late. Lee lost the plot, and maybe he has lost the North too - permanently, or for the foreseeable future. Why, despite the Cheonan, is he now rushing to build bridges after all? Because an ailing, bankrupt and possibly desperate Kim Jong-il has just made his second visit in under four months to the one power he can still trust: China. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">And the winner is ... </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">So there's our winner. Its rivals' missteps have helped, but Beijing has long played a skillful, patient game. Like Moscow, it irked the North by recognizing South Korea (in 1992), but unlike the abrupt Russians it worked hard to soothe sensitivities. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Eighteen years on, guess which power is the top trade partner of both Koreas? Now, there's subtle hegemony for you. No prizes either for guessing who's snapping up North Korea's mines, and beginning the lengthy, costly process of modernizing its decrepit infrastructure. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Face it: who else has the motive, or the means? As all agree, China's overriding worry about North Korea is not Kim's nukes but fear of collapse, and the chaos this could cause on its own borders. Beijing's consistent strategy is not to paint Kim into a corner, no matter what. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Knowing that, how did policymakers in Seoul or Washington delude themselves that China would hurry to join a chorus of condemnation over the Cheonan? No way. Beijing squirmed a bit, but the game was worth the candle. Let Washington and Seoul huff and puff. All that achieved was to push[ed] an ever-more isolated North Korea further into China's orbit and influence. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Nothing is certain, especially about North Korea where forecasts (this writer's not least) have a habit of turning out wrong. I expected North Korea to collapse long ago: guilty as charged, m'lud. I understimated this tough regime's staying power, or the horrors it would impose on its people - including famine - to cling to power while refusing to see sense. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">But this can't go on forever. The old game of militant mendicancy is finally up. Kim Jong-il's frail health, a delicate succession, and an empty treasury - United Nations sanctions have hit arms exports, and crime doesn't pay like it used to - make defying the entire world just too risky. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">North Korea needs a sugar daddy. There is only one candidate left standing, and one who fits the bill perfectly. It may not be a marriage made in heaven, mind you. Pyongyang will keep squawking, and even try the old game of playing off its interlocutors - as in its latest thaw with Seoul. </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Third, North Korea’s nuclear program depends upon Chinese neutrality—China can use its superpower status to solve North Korean aggression</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Choi 10—Dr. Choi is a political scientist educated at Indiana University and taught at the University of Wisconsin and University of Seoul (Yearn-hong, 4 June 2010, China’s role in East Asia’s peace, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2010/06/137_67082.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2010/06/137_67082.html</a>, RBatra) </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Former President Kim Dae-jung and his successor Roh Moo-hyun launched the sunshine policy, with only wishful thinking. However, the 10 years under their rule did not produce any meaningful change in the North Korean regime. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">China has sided with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War. The latter's survival has basically depended on Beijing support, even as China has emerged as a superpower. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">It has used its position of permanent member of the United Nations' Security Council to protect North Korea. But its blind support and alliance with North Korea are raising questions as to China's ability as a superpower. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The North Korean dictatorial regime is heading for a three-generation succession, while its people are starved to death. A hundred thousand or more North Korean people are wandering around northeast China for their mere survival. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">China behind North Korea supported South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's sunshine policy toward the North when it began in 1998. That sunshine policy helped the North Korean regime survive with South Korea's economic assistance and humanitarian aid. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">However, that has been betrayed over the years by North Korea instigating sea battles in the Yellow Sea, killing an innocent woman tourist at the Mt. Geumgang resort and the conducting of a couple of nuclear bomb and long-range missile tests, well before the torpedo attack. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Now, many South Korean people believe that Seoul should give up the so-called sunshine policy. They ask why they should tolerate North Korea's barbaric acts, while continuing to provide astronomical economic assistance it. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Ten years is more than long enough to see some decent changes in the North, but nothing has happened. Behind this ``no change,&quot; has been China. This is a very unfortunate situation for China and North Korea. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Some, a very few, American journalists are sympathetic to the North Korean dictatorship and critical of South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's hard-line policy toward the North. They are ridiculous. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">These people do not see the cause-and-effect relationship. Lee has been trying to maintain a reciprocal relationship with the North. He has genuinely tried to maintain an amicable relationship with Pyongyang under the most difficult situations. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">President Barack Obama's foreign policy toward North Korea has been one <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:02:``tough but fair.&amp;quot; Lee and Obama have made every effort to bring North Korea to the table for the six-nation talks to freeze its nuclear ambitions for a `` -->tough but fair.&quot; Lee and Obama have made every effort to bring North Korea to the table for the six-nation talks to freeze its nuclear ambitions for a <!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:02 -->nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.&quot; </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Nevertheless, China has not used its superpower status and its U.N. Security Council membership to punish North Korea for its barbaric acts. That is the reason why the latter continues to behave like an ugly barbarian nation. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">China should do something to admonish and penalize crimes willfully committed by the North and any other countries: China is trying to say ``neutral&quot; on the two Koreas. Neutrality is just an excuse. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Under the name of neutrality, it provides forgiveness and encouragements of crimes against humanity. Under the protection of China, North Korea developed nuclear weapons and threatened South Korea, Japan and the United States. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Why is this? Probably because North Korea is China's colony or satellite. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">China should be serious toward North Korea, and control the latter's behavior. It is in a position to teach and admonish its ``satellite&quot; country. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Superpower nations should not just be armed with nuclear weapons, but civility and humility. China should show the world its decency, civility and responsibility. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Rogue nations should be punished by the international community. The United Nations is supposed to be a decent organization. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Assume: China's naval ship was destroyed by Taiwan's submarine attack, and 46 were killed. Could China be quiet or neutral? </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">China will not tolerate any attack from any nation. If this is the case, China should not tolerate the North Korean submarine's torpedo attack on a South Korean ship in South Korean waters. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">There is no excuse for China's ``neutrality&quot; which only encourages North Korea's barbaric acts! </span></strong><br />

<strong>Failure to de-nuclearize North Korea guarantees global proliferation and nuclear strikes that kill millions</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious, not only for the Northeast Asian region but for the whole international community.</strong><br />
<strong>At worst, there is the possibility of nuclear attack1, whether by intention, miscalculation, or merely accident, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities. On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust of unprecedented proportions.</strong><br />
<strong>But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view:</strong><br />
<strong>That is not global winter, but the nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years. The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow…The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger…To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.4</strong><br />
<strong>These, of course, are not the only consequences. Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. The direct impacts, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, could make the present global financial crisis pale by comparison. How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. There could be many unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with subsequent nuclear breakout and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, and aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant states. The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">North Korea is currently believed to have sufficient plutonium stocks to produce up to 12 nuclear weapons.6 If and when it is successful in implementing a uranium enrichment program - having announced publicly that it is experimenting with enrichment technology on September 4, 20097 in a communication with the UN Security Council - it would likely acquire the capacity to produce over 100 such weapons. Although some may dismiss Korean Peninsula proliferation risks on the assumption that the North Korean regime will implode as a result of its own economic problems, food problems, and treatment of its own populace, there is little to suggest that this is imminent. If this were to happen, there would be the risk of nuclear weapons falling into hands of non-state actors in the disorder and chaos that would ensue. Even without the outbreak of nuclear hostilities on the Korean Peninsula in either the near or longer term, North Korea has every financial incentive under current economic sanctions and the needs of its military command economy to export its nuclear and missile technologies to other states. Indeed, it has already been doing this for some time. The Proliferation Security Initiative may conceivably prove effective in intercepting ship-borne nuclear exports, but it is by no means clear how air-transported materials could similarly be intercepted. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Given the high stakes involved, North Korean proliferation, if unaddressed and unreversed, has the potential to destabilize the whole East Asian region and beyond. Even if a nuclear exchange does not occur in the short term, the acute sense of nuclear threat that has been experienced for over five decades by North Koreans as a result of US strategic deterrence is now likely to be keenly felt by fellow Koreans south of the 38th Parallel and Japanese across the waters of the Sea of Japan. China, too, must surely feel itself to be at risk from North Korean nuclear weapons, or from escalation that might ensue from next-use in the Korean Peninsula resulting not only in the environmental consequences noted above, but in regime collapse and massive refugee flows. South Korea and Japan appear willing to rely on their respective bilateral security pacts with the United States to deter North Korean nuclear attack for the time being. However, should South Korea and/or Japan acquire nuclear weapons, the outcome would be destabilizing, especially if this resulted from rupture of their alliance relationships with the United States. Both have the technical capability to do so very rapidly. South Korea has previously engaged in nuclear weapons research but desisted after US pressure. Japan still proclaims its adherence to the three Non-Nuclear Principles although recent confirmation that the United States routinely transited nuclear weapons through Japan and retains the right of emergency reintroduction of nuclear weapons has tarnished Japan’s non-nuclear image. Moreover, it has large stockpiles of plutonium that could rapidly be used to produce nuclear warheads. Such responses, already advocated by conservative and nationalist groups within South Korea and Japan, could trigger a regional nuclear arms race involving the Koreas, Japan, Taiwan, and China, with incalculable wider consequences for Southeast Asia, South Asia and the whole Pacific and beyond. These developments would spell the demise of the current global non-proliferation regime as underpinned by the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Failure to reverse the DPRK’s nuclear breakout is also an important factor driving a general malaise in the exercise of American power which one of the authors has characterized elsewhere as “the end of American nuclear hegemony.”8 </span></strong><br />

<strong><span class="Underline">Guarantees nuclear war </span></strong><br />
<strong>Cimbala 10 - Prof. of Political Science @ Penn State, (Stephen, Nuclear Weapons and Cooperative Security in the 21st Century, p. 117-8)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Failure to contain proliferation in Pyongyang could spread nuclear fever throughout Asia. Japan and South Korea might seek nuclear weapons and missile defenses. A pentagonal configuration of nuclear powers in the Pacific basis (Russia, China, Japan, and the two Koreas – not including the United States, with its own Pacific interests) could put deterrence at risk and create enormous temptation toward nuclear preemption. Apart from actual use or threat of use, North Korea could exploit the mere existence of an assumed nuclear capability in order to support its coercive diplomacy. As George H. Quester has noted:</strong><br />
<strong>If the Pyongyang regime plays its cards sensibly and well, therefore, the world will not see its nuclear weapons being used against Japan or South Korea or anyone else, but will rather see this new nuclear arsenal held in reserve (just as the putative Israeli nuclear arsenal has been held in reserve), as a deterrent against the outside world’s applying maximal pressure on Pyongyang and as a bargaining chip to extract the economic and political concessions that the DPRK needs if it wishes to avoid giving up its peculiar approach to social engineering.</strong><br />
<strong>A five-sided nuclear competition in the Pacific would be linked, in geopolitical deterrence and proliferation space, to the existing nuclear deterrents in India and Pakistan, and to the emerging nuclear weapons status of Iran. An arc of nuclear instability from Tehran to Tokyo could place U.S. proliferation strategies into the ash heap of history and call for more drastic military options, not excluding preemptive war, defenses, and counter-deterrent special operations. In addition, an eight-sided nuclear arms race in Asia would increase the likelihood of accidental or inadvertent nuclear war. It would do so because: (1) some of these states already have histories of protracted conflict; (2) states may have politically unreliable or immature command and control systems, especially during a crisis involving a decision for nuclear first strike or retaliation; unreliable or immature systems might permit a technical malfunction that caused an unintended launch, or a deliberate but unauthorized launch by rogue commanders; (3) faulty intelligence and warning systems might cause one side to misinterpret the other’s defensive moves to forestall attack as offensive preparations for attack, thus triggering a mistaken preemption.</strong><br />

<strong><span class="Underline">Strategic reassurance to China is failing now—more effective concessions like the plan are needed to spur co-operation on multiple vital interests </span></strong><br />

<strong><span class="Underline">The Obama administration took office in 2009 determined to move beyond might-makes-right-makes-might unilateralism of the Bush years, and reassert America's global influence as the most principled and powerful guarantor of rule-based multilateralism. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">With respect to China, this approach was presented as a doctrine of &quot;strategic reassurance&quot;. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">However, the policy has not yielded the systemic breakthroughs that the Obama administration hoped to achieve on climate change, non-proliferation, Middle East security, still less on U.S.-China relations. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Instead, increasingly acrimonious exchanges between Beijing and Washington reveal the contradictions inherent in attempting to shoehorn an authoritarian, mercantilist, and suspicious nation into a refurbished world system that ostensibly promotes democracy, open markets, multilateralism, while forcefully advancing American interests. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Now the Obama administration seems to have accepted a world of lowered expectations and strives for the more achievable goal of advancing U.S. power at China’s expense. Friction with China has emerged as a regular feature of U.S. diplomacy—a means to score points in the game of international diplomacy at the expense of an unpopular, uncooperative, and, at least for the moment, diplomatically and militarily weaker regime. Indeed, U.S. China policy today looks a lot like good old-fashioned rollback, isolating China instead of incorporating it into a win-win multi-polar system. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The Western press, distracted by individual issues such as Iran sanctions, Google, and the Cheonan sinking, seems oblivious to the fact that the U.S.-China relationship has lurched into zero-sum territory and relations are in the deep freeze, largely as the result of the willingness of the Obama administration to confront China in pursuit of its agenda. The Chinese media, on the other hand, talks about nothing else. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Observers who believe that China will yield to U.S. pressure as long as its access to world markets is assured are ignoring unmistakable signs that Beijing has decided that, while its economic interests are vital, it must be prepared to downplay short-term economic gain in order to ensure its geopolitical position and national future. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Even in its inception, U.S. demands for “strategic reassurance” were inherently unequal, framed as something that China had to provide up front before the U.S. would reciprocate. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg described the doctrine at a Center for a New American Security conference on China in September 2009. The onus for reassurance was put on China in a way that Beijing undoubtedly found grating. (1) </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Strategic reassurance rests on a core, if tacit, bargain. Just as we and our allies must make clear that we are prepared to welcome China’s “arrival”, as you all have so nicely put it, as a prosperous and successful power, China must reassure the rest of the world that its development and growing global role will not come at the expense of security and well-being of others. Bolstering that bargain must be a priority in the U.S.-China relationship. And strategic reassurance must find ways to highlight and reinforce the areas of common interest, while addressing the sources of mistrust directly, whether they be political, military or economic. </span></strong><br />

<strong>Emmott, 10 – Independent writer and consultant on international affairs and former editor of The Economist, After studying politics, philosophy and economics at Magdalen College, Oxford in 1975-78, Bill moved to Nuffield College to do postgraduate research into the French Communist party's spell in government in 1944-47 (5/31/10, Bill, The Sunday Times, “China’s stance on North Korea could lead to war,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/bill_emmott/article7140609.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/bill_emmott/article7140609.ece</a>, JMP)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>It is time to worry rather more, by focusing instead on China and its policy towards North Korea. For what China’s reaction should tell us is that China’s interests in the Korean Peninsula are different from those of the West, of South Korea or of Japan. And in that divergence of interest lies danger: it makes North Korea the likeliest flashpoint for a potential conflict between China and America.</strong><br />
<strong>On other issues, the Chinese leadership is widely lauded for its fast and effective decision making — on bulldozing old city centres, for example, or building motorways and power stations, or giving aid to African governments in return for mining rights. Far better than those fusty old democracies, mutter the admirers. So why, we should all be asking, are they so slow to make up their minds about North Korea and its acts and threats of war?</strong><br />
<strong>The official line is that China is concerned about stability in North Korea and fears a huge influx of refugees across its long border with that country if Mr Kim’s regime should collapse. A further line, peddled more quietly by Chinese officials, is that China doesn’t really have much influence over those strange, unpredictable Koreans. So all it can do is take part in the six-party talks over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, an on-off exercise that gathers together America, China, Japan, Russia and the two Koreas, urge everyone to show restraint, and hope for the best.</strong><br />
<strong>This line, always pretty thin, is looking ever thinner. The idea that Chinese security forces would not be capable of crowd control in the border region beggars belief. Dealing with refugees might be awkward, and even costly, but as a reason for tolerating military adventurism it is simply not credible. Nor is the notion of Chinese impotence: most of North Korea’s trade is with China, most of its oil supply comes from there, and virtually the only foreign companies in North Korea are Chinese. It would be pretty easy for China to “keep its boot on Kim’s neck”, as Americans like to say these days.</strong><br />
<strong>So why doesn’t it? The answer, surely, must be that China prefers to keep North Korea the way it is. Strategically, it provides a buffer against Japan and averts the prospect of a troublesome and eventually powerful unified Korea in the future. This has been the case ever since Mao Zedong sent in Chinese troops to rescue the North during the Korean War of 1950-53. This preference would not matter much as long as the North Korean regime looked basically stable and was a danger principally to its own people. But this is no longer the case.</strong><br />
<strong>Imagine what could happen when Kim Jong Il dies — which, being 68 and unhealthy, he might suddenly do. Suppose there is a struggle over the succession, one that could turn bloody, given that North Korea is said to be the world’s most militarised society. America, well aware that North Korea has about half a dozen nuclear warheads, will feel an urgent need to send troops in to seize nuclear materials. South Korea will, like Helmut Kohl in 1989, feel an urgent, historic need to ignore the huge costs and push for unification: the North is family, after all.</strong><br />
<strong>And China? My guess is that it would send its troops to the border, and probably across it, “in the interests of stability”, but actually to keep North Korea independent and under Chinese tutelage. The stage would thus be set for the first 21st-century confrontation between two superpowers.</strong><br />
<strong>This is one of the biggest risks facing the world. To reduce it, China needs to be engaged in open dialogue about North Korea, its behaviour and, above all, its future. It may not be seemly to discuss what to do when a regime collapses, especially one of an ally, but that is increasingly necessary in the case of the Kim dynasty.</strong><br />
<strong>Communication between the Chinese and American militaries remains patchy, with efforts to set up hotlines and the like slow to come to fruition. The chances of a misunderstanding in a moment of tension are high. Communication between the political leaderships is better, if still very stilted. The Cheonan sinking could be the last chance to force China to face up to the fact that its North Korean dependant is not just embarrassing but dangerous, to force it to discuss the future of the Korean Peninsula, to force it to join the 21st century rather than staying stuck in the 1950s. Unless that happens, next time it could really be war.</strong><br />

<strong>The status quo military alliance raises tensions and risks miscalculation with China</strong><br />
<strong>Yuan 10 – Associate Professor at the Center for International Security Studies in Sydney, Australia (Jingdong, August 20, 2010, Asia Times, Deep Reasons for China and US to bristle, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/LH20Ad01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/LH20Ad01.html</a>, RBond)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>US-South Korean naval exercises in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan, which included the participation of the aircraft carrier USS George Washington and ostensibly as a show of resolve and response to North Korea's alleged sinking of the South Korean ship the Cheonan, are viewed by Chinese analysts as a provocation. Added to this was the new US-ROK ''2+2'' meeting held in Seoul that involve the two countries' foreign and defense ministers. The signal is not lost to Beijing: Washington's efforts to strengthen military alliances in the region are aimed at reasserting US dominance and containing China's influence. Underlying the growing tension and maneuvering is the lack of mutual trust and in-depth strategic communication. This has left much room for mutual suspicion, misapprehension, and even miscalculation. And this is taking place at a time the US is seeking to reassert its primacy in Asia while China is trying to claim what it views its rightful place in the region. The contest could put East Asia's stability and prosperity at great peril to the detriment of all involved.</strong><br />
<strong>Clearly, managing the changing Sino-US relations is a critical task for leaders and strategists in both countries. However, differences in perceptions and interests, coupled with domestic politics in China and the United States, make such a task at once difficult and imperative. Obama needs to assert himself and dispel the notion that he is weak and too accommodative on foreign policy issues. In China, the pending leadership transition also raises the stakes for contenders to appear firm on issues vital to China's core interests.</strong><br />
<strong>It is not inevitable that the two countries are destined on a slippery slide to confrontation. After all, too much is at stake and neither power can afford another cold war in the 21st century. However, such recognition is hardly a guarantee that future conflicts can be avoided. Much depends on whether cooler heads will prevail in Beijing and Washington even if they have to live with a strategic rivalry for decades to come.</strong><br />

<strong>What some Washington policymakers really hope to do is encircle and contain China. As noted earlier, some South Koreans desire a continued U.S. presence to deter Japanese aggression (which is about as likely as an invasion from Mars) or Chinese pressure (economic influence is inevitable, while mili¬tary invasion is hardly imaginable), but America has little cause to station a permanent garrison in East Asia to protect a small client state from such unlikely threats—which are of little concern to Washington in any case. Instead, the United States is interested in permanent bases for use in other, more likely contingencies, such as a Sino-American conflict over Taiwan. However, offi¬cials in Seoul respond with horror when questioned about their potential involvement in such a conflict: they have no interest in turning their nation into a permanent enemy of China over an issue about which they have no concern. Yet they cannot expect Washington to promise to make war only on their terms.</strong><br />

<strong><span class="Underline">The U.S.-South Korea alliance forms the cornerstone of the South's national security and diplomacy. But China is South Korea's largest trading partner, and it also has a huge influence on peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula. The time has come for Seoul to factor into its diplomacy and security policies both China and its intensifying competition with the U.S. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The code word for &quot;containment&quot; in the Asian press, by the way, is &quot;Cold War atmosphere&quot;. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The message that the Time article was meant to send was that the U.S. Navy are now devoted to defining, countering, and to some extent creating a Chinese threat in the Pacific in order to preserve the scale of its forces and protect its budget. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The Chinese government, given the concerted efforts by the Obama adminstration to rollback China's influence throughout the world diplomatically and economically as well as militarily, will undoubtedly draw more sweeping conclusions. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">I would take issue with two statements in Williams' article. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">First, especially but not exclusively on the issue of the Korean peninsula, the U.S. is there as an unbalancer, not a &quot;balancer&quot; as Bonnie Glaser put it. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The tilt away from the Six Party Talks structure including China to a strengthened ROK-USA security condominium is a signal that a Western response to instability on the peninsula, be it from &quot;provocations&quot; or the demise of Kim Jung Il, will not include China as an equal partner. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The U.S. media has largely ignored the vitriolic response in the Chinese press to America's military moves, but the Chinese clearly see that the pendulum has swung away from stability--with the U.S. presence precluding a rush to rearmament by Japan---to containment. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Containment, to China, implies that the U.S. will continue to fan fears of China's military ambitions to encourage the rise of India and the the creation of pro-American governments and policies throughout Asia and turn a blind eye or, even worse, extend an enabling hand to Asian states that develop adventurist ambitions in challenging China on the issue of the uninhabited but contested islands that dot the region. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">I guess we'll find out if the Obama administration has a long-term plan sees an upside in a near-open breach of relations with China beyond giving the opportunity for the U.S. to play to its military strength in Asia and cooperate with local political leaders like South Korea's Lee Myung-bak, who want to use Washington as a counterweight to Beijing. </span></strong><br />

<strong>China relations are impossible without U.S. concessions allowing a sphere of influence in Korea</strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The Obama administration has explicitly sought to “reset” the relationship with Russia, which had become quite dysfunctional during the final years of the Bush administration. Although Washington has not used the reset terminology with respect to the troubled U.S. relationship with China, the substantive goal appears to be similar. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates’ effort to restore the dialogue between the militaries of the two countries is one indication of that intent. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Both goals, however, are encountering headwinds for a key reason. Policy makers seem unwilling to accept the reality that any great power in the international system expects, and will seek to enforce, a sphere of influence in its immediate region. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice famously (or infamously) insisted that the concept of a sphere of influence was both obsolete and pernicious. But that viewpoint is dangerously erroneous. The tensions between the United States and Russia and those between the United States and China confirm that point. </span></strong><br />

<strong>To begin with, the Korean peninsula encapsulates China’s continuing yet elusive quest to restore its past glory, to make a “rich country, strong army” (fuguo qiangbing), and to achieve great-power status. For one thing, not only was traditional Korea part of the Sinocentric world order up to the mid-19th century, but it was also there that the fledgling People’s Republic confronted the mighty United States 50 years ago. Moreover, the 1992 Sino-South Korean normalization and their fastgrowing economic and other ties testify to the vicissitude of Cold War politics and the validity of China’s ongoing reform and open-door policy. Furthermore, as North Korea’s newest nuclear gambit and a recent spate of anti-American sentiment in South Korea portend, China’s potential to become a full-fledged major power will likely be tested again in the rapidly-changing, yet uncharted, Korean peninsula. This fundamental fact has taken on a new relevance in light of the global discourse over the “rise of China”—be that “China’s peaceful rise” (heping jueqi),3 “China’s peaceful development” (heping fazhan)4 or “China threat theory” (weixielun).5</strong><br />
<br />

<strong>But American engagement may not be enough. The PRC could play a particularly important role in dissuading the North from its nuclear course. Indeed, H.D.S. Greenway of the Boston Globe has advocated building on &quot;the new climate of U.S.-Chinese cooperation of late.&quot; 94 Such a strategy would offer at least one additional benefit. Working together to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis successfully would make it easier to resolve other disputes between Washington and Beijing, thereby laying the groundwork for a wide-ranging partnership in the years and decades ahead. Nevertheless, the most important and immediate goal remains halting nuclear proliferation in Northeast Asia.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>But the present calm is not guaranteed to last. Two waves of confrontation between the United States and China took place in the strait, in the 1950s and in the 1990s. Serious tensions have come and gone, depending on developments in China, Taiwan, and beyond. Moreover, in the decade since the U.S. Air Force accidentally bombed China’s embassy in Belgrade in March 1999, military developments on both sides of the Pacific have drifted into unfamiliar and potentially dangerous waters. What political scientist Christopher Twomey aptly calls an “interlocking pattern” of new or upgraded strategic forces increases tensions and risks for both sides.1 In future war scenarios, the interactions of strategic forces may encourage preemptive moves that risk even more serious forms of escalation.</strong><br />
<strong>Current risks—already a source of discomfort—are only liable to grow as China and the United States continue to modernize their strategic forces. Each side tends to draw ominous inferences about the other’s intentions for new weapons developments, which justifies countermoves and, most of all, injects considerable suspicion and antagonism into a centrally important international relationship. The particular crisis, war, and escalation scenarios that animate this security dilemma are outweighed in significance by their potential to confound cooperation on crucial global challenges: financial stabilization, trade relations, economic recovery, and climate change. But this outcome can be avoided. China and the United States should seize on the current lull in cross-strait tensions to quell the prospect of a trans-Pacific strategic arms race before it becomes self-fulfilling.</strong><br />

<strong><em>The evolution of Sino-U.S. relations over the next months, years, and decades has the potential to have a greater impact on global security and prosperity than any other bilateral or multilateral arrangement. In this sense, many analysts consider the US.-China diplomatic relationship to be the most influential in the world. Without question, strong and stable U.S. alliances provide the foundation for the protection and promotion of U.S. and global interests. Yet within that broad framework, the trajectory of U.S.-China relations will determine the success, or failure, of efforts to address the toughest global challenges: global financial stability, energy security and climate change, nonproliferation, and terrorism, among other pressing issues. Shepherding that trajectory in the most constructive direction possible must therefore be a priority for Washington and Beijing. Virtually no major global challenge can be met without U.S.-China cooperation. The uncertainty of that future trajectory and the &quot;strategic mistrust&quot; between leaders in Washington and Beijing necessarily concerns many experts and policymakers in both countries. Although some U.S. analysts see China as a strategic competitor—deliberately vying with the United States for energy resources, military superiority, and international political influence alike— analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has generally found that China uses its soft power to pursue its own, largely economic, international agenda primarily to achieve its domestic objectives of economic growth and social stability.1 Although Beijing certainly has an eye on Washington, not all of its actions are undertaken as a counterpoint to the United States. In addition, CSIS research suggests that growing Chinese soft power in developing countries may have influenced recent U.S. decisions to engage more actively and reinvest in soft-power tools that have atrophied during the past decade. To the extent that there exists a competition between the United States and China, therefore, it may be mobilizing both countries to strengthen their ability to solve global problems. To be sure, U.S. and Chinese policy decisions toward the respective other power will be determined in large part by the choices that leaders make about their own nations interests at home and overseas, which in turn are shaped by their respective domestic contexts. Both parties must recognize—and accept—that the other will pursue a foreign policy approach that is in its own national interest. Yet, in a globalized world, challenges are increasingly transnational, and so too must be their solutions. As demonstrated by the rapid spread of SARS from China in 2003, pandemic flu can be spread rapidly through air and via international travel. Dust particulates from Asia settle in Lake Tahoe. An economic downturn in one country can and does trigger an economic slowdown in another. These challenges can no longer be addressed by either containment or isolation. What constitutes the national interest today necessarily encompasses a broader and more complex set of considerations than it did in the past As a general principle, the United States seeks to promote its national interest while it simultaneously pursues what the CSIS Commission on Smart Power called in its November 2007 report the &quot;global good.&quot;3 This approach is not always practical or achievable, of course. But neither is it pure benevolence. Instead, a strategic pursuit of the global good accrues concrete benefits for the United States (and others) in the form of building confidence, legitimacy, and political influence in key countries and regions around the world in ways that enable the United States to better confront global and transnational challenges. In short, the global good comprises those things that all people and governments want but have traditionally not been able to attain in the absence of U.S. leadership. Despite historical, cultural, and political differences between the United States and China, Beijing's newfound ability, owing to its recent economic successes, to contribute to the global good is a matter for common ground between the two countries. Today there is increasing recognition that no major global challenge can be addressed effectively, much less resolved, without the active engagement of—and cooperation between—the United States and China. The United States and China—the worlds first- and third-largest economies—are inextricably linked, a fact made ever more evident in the midst of the current global financial crisis. Weak demand in both the United States and China, previously the twin engines of global growth, has contributed to the global economic downturn and threatens to ignite simmering trade tensions between the two countries. Nowhere is the interconnectedness of the United States and China more clear than in international finance. China has $2 trillion worth of largely U.S. dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves and is the world's largest holder—by far—of U.S. government debt. Former treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson and others have suggested that the structural imbalances created by this dynamic fueled the current economic crisis. Yet. China will almost certainly be called on to purchase the lion's share of new U.S. debt instruments issued in connection with the U.S. stimulus and recovery package. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's February 23.2009, reassurance to Beijing that U.S. markets remain safe and her call for continued Chinese investment in the U.S. bond market as a means to help both countries, and the world, emerge from global recession underscored the shared interest—and central role—that both countries have in turning around the global economy quickly. Although China's considerable holdings of U.S. debt have been seen as a troubling problem, they are now being perceived as a necessary part of a global solution. Similarly, as the worlds two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and the United States share not only the collateral damage of energy-inefficient economic growth, but a primary responsibility to shape any ultimate global solutions to climate change. To date, cooperation has been elusive, owing as much to Washington's reluctance as to Beijing's intransigence. Painting China as the environmental bogeyman as an excuse for foot-dragging in policymaking is no longer an option; for its part, China, as the world's top polluter, must cease playing the developing-economy card. Yet energy security and climate change remain an area of genuine opportunity for joint achievement. Indeed, U.S.-China cooperation in this field is a sine qua non of any response to the energy and climate challenges. The sheer size of the Chinese economy means that collaboration with the United States could set the de facto global standards for etficiency and emissions in key economic sectors such as industry and transportation. Climate change also provides an area for cooperation in previously uncharted policy waters, as in emerging Arctic navigational and energy exploration opportunities. Washington and Beijing also share a deep and urgent interest in international peace and stability. The resumption of U.S.-China military contacts is a positive development. As two nuclear powers with worldwide economic and strategic interests, both countries want to minimize instability and enhance maritime security, as seen by parallel antipiracy missions in the waters otT Somalia. Joint efforts in support of United Nations peacekeeping, nonproliferation, and counterterrorism offer critical areas for bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Certainly, regional and global security institutions such as the Six-Party Talks concerning North Korea or the UN Security Council require the active engagement of both Washington and Beijing. Even more broadly, crisis management in geographic regions of mutual strategic interest like the Korean peninsula, Iran, or Burma require much more Sino-U.S. communication if the two countries are to avoid miscalculation and maximize opportunities to minimize human sutfering. Increasing the number of mid-level military-to-military exchanges would help in this regard. The United States and China could do more to cooperate on law enforcement to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in Western China. Afghanistan is competing with Burma as the main provider of narcotics to China; Washington could use its influence with the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul to develop a joint antinarcotics program. This could potentially build networks and joint capabilities that might be useful for U.S.-China cooperation on the issue of Pakistan. In addition, Washington should also encourage NATO-China cooperation along the Afghan border. Collaborating under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) might provide an additional framework for Beijing and Washington to address Central Asian security issues in a cooperative manner. 1he SCO, which includes Pakistan as an observer and will convene a multinational conference on Afghanistan in March 2009, has long made curbing narcoterrorism in Afghanistan a priority. In addition, the VS. Drug Enforcement Agency and the Chinese Anti-Narcotics Bureau should expand cooperation on interdiction and prosecution of heroin and meth traffickers. To be sure, there are a number of areas of serious divergence between Washington and Beijing. This should surprise no one. The United States has disagreements with even its allies. Two large powers with vastly dilferent histories, cultures, and political systems are bound to have challenges. History has shown, however, that the most effective way of addressing issues is for the U.S. and Chinese governments to engage in quiet diplomacy rather than public recrimination. In the U.S.-China context, there is often little to be gained—and much to be lost in terms of trust and respect—by a polarizing debate. Any differences, moreover, must not necessarily impede Sino-U.S. cooperation when both sides share strong mutual interests. I;. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that &quot;the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.&quot;3 Effective policy toward China by the United States, and vice versa, will require this kind of dual-minded intelligence. Moreover, working together on areas of mutual and global interest will help promote strategic trust between China and the United States, facilitating possible cooperation in other areas. Even limited cooperation on specific areas will help construct additional mechanisms for bilateral communication on issues of irreconcilable disagreement. In fact, many of the toughest challenges in U.S.-China relations in recent years have been the result of unforeseen events, such as the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999 and the EP-3 reconnaissance plane collision in April 2001. Building trust and finding workable solutions to tough problems is the premise behind the Obama administrations foreign policy of smart power, as articulated by Secretary of State Clinton. Smart power is based on, as Secretary Clinton outlined in her confirmation hearing, the fundamental belief that 'We must use... the full range of tools at our disposal—diplomatic, economic, military, political and cultural—picking the right tool, or combination of tools, for each situation.&quot;' As the CS1S Commission on Smart Power noted in November 2007, &quot;Smart Power is neither hard nor soft—it is the skillful combination of bothIt is an approach that underscores the necessity of a strong military, but also invests heavily in alliances, partnerships and institutions at all levels... .°5 As such, smart power necessarily mandates a major investment in a U.S.-China partnership on key issues. 'The concept enjoys broad support among the Chinese and American people and, by promoting the global good, it reaps concrete results around the world. There should be no expectation that Washington and Beijing will or should agree on all, or even most, questions. But the American and Chinese people should expect their leaders to come together on those vital issues that require their cooperation. U.S.-China partnership, though not inevitable, is indispensable.</em></strong><br />

Pacala and Socolow further theorize that advancing technology would allow for annual carbon emissions to be cut to 2 billion tons by 2104, a level that can be absorbed by natural carbon sinks in land and oceans. The Pacala/Socolow conceptualization has been extraordi­narily useful in helping to think about how to cut carbon emis­sions. During the three years since the article was written, the urgency of acting quickly and on a much larger scale has become obvious. We also need now to go beyond the conceptu­al approach that treats all potential methods of reducing carbon emissions equally and concentrate on those that are most prom­ising. Researchers such as James Hansen, a leading climate scien­tist at NASA, believe that global warming is accelerating and may be approaching a tipping point, a point at which climate change acquires a momentum that makes it irreversible. They think we may have a decade to turn the situation around before this threshold is crossed. I agree.?3 We often hear descriptions of what we need to do in the decades ahead or by 2050 to avoid &quot;dangerous climate change,&quot; but we are already facing this. Two thirds of the glaciers that feed the Yellow and Yangtze rivers of China will disappear by 2060 if even the current 7 percent annual rate of melting con­tinues. Glaciologists report that the Gangotri glacier, which supplies 70 percent of the ice melt that feeds the Ganges River during the dry season, could disappear entirely in a matter of decades.74 What could threaten world food security more than the melt­ing of the glaciers that feed the major rivers of Asia during the dry season, the rivers that irrigate the region's rice and wheat fields? In a region with half the world's people, this potential loss of water during the dry season could lead not just to hunger but to starvation on an unimaginable scale. Asian food security would take a second hit because its rice­-growing river deltas and floodplains would be under water. The World Bank tells us that a sea level rise of only 1 meter would inundate half of the riceland in Bangladesh. While a 1-meter rise in sea level will not happen overnight, what is worrisome is that if ice melting continues at today's rates, at some point such a rise in sea level will no longer be preventable. The melting that would cause this is not just what may happen if the earth's tem­perature rises further; this is something that is starting to hap­pen right now with the current temperature. As summer neared an end in 2007, reports from Greenland indicated that the flow of glaciers into the sea had accelerated beyond anything glaciologists had thought possible. Huge chunks of ice weighing several billion tons each were breaking off and sliding into the sea, causing minor earthquakes as they did so.!6 With melt-water lubricating the surface between the glaciers and the rocks on which they rested, ice flows were accelerating, flowing into the ocean at a pace of 2 meters an hour. This accel­erated flow, along with the earthquakes, shows the potential for the entire ice sheet to break up and collapse?? Beyond what is already happening, the world faces a risk that some of the feedback mechanisms will begin to kick in, fur­ther accelerating the warming process. Scientists who once thought that the Arctic Ocean could be free of ice during the summer by 2100 now see it occurring by 2030. Even this could turn out to be a conservative estimate.78 This is of particular concern to scientists because of the albedo effect, where the replacement of highly reflective sea ice with darker open water greatly increases heat absorbed from sunlight. This, of course, has the potential to further accelerate the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. A second feedback loop of concern is the melting of per­mafrost. This would release billions of tons of carbon, some as methane, a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming effect per ton 25 times that of carbon dioxide.79 The risk facing humanity is that climate change could spiral out of control and it will no longer be possible to arrest trends such as ice melting and rising sea level. At this point, the future of civilization would be at risk. This combination of melting glaciers, rising seas, and their effects on food security and low-lying coastal cities could over­whelm the capacity of governments to cope. Today it is largely weak states that begin to deteriorate under the pressures of mounting environmental stresses. But the changes just described could overwhelm even the strongest of states. Civilization itself could begin to unravel under these extreme stresses.</em></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><em>Accompanying all these diplomatic initiatives has been a vigorous, if largely unheralded, effort by the Department of Defense (DoD) to bolster US military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. The broad sweep of US strategy was first spelled out in the Pentagon's most recent policy assessment, the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), released on February 5. In discussing long-term threats to US security, the QDR begins with a reaffirmation of the overarching precept first articulated in the DPG of 1992: that the United States will not allow the rise of a competing superpower. This country &quot;will attempt to dissuade any military competitor from developing disruptive or other capabilities that could enable regional hegemony or hostile action against the United States&quot;, the document states. It then identifies <span class="il">China</span> as the most likely and dangerous competitor of this sort. &quot;Of the major and emerging powers, <span class="il">China</span> has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States and field disruptive military technologies that could over time offset traditional US military advantages&quot; - then adding the kicker - &quot;absent US counter-strategies.&quot; According to the Pentagon, the task of countering future Chinese military capabilities largely entails the development, and then procurement, of major weapons systems that would ensure US success in any full-scale military confrontation. &quot;The United States will develop capabilities that would present any adversary with complex and multidimensional challenges and complicate its offensive planning efforts,&quot; the QDR explains. These include the steady enhancement of such &quot;enduring US advantages&quot; as &quot;long-range strike, stealth, operational maneuver and sustainment of air, sea and ground forces at strategic distances, air dominance, and undersea warfare&quot;. Preparing for <span class="il">war</span> with <span class="il">China</span>, in other words, is to be the future cash cow for the giant US weapons-making corporations in the military-industrial complex. It will, for instance, be the primary justification for the acquisition of costly new weapons systems such as the F-22A Raptor fighter, the multi-service Joint Strike Fighter, the DDX destroyer, the Virginia-class nuclear attack submarine, and a new intercontinental penetrating bomber - weapons that would just have utility in an all-out encounter with another great-power adversary of a sort that only <span class="il">China</span> might someday become. In addition to these weapons programs, the QDR also calls for a stiffening of present US combat forces in Asia and the Pacific, with a particular emphasis on the US Navy (the arm of the military least used in the ongoing occupation of and <span class="il">war</span> in Iraq). &quot;The fleet will have a greater presence in the Pacific Ocean,&quot; the document notes. To achieve this, &quot;The navy plans to adjust its force posture and basing to provide at least six operationally available and sustainable [aircraft] carriers and 60% of its submarines in the Pacific to support engagement, presence and deterrence.&quot; Since each of these carriers is, in fact, but the core of a large array of support ships and protective aircraft, this move is sure to entail a truly vast buildup of US naval capabilities in the Western Pacific and will certainly necessitate a substantial expansion of the US basing complex in the region - a requirement that is already receiving close attention from Admiral Fallon and his staff at PACOM. To assess the operational demands of this buildup, moreover, this summer the US Navy will conduct its most extensive military maneuvers in the Western Pacific since the end of the Vietnam <span class="il">War</span>, with four aircraft-carrier battle groups and many support ships expected to participate. Add all of this together, and the resulting strategy cannot be viewed as anything but a systematic campaign of containment. No high administration official may say this in so many words, but it is impossible to interpret the recent moves of Rice and Rumsfeld in any other manner. From Beijing's perspective, the reality must be unmistakable: a steady buildup of US military power along <span class="il">China</span>'s eastern, southern and western boundaries. How will <span class="il">China</span> respond to this threat? For now, it appears to be relying on charm and the conspicuous blandishment of economic benefits to loosen Australian, South Korean, and even Indian ties with the United States. To a certain extent, this strategy is meeting with success, as these countries seek to profit from the extraordinary economic boom now under way in <span class="il">China</span> - fueled to a considerable extent by oil, gas, iron, timber, and other materials supplied by <span class="il">China</span>'s neighbors in Asia. A version of this strategy is also being employed by President Hu Jintao during his current visit to the United States. As <span class="il">China</span>'s money is sprinkled liberally among such influential firms as Boeing and Microsoft, Hu is reminding the corporate wing of the Republican Party that there are vast economic benefits still to be had by pursuing a non-threatening stance toward <span class="il">China</span>. <span class="il">China</span>, however, has always responded to perceived threats of encirclement in a vigorous and muscular fashion as well, and so we should assume that Beijing will balance all that charm with a military buildup of its own. Such a drive will not bring <span class="il">China</span> to the brink of military equality with the United States - that is not a condition it can realistically aspire to over the next few decades. But it will provide further justification for those in the United States who seek to accelerate the containment of <span class="il">China</span>, and so will produce a self-fulfilling loop of distrust, competition and crisis. This will make the amicable long-term settlement of the Taiwan problem and of North Korea's nuclear program that much more difficult, and increase the risk of unintended escalation to full-scale <span class="il">war</span> in Asia. There can be no victors from such a conflagration.</em></strong><br />

<strong><em><span class="Underline">Instead of emulating the policies of pre-World War I Britain toward Germany, the United States should take a page from another chapter in British history. In the late 1800s, although not without tension, the British peacefully allowed the fledging United States to rise as a great power, knowing both countries were protected by the expanse of the Atlantic Ocean that separated them. Taking advantage of that same kind separation by a major ocean, the United States could also safely allow China to obtain respect as a great power, with a sphere of influence to match. If China went beyond obtaining a reasonable sphere of influence into an Imperial Japanese-style expansion, the United States could very well need to mount a challenge. However, at present, little evidence exists of Chinese intent for such expansion, which would run counter to recent Chinese history. Therefore, a U.S. policy of coexistence, rather than neo-containment, might avoid a future catastrophic war or even a nuclear conflagration. </span></em></strong><br />

<strong><em>The areas of maximum danger and instability in the world today are in Asia, followed by the Middle East and parts of the former Soviet Union. The strategic situation in Asia is more uncertain and potentially threatening than anywhere in Europe. Unlike in Europe, it is possible to envisage war in Asia involving the major powers: remnants of Cold War ideological confrontation still exist across the Taiwan Straits and on the Korean Peninsula; India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and these two countries are more confrontational than at any time since the early 1970s; in Southeast Asia, Indonesia—which is the world’s fourth-largest country—faces a highly uncertain future that could lead to its breakup. The Asia-Pacific region spends more on defense (about $150 billion a year) than any other part of the world except the United States and Nato Europe. China and Japan are amongst the top four or five global military spenders. Asia also has more nuclear powers than any other region of the world.</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Asia’s security is at a crossroads: the region could go in the direction of peace and cooperation, or it could slide into confrontation and military conflict. There are positive tendencies, including the resurgence of economic growth and the spread of democracy, which would encourage an optimistic view. But there are a number of negative tendencies that must be of serious concern. There are deep-seated historical, territorial, ideological, and religious differences in Asia. Also, the region has no history of successful multilateral security cooperation or arms control. Such multilateral institutions as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the ASEAN Regional Forum have shown themselves to be ineffective when confronted with major crises.</em></strong><br />

<strong><em>Extinction</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Cheong 2k – East Asia Correspondent (Ching Cheong, The Straits Times, “No one gains in war over Taiwan,” 6-25-2000, Lexis-Nexis Universe)</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>A cross-strait conflict, even at the lowest end of the intensity scale, will suffice to truncate, if not to reverse, the steep GNP growth trends of the past few years. Other than the quantifiable losses from disrupted trade flows, there is also the longer-term damage to consider. For example, it took Taiwan almost three decades to establish itself as the third largest producer of information technology (IT) products in the world. It is now the island's single largest foreign exchange earner. The Sept 21 earthquake last year demonstrated the risk involved in Taiwan's dependence on the IT industry. A few days of power blackouts disrupted chip-manufacturing operations on the island, which in turn sent prices of these components soaring worldwide. Not surprisingly, a scramble followed for alternative sources of supply. A blockade lasting three months will devastate the industry in Taiwan. Similarly, it has taken China more than two decades to establish itself as the second largest recipient of private direct investment. In recent years, such investment has amounted to more than 20 per cent of China's total capital formation. A capital outflow will follow if there is trouble across the strait. Other than China and Taiwan, Japan's economy is likely to be hurt too if the blockade disrupts its &quot;life-line&quot; -the sea lane through which flows its supplies of oil and other commodities. Though no physical loss will be incurred, the blockade will force up prices across the board as Japan is so dependent on this sea lane. The Asean region stands to gain in the short run. Those with strong IT industries, like Singapore and Malaysia, will carve a big slice from what was previously Taiwan's share. Similarly, as investment flees China, the Asean countries might be able to intercept this flow and benefit thereby. Politically, the blockade is likely to provoke Sino-phobia in the region. Japan's rightwing forces will seize this golden opportunity to demand a revision of the post-war Constitution prohibiting its rearmament. Asean countries having territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea will beef up their defence budgets. Ethnic Chinese population in these countries may have to contend with increased suspicion or worse as Sino-phobia rises. The US stands to gain. So long as its stays on the sidelines, it does not lose the Chinese market. At the same time its defence industry gains as countries in the region start stocking up on arms in anticipation of trouble. DESTROYING THE TAIWAN MILITARY THE medium intensity scenario postulates a situation in which Beijing wages a war against Taiwan. The objective here is to obliterate its military capability which is seen as underpinning its independence movement. The outcome: Taiwan is brought to its knees but only after widespread death and destruction have been inflicted on the island and the coastal provinces of China. In this scenario, the US while feeling obliged to support Taiwan militarily is not party to a full-scale war with China. Washington's primary concern would be to keep it to a &quot;limited war&quot; to prevent hostilities from spinning out of control. Limited though it may be, the war will set back the economies of China and Taiwan by at least two to three decades. All the short-term gains enjoyed by the Asean countries in the low-intensity scenario will be nullified as the conflict intensifies. In this medium-intensity scenario, no one gains. Politically, all countries are forced to take sides. This decision is particularly hard to make in those countries having a sizeable ethnic-Chinese population. THE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -horror of horrors -raise the possibility of a nuclear war. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation. There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a nuclear Armaggedon over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else.</em></strong><br />

<strong><em>Inadvertent escalation guarantees nuclear use</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Dodge, 5 (Paul, Department of Defense and Strategic Studies – Missouri State University, “China’s Naval Strategy and Nuclear Weapons: The Risks of Intentional and Inadvertent Nuclear Escalation”, Comparative Strategy, 24(5), December, p. 415-416)</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>In the summer of 2005, Chinese Major-General Zhu Chenghu threatened the United States with nuclear attack, stating that, “If the Americans draw their missiles and position-guided ammunition on to the target zone on China’s territory, I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons.”1 It should be noted that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) considers Taiwan to be PRC territory, as well as the territorial waters surrounding the island, its exclusive economic zone, those of the Senkaku (Diaoyutai Islands), and virtually the entire South China Sea and its islands. To be successful in any military effort to acquire Taiwan or any of its many other territorial ambitions, the PRC realizes that it must be able to deter U.S. military intervention. The idea is to convince the United States and the world that China is both capable and, more importantly,</em> willing// to inflict grievous casualties on U.S. forces, even at the cost of heavy economic, diplomatic, and military losses to the PRC. Efforts toward this end have been manifested over recent years in the form of greatly increased military spending, the acquisition of weapons designed specifically to attack U.S. naval forces, the development of new strategic and tactical nuclear weapons, and the formation of a naval warfighting strategy that emphasizes asymmetric attacks on high-value U.S. assets and personnel. The July statement from General Zhu is of course among the most visible of these efforts. One wonders why General Zhu was not fired or even sternly reprimanded by his military and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) superiors for such a statement at an official press conference. In truth, it is but the latest in a string of bellicose remarks by high-ranking Chinese military officials designed to convince the U.S. policymaking, intelligence, and military communities that China is ready to escalate to the use of nuclear weapons should it become necessary. Classic deterrence, after all, dictates that an enemy can only be deterred through the combination of capability and credibility. However, when considered in the context of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Navy (PLAN) strategy to take on the United States in a naval and aerial conflict, China’s strategy to deter can be seen as a recipe for inadvertent nuclear escalation. Put simply, this piece argues that China’s warfighting doctrine is misguided, unrealistic, and dangerous. It is misguided because it places a great deal of focus on attacking U.S. aircraft carriers, which in reality are likely to be far more difficult to find, track, and attack than the Chinese realize. It is unrealistic because the vast majority of Chinese naval and air forces, which comprise the backbone of its conventional force options, are likely to be annihilated by American standoff weapons, advanced aircraft, and vastly superior attack submarines. Most important of all, the way in which China has mated its nuclear strategy to its conventional warfighting strategy is extremely dangerous because it makes nuclear war with the United States far more likely. There are several reasons why this is the case. First, China’s acquisition of advanced foreign weaponry, its expectation that the United States will back down at the first hint of casualties, and its belief that nuclear weapons can act as a force multiplier all threaten to lower the nuclear threshold and cause a deterrence failure vis-`a-vis U.S. forces in the region. Lulled into a false sense of security, China may act on its irredentist policies when it should be deterred by superior U.S. forces and slim chances for victory. Second, Chinese capabilities are actually very modest, meaning they are only suitable for combat against other regional states. When faced with a first-rate power, China’s forces will suffer heavy attrition. Finally, the loss of these forces, including high-value naval combatants, aircraft, and early warning assets, will cause China’s conventional strategy to collapse, leaving only nuclear options. At this point, the PRC will be left with only two real choices and find itself at a strategic “fork in the road.” On one hand, it can de-escalate, sue for peace, or otherwise accept defeat. On the other, it can fall back on the nuclear aspect of its doctrine. Enormous domestic, economic, and political pressures will make the choice of the former a very difficult one for the PRC leadership. The latter choice entails either early nuclear usage to avoid anticipated casualties, or later use in a desperate effort to cause massive U.S. casualties, aid PLAN conventional forces, or tip the tactical balance in China’s favor. This analysis first examines the conventional aspects of China’s naval strategy and its preoccupation with anti-carrier tactics. Nuclear weapons are closely integrated with conventional forces in this strategy, and both play a crucial role in threatening high-value U.S. assets. The discussion then turns to the real-world difficulties China would face while attempting to track and attack an aircraft carrier battlegroup. Similarly, the vital role of U.S. attack submarines in defeating China’s anti-access strategies will be detailed. While these sections explore why China’s anti-carrier and sea denial strategies are unlikely to succeed, they also highlight just a few of the many reasons why China’s forces would stand little real chance against U.S. forces in the foreseeable future. Finally, these factors will be analyzed in the context of theories of inadvertent escalation. Originally formulated in reference to late ColdWar conflict scenarios, these ideas are greatly germane to any future Sino-U.S. conflict. It is only through the exploration of the impacts of U.S. offensive and defensive actions, as well as the concomitant attrition of conventional forces, that the full escalatory dangers of Chinese warfighting strategy may be revealed.</strong><br />

<strong><span class="Underline">China views both the United States and Russia as having used negotiations—particularly on nuclear issues—to constrain China’s ability to develop its nuclear capability to defend itself, as well as to maintain their monopoly. Chinese analysts are frequently puzzled that despite U.S. supremacy in the nuclear and conventional realm, it still feels insecure. Under such conditions, they ask how can China, much less North Korea or any other country, feel secure if even the United States does not? </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The perceptual weight of former invasions by foreign powers, issues over sovereignty, and self-reliance in the areas of science, technology, and defense all remain paramount in Chinese writings.43 The Chinese analysts surveyed here uniformly perceive China as being forced down the path of becoming a nuclear power, to the point that it has only reacted to, rather than actively shaped, the threats and security environment around it.44 </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Nuclear threats and </span></strong>containment plans <strong>implemented by the United States during the early years of modern China’s formation—combined with the scientific, political, and economic isolation following China’s rupture with the Soviet Union—continue to have a significant and lasting impact on China’s security reasoning and calculus. While Chinese arms control analysts increasingly see China as an agent of change and progress in arms control and disarmament, they continue to discuss their reactive stance, as well as constraints and burdens of the regime.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">This conflicted stance plays out most directly when China calls for multilateral arms control and disarmament processes but routinely singles out the United States to unilaterally reduce its nuclear weapons. In addition, Chinese scholars fault the U.S. and Russian policy of preemption for exacerbating the pace of nuclear proliferation. Chinese authors view the two countries’ current and proposed nuclear weapons modernization programs as perpetuating nuclear deterrence. </span></strong><br />

<strong>Even if you end naval exercises, Navy presence itself causes U.S.-China war and naval arms race</strong><br />

<strong>The Jeju naval base is a likely bone of contention between the United States and China because of missile defense. Seoul plans to dock Aegis-equipped destroyers at Jeju. These warships are the main military component of the U.S. missile defense system. According to Xinhua Chinese newspaper, South Korea plans to build a new naval base on the southern island of Jeju to expand the range of its naval operations. U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin provides the Aegis combat system to Seoul. “China regards missile defense as the 21st century’s greatest threat and is dissatisfied with U.S. missile defense policy,” argues Cheong Wook-sik, director of Peace Network in South Korea. China believes that, in the event of a conflict over Taiwan, the United States will inevitably become involved because of missile defense.</strong><br />
<strong>South Korea, meanwhile, has indicated its interest in becoming more integrated into the U.S. missile defense system. In this way, by becoming caught in a conflict between China and the United States, the naval base could endanger Jeju Island and the national security of South Korea. According to Lee Tae-ho, deputy secretary general of People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy in South Korea, “The Chinese government has a response strategy that first attacks U.S. missile defense in the case of an emergency. That means that the Jeju naval base will be targeted in an armed conflict between the United States and China.” Even short of war, the base will create tension among China, Japan, and Korea, which could escalate into a naval arms race in the Asia-Pacific region.</strong><br />

<strong>A naval arms race that could have catastrophic consequences is developing in Asia-Pacific waters, a military expert warned at a conference here yesterday.</strong><br />
<strong>The naval build-up in North-east Asia has exceeded basic modernisation with the addition of new capabilities such as submarines, destroyers, large amphibious ships and long range missiles, experts said.</strong><br />
<strong>Professor Desmond Ball of the Australian National University warned that the build-up could lead to a calamity if it becomes a full-fledged arms race.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;There's no arms control regime in Asia that might constrain these acquisitions,&quot; he said.</strong><br />
<strong>He and other experts spoke at a conference on New Challenges To Asia Pacific Security organised by the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific.</strong><br />
<strong>Prof Ball said that, since 2000, nearly all countries in the region badly hit by the 1997 financial crisis had increased their defence spending again.</strong><br />
<strong>In South Korea, for instance, it rose 6.2 per cent in 2001 and then to 9.9 per cent by 2007.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;This has resulted, in rough terms, in doubling its defence capability since around 2000 beyond the level considered adequate for modernisation in the 1990s,&quot; he said. He believes that China now spends more on defence than any country in the world except the United States.</strong><br />
<strong>China has bought large numbers of frigates and destroyers from Russia and plans to acquire aircraft carriers as well.</strong><br />
<strong>Analyst Sam Bateman of the University of Wollongong in Australia said: &quot;China is usually seen as the trigger for a naval arms race, potentially shifting the military balance in Asia, although China strongly denies the claims.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>Its naval force expansion may explain the acquisition of new missile destroyers by South Korea and Japan, he said in an article distributed at the conference.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;While most navies, including the Chinese navy, stress that their capabilities are being developed for defensive purposes, it is often difficult to differentiate offensive from defensive capabilities,&quot; he said.</strong><br />
<strong>Chinese analyst Zhang Junshe of the Naval Research Institute said that his country was merely making modest improvements to its maritime defence capability and that its navy &quot;was still lagging behind other countries&quot;.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;We don't think the modernisation of the navy by countries in the region constitutes an arms race,&quot; he added.</strong><br />
<strong>Analyst Kwa Chong Guan of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) suggested in response to the arms race there &quot;should be more trust, more confidence building and more transparency&quot;.</strong><br />
<strong>The head of external programmes at NTU's Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, he warned: &quot;The consequence of the navy's build-up is the increasing probability of accidents and incidents at sea.&quot;</strong><br />

<strong>Chinese leaders would likely seek US concessions on Taiwan too. At the least, Beijing would want the United States to cease selling arms to Taiwan. The intensity of the Chinese government's reaction to the relatively modest arms package that the Obama administration approved in January 2010 suggests just how salient this issue is for Beijing. Chinese leaders would probably press Washington to be more 'cooperative' in telling Taiwan that there is no realistic alternative to ultimate re-unification with the mainland.</strong><br />
<strong>Giving Beijing such concessions on Taiwan might well prove more difficult and painful than conceding on the Korean Peninsula. And there should be no rush to grant the Chinese government its maximum demands for taking a more proactive position towards a disruptive and dangerous North Korea. Negotiations should be aimed at urging China to take decisive Chinese action for fewer concessions. At the same time, the nuclear crisis is urgent enough that US policymakers need to be flexible about their Taiwan policy in their negotiations with China.</strong><br />
<strong>For obvious reasons, making major geopolitical concessions to encourage China to be more forceful and proactive regarding the North Korean problem would not be easy for US policymakers. It would involve a tacit admission that China would henceforth be the most influential outside power with respect to Korean affairs, a development that would certainly not please Japan, Washington's principal ally in East Asia. It would also mean a measurable shift in the overall status and power positions of the United States and China in the region. Such a change would likely make all of China's neighbours somewhat nervous. Nevertheless, American-and East Asian-leaders must ask themselves whether such sacrifices might be the necessary price they have to pay to end the North Korean nuclear threat.</strong><br />

<strong>Japan relations solve war throughout Asia and solve the economy</strong><br />
<strong>Calder 9 (Kent E., director of the Reischauer Center for East Asian Studies. “Pacific Alliance” Page:217. 8/24/2009)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>As we have noted previously, the alliance continues to play some enduring roles in both countries: (I) inhibiting serious conflict between the United States and Japan; (2) arresting the emergence of an unstable balance of power world in Asia; (3) providing a nuclear guarantee to Japan; and (4) preventing an antagonist to American and Japanese interests from dominating the western Pacific. As World War II recedes ever further into history and as Pacific regional institutions and networks grow stronger, American consciousness of the first two points, and even arguably the third, erodes, and a defensive &quot;stop China&quot; rationale grows more salient. Yet the fundamental logic of all four classic systemic arguments for the U.S.-Japan alliance remains, for both partners. The Chinese challenge is compounded, in Japan's case, by deepening political-economic interrelationships across the Taiwan Strait and by parallel ties between Pyongyang and Seoul, even as North Korea increases its chemical, biological, and nuclear capabilities in the wake of actual nuclear tests, and enhances its military delivery systems. Alliances matter for Japan, in particular, because of its relatively modest scale in geostrategic terms; the dangers of an arms race with a nearby rising China; North Korea's emerging WMO capabilities; the need for defense of energy sea-lanes to the Middle East; and the imperative of assuring stable relations with the United States. Alliance with America, in particular, is attractive owing to Washington's geopolitical preeminence, its global intelligence-gathering capabilities, and its importance in helping stabilize global finance and trade systems crucial to Japanese well-being.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The Moscow-Washington START treaty is standing the test of time amid a “political tsunami” in the United States. On Thursday Barack Obama voiced hope that the Senate would ratify the treaty before the end of the year. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The statement was made following the President’s meeting with his Cabinet, the first one after the midterm election, which deprived the Democrats of their majority in the House, and of a number of seats in the Senate. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The election has made the political situation in the United States unpredictable, although the returns came as no surprise, including to Barack Obama. Anyway, he outlined a ratification of the treaty as a priority issue. He feels that the issue is due to be settled during the Senate’s so-called “lime duck” session, or before January, when the term of office of the Senators who lost the midterm election is due to expire. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The President relies precisely on lame ducks’ support, so as to say “yes” to the START treaty with Moscow. But this may prove unrealistic, says an expert with the Russian Foreign and Defence Policy Council Fyodor Lukyanov, and elaborates. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The ratification of the Treaty, Fyodor Lukyanov says, cannot be seen as guaranteed </span></strong>because the session is brief<strong>. In a situation like this Senators normally concentrate on issues that they see as more important, like budget-related problems, but</strong> certainly not international agreements. <br />
<strong><span class="Underline">What’s more, some point out that the treaty is important; therefore it would be wrong to push it though the Senate in a somewhat questionable situation. In other words, they should wait until the Senate meets in the new lineup. It is more likely that START will be ratified by the new Senate. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">But then, it is not impossible that the Republicans, who invariably vote against all of Obama’s initiatives, will try to further consolidate their negative stand, including on START, despite the President’s statement that the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty is not about the Democrats or Republicans, but about the US national security in general. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Alexander Shumilin of the Moscow-based Institute for the US and Canada Studies feels that the </span></strong>overall chance that the treaty will be ratified is decreasing<strong>. Here’s more from Alexander Shumilin.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">It is not necessarily that START will soon be rejected and de-facto denounced, Alexander Shumilin says, but the discussion of the document will slow down. All signs are the Republicans will use the treaty as a bargaining chip. They might agree to a ratification in exchange for some moves on the part of Obama. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">When signing the treaty in Prague on April 8th this year, the Russian and US Presidents agreed that all START adoption procedures would be synchronized. Three months later to the day the Russian Duma International Affairs Committee advised ratifying the document, which provides for reducing by Russia and the US the number of their strategic warheads by a third, down to 1,550. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">But this past Wednesday the Committee was compelled to point out that it is resuming the debates about the treaty following a number of amendments by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The amendments take the future US national missile defence system and some non-nuclear weapon systems from under the treaty jurisdiction, while ignoring Russia’s security interests. Therefore this country remains focused not only on a simultaneous ratification, but also on adherence to the content of the treaty. </span></strong><br />

<strong><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">For years it was hard to find a single American analyst, let alone policymaker, who did not recoil in horror at the suggestion that American forces be brought home from Korea</span></span>. Defenders of the commitment rushed to the barricades in the midst of Kim Daejung’s visit to Pyongyang. For instance, Robert Manning of the Council on Foreign Relations warned against the “loose talk about the future of the U.S.–South Korean alliance and the U.S. military presence in Korea.”81 Even after Roh’s election, U.S. Department of Defense consultant Richard Weitz advocates a continued U.S. presence for the purpose of “rapidly halting any North Korean invasion,” as if South Korea’s 700,000-man military didn’t exist.82 Former secretary of defense William J. Perry, Ashton B. Carter, and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, leading figures in the Clinton administration, offer the cliché of America’s and South Korea’s troops standing “shoulder to shoulder to deter North Korean aggression.”83 Left unanswered is the question of why American shoulders are necessary in the first place. Some analysts would move to strengthen and expand the U.S. commitment to South Korea. Ralph Cossa, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Pacific Forum, wants a force buildup.84 So does the Heritage Foundation.85 The Weekly Standard’s Bill Kristol wants efforts aimed at “shoring up the defense capabilities of South Korea.”86 The Bush administration seems to be taking those recommendations to heart: in early February 2003 Washington announced that it was supplementing its forces in Asia in response to a request from Adm. Thomas Fargo, Pacific commander of U.S. forces.87 <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">But now a growing number of commentators, including some <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">resolute hawks</span>, are saying that the</span> <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal; padding: 0in;">U</span></span>nited <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal; padding: 0in;">S</span></span>tates <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">need not remain in Korea, and certainly not if our forces are unwanted</span></span>.88 <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">The message has </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">hit home <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">even at the Pentagon</span></span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">More broadly</span></span>, notes Scott Snyder, the Asia Foundation’s representative in Korea, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">In Washington</span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">within the U.S. government and <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Congress</span></span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">there is a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">distinct, anti-Korean backlash</span>.”</span></span>89</strong><br />

The current joint command in Korea represents the only truly &quot;joint&quot; force in the world. The clear delineation of roles and reduced exposure to the increasingly suspect political will in Seoul for a potential conflagration that seems to be the objective in the U.S. support for transfer of wartime operation control would suggest at best a trial separation if not an amicable divorce. True, both the U.S. and the ROK proclaim unwavering support for the alliance and for the defense of the peninsula, but this support seems to be the equivalent of the assurances of separating parents that they are still &quot;friends&quot; and that they will still work together for the good of the child. The inevitable outcome appears to lay the groundwork for a much reduced U.S. presence on the Peninsula and, capabilities aside, a downgrade in the political perception of the alliance. In the end, as with the case with many divorces, this change may be for best, but it remains sad. It would be a mistake, however, to assume that this process is only being driven by the civilian leadership of the Defense Department. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Traditionally the bastion</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;"> of support for the U.S.-ROK alliance, the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">defense establishment</span></span></span> both in Washington and in Korea <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">now</span></span> arguably <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">gives Capitol Hill a run for its money as being the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">leading</span></span></span> skeptic, if not <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal; padding: 0in;">detractor</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">, of the alliance</span></span>, at lease in the context of current leadership in Seoul. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">Sensitive issues, such as anti-American incidents</span></span>, the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">vilification of the USFK</span></span> in blockbuster movies, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">and questions about environmental standards and basing</span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">have all taken their toll</span></span>.

In addition, the question of bombing ranges and whether the U.S. will have to travel to Alaska or Thailand to train appears to have been solved only by an unprecedented threat to withdraw the U.S. Air Force from Korea. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">Coupled with</span></span> base <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">relocation issues</span></span> and the growing difficulty of coordinating plans and policies regarding North Korea (a nation the ROK Ministry of Defense no longer designates as its primary enemy), and of course the question of wartime operational control, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;">these issues combine to </span><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-size: 13pt; padding: 0in;">challenge longstanding military support</span></span>.</strong><br />

<strong><span class="Underline">Moreover, in recent years, both the US and Russia, as well as Britain and China, have modified their procedures so that even if a nuclear-armed missile were launched, it would go not to a “real” target in another country but – at least in the US case - to empty ocean. In addition to the basic advantage of insuring against a nuclear detonation in a populated area, the fact that a missile launched in error would be on flight path that diverged from a plausible attacking trajectory should be detectable by either the US or the Russian warning systems, reducing the possibility of the accident being perceived as a deliberate attack. De-targeting, therefore, provides a significant protection against technical error. </span></strong>These arrangements <strong>– PALs and their equivalents coupled with continued observance of the agreement made in the mid-90s on “de-targeting” – do not eliminate the possibility of technical or operator-level failures, but they</strong> come very close to providing absolute assurance that such errors cannot lead to a nuclear explosion or be interpreted as the start of a deliberate nuclear attack<strong>.6 The advantage of such requirements for external information to activate weapons is of course that the weapons remain available for authorized use but not susceptible of appropriation or mistaken use. The drawback from a deterrence and operational point of view is, of course, that the system for transmitting the information must not be susceptible of interruption – that is, there must be assurance that an authorized decision maker will be able to act and have the decision – and the accompanying authenticated orders and unlock combinations – communicated to and received by the operators of the weapon systems. Accordingly, a system of combination-locked safeties requires a highly survivable network for decision and communication with the operators. Otherwise there would be pressures for early transmission of the codes, with their insertion subject to a later execute order or even more dangerous, pre-delegation of authority to issue the execute orders. In this, as in other aspects of measures to meet the “never” requirement, a highly capable and highly survivable command and control system is essential.</strong><br />

<strong>Troops in Korea aren’t key to regional stability</strong><br />
<strong>Cha, professor of gov, 2—Professor of Government @ Georgetown, Director of the Asian Studies program at Georgetown, former top North Korea adviser to Bush, A.B. and his Ph.D. from Columbia University, as well as a B.A. (and subsequent M.A.) from the University of Oxford (Victor D., © 2002 by the CSIS and MIT, Washington Quarterly Winter 2002-2003 edition, “Focus on the Future, Not the North”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.twq.com/03winter/docs/03winter_cha.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.twq.com/03winter/docs/03winter_cha.pdf</a>, RBatra) p. 95</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Perhaps the most often-cited rationale for the future of U.S. alliances in Northeast Asia is “regional stability.” This justification, however, raises more questions than it answers. Many have defined this phrase with regard to Korea implicitly to mean enabling the alliance to operate in regional contingencies beyond the peninsula. If this definition implies a combat or logistics role for the USFK in a Taiwan Strait contingency, however, then current U.S. basing on the peninsula is still too distant, at 800-plus nautical miles away.13 The alternative would be to station long-range aircraft, heavy bombers, and hardened fuel assets in Korea (rather than their current location in Guam), all of which would probably be politically unacceptable for the Koreans. Furthermore, if regional stability implies using the USFK for contingencies in Southeast Asia, then this too is unnecessary. A crisis in Indonesia, for example, to which U.S. forces might respond, would potentially require the use of U.S. air bases as far north as Kadena and Iwo Jima or the Philippines, not Korea.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Plan solves the prolif impact – the only incentive for countries to get nuclear weapons is if North Korea has them – only troop withdrawal spurs Chinese co-operation on nonproliferation</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The plan can’t hurt the GLOBAL nuclear guarantee – no risk of credibility collapse</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>In the same way, how can a regional nuclear umbrella be eliminated when it rests on a massively global nuclear capability? As noted, the US withdrew its nuclear weapons from the peninsula in 1991 but North Korea still worries about a nuclear attack. The US does not need to keep nuclear weapons in East Asia to deliver highly accurate nuclear attacks anywhere in the region, from thousands of miles away. And many of the nuclear weapons the US withdrew from its navy were stored and could readily be reinstalled. The US also has many other stockpiled nuclear weapons for planes, cruise missiles, etc. Analysts have long noted that pledges of nonuse or no first use of nuclear weapons can not be taken seriously because they are unlikely to be honored if the face of a grave attack. Why should a US pledge to not retaliate with nuclear weapons for, say, a nuclear attack on Japan or the ROK, be taken as inviolate? The only reliable way to eliminate American extended nuclear deterrence is to eliminate American nuclear weapons. But that would make the proposed tradeoff even more sensitive and provocative.</strong><br />
<strong>To get North Korea to where if feels less threatened by American nuclear forces and surrenders nuclear weapons capabilities, it would be much easier to begin by moving a long way toward a more peaceful and secure regional system despite the continuing existence of nuclear weapons and extended nuclear deterrence. Those nuclear capabilities would have to be shifted into a very reserved or recessed configuration, so that the nuclear deterrence involved is also very recessed. Nuclear deterrence in the regional system, extended or not, should a deep background phenomenon, not salient, in relations among participants in Northeast and East Asian international politics.</strong><br />
<strong>It is turning out to be easier to deal with fears in Japan and the ROK that they are no longer important enough to the US to be worth defending. This fear is really an artifact of a narrow realist conception of alliances which is <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">incompatible with contemporary relations among democracies</span>. If modern liberal democracies operate under a democratic peace and see the spreading of democracy as very important for their national security, they will not abandon one when it is attacked by nondemocratic governments or other elements. It will be no easier to credibly eliminate the East Asian alliances in fact than to credibly eliminate the deterrence used in sustaining them – even without a formal alliance the US would be highly likely to help defend the ROK if necessary, even if the nuclear umbrella were removed in some symbolic way.</strong><br />

<strong><span class="Underline">Nor was that an isolated case: China increasingly harasses the Vietnamese and other neighbors in the East China, South China and Yellow seas -- saying, in effect, we're boss here and we'll take whatever we believe is ours. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">All this lit enough red lights at the Pentagon that Gates headed to Vietnam, where he announced that we'll support (read that &quot;defend&quot;) everybody's right to &quot;transit through, and operate in, international waters.&quot; </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">But rather than explicitly standing by Japan and China's other victims, he said America doesn't take sides in regional territorial disputes. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Indeed, Gates also attempted to smooth some feathers during a Monday meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Liang Guanglie: Beijing is hopping mad about a $6.4 billion arms deal President Obama signed with Taiwan in January and throwing around unspecified allegations of American spying. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">But China's new assertiveness goes beyond </span></strong>brazen displays of power in its immediate neighborhood<strong>. Beijing is also spreading its wings in Africa, South Asia and the Middle East.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">The most worrisome example was an air exercise last month in Turkey. For years, the annual drill known as &quot;Anatolian Eagle&quot; involved America, Israel and other Western allies of Turkey. But last year, when Ankara barred Israeli pilots from participating, the US and Italy cancelled their participation in solidarity. So this year, Turkey invited China to replace its old nato allies in the annual exercise. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">More, the Turkish daily Hurriyet reported on Monday that China's Russian-made SU-27 warplanes made a refueling stop in Iran on route to the Turkish air exercise. It was the first time since the 1979 revolution that the Islamic Republic granted foreign planes access to its territory. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">According to reports in Turkey and Israel, Washington is watching warily. Before the exercise, the administration demanded that Turkey use no F-16 fighter planes or other American or NATO technology. (The Turks said they'd use older planes instead.) </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">We have plenty of reasons to worry about this and other growing Chinese alliances. To be sure, China's military has a way to go before it can equal ours. But with a fast-growing Chinese economy and a thirst for oil and other resources -- and with a new generation of ever-more aggressive People's Liberation Army generals who see America as the enemy -- we'd better pay attention. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">Beijing, like other US adversaries and competitors, has surely noticed our president's shyness about asserting our military might. People around the world still hope to rely on us for the defense of values they know we cherish and China doesn't. But, right or wrong, </span></strong>the world simply doesn't think <strong>Obama intends to secure US global leadership by military means.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline">If world players believe we're about to </span></strong>forfeit our military superiority<strong>, they'll turn elsewhere -- and China right now looks like the most promising alternative.</strong><br />

Deterrence doesn’t apply to China-Taiwan <br />
Layne 97<strong>—PhD, Robert M. Gates Chair in Intelligence and National Security at the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&amp;M University, teaches political science and IR (Christopher, Summer 1997, International Security Vol. 22, No. 1, “From Preponderance to Offshore Balancing: America's Future Grand Strategy”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2539331" rel="nofollow">http://www.jstor.org/stable/2539331</a>, p. 107-9, RBatra)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span class="Underline">It is doubtful that the United States could deter a Russian invasion of the Baltics or Ukraine, or, several decades hence, a Chinese assault on Taiwan. To engage in such actions, Moscow or Beijing would have to be highly motivated; conversely, the objects of possible attack are unimportant strategically to the United States, which would cause the challenger to </span></strong>discount U.S. credibility<strong>. The spring 1996 crisis between China and Taiwan suggests the difficulties that U.S. extended deterrence strategy will face in coming decades. (China provoked the crisis by conducting intimidating military exercises in an attempt to influence Taiwan's presidential elections.) During the crisis a Chinese official said that China could use force against Taiwan without fear of U.S. intervention because American decision makers &quot;care more about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan.&quot;61 Although an empty threat today, as China becomes more powerful militarily and economically in coming decades, threats of this nature from Beijing will be more potent.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The U.S. is sending a signal of weakness in the Strait now</strong><br />
Sutter, Asian studies prof, 10**—Visiting Professor of Asian Studies at the School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University (Robert, 15 September 2010, China’s Rise, the US, and Asia’s Angst, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/Security-Watch/Detail/?ots591=4888caa0-b3db-1461-98b9-e20e7b9c13d4&amp;lng=en&amp;id=121122" rel="nofollow">http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/Security-Watch/Detail/?ots591=4888caa0-b3db-1461-98b9-e20e7b9c13d4&amp;lng=en&amp;id=121122</a>, RBatra) <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, many officials and nongovernment experts have strong concerns about the longer term future. They wonder whether the United States can sustain its military and economic commitments to the region. The global economic crisis and US recession have resulted in massive government debt that raises questions about future US military spending. The crisis and recession also challenge US free trade policies and the sustainability of the US asymmetrical trade relationships with Asia.<br />
China, for its part, seems positioned to continue economic, military, and political advances. China’s military buildup has already raised serious questions about US ability to come to Taiwan’s defense in the event of a Chinese attack against the island. Chinese anti-access efforts might hamper US abilities to protect its interests in other areas along the Chinese periphery.<br />
<br />
Multiple empirical studies prove that credibility doesn’t spill over or deter conflict<br />
Fettweis, security prof, 7 (Christopher, Assistant Prof. National Security Affairs – National Security Decision Making Dept. – US Naval War College, Political Science Quarterly, “Credibility and the War on Terror”, 122(4), p. 617-618)<br />
<br />
Mercer’s larger conclusions were that states cannot control their reputations or level of credibility, and that target adversaries and allies will ultimately form their own perceptions. Sending messages for their consideration in future crises, therefore, is all but futile. These arguments echoed some of the broader critiques of the credibility imperative that had emerged in response to the war in Vietnam, both by realists like Morgenthau and Waltz and by so-called area specialists, who took issue with the interdependence beliefs of the generalists. As Jervis observed, a common axis of disagreement in American foreign policy has been between those who focus on the specific situation and the particular nations involved (often State Department officials or area experts), and those who take a global geopolitical perspective (often in the White House or outside foreign policy generalists). The former usually believe that states in a region are strongly driven by domestic concerns and local rivalries; the latter are predisposed to think that these states look to the major powers for their cues and have little control over their own fates.41 Throughout most of the Cold War, since those who argued that events are interdependent won most of the policy debates, U.S. foreign policy was obsessed with credibility. A series of other studies have followed those of Hopf and Mercer, yielding similar results. The empirical record seems to suggest that there have been few instances of a setback in one arena influencing state behavior in a second arena.42 Daryl Press began his recent study expecting to find that perceptions of the opponent’s credibility would be an important variable affecting state behavior. 43 He chose three cases in which reputation would presumably have been vital to the outcome—the outbreak of the First World War, the Berlin Crisis of the late 1950s, and the Cuban Missile Crisis—and found, to his surprise, that in all three cases, leaders did not appear to be influenced at all by prior actions of their rivals, for better or for worse. Crisis behavior appeared to be entirely independent; credibility, therefore, was all but irrelevant. Mercer’s conclusions about reputation seem to have amassed a good deal more supporting evidence in the time since he wrote.<br />
