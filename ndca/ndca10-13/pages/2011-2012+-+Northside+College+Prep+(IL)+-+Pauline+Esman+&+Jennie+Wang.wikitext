**Plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase its exploration and development of space by restarting the Space Shuttle Program and re-implementing missions.** 

**In July, Congress abandoned the Space Shuttle program in favor of private spaceflight and the Space Launch System. Spaceflight is here to stay, but Congress’s failure to fund and plan dooms transition.**

Contention One is Econ 

**Scenario 1 is growth. Retiring the Shuttle killed thousands of jobs across the country**

<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 7pt;">The final space shuttle launch on July 8 will make for huge business in Florida's Space Coast, as a million people are likely to see the shuttle take off one last time.. </span>


**And, absent the shuttle, workers are jobless, homeless, and forced into poverty**

<span style="font-size: 9pt;">NASA's historic final space shuttle mission may have to wait a little longer, with bad weather threatening to delay the launch.</span>


**Scenario 2 is Private Spaceflight –**

In this proposed budget we find several billions of dollars allotted to developing commercial human access to low Earth orbit, based upon the assumptions and claims by those competing for this exclusive contract who say that they can achieve this goal in little more than three years, and that it can be done for something less than 5 billion dollars.

<span style="color: #1a1718; font-family: Times; font-size: 9pt;">More than anything, the administration’s budget request represents a change of strategic direction, away from a focused program of exploration in which the government opens frontiers and enables the private sector to follow, towards an unstructured program intended to help tomorrow’s leaders make decisions about the future of the space program.</span>

Perhaps the biggest concern among skeptics of commercial crew is the ability of industry to carry out such missions safely.



**The impact is the private spaceflight industry – an accident would shut down companies for good**

**NPR 11** <span style="font-size: 10pt;">[National Public Radio, Nell Greenfieldboyce, “NASA Prepares for Risks in Private Space Travel”, 1/28/11, http://www.npr.org/2011/01/28/133308080/nasa-prepares-for-risks-in-private-space-travel]</span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 7pt;">As NASA somberly marks the 25th anniversary of the space shuttle Challenger accident, the agency is looking ahead to the retirement of its aging space shuttle fleet later this year. </span>

**That means the biggest government bailout in history**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Many are skeptical that markets are robust enough for commercial providers to develop these capabilities without significant additional NASA funding....</span>


**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Bailouts substantially increase poverty </span>**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">White 8 </span>**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">(Jerry White, write in candidate of the Socialist Equality Party in the 2008 Election, labor organizer, political activity, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Equality Party; “</span><span style="color: #262626; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">US government bailouts: poverty wages for auto workers, trillions for bankers”; World Socialist Web Site; 12/16/2008)</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">In the debate over federal assistance to the failing Detroit automakers, the clear consensus has emerged within the corporate, political and media establishment that auto workers must accept sharply lower wages and benefits as part of any industry bailout</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 3pt;">.....</span>


**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Poverty is the worst form of bare life. It’s a prior question to solving any other violence. </span>**

Contention Two is Disease
**The Russian Soyuz exploded in August and flights have been suspended indefinitely. No Shuttle means no backup plan**
**BBC 11** <span style="font-size: 10pt;">[British Broadcasting Corporation, 9/9/11, “Russia pins Soyuz failure to production line defect”, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14852534]</span>
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">The Russian space agency says a rocket that failed </span><span style="font-size: 4pt;">while carrying cargo to the International Space Station</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> on 24 August had a production line defect.</span>

**Even when the Soyuz can fly, it’s not capable of carrying critical science experiments or repairing the ISS**
**<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Abbey 11 </span>**<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">(George W.S. Abbey, Senior Fellow in Space Policy; Baker Institute for Public Policy, Rice University; “Restore the Vision”; 7/20/11) </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">The space shuttle’s retirement after the mission launched on July 8, 2011, means that the station will depend entirely on the Russian Soyuz system for transporting astronauts.</span>

**<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">BUT, ISS failure is highly probable, and only relaunching the shuttle program can prevent the loss of vital projects </span>**
**<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Abbey 11 </span>**<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">(George W.S. Abbey, Senior Fellow in Space Policy; Baker Institute for Public Policy, Rice University; “Restore the Vision”; 7/20/11) </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">In the event of damage from a fire, space debris, or a potential collision from the frequent docking of manned or unmanned commercial resupply spacecraft, the space station backup systems offer little margin of safety.</span>


**<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">The ISS is uniquely to medical breakthroughs in curing diseases </span>**
**Ruttley et. al 9**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Tara Ruttley, Associate Program Scientist for the ISS, PhD in Neuroscience; Cynthia Evans; Julia Robinson; “The Importance of the International Space Station for Life Sciences Research: Past and Future”; Published by the ISS Space Program; 2009) </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times; font-size: 9.5pt;">One of the most exciting results reported from ISS research is the confirmation that common pathogens change and become more virulent during space flight (Wilson et al., 2007)…..</span>

__Contention 3: F/W__ 

Our framework for evaluating the debate is that you look to probability first. This is the most productive means of accessing risks

<span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">And, the willingness to sacrifice the lives of their own population in the name of greater security interest constitutes bio-political control that makes war and bare life inevitable.</span></span>
