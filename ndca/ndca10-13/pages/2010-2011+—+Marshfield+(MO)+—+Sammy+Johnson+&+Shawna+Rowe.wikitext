<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Washington Post reporter Walter Pincus noted about three months ago that</span> **__the Pentagon was STILL attempting to manipulate public opinion about the wars in Iraq__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">and Afghanistan</span>**__via propaganda__.**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> He accurately noted that as the Obama administration was giving the Pentagon marching orders (prior to the firing of General Stanley McChrystal) to begin thinking about drawing down U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, the military continued plans to step up efforts to influence media coverage in Afghanistan — as well as here at home to win hearts and minds in America and Afghanistan using propaganda.“It is essential to the success of the new Iraqi government and U.S. Forces-Iraq mission that both communicate effectively with our strategic audiences (i.e. Iraqi, pan-Arabic, international, and U.S. and USF-I audiences) to gain widespread acceptance of core themes and messages,” according to the pre-solicitation notice for a civilian contractor or</span>**__contractors__** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">to</span> **__provide “strategic communication management services” there. Calling strategic communications “a vital component of operations in Iraq,” the notice says one goal is “to effectively build U.S. decision makers’ and the public’s understanding of Iraq’s current situation, future and strategic importance as a stabilizing presence and ally against terrorism in the Middle East.”__**</span>

The Pentagon's Propaganda at Its Worst Oct 17http://www.alternet.org/world/103345/private_military_contractors_writing_the_news_the_pentagon's_propaganda_at_its_worst/?page=entire</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Perhaps one of</span>**__the__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Bush administration's</span>**__most egregious PR undertakings in the war on Iraq was revealed this spring, when the New York Times blew the lid off the Pentagon's military analyst program, in which more than 75 retired military officials were recruited to spout pro-war rhetoric on major networks in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq.__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">These "message force multipliers," as they were branded, were provided with thousands of talking points by the Department of Defense starting in 2002. In one memo, dated Dec. 9, 2002 and titled "Department of Defense Themes and Talking Points on Iraq," a quote from Paul Wolfowitz -- "We cannot allow one of the world's most murderous dictators to provide terrorists a sanctuary in Iraq" -- was followed with a bullet point: "Saddam Hussein: A Global Threat." The investigative piece by the Times said the project "continues to this day," seeking to "exploit ideological and military allegiances, and also a powerful financial dynamic: Most of the analysts have ties to military contractors vested in the very war policies they are asked to assess on air."</span>**__"Records and interviews show how the Bush administration has used its control over access and information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse -- an instrument intended to shape terrorism coverage from inside the major TV and radio networks." It would be hard to overstate the implications of such a program, particularly for a country that claims to be a beacon of democracy. Although the Pentagon was said to have suspended its PR briefings of retired military officials shortly after the Times story broke, since claiming that its inspector general is conducting an investigation, in reality there has been precious little fallout.__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">However, in one promising move, earlier this month, the Federal Communications Commission sent five letters of inquiry to TV military analysts in an apparent probing of the program. According to one report, "at issue is that some of them were also linked to Pentagon contracts, raising the issue of conflict of interest. In its letter signed by the chief of the investigations and hearings division enforcement bureau, the FCC suggests that TV stations and networks may have violated two sections of the Communications Act of 1934 by not identifying the ties to the Pentagon that their military analysts had." Diane Farsetta at PR Watch, who has written extensively on the Pentagon's pundits, particularly their work on behalf of defense contractors, says, "the good news is that that's (a first) step toward conducting an investigation." Profiting off the "War of Ideas" Beyond the Pentagon's pundit "scandal,"</span> **__the fact that propaganda contracts continue to be awarded to the very companies that have previously been implicated in ethical breaches for disseminating unattributed__** **__U.S.__** **__propaganda abroad is reason enough to renew alarm. More than the dollar amount, what is outrageous to Farsetta about the most recent propaganda contract is that it is "blatantly illegal." "If you look at this most recent contract," she explains, "one of the 'strategic audiences' is__** **__U.S.__** **__audiences."__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">According to federal law going back to World War II, she says "no taxpayer money can go to propagandize U.S. audiences."</span>


**And The propaganda is used to fuel war. As long as propaganda is allowed to continue there will always be a continuation of aggression and war. It is most devastating when it is directed at domestic audiences. This propaganda only serves to silence our voice while destroying freedom of thought.**

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">**__the public support that is one of war's most essential requirements. lt's metaphor helps construct our reality, then propaganda is one of the chief materials in that construction.__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">The frames through which we see the world are built from the language propaganda offers us, and that the media, echoing it, rarifies. </span>**__Support for war is much more powerful when it is emotional or visceril than when it is logical or intellectual; likewise, the war on terror depends on our "feeling" more than our "knowing" This is made especially clear when we consider how much misunderstanding and outright error has surrounded the war__**. <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">When. in january 2002. the Knight-Ridder newspaper company sponsored an opinion poll, it reported that while two~thirds of the respondents claimed they had a good grasp of the issues surrounding the war. “closer questioning revealed large</span></span>
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">gaps in that knowledge," including serious errors of niet. For example, fully halt of those surveyed thought that one or more of the 9/ ll terrorists were Iraqi when, in reality. not one of the terrorists was an lraqi citizen.: The survey's results suggest that</span>**__the more knowledge people possessed about events surrounding the war, the less likely they were to rake a fierce. aggressive. or militaristic stance__**. S<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">urvey authors noted significantly that “Those who show themselves to he most knowledgeable about the lraq situation are significantly less likely to support military action,"</span>**__Propaganda is not concerned with disseminating information but with rallying emotion. lnformation is a distraction from propaganda`s fundamental work: it is not intended to enlarge our understanding of complex issues but to narrow it, so that we will be both focused and manageable. Propaganda's intent is not to educate but to generate and direct emotion. to boil the blood while it narrows the mind. lts most essential task. and its most dangerous, is to ensure that public emotion dominates public discussion. Propaganda is the mechanism by which governments persuade the public of the evil of the enemy and the justness of its own cause. When propaganda spreads through public discourse. flowing from government spokespeople__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">through the news media to the internet and television, re-articulated by news anchors and columnists, bloggers and talk show hosts,</span>**__it inevitably influences public opinion. Influence, after all, is propagandas purpose. The facts, for propagandists, merely confuse the issue. weakening the clarity required to create and sustain moral certainty. For the machinery of war to run smoothly,propaganda must be pure__**, <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">distilled. and unpolluted by contaminants such as complexity or subtlety. While we may naturally associate clarity with knowledge, propaganda implicitly asserts the opposite: the more we know, the greater out confusion. hesitation, and ambivalence; the less we know. the more strongly and clearly we can feel.</span>**__We need. therefore. to he aware of the ways in which propaganda suppresses information, not overtly. as in policies of censorship, but subtly. The silencing effect is the same in both censorship and propaganda; the difference is that the censored generally know they are being censored, while those subjected to expert propaganda are often unaware of it.__** ln <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">the study of propaganda. scholars typically differentiate between how propaganda works differently in a controlled society than in an open society. Noam Chomsky states that</span>**__"Propaganda is to democracy what violence is to totalitarianism.” ln the controlled society, propaganda is obvious, and its very obviousness allows a stance of silent resistance or dismissal; it may be tolerated for fear of reprisal. but citizens recognize it for what it is. ln contrast, in a more open society like__** **__America__****__, says Nancy Snow, “the hidden and integrated nature of the propaganda best convinces people that they are not being manipulated. For Americans, argues Snow, propaganda is something associated with dictators: “it is not supposed to he pan of an open society__**.” <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Evidence of propaganda at work in closed societies is easy to come by. Hitler's propaganda machine was legendary, and relied on one of the twentieth century's most influential practitioners of public relations, Edward Bernays. Bernays, the nephew of Sigmund Freud, merged Freud's work in individual psychology with his own brand of social psychology. using public opinion polls, advertising, and other means of persuasion to political ends. ln his early books Crystallizing Public Opinion (|9Z3) and Propaganda (1928), he spoke of constructing the "necessary illusions" that could be delivered to the public as reality in order to achieve what he famously called the "engineering of consent."7 joseph Goebhels used Bernays` work as the basis for his propaganda in the l93Os.“ Herman Goering was blunt about how easy it is to control public sentiment about war. whether in a democracy or a dictatorship. Acknowledging that “of course the people don't want war," he added, "but it's always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it`s a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, ora communist dictatorship.Voice or no voice. the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders." All that is necessary, said Goering, is to “tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism. and exposing the country to greater danger."“ The engineering of consent wasn’t limited to European dictatorships. American President Woodrow Wilson relied on Bemays and influential journalist Walter Lippmann in l9l7 to reverse Americas reluctance to enter WWI. Bernays` famous slogan “Make the World Safe for Democracy" effectively reversed the tide of public opinion, creating a band-wagon effect so strong that to question it was seen as dangerously unpatriotic.</span>**__The propaganda of the current war on terror remains equally effective in marshalling opinion. Relying equally heavily on hired experts. PR consultant ]ohn Rendnn, who has worked extensively for the Pentagon and__** **__CIA__** **__on supplying language for public discussions of Iraq, referred to himself in a 1996 speech as “an information warrior and at perception manager."‘° Managing perception included such tasks as supplying American flags fur Kuwaitis to wave in televised scenes of__** **__U.S.__** **__Marines entering__** **__Kuwait__** **__City__** **__at the end of the Gulf War; these scenes aired on news broadcasts all over the world. sent a strong visual message about the welcome of the marines as liberators.__**" “<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Did you ever stop to wonder,"</span></span>

"how the peuple of Kuwait City, after being held hostage for seven long and painful months, were able to get hand-held American flags . . , Well, you now know the answer. That was one of my jobs."'3</span>**__Propaganda speaks to two audiences.

But perhaps</span>**__propaganda is most pernicious when directed towards a domestic audience.__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">As Jacques Ellul observes,</span>**__propaganda is always at its most effective when it is least noticeable."‘ Critics of the war on terror state that the American public has been manipulated and deceived by "a covert disinformation campaign" orchestrated by professional Public Relations consultants whose job is to "spin" the war and government messages to the public.” This is done in the name of the public good as a way of offering clarity;__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">for example, in October 2001 Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that "we need to do a better job to make sure that people are not confused as to what this is about."\° President Bush echoed this when, on May 24. 2005, he said, “See in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in, to kind of catapult the propaganda."‘7</span></span>

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">**__What underlies the war on terror,__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">according to David du Bois,</span>**__is “the con- viction among white Americans that people of color are inherently inferior to whites and are therefore capable of committing, indeed eager to commit, the most heinous of crimes against ‘the hated and envied European/American.’”43 Such racist attitudes do not go unnoticed in the rest of the world;__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">as Klein ob- serves, “Racism is the terrorists’ greatest recruitment tool.” She reports that Hussein Osman, apprehended in connection to the 2005 failed bombing at- tempt in London, told police that he prepared for the mission by watching films on the war in Iraq, “especially those where women and children were be- ing killed and exterminated by British and American soldiers.”44 This suggests “a possible motive for acts of terror against the UK: rage at perceived extreme racism.” And what else, asks Klein, can we call the belief “that American and European lives are worth more than the lives of Arabs and Muslims, so much more that their deaths in Iraq are not even counted?”45 </span>**__A bitter irony lies at the heart of all this: indisputably, it seems, our na- tional insecurities about the state of national security has made us significantly less secure. This is not speculation: American intelligence officials agree that “the__** **__Iraq__** **__war has made the overall__** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">terrorism</span> **__problem worse.”__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">46 The New York Times reports that American intelligence agencies now concur that the invasion and occupation of Iraq have “helped spawn a new generation of Islamic radicalism,” resulting in a significant increase in the “overall terrorist threat.”47</span>**__Eighty percent of foreign-policy experts__** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">participating in the Terror- ism Index report </span>**__assert that the war in__** **__Iraq__** **__has had a negative effect “on__** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">pro- tecting the American people from global terrorist networks and in</span> **__advancing__** **__U.S.__** **__national security goals.__**”<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">48 Significantly, 30 percent of those analysts rank the project of “winning the hearts and minds” of the Muslim world as the most urgent U.S. policy objective for the next five years, as opposed to only 15 percent who consider creating a “stable, secure Iraq” the most essential en- deavor. The sense of the pressing consequence of the war in Iraq is shared among many expert observers. “The National Intelligence Estimate attributes a more direct role to the Iraq war in fueling radicalism than that presented ei- ther in recent White House documents or in a report released Wednesday by the House Intelligence Committee,” writes Mark Mazzetti, asserting that since the beginning of the war on terror, “Islamic radicalism, rather than be- ing in retreat, has metastasized and spread across the globe,” resulting in a “dif- fusion of jihad ideology.”49 Ironically, the same seeds of the attitudes about race that underlie our aggression in Iraq and are “exacerbating domestic con- flicts” and “fomenting radical ideologies” can be found in the language of the New York Times article that is earnestly exposing its dangers. When Islamic radicalism is represented in the article as something that, like vermin, “spawns,” or that, like cancer “metastasizes and spreads,” we find ourselves al- most before we’re aware of it enmeshed in the same dehumanizing metaphors that shape our perspectives, bind our thinking, and limit our responses. As the Intelligence Estimate’s grim survey of heightened terrorist threat makes clear, the consequences of allowing such metaphors to govern our thinking and our policies are not abstract, but terrifyingly concrete.</span></span>




**Racism is spirit murder. It should be rejected, is as bad as bodily murder and justifies genocide.**

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">**Williams 87**</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-left: 0in;">Patricia Williams, Associate Professor of Law at Queens College, Miami Law Review, September 1987 (42 U. Miami L. Rev. 127)</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">The second purpose of this article is to examine</span>**__racism__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">as a crime,</span>**__an offense so deeply painful and assaultive as to constitute something I call "spirit-murder__**.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">" Society is only beginning to recognize that racism is as devastating, as costly, and as psychically obliterating as robbery or assault; indeed they are often the same.</span>**__Racism resembles other offenses against humanity whose structures are so deeply embedded in culture as to prove extremely resistant to being recognized as forms of oppression.__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">7 It can be as difficult to prove as [*130] child abuse or rape, where the victim is forced to convince others that he or she was not at fault, or that the perpetrator was not just "playing around." As in rape cases, victims of racism must prove that they did not distort the circumstances, misunderstand the intent, or even enjoy it. [Continues…] There are certain societies that define the limits of life and death very differently than our own. For example, death may occur long before the body ceases to function, and under the proper circumstances, life may continue for some time after the body is carried to its grave. 71 These non-body-bound, uncompartmentalized ideas recognize the power of spirit, or what we in our secularized society might describe as the dynamism of self as reinterpreted by the perceptions of [*151] other. 72 These ideas comprehend the fact that a part of ourselves is beyond the control of pure physical will and resides in the sanctuary of those around us. A fundamental part of ourselves and of our dignity is dependent upon the uncontrollable, powerful, external observers who constitute society. 73 Surely a part of socialization ought to include a sense of caring responsibility for the images of others that are reposited within us. 74 Taking the example of the man who was stabbed thirty-nine times out of the context of our compartmentalized legal system, and considering it in the hypothetical framework of a legal system that encompasses and recognizes morality, religion, and psychology, I am moved to see this act as not merely body murder but spirit-murder as well.</span>**__I see it as spirit-murder, only one of whose manifestations is racism -- cultural obliteration, prostitution, abandonment of the elderly and the homeless, and genocide are some of its other guises. I see spirit-murder as no less than the equivalent of body murder.__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">One of the reasons that I fear what I call spirit-murder, or disregard for others whose lives qualitatively depend on our regard, is that its product is a system of formalized distortions of thought. It produces social structures centered around fear and hate; it provides a [*152] tumorous outlet for fellings elsewhere unexpressed. 75 For example, when Bernhard Goetz shot four black teenagers in a New York City subway, an acquaintance of mine said that she could understand his fear because it is a "fact" that blacks commit most crimes. What impressed me, beyond the factual inaccuracy of this statement, 76 was the reduction of Goetz' crime to "his fear," which I translate to mean her fear. The four teenage victims became all blacks everywhere, and "most crimes" clearly meant that most blacks commit crimes.</span></span>
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">[Continues…] For these reasons, I think </span>**__we need to elevate what I call spirit-murder to the conceptual,__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">if not punitive</span>**__level of a capital moral offense. 88 We need to see it as a cultural cancer; we need to open our eyes to the spiritual genocide it is wreaking__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">on blacks, whites, and the abandoned and abused of all races and ages. We need to eradicate its numbing pathology before it wipes out what precious little humanity we have left.</span></span>

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Philip</span>**__Knightly’s__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(1975) and Sam Keen’s (1991) pioneering </span>**__work on enemy construction analyzes the persistence of animal images of the enemy in media propaganda. The construction of the enemy as a dehumanized Other is much more than a representational strategy performed by the news media; its results can be global in reach__**.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Said’s work lays much of the groundwork for current analyses of the media’s fabrication of the enemy-Other; it argues that colonial and imperial projects depend on the way we characterize those we see as deeply and oppositionally different from ourselves. Over time, these characterizations are systematized and grouped into an organized body of thought, a repertoire of words and images so often repeated that it comes to seem like objective knowledge. Orientalism, the distorting lens created by this process, offers a framework through which the West examines what it perceives as the foreign or alien, consistently figuring the East as the West’s inverse: barbaric to its civilized, superstitious to its rational, medieval to its modern. While Western citizens are defined by their essential uniqueness and individuality, those of the East are constructed in metaphoric terms that emphasize their indistinguishability; the language of Western media discourse typically emphasizes mass over singularity when it represents the East. </span>**__In times of conflict, when constructions of the Other conflate with constructions of the enemy, this pattern intensifies. As Lori A. Peek points out, the processes of defining the enemy and defining the Other have a lot in common, in that they “sometimes lead to devastating outcomes”__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(Peek, 2004: 28). Presenting the enemy-Other as an indistinguishable mass is an essential strategy in the process of enemy fabrication; wartime images traditionally stress this indistinguishability, as evidenced in Frank Capra’s 1945 propaganda film, Know Your Enemy: Japan, which claimed all Japanese resembled “photographic reprints off the same negative” (Dower, 1986: 18), a message visually reinforced by inter-cutting scenes of a steel bar being hammered in a forge with scenes of regimented Japanese mass activity, the visual correlative of a race lacking individual identity. </span>**__Such representations operate most visibly in overt propaganda,__** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">but devolve so thoroughly into public discourse that they influence the media’s rhetorical choices. Middle-Eastern identities are confused and eroded; Rayan El Amine notes that the Islamic menace “has replaced the red menace, and the ‘evil empire’ of the cold war has become the . . . ‘evil doers’ of the Arab and Muslim world” (2005). The metaphors employed in Canadian newspaper headlines further and solidify such attitudes, compressing difference into unanimity by employing a vocabulary of indistinguishability. Unlike the civilized citizens of the West, who are primarily identified with culture rather than with nature, the hordes of the East are represented as being as natural as insects and as undifferentiated as a hive or swarm. The headlines gathered here clearly indicate an ongoing equation of the Muslim Other with swarming insects and massing rodents, a metaphoric conflation that is especially resilient and persistent. As Merskin notes,</span>**__we did not see “the end of enemy construction with the war in__** **__Iraq__****__. The stereotype was carried from the Taliban, bin Laden, and terrorists to the axis of evil and Hussein. Since the occupation of__** **__Iraq__****__, the evil Arab image shifted to . . . ‘crazed’ Iraqis opposed to__** **__U.S.__** **__occupation” (2004: 60). Such images are not, as Merskin argues, simply an issue of journalistic imbalance and unfair representations, but speak to fundamental questions of why such images are so necessary and prevalent__**.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"> **And dehumynization is the worst possible impact. When propaganda is used to justify dehumynization the only possible outcome is complete obliteration. Critiquing the practices that lead to dehumynization is a pre-requisite question to accessing the impacts of the negative disadvantages. Genocide is inevitable with dehumynization.**</span>

<span style="color: black;">The categories identified by Keen powerfully and primally stigmatize the en- emy. The expressions of the hostile imagination are often ingenious and com- pelling, which is part of their power and their effectiveness. Beyond simple stigma, however, lies dehumanization.</span>**__<span style="color: black;"> Like other forms of propaganda, dehumanization repeatedly portrays the enemy as less than us; it goes further, how- ever, in the extent to which it strips away humanity</span>__**<span style="color: black;"> through the consistency of its metaphoric links with the bestial, the verminous, and the microscopic. </span>**__<span style="color: black;">Tropes of animal, insect, germ and disease are so important to our construction of the enemy in the war on terror, so linked to larger discourses of racism, that they require concentrated attention.</span>__**
**__<span style="color: black;">Dehumanization creates an enemy that not only allows for but demands cruel treatment; such cruelty is seen as requisite to the larger task of extermination.</span>__**<span style="color: black;"> D</span>
<span style="color: black;">Dehumanization allows us to re-cast cruelty and violence as some- thing else; after all, if an enemy is so far down the evolutionary ladder that it cannot feel pain, then how can inflicting pain be cruel? One of the most striking historical examples of this comes from WWII: the Japanese military performed medical experiments on human prisoners who they called “maruta”—literally, “logs of wood.”6 </span>**__<span style="color: black;">Once made not only inhuman but inan- imate, the bodies of feeling beings could be brutalized without compunction or regret.</span>__**
**__<span style="color: black;">Dehumanization also allows us to blame the victims by eliminating their basic human attributes and thus their claims to protection</span>__**<span style="color: black;">. Hanan Ashrawi argues that “Blaming the victim has been the common resort of the guilty in rationalizing and distorting the horror of the crime.”7 Within this metaphoric framework, the fault lies in the nature of the sub-human enemy, and those faults are perceived as so hideous and dangerous that obliterating them is both necessary and noble: like the cancerous cell, if simply left alone, the encroaching enemy will spread and replicate.</span>**__<span style="color: black;"> Obliteration is therefore the only safe, rational, even the only moral response.</span>__**<span style="color: black;">A History of Dehumanizing Practices</span>**__<span style="color: black;">One of the most important reasons for developing a critique of how metaphors dehumanize the enemy is the gravity of dehumanization’s conse- quences. One of its most devastating roles is in mass killings and genocide. Gregory H. Stanton has influentially argued that dehumanization is a neces- sary precursor to genocide, a prerequisite for genocide’s comprehensive vio- lence. The first three stages leading to genocide, </span>__****__<span style="color: black;">Stanton</span>__****__<span style="color: black;"> argues, are classifi- cation, symbolization, and dehumanization. Our metaphors of the enemy accomplish in one gesture all three of these steps, powerfully conflating them into a single process that simultaneously identifies, marks, symbolizes and profoundly devalues the Other.</span>__**
**__<span style="color: black;">For </span>__****__<span style="color: black;">Stanton</span>__****__<span style="color: black;">, genocide is not a product but a process. It may appear sudden but is actually linked to a series of separate stages, each progressive and each integral to the “genocidal process.” Classification, symbolization, and dehu- manization are followed by organization, polarization, identification, extermi- nation, and finally denial of the genocidal act. </span>__**<span style="color: black;">Stanton argues thatevery genocide is followed by denial. The mass graves are dug up and hidden. The historical records are burned, or closed to historians. Even during the genocide, those committing the crimes dismiss reports as propaganda. </span>**__<span style="color: black;">After- wards such deniers are called “revisionists.” Others deny through more subtle means: by characterizing the reports as “unconfirmed” or “alleged” because they do not come from officially approved sources; by minimizing the number killed; by quarreling about whether the killing fits the legal definition of geno- cide (“definitionalism”); by claiming that the deaths of the perpetrating group exceeded that of the victim group, or that the deaths were the result of civil war, not genocide.8</span>__**
<span style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;">**__<span style="color: black;">Before there can be an act of genocide to deny, however, there must be a number of conditions in place to allow genocidal violence to occur. Stanton argues that classification, the first condition or stage, is fundamental and deeply encoded in human language. All languages require classification, a “division of the natural and social world into categories.”9 All cultures have categories to distinguish between “us” and “them,” between members of our group and others. While all language may make this distinction, it is when we add symbolization to “name and signify” our classifications that what Keen calls the “paranoid culture” begins to assert itself, making certain phys- ical characteristics (such as skin color or facial features) symbols for racial or ethnic classifications.10 In the later stage of the genocidal process, these markers may become abstract and externalized, as with the yellow star forced on the Jews of Nazi Germany or the blue-checked scarf used by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia to identify, marginalize, and deport people from the Eastern Zone.</span>__**</span>


<span style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;">**<span style="color: black;">And genocide outweighs omnicide.</span>**</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">**Lang 03**</span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Act and idea in the Nazi genocide By Berel Lang professor of Philosophy at Wesleyan, 2003, pg 12-13</span>
<span style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Before considering further the two primary factors in the concept of genocide (the specification of the group and the intention related to its destruction), it is important to recognize the implied relation between these factors, on the hand, and the likely agents of genocide, on the other. That genocide entails the destruction of a group does not imply that the act of genocide itself must be the act of a group; but the practical implementation of a design for genocide would almost necessarily be so complex as to assure this. Admittedly; the same technological advances that make genocide increasingly possible as a collective action also have increased the possibility that an individual acting alone could initiate the process. (</span>**__When the push of a single button can produce cataclysmic effects, we discover an order of destruction-“omnicide__**”<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">-even larger than genocide.)'1'</span>**__But the opprobrium attached to the term “genocide” seems also to have the connotation of a corporate action--as if this act or sequence of acts would be a lesser fault, easier to understand if not to excuse if one person rather than a group were responsible for it. A group (we suppose) would be bound by a public moral code; decisions made would have been reached collectively; and the culpability of individual intentions would be multiplied proportionately.__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Admittedly, corporate responsibility is sometimes invoked in order to diminish (or at least to obscure) individual responsibility; so, for example, the “quagmire” effect that was appealed to retrospectively by defenders of the United States’ role in Vietnam. But</span>**__for genocide, the likelihood of its corporate origins seems to accentuate its moral enormity: a large number of individual, intentional acts would have to be committed and the connections among them also affirmed in onder to produce the extensive act. Unlike other corporate acts that might be not only decided on but carried out by a single person or small group of persons, genocide in its scope seems necessarily to require collaboration by a relatively large number of agents acting both collectively and individually.__**</span>

**First, there is exactly zero benefit to the current propaganda. It should be ended.**

Currently affiliated with Georgetown University, he blogs and teaches about public diplomacyThe Pentagon's new Iraq propagandaThe US is spending $300m to 'engage and inspire' Iraqis. That's not the way to win hearts and minds guardian.co.uk, Monday 27 October 2008 http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/27/us-iraq-propaganda-pentagon</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Little noticed in Gates's widely acclaimed remarks, however, was his statement: "Don't get me wrong, I'll be asking for yet more money for defence next year."</span>**__Part of the money Gates intends to spend__,**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> as the Washington Post reported recently, </span>**__is for a $300m, three-year effort to "engage and inspire" Iraq's population to support its government and US policies through a variety of programmes ranging from media products to entertainment__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(an additional $15m a year would be spent polling Iraqis). This is a huge amount by soft-power standards. The state department expects to spend just $5.6m on public diplomacy in Iraq in fiscal 2008.</span>**__The defence department money is to be distributed among four private contractors,__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">including the Lincoln Group </span>**__which, per arrangements with the Pentagon, covertly paid Iraqi newspapers to print articles composed by the US military but published as straight news items.__** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">A few critical voices have been heard regarding Gates's hearts-and-mind initiative. </span>**__Jim Webb, the Democratic senator from Virginia, whose military and journalistic background makes him eminently qualified to speak about the use of soft power by the Pentagon,wrote__**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">in a letter to Gates:</span>**__"At a time when this country is facing such a grave economic crisis, and at a time when the government of Iraq now shows at least a $79bn surplus from recent oil revenues, in my view it makes little sense for the US department of defence to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars to propagandise the Iraqi people."__** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Public-diplomacy specialists have also been put off by Gates's indoctrination mission. As one noted scholar informed me by e-mail: </span>**"__Communication that is seen as propaganda does not attract and thus does not produce soft power." Critics point out that the defence department's funding is not transparent, which could result in its programmes losing credibility when target audiences find out where the money really comes from__.**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> This certainly turned out to be the case during the cold war, when the CIA was exposed as the covert financial supporter of intellectual magazines like Encounter that had been considered independent. Already, the Iranian ambassador to Iraq, Kazemi Qomi, has complained: "Four large media companies are contributing to the Pentagon's plan to provoke the Iraqi public opinion against the Islamic Republic and strain Tehran-Baghdad relations." Such "anti-Iranian propaganda", the Iranian news agency FARS says, is "futile". </span>**__The Pentagon's costly soft-power initiative is not limited to foreign audiences, but includes the__** **__US__** **__as well__.**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">It specifies the need to "communicate effectively with our strategic audiences (ie Iraqi, pan-Arabic, international and US audiences) to gain widespread acceptance of [US and Iraqi government] core themes and messages." According to Marc Lynch, a specialist in the Middle East media,</span>**__making "American audiences … a key target for manipulation through the covert dissemination of propaganda messages should be seen as scandalous, subversive of democracy and illegal."__** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Scandalous it indeed is, but such homeland targeting is part of the defence department's modus operandi, as the New York Times' revelations about the military's use of domestic-media commentators as propagandists for the Pentagon indicates (the activity is currently being investigated by the federal communications commission). Nothing is worse than the misapplication of hard power, as Gates has rightly suggested. He seems unwilling to admit, however, that the same is true in the case of what the Pentagon interprets soft power to be.</span></span>

**__The plunging global economy is an even bigger threat to the United States' national security than the al Qaeda terrorist network or proliferation of weapons of mass destr__****__uction__**, according to America's new intelligence czar.Retired Admiral Dennis Blair, the Obama administration's Director of National Intelligence, in his first appearance before the US Congress, stated, "**__The primary near-term security concern of the United States is the global economic crisis and its geopolitical implications__**." Traditionally, US intelligence chiefs always preface their opening remarks with either terrorist or nuclear proliferation threats, but Blair's first sentences in his testimony before the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was about the economy.Blair said, "The crisis has been going on for over a year, and economists are divided over whether and when we could hit bottom. Some even fear that the recession could further deepen and reach the level of the Great Depression." "Of course, **__all of us recall the dramatic political consequences wrought by the economic turmoil of the 1920s and 1930s in__** **__Europe__****__, the instability, and high levels of violent extremism," he said. "Though we don't know its eventual scale, it already looms as the most serious global and economic and financial crisis in decades,__**" he added. Blair pointed out, "Industrialised countries are already in recession and growth in emerging market countries, previously thought to be immune from industrialised countries' crises, has also faltered, and many are in recession as well." "Even China's dynamic growth engines have taken a hit as they grapple with falling demand for their exports and slowdown in foreign direct investment and portfolio investments," he said. Blair served notice that "the financial crisis and global recession are likely to produce a wave of economic crises in emerging market nations over the next year, prompting additional countries to request International Monetary Fund or other multilateral or bilateral support." "**__Time is probably our greatest threat__**," he said. **__"The longer it takes for the recovery to begin, the greater the likelihood of serious damage to US' strategic interests."__** Blair added, "Roughly, a quarter of the countries in the world have already experienced low-level instabilities such as government changes because of the current slowdown."

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">For farmers like Randall, today's challenges may be tomorrow's crises. The problems of coping with</span> **__high oil prices reveal how utterly dependent our food production system is on nonrenewable fuels.__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As long as oil is plentiful, that dependence isn't a concern. But in some circles fears are growing that </span>**__if global petroleum production begins a steady decline, our entire food system will be strained, testing our ability to feed ourselves.__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">"How dependent on oil is our food system?" Richard Heinberg, a leading "peak oil" scholar and the author of [[http://alternet.bookswelike.net/isbn/0865715297|The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies]] said in an interview. "Enormously dependent. Fatally dependent, I would say." Of course, you won't find any oil on your dinner plate, but</span> **__petroleum and other fossil fuels are inside of every bite you eat. About one-fifth of all__** **__U.S.__** **__energy use goes into the food system.__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The synthetic nitrogen fertilizers that are essential for high crop yields are a byproduct of natural gas. Gasoline and diesel fuels power the combines that rumble through the grain fields. Countless kilowatts of electricity are burned up in the factories that process all of the packaged goods that line the supermarket shelves. And then there's the gasoline required simply to get food to market. We now have a globalized food system, one in which the typical American meal travels 1,500 miles from farm to fork. Organic products -- though they may have a more sustainable veneer -- are in many respects no different; 10 percent of organic products come from abroad. Without oil, we would all be on one harsh diet. </span>**__"We've created an agricultural system where, on average, for every energy of food calorie we produce, we need to expend about 10 calories of fossil fuels,__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">" Heinberg said. Such an imbalance would not be worrisome if there were an inexhaustible supply of oil. But, as every child learns in elementary science class, petroleum is a nonrenewable resource. A heated debate is under way about when that resource will begin to decline. Some say that we have already passed the summit of peak oil and point to a leveling of global petroleum production as proof. The U.S. government argues that we have decades before oil extraction begins to decline. Others calculate that we will hit the peak oil mark sometime in the next 10 years. Regardless of when exactly oil production starts to drop, it's clear that in this century humanity will have to learn to live without cheap, abundant oil. What this means for our food system is also up for debate. At the very least,</span> **__costlier oil will lead to more expensive food,__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">especially for processed</span> **__and__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">packaged goods. At the very worst, peak oil</span> **__could seriously disrupt agriculture,__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> especially in highly industrialized nations like the United States, where food systems are heavily reliant on oil. "This era of increasing globalization of our food supply is going to draw to a close here in the next decade or so," Ronnie Cummins, executive director of the Organic Consumers Association, said. "I think it (eventual oil scarcities) is going to mean the end of importing billions of dollars of food from overseas**__.__** </span>**__It's going to mean the end of relatively cheap food in the__** **__U.S.__** **__And it's going to mean a significant increase in starvation and malnourishment across the world."__**</span>

**And even small increases in food prices put food out of reach for over 1 billion people.**
**Power 96**
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Tampa Tribune ‘96 [Paul Power Jr., “Grain shortage growing problem,” Jan 20, LN] </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are more people in this world than ever, but less grain to feed them. That's kindled fears of a world food crisis, a problem Florida may help prevent. Poor weather, drought, political unrest and</span> **__economic shifts__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">have decreased planting, pushing world grain reserves to record lows. Meanwhile, the world's population grew by 100 million, to 5.75 billion in 1995 - a record increase. Now, miners in West Central Florida are digging out phosphate more quickly, so it can be used to make fertilizer. Analysts are warning about the increasing possibility of flood or drought in the world's food-producing regions. That</span> **__can push food prices much higher, both here and abroad, and even cause famine in the poorest countries.__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">U.S. food prices may rise more than 4 percent this year, ahead of the rate of inflation. "Conditions today indicate that there is at least some vulnerability in the food supply," said Sara Schwartz, an agricultural economist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Corn and soybean production plunged last year in the United States, she said. Wet weather slowed grain planting in the United States and Canada. Elsewhere, drought and civil conflict in sub-Saharan Africa cut production to 20 percent below normal. The European Union has less than one quarter of the grain reserves it held in 1993. The amount of corn expected to be available in the United States by summer - when corn is harvested - was trimmed by crop forecasters this week to 507 million bushels, the lowest in 20 years. On a global scale, food supplies - measured by stockpiles of grain - are not abundant. In </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">1995, world production failed to meet demand for the third consecutive year, said Per Pinstrup-Andersen, director of the International Food Policy Research Institutein Washington, D.C. As a result, grain stockpiles fell from an average of 17 percent of annual consumption in 1994-1995 to 13 percent at the end of the 1995-1996 season, he </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">said. That's troubling, Pinstrup-Andersennoted, since 13 percent is well below the 17 percent the United Nations considers essential to provide a margin of safety in world food security. During the food crisis of the early 1970s, world grain stocks were at 15 percent. </span>**__"Even if they are merely blips, higher international prices can hurt poor countries that import a significant portion of their food__**,"<span style="font-size: 8pt;">he said</span>. "**__Rising prices can also quickly put food out of reach of the 1.1 billion people in the__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">developing</span> **__world who live on a dollar a day or less."__**

Want Cheaper Gas and Oil? End the Damned Wars! by Dave Lindorff Philadelphia-based journalist. http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/05/17/9017
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">One analyst,</span> **__economist Ismael Hussein-Zadeh, a professor of economics at__** **__Drake__** **__University__** in Des Moines, Iowa, has a different explanation for the price rise, and American motorists and homeowners should pay close attention. "Oil prices have gone from the mid $20 range in the fall of 2002 to $127 yesterday -- a rise of $100/barrel in just over five years," he says. "And the bulk of that increase can be attributed to the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to the threats of war against Iran." Hussein-Zadeh's analysis **__looks__** **__at a number of ways that the__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Bush/Cheney</span> **__wars have contributed to rising oil prices. Chief among these are two factors: the threat to supplies, particularly from the__** **__Persian Gulf__** **__region__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from which 20 percent of the world's oil supplies come,</span> **__and a falling dollar, because oil is priced in dollars, and as it loses value, oil producing countries raise their prices to compensate__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In an article titled "Worried About the Price of Gas? End US Wars," Hussein-Zadeh writes, "Soon after the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq the price of oil began to escalate in tandem with the escalation of war and political turbulence in the Middle East." Furthermore, he says, "Anytime there is a renewed US military threat against Iran, fuel prices move up several notches." If the US were to actually make good on Bush's and Cheney's threats to attack Iran, in Hussein-Zadeh's view "the sky would be the limit" to oil prices, with $200/barrel being a starting point.</span> **__The dollar's fall, too, is significantly a result of the__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">wars-particularly the</span> **__Iraq War,__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">he says.</span> **__That war has been costing the US $200 billion a year, all in borrowed funds. That in itself is a huge hole that has to be funded by borrowing from__** **__China__****__,__** **__Japan__****__,__** **__Saudi Arabia__** **__and other nations. But as Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz has pointed out, the true cost of the__** **__Iraq__** **__War, when interest on debt, health costs of injured veterans and other long-term costs are factored in, is more like $3 trillion and rising.__** <span style="font-size: 7pt;">And when currency speculators and traders -- the ones who really set the value of the dollar -- make their bets, they're looking at that bigger number, not the little one. Moreover</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>**__it's not just oil that has been driven up in price because of the war. As energy costs have gone up, so has the cost of food, in no small part because most fertilizer is oil-based, and because transportation costs are also largely a reflection of oil prices__****__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span>__** As well, to the extent that American's food is imported, they are paying in shrinking dollars, whose value is being driven down because of the war. Hussein-Zadeh says the Bush/Cheney administration and its neoconservative war promoters have worked hard to offer other more benign explanations for the crippling rise in energy prices, and food prices. As he puts it: Neoconservative forces in and around the Bush administration and beneficiaries of war dividends -- wishing to deflect attention away from war as the main culprit for the skyrocketing energy prices -- tend to blame secondary or marginally relevant factors: OPEC, China and India for their increased demand for energy, or supply-demand imbalances in global markets. Whatever the contributory role of these factors, the fact remains that the current oil price hikes started with the beginning of the Bush administration's wars against Iraq and Afghanistan. Furthermore, a closer examination of these factors reveals that their roles in the current price inflation of oil have been negligible. Common sense bears him out here. China's and India's economies have indeed been growing rapidly, and with them, demand for oil, but over the past five years, oil prices have risen 400%, and the same cannot be said for demand. Even if Chinese and Indian growth figures of 7-9 percent per year were accurate (and there is reason to believe they are grossly inflated), that at best would amount to perhaps a 50% increase in economic activity over five years. In fact, during this time more efficient energy use in the developed countries has largely offset much of the increasing demand for oil in China and India, and even in China and India, much of the energy growth has involved replacing inefficient vehicles and power plants with more efficient ones, so oil consumption isn't rising in lock step with economic growth<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>**__The answer then, to rising oil prices, is obvious then__****__.__** It is not some silly two-month moratorium on federal taxes-what Sen. McCain referred to, in a candid moment, as a "little gift" to American vacationers. Nor is it opening up the Artic refuge to drilling -- a move that would take years to lead to any significant new supply, and which in any case would have minimal impact on overall supply, or on prices. Nor is it opening up the Strategic Oil Reserve -- another drop in the barrel. Nor is it hammering OPEC to boost production -- something they have already done. No, it is much simpler. As Hussein-Zadeh puts it: The political implications of this discussion are clear: **__to bring down the prices of fuel and food requires bringing home the troops. By lowering the energy costs of production and transportation this will help save our own and many other economies from the plagues of inflation and stagnation. It will bring relief to hundreds of millions worldwide who are burdened by crippling energy bills and the crushing costs of feeding their families.__** </span>

White voters are divided, with 47 percent supporting Fiorina and 42 percent backing the incumbent. Latinos, meanwhile, heavily favor the Democrat, 61 percent to 24 percent. Voters are split about which candidate can do a better job on the issue of unemployment and the economy. Forty-one percent said Boxer would do a much better or somewhat better job, while 40 percent said the same of the Republican. On immigration, the senator had a narrow 5-point lead over Fiorina. The two candidates are statistically tied in RCP’s average of polls on the race, which the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee says is crucial to keep the party’s majority in the Senate. Boxer, a five-term congresswoman and three-term senator who is currently chief deputy whip and chair of the Senate Environment Committee, is waging the most challenging re-election campaign of her career. She appealed to supporters over the weekend for contributions as the race entered the homestretch. </span>**__“This race is down to the wire… even the slightest advantage could tip the scales to Fiorina,__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">” said Boxer campaign manager, Rose Kapolcynzki. </span>

**__California__** **__GOP Senate hopeful Carly Fiorina this week staked out her spot opposing tough Net neutrality rules__**.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The former Hewlett-Packard CEO and telecommunications industry executive told POLITICO she opposes any federal requirement that Internet providers treat all Web traffic equally. "The principle sounds fantastic, but the principle is not the problem," Fiorina said in an interview at the Technology Policy Institute's conference in Aspen, Colo. "The problem is how companies and regulatory bodies are trying to translate that principle into policy, which would have a bad effect." A spokeswoman later added that Fiorina "opposes Net neutrality and thinks government intervention and more regulation will not be helpful where the Internet is concerned." </span>**__Fiorina's position contrasts greatly with that of her opponent, Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, who previously cosponsored legislation that would have set open Internet rules firmly in place.__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In a statement, Boxer reaffirmed her support for Net neutrality. Her office later added that Boxer felt it was "premature to comment" on the Federal Communications Commission's efforts to mandate Net neutrality using its own rule-making process. Fiorina criticized the agency for contemplating any legal avenue that would see Internet providers subject to some of the same rules that currently apply to phone services. "The FCC is not an appropriate regulatory body for all of the advances going on for the Internet," she said. Ultimately, the Net neutrality issue is unlikely to energize voters in a race pivoting primarily on economic issues, and Fiorina's comments most likely won't shake the ground in Silicon Valley, especially given her more than 20 years of experience at AT&T and Lucent Technologies. Many of </span>**__the__** **__Golden__** **__State__****__'s top tech companies__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have also long made up their minds, said Ralph Hellmann, senior vice president of the Information Technology Industry Council. He added many of those firms</span> **__"are already close to Boxer." But a Fiorina win could make it more difficult for Net neutrality advocates to get anything through the Senate next year, especially if the FCC finds itself mired in legal battles should it reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service.__**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To encourage Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to invest in broadband infrastructure, the Bush FCC classified DSL services as “information services,” which subjected them to a lesser degree of regulation than would treatment as “telecommunications services,” a regulatory regime originally designed for natural monopolies such as the old AT&T.</span> **__The Obama FCC wants to impose “net neutrality” rules that would prevent ISPs from discriminating against customers in the priority and speed of service.__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Stung by court decisions limiting its legal authority over information services, the FCC reacted by proposing to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service, which would subject it to more intrusive regulatory controls. Opponents object that reclassification would deter many billions of dollars in new investment. To break this impasse, after extensive negotiations leading antagonists Google and Verizon agreed on their own framework to prevent discrimination, under which ISPs could not block content producers or offer them a “fast lane” (paid prioritization). Cellphone networks, however, would be excluded from this framework.</span> **__Announcement of this private sector alternative likely will force Congress to intervene and solve the problem by legislation.

The Environmental Protection Agency also is contemplating limits on carbon emissions. A determined Congress could block both actions. Speaker Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also have promised to consider the Korean Free Trade Agreement, a much-needed measure to boost U.S. exports to the fastest-growing region in the world.

Given the near gridlock that characterized the last six months in Congress, the prospects for any meaningful action on any of these major issues is questionable at best for the lame-duck session. The likelihood that scores of members will be involuntarily retired probably sours their mood and saps their motivation to take on the major issues. This dynamic leaves the president in a key role. He could, if he were to follow the precedent of Bill Clinton after the massive Democratic losses in the 1994 congressional elections, begin to move to the center and work on compromises with Republicans and conservative Democrats. This might involve, for example, compromising on the expiration of the so-called "Bush-era tax cuts" on income and capital by extending them for two years, as Obama's former budget director Peter Orszag has suggested and as dozens of Democrats in Congress have urged. If the president chooses not to compromise, his veto power ensures defeat of any legislation he chooses. He also could move ahead with regulations such as the new ozone rule. How the president chooses to act in these circumstances is thus crucial to resolving the many outstanding issues.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[David Dayen, “Defense Spending Cuts Face Likely Congressional Override,” Monday May 17, 2010 9:18 am, http://news.firedoglake.com/2010/05/17/defense-spending-cuts-face-likely-congressional-override/] </span>
<span class="underline">The lesson of Congress</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the modern age </span><span class="underline">is that it’s much harder to eliminate a program than it is to enact one. Every program has a champion somewhere on Capitol Hill, and it probably only needs one to be saved</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – but 218 and 60 to be put into motion. A </span><span class="underline">case in point: our</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> bloated </span><span class="underline">military</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> budget. The </span><span class="underline">Obama </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Administration has generally </span><span class="underline">tried to cancel</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> out </span><span class="underline">unnecessary defense programs, with meager success</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the last budget year. </span><span class="underline">Congress will probably assert themselves in an election year, however. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has vowed to impose fiscal austerity at the Pentagon, but </span><span class="underline">his biggest challenge may be persuading Congress to go along. </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Lawmakers from both parties are poised to override Gates and fund the C-17 cargo plane and an alternative engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter — two weapons systems the defense secretary has been trying to cut from next year’s budget. They have also made clear they will ignore Gates’s pleas to hold the line on military pay raises and health-care costs, arguing that now is no time to skimp on pay and benefits for troops who have been fighting two drawn-out wars</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">The competing agendas could lead to a major clash between Congress and </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the </span><span class="underline">Obama</span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">administration this summer. Gates has repeatedly said he will urge President Obama to veto any defense spending bills that include money for the F-35’s extra engine or the C-17, both of which he tried unsuccessfully to eliminate last year. Last year, after a similarly protracted struggle, Gates succeeded in getting Congress to end funding for the F-22, a plane which tended to malfunction in the rain. Seriously. But Congress did not move on the F-35 engine or the C-17, and they seem similarly positioned this year. Ike Skelton and Carl Levin support the F-35 engine, for example, and included it in their appropriation requests out of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, which they separately chair. I fully recognize that</span> <span class="underline">the off-limits discussion about military spending concerns the bases in over 100 countries and continued adventures abroad</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in places where “victory” means almost nothing. But </span><span class="underline">it is a symptom of the</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> same problem – the </span><span class="underline">persistent inertia that aids the military-industrial complex</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to keep the war machine moving. And so we get new engines to planes that don’t need new engines. </span>

Cunningham is the senior economist of the Economic Research Bureau, a 51-year organization within the Chamber. Cunningham has over 19 years of experience reporting on local economic trends, data and analysis for the San Diego region and produces the monthly "San Diego Economic Bulletin." Cunningham cited the relative diversification of San Diego's economy as the reason San Diego has been able to weather the recent national economic recession relatively well.<span style="font: 12px Times;">__**The United States' involvement in the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars meant lucrative defense contracts**__</span> for San Diego's defense industry <span style="font: 12px Times;">__**and will continue to drive the economy**__</span> in 2004 according to Cunningham. He also cited steady employment numbers for the San Diego region, which emphasized his point that San Diego's economy has performed well and will continue to do so as conditions improve state and nation wide over the next year.</span>

<span style="font: 8px Times; margin: 0px 0px 0px 14.4px;"><span style="font: 12px Times;">__**Here's the latest trend that started in California and is spreading to the rest of the country: recession**__</span>. It's all but certain the U.S. economy is in a recession, as falling home prices and Wall Street turmoil have put the brakes on consumer spending and stoked unemployment. But <span style="font: 12px Times;">__**California**__</span> got there first. Now, the state<span style="font: 12px Times;"> __**provides a template of how a broad U.S. downturn could look.**__ </span>With its export businesses, manufacturing sector, professional services and big retail employers, California looks like many other U.S. states, only more so. <span style="font: 12px Times;">__**California's $1.8 trillion economy -- twice the size of India's and accounting for about 15% of the U.S. gross domestic product -- is powerful enough to have ripple effects nationally.**__</span> It is home to Hollywood, five of 30 Major League Baseball franchises and the largest farming sector in the nation.<span style="font: 12px Times;"> __**California was also at the leading edge of the nation's recent housing bubble, which is where its current problems started.**__</span> Home prices in California rose higher and faster than in most of the U.S., and started weakening earlier, in 2005. Some mortgage-holders defaulted. Others struggle along under a mountain of debt. The problems spread to the state's financial sector, which was heavily exposed to local real estate. As Californians cut their spending, job losses spread from the housing sector to retail stores and auto dealers. Now the state's unemployment rate is 7.7%, among the highest in the nation. Along with Sunbelt states such as Florida and Nevada, California is a big source of the shocks now working through the world's banks, corporations and stock markets. The financial crisis has frozen credit markets, cutting into companies' ability to engage in even the day-to-day borrowing they need to run their businesses. But even before the most recent blows to the national economy, Californians were feeling the downward drag of a consumer-led recession -- in which shrinking home values caused people to rein in their spending, fueling unemployment and, in turn, sparking further spending cuts and joblessness.</span>

Calling attention to the successes and shortcomings of U.S. global health investments in previous years, <span style="font: 12px Times;">__**Secretary Clinton promised a new approach in the $63 billion GHI that will build on existing programs and create lasting change.**__ </span>In her speech, Secretary Clinton made the case for global health investments and articulated areas for growth. She explained that <span style="font: 12px Times;">__**global health has everything to do with**__ </span>foreign policy: from strengthening weak and fragile states and building the foundation from which societies can grow, to increasing U.S. national security, <span style="font: 12px Times;">__**carrying out public diplomacy**__</span>, and demonstrating American values, global health plays a central role. In a time of even greater economic limits, however, it is even more important to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent effectively and get results. The Secretary made it clear that the GHI will maximize resources as well as achieve more effective outcomes on the ground. By emphasizing coordination, leveraging the efforts of other donors and non-governmental organizations, and working with countries to increase their investments in health, the Administration hopes the GHI will increase its impact in the short and longer term. Key elements of the GHI highlighted in the speech include the Administration’s promise to make care more accessible and close gaps created by clinics or programs focused on only one disease or one type of intervention. Secretary Clinton applauded global health progress, but noted that in many places a woman might be treated for HIV but die in childbirth, or a child might be immunized against polio but not have access to clean water and therefore die of a diarrheal disease. <span style="font: 12px Times;">__**The GHI will work closely with country governments to strengthen their commitments to health and create the necessary capacity, infrastructure, regulations, and other policies that will help them take responsibility for the health of their citizens**__</span>. While the U.S. will focus on innovation, maternal and child health, improved methods of monitoring and evaluating programs, and better in-country coordination, <span style="font: 12px Times;">__**ultimately the GHI hopes to bring all U.S. resources**__- </span>both from within and outside the government- to bear<span style="font: 12px Times;"> __**to help countries lead their own way toward sustainable health systems.

All this adds up to a powerful deterrent capability. He should then underline America's continuing commitment to Afghans ready to fight terrorists by instituting a plan to provide economic and military aid. In particular, funds and arms should be directed to the tribal leaders and warlords willing to fight the terrorists—and support should be given to efforts to divide Taliban leadership and attract Taliban fighters away from their cause. Then, he needs to build a containment policy against the Taliban with Afghan's neighbors. This includes Russia, India, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and yes, Iran (which helped us in the beginning of the war). All share strong interests in preventing the spread of Taliban influence and curtailing the drug trade. <span style="font: 12px Times;">__**Like President Nixon and Henry Kissinger, Obama and his team can drown the aftereffects of Afghanistan in powerful diplomacy and continued, focused commitment to Afghans**__</span><span style="font: 8px Times;">.

<span style="font: 8px Times; margin: 0px;"> Greater international environmental regulation can increase international tension. <span style="font: 12px Times;">__**Foreign policy is a bag of goods**__</span> that includes issues from free trade to arms trading to human rights.<span style="font: 12px Times;"> __**Each new issue in the bag weighs it down, lessening the focus on other issues and even creating conflicts between issues**__</span>. Increased environmental regulations could cause countries to lessen their focus on international threats of violence such as the sale of ballistic missiles or border conflicts between nations. As countries must watch over more and more issues arising in the international policy arena, they will stretch the resources necessary to deal with traditional international issues. As Schaefer (2000, 46) writes, <span style="font: 12px Times;">__**“Because diplomatic currency is finite . . . it is critically important that the United States focus its diplomatic efforts on issues of paramount importance to the nation.**__</span> Traditionally, these priorities have been opposing hostile domination of key geographic regions, supporting our allies, securing vital resources, and ensuring access to foreign economies.”</span>

<span style="font: 8px Times; margin: 0px;"> <span style="font: 12px Times;">__**Right now, the United States has a rare opportunity to stem or eradicate some of the world's most common and fatal health threats. However, as with most opportunities, we have a small amount of time to leverage it effectively. President Obama's Global Health Initiative (GHI) has the potential to save lives**__ </span>and improve the health and rights of women globally. It is the first comprehensive U.S. policy approach to global health that recognizes that our greatest plagues -- HIV/AIDS, maternal and infant mortality, and poor sexual and reproductive health -- are all interconnected, and they are all preventable. Now the Administration and Congress need to develop the policies and provide the funding that will make it work. The GHI has a number of strengths right out of the gate. It is the first government-sponsored initiative that promotes a woman-centered approach to policy and programming. With half a million women dying each year from pregnancy-related causes, and HIV/AIDS the leading cause of death for women of reproductive age (15-44), a woman-centered approach is relevant and necessary. It does not ignore or diminish the health needs of men and boys, but rather recognizes and addresses the disparate needs and conditions of women. It's a stellar, surprising and refreshing start.<span style="font: 12px Times;">__**There are, however, some things the GHI needs if we are truly going to get ahead of something as devastating as HIV/AIDS.**__</span> In the midst of a domestic budget freeze, the GHI absolutely needs additional funding. By 2011, annual funding needs to double from $8 billion to $16 billion. It would mean an additional 35 million women would have a skilled attendant present during birth, 10 million more couples would have access to family planning, and 370 million adolescents would get comprehensive sexuality education. Realistically, a budget increase will be difficult. However, <span style="font: 12px Times;">__**with or without additional funding, the GHI still needs to be leveraged to achieve all of its possible potential**__</span>. To do that, all GHI policy and programming needs to be human rights-based and integrated. "Integrated" means recognizing that HIV/AIDS and reproductive health care are intrinsically linked, and they need to be addressed accordingly. Anyone, woman or man, accessing HIV treatment must also have access to voluntary family planning and other reproductive health services, such as cancer screening and treatment and safe abortion services. For any HIV/AIDS or reproductive health program to be effective, integration has to be a guiding principle.</span>
