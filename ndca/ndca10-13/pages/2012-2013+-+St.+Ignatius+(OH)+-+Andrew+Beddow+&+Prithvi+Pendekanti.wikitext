**The affirmative envisions the world in terms of a moral dichotomy; unable to accept difference, the affirmative’s moralism must create a “devil spirit” (the immoral). In a world where death is inevitable, the affirmative’s moralist desire to perpetuate life creates an evil out of the world of suffering. They internalize this fear of the “devil spirit”, unable to accept the flaws and suffering that they live in.**
