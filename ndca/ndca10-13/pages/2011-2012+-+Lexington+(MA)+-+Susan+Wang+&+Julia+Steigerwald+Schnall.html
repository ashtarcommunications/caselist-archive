<u>Relationships within government organizations and agencies</u>, such as those upon which the NSTP was designed, <u>can</u> often <u>lead to confusing policy</u>, especially for commercial space matters. For example, the NSTP provides that the departments of Transportation (DOT) and Commerce (DOC) should promote creative arrangements between the public and private sectors. There is also an interagency working group representing the DOD, the DOC, the DOT, NASA, and the intelligence community which is to make certain that a commercial voice is heard throughout the process of designing a new launch vehicle. Unfortunately, <strong><u>barriers</u></strong> <u>to space enterprise often result from the actions of these <strong>agencies</strong> as they <strong>are not</strong> <strong>always in harmony with one another regarding space policy</strong>.</u> This situation has been documented by Joan Johnson-Freese and Roger Handberg in their book Space: The Dormant Frontier. In this book, the authors clearly state that <u>the NSTP often fails to obtain cooperation or coordination between the DOD, NASA, and the other agencies for they only cooperate superficially.</u><br />

On Thursday, July 15, 2004, the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics of the Committee on Science will hold a hearing to examine whether and how the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (<strong><u>NASA) could use prizes to spur innovation</u></strong>. <u>NASA</u> has requested permission to begin a small prize program and <u>is seeking legislative authority to run an expanded program.</u> (See details below.)<u>The type of prizes</u> NASA would offer <u>are known as ''inducement prizes''</u>—prizes offered <u>to induce someone to undertake research with a particular goal</u>—<u>as opposed to prizes given for previous achievements</u> (such as the Nobel Prize).In its report issued last month, the President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy (also known as the Aldridge Commission for its Chairman, former Under Secretary of Defense Edward ''Pete'' Aldridge) recommended that NASA offer inducement prizes.In<u>ducement prizes have also been in the news</u> recently <u>because of the flight of</u> Burt Rutan's <u>SpaceShipOne</u>—<u>the first privately financed flight into space—which was prompted by the X–Prize,</u> a $10 million inducement prize for a human sub-orbital space flight. The X–Prize is privately funded and administered by a private foundation that was set up for that purpose.2. WitnessesRear Admiral Craig E. Steidle (Ret.) is the Associate Administrator at NASA for Exploration Systems, and oversees the Centennial Challenges program, NASA's program of prize contests.The Honorable Robert Walker is the Chairman of Wexler &amp; Walker Public Policy Associates and former Chairman of the House Science Committee. He was also a member of the Aldridge Commission. Dr. Peter Diamandis is the Chairman of the X–Prize Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the formation of a space-tourism industry through a $10 million prize.Dr. Molly Macauley is an economist and Senior Fellow with Resources for the Future. Dr. Macauley's research interests include space economics and policy and the economics of new technologies.Dr. Douglas Holtz-Eakin is the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.3. Overarching QuestionsThe hearing will discuss the following topics:1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of NASA using prizes to spur innovation?2. Should prizes be offered for the development of specific, discrete technologies (such as the development of a better astronaut glove), or for large technological feats (such as sending a person into orbit), or should there be a wide range in the size of prizes?3. To what extent should NASA rely on prize competitions for the development of important new technologies? Should NASA ever rely exclusively on prize competitions for the development of a technology, and if not, how should it determine how to meld competitions with more traditional contracting? 4. How can NASA ensure that technologies resulting from a prize competition are safe, as well as relevant to NASA's objectives?4. NASA's Proposal for Greater Prize AuthorityAs part of the Space Exploration Vision that the President announced on January 14, <u>NASA proposed the ''Centennial Challenges'' program—a set of prize contests for designing particular technologies. NASA requested</u> <u>approval</u> from the Appropriations Committee to begin the Centennial Challenges this fiscal year <u>by transferring</u> $2 million <u>from other programs into the prize effort.</u> The Appropriations Committee denied the request, saying it ''was not included as part of the fiscal year 2004 budget submission nor was the initiative approved in the appropriations Act.''This year's program was to award prizes up to $250,000. <u>NASA is</u> also <u>seeking statutory authority to expand the program to $50 million annually and to allow it to award prizes of up to $10 million</u> (<u>and greater amounts, up to $50 million</u>, with the approval of the NASA Administrator). NASA included the proposal in the reauthorization bill proposal it sent to Congress earlier this year. (See attached list of potential contest topics.)5. IssuesCould prizes open new pathways to technological innovation for NASA? Traditionally, <u>NASA has used several tools to spur the development of technologies it needs to carry out its mission</u>. It has awarded grants to universities and other non-profits, it has relied on its own in-house scientists and engineers, and it has drawn up specifications and then awarded contracts for the development or procurement of specific technologies. <u>Prizes would</u> presumably <u>involve less direction from NASA than would any of the traditional routes</u>. Instead, <u>NASA would offer a prize for the development of a particular technology or achievement, and then would wait to see what contestants produced</u>. Proponents of prizes argue that <strong><u>this would be less costly and less bureaucratic</u></strong>, <strong><u>and</u></strong> might <strong><u>spur more creative thinking</u></strong>. In addition, they argue that <strong><u>inventors and entrepreneurs</u></strong> (as opposed to large aerospace corporations) <strong><u>would be more able to compete than they can under traditional processes, which involve more ''red tape</u></strong>.''Some of these benefits are discussed in a 1999 National Academy of Sciences report, ''Concerning Federally Sponsored Inducement Prizes in Science and Engineering.'' The report recommended that Congress encourage federal agencies to experiment more extensively with inducement prize contests in science and technology.The report noted that <u>traditional peer review processes tend to favor proposals that seem safe over those that may produce surprising and potentially more innovative results</u>. The report also noted that <strong><u>the federal procurement system can be intolerant of risk</u></strong>, <strong><u>and</u></strong> can p<strong><u>lace costly bureaucratic demands on private-sector contractors</u></strong>.In summary, <u>the Academy cited prizes as having these benefits</u>: <u>the ability to attract a broader spectrum of ideas and participants</u> by <strong><u>reducing the costs and other bureaucratic barriers to participation</u></strong> by individuals or firms; <u>the ability of the Federal Government to <strong>shift much of the risk and the financial burden</strong> of technology development from the government to the contestants</u>; <u>the ability to educate</u>, <u>inspire, and mobilize the public for scientific</u>, <u>technological, and societal objectives.</u>What are the pitfalls of using prizes to spur technology development?Prize contests can be less clear-cut than they first appear. Problems can develop in the design of the contest, the selection of a winner, and in the aftermath.First, <u>NASA would have to be careful in its design of prize contests. The goal for which the prize was being awarded would have to be clearly enough described that contestants</u> (and NASA) <u>had a firm sense of what NASA was seeking and why.</u> On the other hand, too detailed a description by NASA would limit the kinds of ideas that a contest could yield. A very detailed description would not end up being much different than contract specifications.The selection of a prize winner can also be difficult. Judges need to be open to unexpected ideas. There are historical examples of revolutionary ideas losing prize contests because the judges were not open to unexpected ways of achieving the stated goals. (See below.) On the other hand, NASA would also have to be careful to test prize entries carefully to ensure that there were no safety or other problems that might not be initially apparent.Finally, in terms of the aftermath, <u>NASA would have to decide how to put a winning idea into actual use</u>. A prize winner might not have the financial wherewithal or even the technical capacity to actually turn their winning idea into a viable product. The 1999 Academy report suggested these steps to avoid some of the pitfalls: <u>Contest rules should be seen as transparent, simple, fair, and unbiased</u>. <u>Prizes should be commensurate with the effort required and goals sought</u>. Treatment of intellectual property resulting from prize contests should be properly aligned with the objectives and incentive structure of the prize contest.Finally, it is unclear whether prizes would necessarily be a less costly way of doing business once all the costs NASA would have to incur in running a successful contest are taken into account.How dependent upon prizes should NASA be for the development of critical technologies? If a technology is critical to a NASA objective—returning to the Moon by 2020, for example—should NASA depend on prizes for the development of relevant technologies? The timing of technology development may be easier to control through traditional means of doing business (although traditional programs have been plagued by delays at times). If NASA wanted to use both prizes and traditional grants and contracts to develop a technology, would those two paths be undertaken simultaneously? Would those with a contract have an unfair advantage? NASA and prize advocates have not yet made clear how they would answer such questions.What kinds of goals are appropriate for prize contests? <u>NASA has proposed to use prizes</u> primarily <u>to develop specific, discrete technologies necessary to enable space exploration,</u> such as the development of a better astronaut glove. However, <u>the</u> Aldridge <u>Commission recommended a different type of prize program that would ''accelerate the development of enabling technologies. As an example</u> of a particularly challenging prize concept, <u>$100 million to $1 billion could be offered to the first organization to place humans on the Moon and sustain them for a fixed period before they return to Earth</u>.''

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">As presidents segue from the campaign into governance, they develop various strategies for moving their policy agenda forward. The most common strategy for presidents to secure their policy goals has been to submit their legislative proposals to Congress, building on the tools of public persuasion and party supremacy. When presidents capture public support, as President George W. Bush did with his tax cut proposal, Congress follows with legislative approval. However, in </span>recent administrations, particularly since the Reagan administration, presidents have often bypassed Congress using administrative actions. They have opted for a strategy through administrative actions that is less time-consuming and clearly less demanding of their political capital.<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Using an array of both formal and informal executive powers, </span>presidents have effectively directed the executive departments to implement policy without any requisite congressional authorization<span style="font-size: 10pt;">. In effect, </span>presidents have been able to govern without Congress<span style="font-size: 10pt;">. The arsenal of administrative actions available to presidents includes the power of appointment, perhaps </span>the most important of the arsenal, executive orders<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, executive agreements, proclamations, signing statements, and a host of national security directives. 1 More than any past president, George W. Bush has utilized administrative actions as his primary tool for governance.</span><br />

 Payroll taxes will likely pass- distinct from other jobs bill issues<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Espo 10/19/</span>11 (David, AP Special Correspondent “Analysis: Yes, parts of the jobs bill will pass”)<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Congress will</span><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">almost certainly approve</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the parts of</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> President Barack</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Obama's jobs bill that extend the payroll tax</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> cut and long-term unemployment benefits. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But his calls for new spending and a surtax on millionaires seem doomed</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It's a legislative reality largely missing in the furious political debate now unfolding along all-or-nothing lines, in which Obama tries to assign Republicans part of the blame for a dismayingly weak economy while the GOP tries to avoid it. &quot;Last week, all the Republicans in the Senate got together and blocked the jobs bill,&quot; the president said this week after his bus rolled, campaign-style, into Millers Creek, N.C. &quot;They refused to even debate it.&quot; He cited a poll that said about 63 percent of Americans &quot;support the ideas in this jobs bill,&quot; then he asked, &quot;So why is it that 100 percent of Republicans in the Senate voted against it?&quot; He added, &quot;It doesn't make any sense.&quot; The morning after, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell rebutted. &quot;He's trying to change the topic,&quot; the Kentucky senator said of Obama. &quot;He wants to deflect attention from that 1.5 million job loss&quot; since he took office. &quot;For two years, the president got everything he wanted from the Democrats in Congress,&quot; McConnell added. In the political argument, both sides play loose with the facts. Despite Obama's rhetoric, it was Senate Democrats who forced a rewrite of the jobs bill last week. And even now, it's unlikely he has enough support within his own party to assure a majority. And despite McConnell's claim, Obama settled for less than he wanted from Congress in an economic stimulus bill early in 2009, agreeing to a concession in exchange for Republican votes critical to passage. Political debate aside, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">significant parts of the legislation seem on track to pass by year's end, when payroll tax cuts enacted a year ago and unemployment benefits are scheduled to expire</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The proposed renewal of the payroll tax cut, at $179 billion over a decade, is the largest single item in the legislation and has drawn no significant opposition from Republicans</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A proposal to give employers a break on payroll taxes, a $69 billion provision, could pass, as well.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> An extension of unemployment insurance, likely to pass, carries a price tag of $48.5 billion. Far less likely to become law, given Republican opposition, are the president's requests for $50 billion over a decade for transportation projects, $35 billion to help the states hire teachers and first responders, $30 billion for school modernization and $15 billion for a neighborhood stabilization fund. </span><br />

'Backward step': U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Republicans threaten to push the country into recession</span> if they don't back the jobs bill Senior White House officials have said they will sit down with Democrat Senate leaders to hold a series of votes on parts of the $447billion plan - including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Mr Obama told a meeting of his Jobs Council in Pittsburgh: 'Our expectation is, if they don't pass the whole package, we're going to break it up into constituent parts.' In the campaign video, he added: 'They'll be forced to decide whether we should cut taxes for middle class Americans or let them go up next year. 'In fact, that's exactly what one of the leading Republican presidential candidates suggested we do during last night's debate: allow taxes to rise by up to $1,000 next year for struggling middle class families.' U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has also warned Republicans they risk pushing the country into recession if the bill is defeated. He said: 'If Congress does not act, it will be because Republicans decided they did not want to do anything to help the economy.' Mr <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Obama has been working to get Congress to pass</span> a full version of <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the bill</span> - which aims to cut unemployment, boost growth and protect the U.S. from the euro zone debt crisis. But it was unlikely to get through the house in its full state. Massachusetts Governor Mitt <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Romney has opposed the temporary extension of the payroll tax cut,</span> and labelled it a 'little Band-Aid' during the Republic candidate debate on Tuesday night. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The White House will now seek to </span><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">build pressure</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> on votes on individual parts of the bill</span><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, including the payroll tax cut</span></em> and helping war veterans find work. Mr Obama has been keen to portray himself as champion for the middle classes. Campaign official David Axelrod argued that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">since he began selling the jobs bill, the public has moved to support him. 'The more people know</span> about the American Jobs Act; <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the more they hear the president talking about it; the more they want Congress to pass the plan</span>,' he said. Recent polling data has revealed 52 per cent of Americans now back the bill, according to SBS.<br />

Payroll tax cut portion of Jobs Bill needed to avert economic shock that will tip US back into a second recession<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">President </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Obamais expected to call for an extension of the payroll tax cut</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">in his jobs speech tonight — in fact, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">it will likely be the centerpiece of his proposal. The tax cut</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which was enacted in 2010 as part of the lame-duck tax deal, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">brings the employee share of Social Security taxes down from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A few rumors are going around that </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Obama might even expand this cut further</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> — perhaps by slashing the employer’s share of the tax. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So will</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> any of </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">this actually help the economy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? The main point advocates emphasize is that an </span><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">extension is necessary to preventing further economic harm</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. In 2011, the cut is projected to boost workers’ take-home pay by about $120 billion</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If Congress lets the tax cut expire, then the hike next year would deliver an economic shock that could tip us </span><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">back into recession</span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Goldman Sachs estimates that failing to extend the payroll tax cut could reduce economic growth by two-thirds of a percentage point in early 2012.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics concurs. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Even if renewing the payroll tax cut won’t boost the economy further, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the argument goes</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, it will at least avert further degradation.</span><br />

A double dip recession would be much worse than the first and trigger an economic depression<br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Another recession could be even worse than the last one for a few reasons. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">F</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">or starters, the economy is more vulnerable than it was in 2007</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> when the Great Recession began. In fact, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the economy would enter the new recession much weaker than the start of any other downturn since the end of World War II.Unemployment currently stands at 9.1%.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In November 2007, the month before the start of the Great Recession, it was just 4.7%. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">And the large number of Americans who have stopped looking for work</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the last few years </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">has left the percentage of the population with a job at a 28-year low. Various parts of the economy also have yet to recover from the last recession and would be at serious risk of </span><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">lasting damage i</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">n a new downturn. Home values continue to lose ground and are projected to continue their fall</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. While manufacturing has had a nice rebound in the last two years, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">industrial production is still 18% below pre-recession levels. There are nearly 900 banks on the FDIC's list of troubled institutions, the highest number since 1993. Only 76 banks were at risk as the Great Recession took hold. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But what has economists particularly worried is that the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">tools generally used to try to jumpstart an economy teetering on the edge of recession aren't available this time around. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The reason we didn't go into a depression three years ago is the policy response by Congress and the Fed,&quot; said</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Dan Seiver, a finance professor at San Diego State University. &quot;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We won't see that this time</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Three times between 2008 and 2010, Congress approved massive spending or temporary tax cuts to try to stimulate the economy. But fresh from the bruising debt ceiling battle and credit rating downgrade, and with elections looming, the federal government has shown little inclination to move in that direction. </span><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So this new recession would likely have virtually no policy effort to counteract it</span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

Conversely, global policymakers do not seem to have grasped the downside risks to the global economy posed by a deteriorating domestic and international political environment. If the past is any guide, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the souring of the political environment must be expected to fan</span> the <span style="font-size: 10pt;">corrosive protectionist tendencies and nationalistic economic policy responses</span> that are already all too much in evidence. After spending much of 2008 cheerleading the global economy, the International Monetary Fund now concedes that output in the world's advanced economies is expected to contract by as much as 2% in 2009. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">This would be the first time</span> in the post-war period that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">output contracted in all of the world's major economies</span>. The IMF is also now expecting only a very gradual global economic recovery in 2010, which will keep global unemployment at a high level. Sadly, the erstwhile rapidly growing <span style="font-size: 10pt;">emerging</span>-market <span style="font-size: 10pt;">economies will not be spared by</span> the ravages of the <span style="font-size: 10pt;">global recession. Output is already declining</span> precipitously <span style="font-size: 10pt;">across Eastern and Central Europe as well as in a number of key Asian economies, like South Korea and Thailand</span>. A number of important emerging-market countries like Ukraine seem to be headed for debt default, while a highly oil-dependent Russia seems to be on the cusp of a full-blown currency crisis. Perhaps <span style="font-size: 10pt;">of even greater concern is the virtual grinding to a halt of</span> economic <span style="font-size: 10pt;">growth in China</span>. The IMF now expects that China's growth rate will approximately halve to <span style="font-size: 10pt;">6%</span> in 2009. Such a growth rate <span style="font-size: 10pt;">would fall far short of what is needed to absorb the 20 million </span>Chinese workers <span style="font-size: 10pt;">who migrate</span> each year from the countryside to the towns in search of a better life. As a barometer of the political and social tensions that this grim world economic outlook portends, one needs look no further than the recent employment forecast of the International Labor Organization. The ILO believes that the global financial crisis will wipe out 30 million jobs worldwide in 2009, while in a worst case scenario as many as 50 million jobs could be lost. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">What do these trends mean in the short</span> and medium <span style="font-size: 10pt;">term</span>? The Great Depression showed how social and <span style="font-size: 10pt;">global chaos followed</span> hard on <span style="font-size: 10pt;">economic collapse</span>. The mere fact that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">parliaments</span> across the globe, from America to Japan, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">are unable to make</span> responsible, economically <span style="font-size: 10pt;">sound recovery plans</span> suggests that they do not know what to do and are simply hoping for the least disruption. Equally worrisome is the adoption of more statist economic programs around the globe, and the concurrent decline of trust in free-market systems. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The threat of instability is</span> a <span style="font-size: 10pt;">pressing</span> concern. China, until last year the world's fastest growing economy, just reported that 20 million migrant laborers lost their jobs. Even in the flush times of recent years, China faced upward of 70,000 labor uprisings a year. <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A sustained downturn poses grave</span></em> and possibly immediate <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">threats to Chinese internal stability</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. The regime</span> in Beijing <span style="font-size: 10pt;">may be faced with a choice of repressing its own people or diverting their energies outward, leading to conflict with China's neighbors. Russia</span>, an oil state completely dependent on energy sales, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">has had to put down riots</span> in its Far East as well as in downtown Moscow. Vladimir Putin's rule has been predicated on squeezing civil liberties while providing economic largesse. If that devil's bargain falls apart, then <span style="font-size: 10pt;">wide-scale repression </span>inside Russia, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">along with a continuing threatening posture</span> toward Russia's neighbors, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">is likely. Even</span> apparently <span style="font-size: 10pt;">stable societies face</span> increasing risk and <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the threat of</span> internal or possibly <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">external conflict</span></em>. As Japan's exports have plummeted by nearly 50%, one-third of the country's prefectures have passed emergency economic stabilization plans. Hundreds of thousands of temporary employees hired during the first part of this decade are being laid off. Spain's unemployment rate is expected to climb to nearly 20% by the end of 2010; Spanish unions are already protesting the lack of jobs, and the specter of violence, as occurred in the 1980s, is haunting the country. Meanwhile, in Greece, workers have already taken to the streets. Europe as a whole will face dangerously increasing tensions between native citizens and immigrants, largely from poorer Muslim nations, who have increased the labor pool in the past several decades. Spain has absorbed five million immigrants since 1999, while nearly 9% of Germany's residents have foreign citizenship, including almost 2 million Turks. The xenophobic labor strikes in the U.K. do not bode well for the rest of Europe. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">A prolonged global downturn, let alone a collapse, would </span><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">dramatically raise tensions</span></em>inside these countries. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Couple that with possible protectionist legislation in the United States, unresolved ethnic and territorial disputes in all regions of the globe and a loss of confidence</span> that world leaders actually know what they are doing. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The result may be</span> a series of small explosions that coalesce into <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">a big bang</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span></em><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As is well understood, the space policies of the Bush administration were decidedly oriented toward military security concerns and independent action. The 2006 National Space Policy unabashedly proclaimed the U.S. intention to maintain a dominant position in space indefinitely. This policy orientation dismissed multilateral cooperation as impinging on U.S. “freedom of action,” throwing weight instead behind a wide range of technology development initiatives founded on the assumption that deployment of weapons in space was, if not already factual, certainly inevitable.2 U.S. commercial and civil engagement was overshadowed by these security concerns, expressed through the tightening of export control restrictions inhibiting a broad range of technology sharing. Once again, U.S. space policy was subsumed by other national priorities, in this case dominated by military security concerns. This background is essential for appreciating how </span>the space policies of the Obama administration are beginning to genuinely break new trails<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The U.S. National Space Policy issued in June 2010 has been widely recognized for its cooperative and multilateral tone<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, including as explicit near-term goals the expansion of international cooperation on all activities and pursuing international as well as national measures to enhance space stability. </span>Particularly notable are the document’s emphasis on orienting U.S. “leadership” toward fostering international cooperation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and its references, in its concluding section, to cooperation with other states and non-state actors in the pursuit of national security space objectives.3 Less broadly noticed was this policy’s clarity and coherence in articulating a vision for U.S. space activities on its own terms. The document is organized around core principles, subsidiary goals and implementing guidelines that exceed its predecessors in delineating a longer-term direction for U.S. space policy that is integrated with, rather than derivative of, broader U.S. global aims.4 The policy also was generated and issued far earlier in the tenure of the administration than either of its predecessors, indicating an increased prioritization of attention to space policy at higher levels of policy-making. To some degree,</span> a turn toward multilateral cooperation in U.S. space policy was to be expected<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision increased awareness of the challenge of space debris and the need for better global information sharing on space situational awareness (SSA).5 Also, </span>new budget realities and unpromising technological developments have scaled back ambitions in some quarters for solving U.S. space security concerns with new independent capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, the Obama administration has pursued a more cooperative disposition across a wide range of global policy challenges, from Iranian nuclear ambitions to global climate change. But the improved clarity of vision in the 2010 Space Policy suggests that the emphasis on fostering global cooperation on space-related activities is more grounded in deliberate foresight than sailing the prevailing political winds. </span>The 2011 National Security Space Strategy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, released February 4, </span>is best interpreted against this background of the Obama administration’s turn toward both greater international space cooperation<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and greater attention to space policy in general. This first-of-its-kind strategic statement culminates a congressionally mandated space posture review.6 The initial section portraying the strategic environment to which U.S. security policy must be responsive highlights the growing problems of space debris, orbital congestion and coordination among a growing number of space actors — not state-based security threats per se. The Security Space Strategy features the objective of a “stable space environment in which nations exercise shared responsibility.”7 Specific provisions intended to implement this strategy, relevant to the preceding observations, include:8 • The strategy presents a full section on “Partnering with Responsible Nations, International Organizations, and Commercial Firms.” This category is not wholly multilateral in the traditional sense, displaying a symbiosis of alliance-building and collective cooperation not always carefully distinguished; i.e., “The United States will lead in building coalitions of like-minded space-faring nations and, where appropriate, work with international institutions to do so.” • The strategy intends to “encourage responsible behavior in space and lead by the power of example,” a significant observation given the tendency of U.S. policy-makers (as noted above) not to expect quid pro quo responses to cooperative gestures. Also, </span>the strategy states the U.S. “will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, andnorms of behavior for responsible space operations.”<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [italics added] In the context of the section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression,” the strategy similarly intends to “support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space” as well as “pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint,” along with other measures. </span>This emphasis on norm-building and the role of example suggests a near-term endorsement of the development of “codes of conduct” for space activities<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (such as the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct, discussed below), </span>whether or not such concord leads to more formal arms control arrangements <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the longer-term. • </span>The Department of Defense is directed to “foster cooperative SSA relationships<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” and to “expand provision of safety of flight services to U.S. Government agencies, other nations, and commercial firms.” Greater SSA information sharing has been a key suggestion for fostering international cooperation; the U.S. possesses globally superior SSA capabilities, but restricts the sharing of this information on the basis of national security concerns.9 Hence, this nominal commitment is significant in its own right. • </span>The strategy commits to reforming export controls.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “In particular, as new opportunities arise for international collaboration, a revised export control system will better enable the domestic firms competing for these contracts.” As noted above, the oppressive impact of current U.S. export controls not only impinges on U.S. commercial space actors but also epitomizes the high degree to which U.S. policy has subsumed commercial and civil interests to national security concerns. The strategy appears to acknowledge this connection and commit to remedy it. • The most assertive passages of the statement are moderated with community-building intent. For example, the strategy’s section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression” concludes that the U.S. “will retain the right and capabilities to respond in self-defense, should deterrence fail,” but immediately adds that the U.S. “will use force in a manner that is consistent with longstanding principles of international law, treaties to which the United States is a party, and the inherent right of self defense.” • The concluding and most conflict-oriented section of the strategy opens by noting that “some actors may still believe counterspace actions could provide military advantage.” Counterspace capabilities, unarticulated in the document, include ASATs, ground-based directed energy weapons and satellite transmission jamming. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy Gregory Schulte explained at the strategy’s rollout that China is a principal concern in this regard, but so is the proliferation of these technologies: “If Ethiopia can jam a commercial satellite, you have to worry what others can do.”10 This section of the strategy does not, however, call for maintaining options to develop complementary space conflict capabilities. Rather, the strategy asserts that the U.S. “must be prepared to ‘fight through’ a degraded environment,” and identifies “resilience” and “space protection” as the key criteria. The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective, highlighting those elements expressing consistency with the 2010 National Space Policy’s bend toward fostering greater international collaboration. Perhaps </span>as striking <span style="font-size: 8pt;">as the prevalence of such passages, however, </span>is the absence of expressed intention — even couched in hedging language — to sustain or expand<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the kind of </span>independent space-based military capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that were the centerpiece of the prior administration’s aims (if not its accomplishments). Again, to some extent this turn in tone is overdetermined by extenuating global circumstances. But one must still be struck by the degree to which developments such as the Chinese ASAT test have not ignited the kind of response one might have anticipated only a few short years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 </span>The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its sends concerning U.S. policy toward the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.12 The strategy did not explicitly endorse this EU initiative, but Mr. Schulte, at the February 4 presentation of the strategy, highlighted the initiative “as a potential way” to promote “transparency and confidence-building measures, which tend to be voluntary as opposed to legally binding.” A week earlier, Rose Gottemoeller, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, stated at the Conference on Disarmament that the administration was nearing a decision on whether the U.S. would sign on to the code, and what modifications might be required in order to do so.13 As U.S. interest in the Code of Conduct has increased, debates over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. </span>These policy movements toward multilateral engagement and commitment to behavioral standards (even if non-binding) mark a sharp departure from the stiff resistance to curtailing U.S. “freedom of action” in the previous administration<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and have accordingly generated resistance from congressional opponents on just those terms. Prior to the release of the National Security Space Strategy, a group of 37 Republican senators led by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl issued a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concern over a potential multilateral commitment that might limit development and/or deployment of space-based missile defense interceptors and ASAT-defeating systems.14 Critics also decried the strategy’s emphasis on “the old fallacious assumption that the power of example will prevent adversaries from doing the United States harm,” and endorsed maintaining the goal of U.S. retention of a “dominant position in military and intelligence space capabilities.”15 In fact, the administration’s warming toward normative commitments in general — and the EU Code of Conduct in particular — are in part intended to forestall pressure for more formal and binding measures that would definitively cut off the “hedge” of unilateral U.S. weapons development options.16 The balance of U.S. debate may have shifted toward greater international cooperation, but the terms of the debate remain the same. In sum, </span>the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing in U.S. policy toward greater global engagement but also,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and more importantly, </span>a step toward greater long-term coherence in thinking concerning the core goals of U.S. space activities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even supporters of the general directions of the strategy noted its more-than-expected breadth of thought.17 But if this reading is sound, the strategy is still but one step on a long road, and ongoing debates over the role of U.S. space policy vis-à-vis broader national security interests will insure that road is bumpy. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that more specific guidelines for military implementation of the strategy remain to be developed.18 Many devils may lurk in these details. </span><br />

Perhaps of even greater concern is that several other nations, including one of China’s regional rivals, India, may feel compelled to seek ­offensive as well as defensive capabilities in space<span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 8pt;">. The U.S. trade journal Defense News, for instance, quoted unidentified Indian defense officials as stating that their country had already begun developing its own kinetic-energy (nonexplosive, hit-to-kill) and laser-based antisatellite weapons. </span>If India goes down that path, its archrival Pakistan will probably follow suit.<span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 8pt;"> Like India, Pakistan has a well-developed ballistic missile program, including medium-range missiles that could launch an antisatellite system. </span>Even Japan,<span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 8pt;"> the third major Asian power, </span>might join such a space race<span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 8pt;">. In June 2007 the National Diet of Japan began considering a bill backed by the current Fukuda government that would permit the development of satellites for “military and national security” purposes. As for Russia, in the wake of the Chinese test President Vladimir Putin reiterated Moscow’s stance against the weaponization of space. At the same time, though, he refused to criticize Beijing’s actions and blamed the U.S. instead. The American efforts to build a missile defense system, Putin charged, and the increasingly aggressive American plans for a military position in space were prompting China’s moves. Yet Russia itself, as a major spacefaring power that has incorporated satellites into its national security structure, would be hard-pressed to forgo entering an arms race in space. </span>Given the proliferation of spacefaring entities, proponents of a robust space warfare strategy believe that arming the heavens is inevitable and that it would be best for the U.S. to get there first <span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 8pt;">with firepower. Antisatellite and space-based weapons, they argue, will be necessary not only to defend U.S. military and commercial satellites but also to deny any future adversary the use of space capabilities to enhance the performance of its forces on the battlefield. </span>Yet any arms race in space would almost inevitably destabilize the balance of power and thereby multiply the risks of global conflict<span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 8pt;">. In such headlong competition—whether in space or elsewhere—</span>equilibrium among the adversaries would be virtually impossible to maintain. Even if the major powers did achieve stability, that reality would still provide no guarantee that both sides would perceive it to be so. The moment one side saw itself to be slipping behind the other, the first side would be strongly tempted to launch a preemptive strike<span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 8pt;">, before things got even worse. Ironically, the same would hold for the side that perceived itself to have gained an advantage. Again, </span>there would be strong temptation to strike first, before the adversary could catch up. Finally, a space weapons race would ratchet up the chances that a mere technological mistake could trigger a battle. After all, in the distant void, reliably distinguishing an intentional act from an accidental one would be highly problematic. <span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Hit-to-Kill InterceptorsAccording to assessments by U.S. military and intelligence officials as well as by independent experts, the Chinese probably destroyed their weather satellite with a kinetic-energy vehicle boosted by a two-stage medium-range ballistic missile. Technologically, launching such direct-ascent antisatellite weapons is one of the simplest ways to take out a satellite. About a dozen nations and consortia can reach low Earth orbit (between roughly 100 and 2,000 kilometers, or 60 to 1,250 miles, high) with a medium-range missile; eight of those countries can reach geostationary orbit (about 36,000 kilometers, or 22,000 miles, above Earth).But the real technical hurdle to making a hit-to-kill vehicle is not launch capacity; it is the precision maneuverability and guidance technology needed to steer the vehicle into its target. Just how well China has mastered those techniques is unclear. Because the weather satellite was still operating when it was destroyed, the Chinese operators would have known its exact location at all times.Ground-Based LasersThe test of China’s direct-ascent antisatellite device came on the heels of press reports in September 2006 that the Chinese had also managed to “paint,” or illuminate, U.S. spy satellites with a ground-based laser [see lower box on page 83]. Was Beijing actually trying to “blind” or otherwise damage the satellites? No one knows, and no consensus seems to have emerged in official Washington circles about the Chinese intent. Per­haps China was simply testing how well its network of low-power laser-ranging stations could track American orbital observation platforms.Even so, the test was provocative. Not all satellites have to be electronically “fried” to be put out of commission. A 1997 test of the army’s MIRACL system (for midinfrared advanced chemical laser) showed that satellites designed to collect optical images can be temporarily disrupted—dazzled—by low-power beams. It follows that among the satellites vulnerable to such an attack are the orbital spies.The U.S. and the former Soviet Union began experimenting with laser-based antisatellite weapons in the 1970s. Engineers in both countries have focused on the many problems of building high-power laser systems that could reliably destroy low-flying satellites from the ground. Such systems could be guided by “adaptive optics”: deformable mirrors that can continuously compensate for atmospheric distortions. But tremendous amounts of energy would be needed to feed high-power lasers, and even then the range and effectiveness of the beams would be severely limited by dispersion, by attenuation as they passed through smoke or clouds, and by the difficulty of keeping the beams on-target long enough to do damage.During the development of the SDI, the U.S. conducted several laser experiments from Hawaii, including a test in which a beam was bounced off a mirror mounted on a satellite. Laser experiments continue at the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. Pentagon budget documents from fiscal years 2004 through 2007 listed antisatellite operations among the goals of the Starfire research, but that language was removed from budget documents in fiscal year 2008 after Congress made inquiries. The Starfire system incorporates adaptive optics that narrow the outgoing laser beam and thus increase the density of its power. That capability is not required for imagery or tracking, further suggesting that Starfire could be used as a weapon.Yet despite decades of work, battle-ready versions of directed-energy weapons still seem far away. An air force planning document, for instance, predicted in 2003 that a ground-based weapon able to “propagate laser beams through the atmosphere to [stun or kill low Earth orbit] satellites” could be available between 2015 and 2030. Given the current state of research, even those dates seem optimistic.Co-orbital SatellitesRecent advances in miniaturized sensors, powerful onboard computers and efficient rocket thrusters have made a third kind of antisatellite technology increasingly feasible: the offensive microsatellite. One example that demonstrates the potential is the air force’s experimental satellite series (XSS) project, which is developing microsatellites intended to conduct “autonomous proximity operations” around larger satellites. The first two microsatellites in the program, the XSS-10 and XSS-11, were launched in 2003 and 2005. Though ostensibly intended to inspect larger satellites, such microsatellites could also ram target satellites or carry explosives or directed-energy payloads such as radio-frequency jamming systems or high-powered microwave emitters. Air force budget documents show that the XSS effort is tied to a program called Advanced Weapons Technology, which is dedicated to research on military laser and microwave systems.During the cold war the Soviet Union developed, tested and even declared operational a co-orbital antisatellite system—a maneuverable interceptor with an explosive payload that was launched by missile into an orbit near a target satellite in low Earth orbit. In effect, the device was a smart “space mine,” but it was last demonstrated in 1982 and is probably no longer working. Today such an interceptor would likely be a microsatellite that could be parked in an orbit that would cross the orbits of several of its potential targets. It could then be activated on command during a close encounter.In 2005 the air force described a program that would provide “localized” space “situational awareness” and “anomaly characterization” for friendly host satellites in geostationary orbit. The program is dubbed ANGELS (for autonomous nanosatellite guardian for evaluating local space), and the budget line believed to represent it focuses on acquiring “high value space asset defensive capabilities,” including a “warning sensor for detection of a direct ascent or co-orbital vehicle.” It is clear that such guardian nanosatellites could also serve as offensive weapons if they were maneuvered close to enemy satellites.And the list goes on. A “parasitic satellite” would shadow or even attach itself to a target in geostationary orbit. Farsat, which was mentioned in an appendix to the [Donald] Rumsfeld Space Commission report in 2001, “would be placed in a ‘storage’ orbit (perhaps with many microsatellites housed inside) relatively far from its target but ready to be maneuvered in for a kill.”Finally, the air force proposed some time ago a space-based radio-frequency weapon system, which “would be a constellation of satellites containing high-power radio-frequency transmitters that possess the capability to disrupt/­destroy/disable a wide variety of electronics and national-level command and control systems.”Air force planning documents from 2003 envisioned that such a technology would emerge after 2015. But outside experts think that orbital radio-frequency and microwave weapons are technically feasible today and could be deployed in the relatively near future.Space BombersThough not by definition a space weapon, the Pentagon’s Common Aero Vehicle/Hypersonic Technology Vehicle (often called CAV) enters into this discussion because, like an ICBM, it would travel through space to strike Earth-bound targets. An unpowered but highly maneuverable hypersonic glide vehicle, the CAV would be deployed from a future hypersonic space plane, swoop down into the atmosphere from orbit and drop conventional bombs on ground targets. Congress recently began funding the project but, to avoid stoking a potential arms race in space, has prohibited any work to place weapons on the CAV. Although engineers are making steady progress on the key technologies for the CAV program, both the vehicle and its space plane mothership are still likely decades off.Some of the congressional sensitivity to the design of the CAV may have arisen from another, much more controversial space weapons concept with parallel goals: hypervelocity rod bundles that would be dropped to Earth from orbital platforms. For decades air force planners have been thinking about placing weapons in orbit that could strike terrestrial targets, particularly buried, “hardened” bunkers and caches of weapons of mass destruction. Commonly called “rods from God,” the bundles would be made up of large tungsten rods, each as long as six meters (20 feet) and 30 centimeters (12 inches) across. Each rod would be hurled downward from an orbiting spacecraft and guided to its target at tremendous speed.Both high costs and the laws of physics, however, challenge their feasibility. Ensuring that the projectiles do not burn up or deform from reentry friction while sustaining a precise, nearly vertical flight path would be extremely difficult. Calculations indicate that the nonexplosive rods would probably be no more effective than more conventional munitions. Furthermore, the expense of lofting the heavy projectiles into orbit would be exorbitant. Thus, despite continued interest in them, rods from God seem to fall into the realm of science fiction.Obstacles to Space WeaponsWhat, then, is holding the U.S. (and other nations) back from a full-bore pursuit of space weapons? The countervailing pressures are threefold: political opposition, technological challenges and high costs.The American body politic is deeply divided over the wisdom of making space warfare a part of the national military strategy. The risks are manifold. I remarked earlier on the general instabilities of an arms race, but there is a further issue of stability among the nuclear powers. Early-warning and spy satellites have traditionally played a crucial role in reducing fears of a surprise nuclear attack. But if antisatellite weapons disabled those eyes-in-the-sky, the resulting uncertainty and distrust could rapidly lead to catastrophe.One of the most serious technological challenges posed by space weapons is the proliferation of space debris, to which I alluded earlier. According to investigators at the air force, NASA and Celestrak (an independent space-monitoring Web site), the Chinese antisatellite test left more than 2,000 pieces of junk, baseball-size and larger, orbiting the globe in a cloud that lies between about 200 kilometers (125 miles) and 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) above Earth’s surface. Perhaps another 150,000 objects that are a centimeter (half an inch) across and larger were released. High orbital velocities make even tiny pieces of space junk dangerous to spacecraft of all kinds. And ground stations cannot reliably monitor or track objects smaller than about five centimeters (two inches) across in low Earth orbit (around a meter in geostationary orbit), a capability that might enable satellites to maneuver out of the way. To avoid being damaged by the Chinese space debris, in fact, two U.S. satellites had to alter course. Any shooting war in space would raise the specter of a polluted space environment no longer navigable by Earth-orbiting satellites.Basing weapons in orbit also pre­sents difficult technical obstacles. They would be just as vulnerable as satellites are to all kinds of outside agents: space debris, projectiles, electromagnetic signals, even natural micrometeoroids. Shielding space weapons against such threats would also be impractical, mostly because shielding is bulky and adds mass, thereby greatly increasing launch costs. Orbital weapons would be mostly autonomous mechanisms, which would make operational errors and failures likely. The paths of objects in orbit are relatively easy to predict, which would make hiding large weapons problematic. And because satellites in low Earth orbit are overhead for only a few minutes at a time, keeping one of them constantly in range would require many weapons.Finally, getting into space and operating there is extremely expensive: between $2,000 and $10,000 a pound to reach low Earth orbit and between $15,000 and $20,000 a pound for geostationary orbit. Each space-based weapon would require replacement every seven to 15 years, and in-orbit repairs would not be cheap, either.Alternatives to Space WarfareGiven the risks of space warfare to national and international security, as well as the technical and financial hurdles that must be overcome, it would seem only prudent for spacefaring nations to find ways to prevent an arms race in space. </span>The U.S. focus has been to reduce the vulnerability of its satellite fleet<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> and explore alternatives to its dependence on satellite services. </span>Most other space-capable countries are instead seeking multilateral diplomatic and legal measures. The options range from treaties that would ban antisatellite and space-based weapons to voluntary measures that would help build transparency and mutual confidence<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">.The Bush administration has adamantly opposed any form of negotiations regarding space weapons. Opponents of multilateral space weapons agreements contend that others (particularly China) will sign up but build secret arsenals at the same time, because such treaty violations cannot be detected. They argue further that the U.S. cannot sit idly as potential adversaries gain spaceborne resources that could enhance their terrestrial combat capabilities.Proponents of international treaties counter that </span>failure to negotiate such agreements entails real opportunity costs. An arms race in space may end up compromising the security of all nations<u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">,</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> including that of the U.S., while it stretches the economic capacities of the competitors to the breaking point. And whereas many advocates of a space weapons ban concede that it will be difficult to construct a fully verifiable treaty—because space technology can be used for both military and civilian ends—effective treaties already exist that do not require strict verification. A good example is the Biological Weapons Convention. Certainly a prohibition on the testing and use (as opposed to the deployment) of the most dangerous class of near-term space weapons—destructive (as opposed to jamming) antisatellite systems—would be easily verifiable, because earthbound observers can readily detect orbital debris. Furthermore, </span>any party to a treaty would know that all its space launches would be tracked from the ground, and any suspicious object in orbit would promptly be labeled as such. The international outcry that would ensue from such overt treaty violations could deter would-be violators<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">.Since the mid-1990s, however, </span>progress on establishing a new multilateral space regime has lagged. The U.S. has blocked efforts<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to begin negotiations on a treaty to ban space weapons. China, meanwhile, has refused to accept anything less. Hence, intermediate measures such as voluntary confidence-building, space traffic control or a code of responsible conduct for spacefaring nations have remained stalled.</span>Space warfare is not inevitable. But the recent policy shift in the U.S. and China’s provocative actions have highlighted the fact that the world is approaching a crossroads<u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">.</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Countries must come to grips with their strong self-interest in preventing the testing and use of orbital weapons. The nations of Earth must soon decide whether it is possible to sustain the predominantly peaceful human space exploration that has already lasted half a century. The likely alternative would be unacceptable to all.</span><br />
d. Space wars occur through miscalculation and cause extinction<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mitchell, et al 1</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -Associate Professor of Communication and Director of Debate at the University of Pittsburgh</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Dr. Gordon, ISIS Briefing on Ballistic Missile Defence, “Missile Defence: Trans-Atlantic Diplomacy at a Crossroads”, No. 6 July, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1042:http://www.isisuk.demon.co.uk/0811/isis/uk/bmd/no6.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.isisuk.demon.co.uk/0811/isis/uk/bmd/no6.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.isisuk.demon.co.uk/0811/isis/uk/bmd/no6.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1042 -->)</span><br />
<br />
A buildup of space weapons might begin with noble intentions of 'peace through strength' deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that '… the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use'<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.33 This drift toward usage is strengthened by a strategic fact elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, 'anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand'.34 </span>The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent 'dual capability' of spaceborne weapon components.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As Marc Vidricaire, Delegation of Canada to the UN Conference on Disarmament, explains: 'If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land'. 35 To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such</span> interceptors can<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span>be used as orbiting 'Death Stars', capable of sending munitions hurtling through the Earth's atmosphere. The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense 'use or lose' pressure into strategic calculations, with the spectre of split-second attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting Death Stars with automated 'hair trigger' devices<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, </span>by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed 'complexly interactive, tightly coupled' industrial systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other's flawless performance. According to Perrow, this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail. As Perrow explains, '[t]he odd term &quot;normal accident&quot; is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable'.36 </span>Deployment of space weapons with pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to 'normal accidents'. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to retired Lt. Col. Robert M. Bowman, </span>'even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage — even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!'<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 37 In the same Star Wars technology touted as a quintessential tool of peace, defence analyst David Langford sees one of the most destabilizing offensive weapons ever conceived: 'One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people'.38 Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that </span>any nation subjected to space weapon attack would retaliate with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen.<br />
