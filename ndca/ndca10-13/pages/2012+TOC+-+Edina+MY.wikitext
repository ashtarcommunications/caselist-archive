The status quo represents a fundamental paradox – in our search for extraterrestrial intelligence we insist on receiving with nothing to give – absent a reorientation towards an active approach, this view creates an isolationism that culminates in planetary extinction
Zatisev 11 – Chief scientist at the Russian Academy of Science's Institute of Radio Engineering and Electronics
(Alexander, “Rationale for METI”, http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1105/1105.0910.pdf, dml)

In 1999, after the development [...] isolated civilization due to “apathy”.


The SETI paradox fits within a larger narrative of exclusion that denies the possibility of the extraterrestrial Other – this reinforces a system of colonialism and mastery that culminates in planetary destruction – we must reconsider the possibility of the extraterrestrial
Zimmerman 2 – assistant professor of religious studies, Stanford University
(Michael, “Encountering Alien Otherness”, http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/paper_zimmerman_Alien_Otherness.pdf, dml) [gender-modified words denoted by brackets]

According to the exclusionary either/ [...] make such integration a top priority.


The logic of control exemplified by the destruction of Otherness can only culminate in planetary extinction through mechanization – we must acknowledge our ultimate finitude.
Joronen 11 – coordinator of the Geography graduate school at the University of Turku
(Mikko, “Dwelling in the Sites of Finitude: Resisting the Violence of the Metaphysical Globe”, Antipode Volume 43, Issue 4, pages 1127–1154, September 2011)

Perhaps one of the most striking [...] the living earth a home.


Placing human life as first priority devalues the existence of the Other – the impact is endless nihilism and genocide
Introna 9 – Professor of Organization, Technology and Ethics at Lancaster University
(Lucas, “Ethics and the Speaking of Things,” Theory, Culture & Society 2009 vol 26 no 4, 25-46, dml)

In the ethics of hybrids our [...] letting-be of all beings.


Thus, we advocate that the United States federal government should substantially increase its messages to extraterrestrial intelligence.


The affirmative is more than action, it is acknowledgement of alterity – recognizing the Otherness of the extraterrestrial creates an existential threat for sovereign power and is critical to deconstruct anthropocentrism
Wendt and Duvall 2008 (Alexander Wendt and Raymond Duvall, Duvall is a professor of political science at U. of Minnesota, Wendt is a constructivist IR Professor at Ohio State U., June 11 2008, Political Theory, Vol. 36, No. 4, “Sovereignty and the UFO,” http://ptx.sagepub.com/content/36/4/607)

If the limits of the governmental [...] sovereignty that one must look first.


Actively encountering the extraterrestrial Other is an ontological lightning shock which allows us to acknowledge our existential finitude
Zimmerman 2 – assistant professor of religious studies, Stanford University
(Michael, “Encountering Alien Otherness”, http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/paper_zimmerman_Alien_Otherness.pdf, dml)

But Strieber, Mack, and [...] the ignorance that leads to suffering.


Humanity is a tiny speck in the history of a universe that will inevitably die – in the face of uncontrollable catastrophe and cosmic flux, ethics must enter first in your decision calculus
Clark 10 – Senior Lecturer in Geography at Open University
(Nigel, “Ex-Orbitant Generosity: Gifts of Love in a Cold Cosmos”, Parallax, Vol. 16, No. 1, Pg. 80-95, dml)

Harman has no qualms about positing [...] If not us, then who?


And, we have an obligation to assist the helpless Other even in the face of extinction
Jovanovic and Wood 4 – Communications/Rhetoric Professors @ Denver University and University of North Carolina respectively
(Spoma and Roy, “Speaking from the Bedrock of Ethics,” Philosophy and Rhetoric Vol 37 no 4, 2004, 317-334, dml)

Their framework limits out alterity – engaging the unknown is the precondition to ethical politics and should be first priority

**Our interpretation has two parts – the first is that the judge should view the resolution as a possible truth claim. If the affirmative proves this truth claim we should win. The neg can argue inherency, multiple conditional advocacies or counterfactuals, or other arguments that disprove the entirety of the truth claim.**

Modernity wrongfully tries to solve new risks with riskier, more dangerous and more complex and interdependent solutions to try to know and predict the unknowable, or stuff doubt under the rug. This “divide and conquer” approach always fails.
