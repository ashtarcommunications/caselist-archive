**Automobility Bikes**
====**Observation 1: Inherency**==== 
====Current infrastructure ideas and policies are structured around the car. Though the government has mandated more cycling infrastructure, states continue to ignore this and spatially organize for the automobile. The metropolis has become the autopolis, forcing out the bicycle.====

<span style="font-size: 10.67px;">It is more than a little ironic that Dwight Eisenhower, Nazi fighter extraordinaire, was impressed by the efficiency of the autobahn and at once incapable of recognizing its deep implications in totalitarian logic..... In addition to penning books on the subject, he used his “Sky Line” column in the //New Yorker// to wage a public battle against auto-centric planning and, more specifically, Robert Moses’s catastrophically myopic vision of New York City as a driver’s paradise.30 In 1963, he stated:</span>
====__**Plan: The United State federal government should substantially increase its investment in bicycle transportation infrastructure in the United States.**__==== 
====**Advantage: automobility**==== 
====This network of infrastructure kills space as a living area, dividing and hierarchizing it and making us further rooted in automobility in an attempt to spatially fix these cracks.====

<span style="font-size: 10.67px;">The concept of automobility—or that of the "auto social formation" or "car culture"—calls attention to the hybrid assemblage or machinic complex that the apparently autonomous entities of car and driver compose....</span> <span style="font-size: 14.67px;">__Citizens are thus coerced into a limited flexibility, creating a situation that is "a wonderful testament to the ability of a sociomaterial structure to serve its own reproduction__.</span><span class="DebateUnderline">"</span>[[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v057/57.3campbell.html#FOOT96|96]]
====We experience nothing between our starting point and destination, using this space as only a means to achieve our travel, making it into a dead zone.==== 
<span style="font-size: 10.67px;">John </span><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">Urry</span><span style="font-size: 10.67px;">, Professor of Sociology and Director of the Centre for Mobilities Research, Lancaster University; Edited by Steffen Böhm, Campbell Jones, Chris Land, and Matthew Paterson; “Inhabiting the car,” in “Against Automobility,” The Editorial Board of the Sociological Review 20</span><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">06</span><span style="font-size: 10.67px;">, p.21-22</span>
<span style="font-size: 10.67px;">Simmel makes points relevant to the nature of this inhabiting. Contra much contemporary social theory he considers that the eye is a unique ‘sociological achievement’ (Simmel, 1997: 111). ...... Morse describes the freeway not as a place but as a vector, as direction, as ‘inbetweens’ where magnitude is measured in minutes rather than miles (1998). </span>
====The separation and depersonalization of the car causes a state of diremption in which the world is seen as dead or foreign. This separation is internalized to prevent social interaction and understanding that in turn forms the basis and meaning of life.==== 
<span style="font-size: 10.67px;">(Joshua </span><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">Fischel</span><span style="font-size: 10.67px;">, Senior Project Manager at Thomson Reuters, 20</span><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">11</span><span style="font-size: 10.67px;"> “EDUCATION AFTER MODERNITY: DEWEY, DAVIDSON, AND THE PROSPECTS FOR OVERCOMING DIREMPTION”)</span>
<span style="font-size: 10.67px;">But let’s take a closer look at what happens when we emerge from a condition of diremption to a condition of love. Friedrich Hegel’s early essay on love can help us do so. According to Hegel (1948), </span>__<span style="font-size: 14.67px;">in the state of diremption, an individual exists and understands itself in a state of opposition to an objective world or “dead matter” that is distinct from itself</span>__<span style="font-size: 10.67px;"> (p. 304).....Only when the self comes to realize that the perceived separation and opposition between self and world is illusory, will it be able to overcome this alienation. </span>
====The subject of automobility is liquidated, the organization of space gives them no choices and takes them away from life.==== 
<span style="font-size: 10.67px;">Kari </span><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">Hensley</span><span style="font-size: 10.67px;">, doctoral candidate at New York University in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication, master's degree in that program as well as an undergraduate degree in the history of art from the University of California, Berkeley, March 20</span><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">10</span><span style="font-size: 10.67px;">, American Quarterly, Vol. 62 No. 1, One Nation Behind the Wheel Automobility in U.S. Culture, Project Muse, [[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v062/62.1.hensley.html]], TB</span>
The liberal ideal of the "open road" has been further troubled by the ubiquity of racialized violence and discrimination. Automobility gives a sense of variety and mobility, but __<span style="font-size: 14.67px;">the choices are prescribed and mass-produced, the routes already mapped</span>__<span class="DebateUnderline">. </span>The paradox of automobility is that it disciplines as it liberates.
====**Observation 2: Solvency**==== 
====Bicycling reconnects us with this space – time and space are balanced and speed is restrained enabling us to keep up with our movement and experience travel for what it is.==== 
<span style="font-size: 10.67px;">Zack </span><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">Furness</span><span style="font-size: 10.67px;">, Assistant Professor of Cultural Studies in the Department of Humanities, History, and Social Sciences at Columbia College Chicago, 20</span><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">10</span><span style="font-size: 10.67px;">, One Less Car: Bicycling and the Politics of Automobility, Chapter 3: Vélorutionaries and the Right to the (Bikeable) City, Project Muse, [[http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781592136148]], TB</span>
Contributing to this paradigm shift were a number of interrelated, or at least intersecting, factors, including the growth of the appropriate technology (AT) movement and its popularization through E. F. Schumacher’s //Small Is// //Beautiful,// published in 1973.96 Schumacher, one of the primary theorists of AT, elaborated a holistic critique of industrialism and the logic of progress implicit to technological development......102 Rivvy Neshama speaks clearly to the correlation between biking and the counterculture in describing the motivation for TA’s 1974 Bike-in:
====A lack of adequate infrastructure prevents widespread adoption of bicycling==== 
<span style="font-size: 10.67px;">(Zack </span><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">Furness</span><span style="font-size: 10.67px;">, Columbia College Chicago Department of Humanities, 20</span><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">10</span><span style="font-size: 10.67px;">, one less car chapter 1) </span>
<span style="font-size: 14.67px;">Bicycling</span> is not only a fringe mode of transportation in a country with more vehicles than licensed drivers; it <span style="font-size: 14.67px;">is a form of mobility rendered virtually obsolete by the material infrastructure</span>and dominant cultural norms <span style="font-size: 14.67px;">in the United States</span>......... 25
Politicizing the bicycle and its infrastructure as a tool for spatial and cultural reform rejects the current mindset of transportation.
<span style="font-size: 10.67px;">Zach </span><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">Furness</span><span style="font-size: 10.67px;">, Assistant Professor of Cultural Studies in the Department of Humanities, History, and Social Sciences at Columbia College Chicago, 20</span><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">10</span><span style="font-size: 10.67px;">, One Less Car: Bicycling and the Politics of Automobility, pg. 8-10, TB</span>
<span style="font-size: 10.67px;">Against these odds, support for bicycle transportation is growing in the United States, and so are the ranks of those drawing critical attention to the intersecting problems of auto-supported sprawl, oil reliance, and “car addiction.”43 Indeed, </span><span style="font-size: 14.67px;">__there is a distinctly political impetus spurring many of today’s bicycling advocates to challenge the institutions and__ </span><span style="font-size: 10.67px;">..... By focusing on the intersection of these issues and the myriad ways they play out through the contestation of automobility, this book not only pieces together a cultural and political map of the bicycle in the United States; it also uses the bicycle as an object with which to analyze and critique some of the dominant cultural and political formations in the so-called Western world.</span>
