When assessing the Japan-U.S. TMD project, citizens interested in government accountability and nuclear safety would do well to put stock in the old aphorism: you can’t judge a book by its cover. If historical trends continue, there is good reason to expect that the official discourse on Japanese TMD … to nuclear, chemical, or biological attack.46

The actions suggest a lack of civilian control, although after the fact they have been explained as acts of deterrence. …and difficult to control.51 At least there is improved communication between the two militaries; a hotline linking the Pentagon with the Central Military Commission was established in early 2008.

[[http://www.fpif.org/articles/arms_race_in_space]]

In fact we have just learnt that the Air Force is working on plans to develop a “counter-ASAT” …Space weapons could lead to itchy fingers on nuclear triggers. They would therefore significantly increase the importance nuclear weapon states place upon nuclear deterrence.

Space conflict leads to space debris – this causes US-Russia war – will likely coincide with early-warning false alarms – ensures immediate escalation

[[http://www.cdi.org/PDFs/scenarios.pdf]]
