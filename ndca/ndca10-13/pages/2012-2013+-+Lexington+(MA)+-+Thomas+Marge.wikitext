V: Government Obligations

VC: Public Safety

The social contract gives the government an obligation to protect the people's safety [Locke].

Crime has a large impact on public safety [FBI].

C1) Retribution deters crime, increasing public safety [Yahya cites Levitt study].

Prefer Yahya because it is a 15 year long study, including all 50 states.

C2) Deterrence is key to lower crime rates.

Deterrence stops crime before it happens.

Rehab is too late, criminal records decrease the chance of getting a job [Holzer and Raphael 06].

Sinking into poverty increases the chance of reofending [Holzman-Escareno 11].
