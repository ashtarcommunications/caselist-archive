===Plan=== 

Plan: The United States federal government should end cooperation and co-development of missile defense military presence with Japan

===China=== 

Contention one is China

Ending cooperation means that BMD won’t get developed – neither Japan nor the US will independently develop missile defense

Muse]

The 1998 launch of the North … programmes as a distinct strategic challenge.

Scenario one is missile modernization

The US and Japan are bolstering cooperation now – this new cooperation uniquely irritates China and specifically triggers Chinese anti-ship missile upgrades

Reed and Slavin 12/29 – Japan correspondent for Stars and Stripes AND staff writer for Stars and Stripes (Charlie and Erik, 12/29/10, “Admiral: China progressing on anti-carrier missile system,” http://www.stripes.com/news/admiral-china-progressing-on-anti-carrier-missile-system-1.130209)

Why are China's missiles the … scenario is becoming more plausible.

An Asian arms race causes extinction

So, is the world safer … Earth. The Clock is ticking.

INF collapse causes global nuclear war

Arbatov 7 – corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and member of the Editorial Board of Russia in Global Affairs (Alexei, July-September, “Is A New Cold War Imminent?” Russia in Global Affairs, Volume 5, Number 3, http://eng.globalaffairs.ru/number/n_9127)

Meanwhile, U.S. plans to build a missile … major capitals of the world.

Scenario two is Taiwan

China thinks that BMD would psychologically embolden Taiwanese secessionism – the technological effectiveness of BMD is irrelevant – only the political effect matters

Colonel O’Donogue, a Naval aviator who served in Operations Desert Shield, Southern Watch, and Silent Assurance, earned an M.A. in National Strategy and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College, September, http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB66.pdf,]

Extinction

THE high-intensity scenario postulates a … puts sovereignty above everything else.

China prioritizes Taiwan over all other issues, so it would wage war over it

Swaine 4 [Dr. Michael D. Swaine, Senior Associate and Co-Director of the China Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, “Trouble in Taiwan,” Foreign Affairs, March/April 2004, http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/?fa=view&id=1460]

China's leaders are under few … critics of the status quo.

Nuclear war over Taiwan is very plausible – ten reasons for miscalculation

In Roberts' assessment, there are … future military confrontation over Taiwan.

Predictions of Chinese aggression over Taiwan are irrelevant to whether China is a threat and just recognize Chinese historical perceptions

BMD in Japan breaks down deterrence – that independently causes nuclear war

Academic debates about threats result in better policy-making—real threats can be confronted

Walt 91 [Stephen, Professor of Political … of Chicago, 1991, International Studies Quarterly, p. 229-30)

A recurring theme of this … an additional avenue of influence.

Predictions of Chinese expansionism surrounding Taiwan are irrelevant to whether or not China poses a threat to the US – the 1AC just recognizes Chinese historical perceptions

Carpenter and Dorn 2k [Ted … Partner or Emerging Threat? p. Questia]

Beijing's determination to reincorporate Taiwan into some form of … Chinese as one of the most shameful chapters in Chinese history.

Our specific predictions of China don’t involve irrational threat construction – they’re rooted in Chinese domestic concerns and historical perspectives

Expert predictions of China are accurate and possible even when experts have divergent opinions – results are constant even with huge changes in assumptions – proves that predictions are good and China representations don’t shape reality

Before turning to our analysis … robust against plausible measurement errors.

Predictions and securitization of terrorism are empirically key to prevent future threats – irrational desecuritization causes terrorism and prevents public education – predictions are sometimes inaccurate only because people force themselves to stop predicting – star this card

===Counterinsurgency Neg=== 

====1NC Empirics==== 

Counterinsurgency will be effective now – all the affirmatives’ claims of COIN being bad comes from before the new resource allocation that will make it successful.

Counterterrorism is impossible without counterinsurgency – intelligence. Iraq proves.
