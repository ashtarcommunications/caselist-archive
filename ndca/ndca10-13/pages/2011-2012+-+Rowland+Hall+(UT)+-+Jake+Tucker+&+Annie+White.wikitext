**E) The alternative is to love war.**
**Instead of going to war in the name of peace, we should enter war for war’s own sake. This means setting aside our fear and distaste for conflict so we can imagine ourselves embroile cd in beautiful strife.**
**Also, the alternative comes first and is a prerequisite to aff solvency because war is the primary psychological task that shapes all of our notions about society – unless we come to terms with the war in each of us, our desire for war will lash out and push us closer and closer to annihilation.**

===Capitalism Critique=== 
**<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The plan is a last ditch effort at averting crisis by making an ‘outer spatial fix’ to resolve the core contradictions of capitalism. These endeavors inevitably fail creating an endless cycle of violence in an attempt to sustain capital.</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our alternative is to vote negative to refuse to participate in activities which support capitalism. We must hollow out capitalist structures by refusing to invest our energy in reforms and rescue operations</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 14pt;">And, method comes first. Our understandings of the ways in which society is constructed and how that affects our political imagination is a prerequisite to action or critique - any other framing mechanism makes capitalism and the case impacts inevitable.</span>**

===Astropolitics===

**<span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">The production of outer space as a sphere in which the U.S. must ensure full spectrum dominance simultaneously produces a militarization of __inner space__, or domestic politics—the politics of the aff ensures a __never-ending war__against alterity</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">The Alternative is to use the ballot as a political tool to refuse security. Only our discursive dissent can create the critical starting point necessary for breaking down oppressive systems of power premised on politics of fear and subjective control. Vote negative, not so much to imagine a world without security, but to respond to security’s totalizing attempt at power. </span>**
