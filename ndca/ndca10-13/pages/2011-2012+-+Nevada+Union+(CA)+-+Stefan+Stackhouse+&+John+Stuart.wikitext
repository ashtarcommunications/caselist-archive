**Observation 1: Universal Man**
**The dominant space narrative has already been constructed by the forces of imperialism into an exploitable frontier, and if left unchallenged, will become even more of a reality. Despite this, we still have the power to redirect the narrative with Science Fiction.**

<span class="underline">The existing discursive construction of space</span>,…<span class="underline"> anyone who cares to participate in its construction</span>


**Today capitalism and imperialism are sustained through science fiction which functions as an R and D arm of the predictions and futures industry. A bright and technocratic future is produced for capital and the west while the predictions for Africa and the oppressed are dystopic. Not only do these predictions relegate the disempowered to the past but they also have the ability to draw society toward their implementation.**

**Observation 2: Trouble on Triton**

**Bron is the epitome of the mythos of the conquistador. Tall, white, masculine, heterosexual. Under the traditional science fiction narrative, Bron would fly through the cosmos, conquering planet after planet as a curvaceous female clung to his leg and breathily cheered him on to new frontiers. Yet in Samuel R. Delany’s //Triton//****, Bron’s plight is far from the expected. Instead of playing the conqueror, Bron is used to explore imaginative possibilities outside our status quo. Only in the heterotopia can we dare to imagine a powerful white hegemon undergoing a sex change and taking on a black transsexual warrior as a lover. Exploration beyond the mesosphere creates<span style="color: black;"> a place where the agents of imperialism can be challenged and where we can encounter our limits and be transformed by the experience. We need not dwell on a triumphal utopian interpretation of this, however - we need an ambiguous look at the utopian politics of space.</span>**

**Observation 3: Space Race**

**Our discussion of the discursive constructions that make racial domination possible is key to stop it and spills over into the broader educational space. The racist disciplinary power of the debate community that marginalizes blackness can only be sustained and instituted by those within it—we all must say NO MORE and shed the chains of exclusionary white oppression.**

The attempts at educational reform are not limited… discipline its differently situated stakeholders.


**Intellectuals must map out the structures of social dominance because individual participation sustains it.**

To begin an investigation of these questions of race,… and rhetorical engagement with contemporary racism in America.

**Observation 4: Junk City**

**Debate has traditionally been the clash between the affirmatives utopian advantages and the negative’s dystopian nuclear war scenarios that ultimately results in stagnate debate and ignored assumptions. We instead offer a heterotopic alternative: Junk City.**

Q: In the dialogue with The Dispossessed, if Bron… I suppose so. It's certainly one thing I meant

**<span class="cite">The political task at hand is not to impose overarching utopian plans. Instead, we must build new structures outside of the dominant hegemonies from the discarded shards laying around us here in Junk City in order to create a new heterotopic political. </span>**

Q: I find it curious that the utopian possibilities… though it's often the engineers who provide the junk the gomi no sensei works with.


**The false choice presented by policy debate is between a static utopian plan text that seeks perfection and an anti-utopian status quo which views change as impossible. This binary leads to totalitarianism and the subordination of all life. We should reject this binary in favor of an ambiguous heterotopia**.
