In the fabled words of Tacitus, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">“</span></span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">They make a wasteland and call it peace</span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” Throughout history, counter-insurgents have often adopted some variation of the Roman method—from Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman’s March to the Sea to the far more brutal tactics adopted by the Nazis in World War II and the Soviet Union against recalcitrant ethnic minorities. Far fewer have taken their cues from the American way of COIN as described in FM 3-24. This is not to suggest that U.S. military leaders should take inspiration from Imperial Rome or Nazi Germany. But </span>__the continued evangelism of humanistic COIN threatens to convince policymakers that counterinsurgency can be done effectively, without coercion—or that there exists a simplistic choice between the Roman method and McChrystal’s predominant focus on population protection.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">And while it can be problematic to draw too narrow an historical lesson from past events, on this point the legacy of COIN is consistent. </span>__The methods for defeating an insurgency have generally been defined less by an open hand than a clenched fist. The mistaken belief that counterinsurgencies can be waged humanely risks embroiling the United States in more conflicts and weakening national security. When it comes to COIN, the best course of action for the United States is most certainly less, not more.__</span>

The focus on COIN doctrine was enshrined by__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Gen. David </span>__Petraeus__ __and the__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 2006</span> __publication of the__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Army and Marine counter-insurgency manual, </span>__FM 3-24,__ __which calls for a military approach that seeks to convince the population that counter-insurgents, acting on behalf of a sovereign government, can be trusted and are worthy of popular support__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

But </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">the veneration of COIN conceals a brutal reality. The history of counter-insurgency </span>in the twentieth century <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">is not a story of warm and fuzzy war</span>, of benevolent soldiers providing essential government services to grateful natives, of armed social work, or of the gentleman soldier’s antidote to the__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Shermanesque </span>__notion of Total War__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">Instead, counter-insurgency is a repeated tale of coercion and violence</span> directed largely against unarmed civilians__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">this defines both those COIN efforts that have been successful—and those that have failed</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Yet counter-insurgency is often described today in misleading terms. According to Mark Bowden, author of Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, COIN “embraces distinctly liberal, humanistic values like protecting civilians, cultural sensitivity, and rigid adherence to ethical standards and the law.” Others such as Max Boot, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power, have argued that </span>__the focus on counter-insurgency, in Afghanistan today, is in keeping with a grand U.S. military tradition__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: “McChrystal’s advice to embrace the population and be sparing in the use of firepower has been employed by successful counterinsurgents from the American Army in the Philippines at the turn of the twentieth century.” </span>__Even those on the left are not immune to the seductions of this new mode of American warfare__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Rachel Kleinfeld, director of the progressive–oriented Truman National Security Project, has lauded counter-insurgency for its focus on the “importance of legitimacy and privileging civilian life in order to gain hearts and minds,” a goal we are told that “progressives have been promoting for years.”</span></span>

Certainly peace and war are linked as systems of meaning—the horrors of war provide peace with its normative force—but as norms there is a vast distance between them.</span> They are like planets separated by the vacuum of space, their overlapping gravitational forces drawing every action, every policy, and every ethic in one direction or another. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">There is no ontological middle ground, no viable normative place of war/peace where the two can mesh together in a mutually enhancing exchange</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I argue this because </span>__it is just such an imagined normative harmony of war and peace that underpins the new internationalism and hides there as a new ontological claim.__ __The practical force to my argument is supplied by the fact that just as every normative argument made in this field will reinforce either war or peace, policy actions will also do so, ineluctably affecting the future possibilities for global security and conflict.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Such a practical understanding is implicit in the international system of arms control set out by the NPT, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and the now moribund Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which is structured by the need to manage and gradually eliminate the security dilemma. In this sense, the new internationalists who argue for selective/preventive counter-proliferation, while remaining silent about the U.S. administration‘s plans for missile defense and space, are literally playing with nuclear fire. As Neta Crawford argues, a preventive security doctrine ―is likely to create more of both fearful and aggressive states ...instability is likely to grow as a preventive war doctrine creates the mutual fear of surprise attack.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">‖</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">VI of the NPT, with its in junction for , embodies an insight that WMD proliferation is also driven by a desire to counter conventional military threats cheaply. This is the widely understood basis for Israeli nuclear doctrine, and it seems reasonable to see it as at least part of the rationale for the Iranian and North Korean programs. A desire for a symmetric as much as mutual deterrence drives WMD proliferation, and hence the proliferation of conventional and mass destruction weapons cannot be disentangled.</span></span>

In the run-up to the battle, the U.S. military gave up the element of surprise, practically broadcasting to the Taliban their intentions to take the town. The hope was that Taliban fighters would flee before the battle began, sparing the lives of civilians potentially caught in the crossfire. In the wake of the battle, the United States and NATO brought in both civil aid projects and what General McChrystal referred to as “government in a box.” However, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">this approach is fundamentally incongruent with the timeline of</span></span> __U.S. military <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">engagement in Afghanistan.</span> The current U.S. mission is predicated on the goal of building up the confidence of the population, providing security, and expanding the legitimacy of the government in Kabul__. But __since that government lacks basic capacity, this is a goal that cannot be accomplished in the near-term.__ Yet the clock is ticking on America’s troop presence there—President Barack Obama has made clear that U.S. forces will begin coming home in June 2011. __There seems to be a critical mismatch between strategy and tactics. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">A carrot-based approach </span>that aims to build up the confidence of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">the Afghan people</span> in the U.S. military, NATO, and their own government is the sort of mission that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">might have worked at the beginning of the war</span> in Afghanistan—<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">not eight years later</span>__. In short, __the Pentagon has chosen a mission in Afghanistan that minimizes its most obvious military advantage and accentuates practices for which it has neither the will, resources, nor core competency to implement successfully.__ Moreover, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">even by</span> the tenets laid out in <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">FM 3-24, __Afghanistan is a poor choice for__</span> __a <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">counter-insurgency</span> campaign.__ The country lacks a competent and respected host government, Afghanistan’s security services are inadequate and feared by the population, and the presence of a sanctuary for Taliban fighters across the border in Pakistan fundamentally undermines the ability of the counter-insurgency effort. Moreover, __the United States faces an intractable enemy that, particularly in the Pashtun-dominated south, has the advantage of ethnic fealty—as well as the inclination to use coercive techniques of its own__. Assassination of local leaders who resist its influence, night letters meant to sow fear in the minds of unarmed and defenseless civilians; each of these tactics is crucial to Taliban success.

Having satisfied themselves that those attempts have been unsuccessful, they </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">put</span></span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"> forward the claim that civilian immunity has nothing to do with civilians’ acts or omissions, guilt or innocence</span>, responsibility or lack of it, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">but is merely a useful convention.</span>__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is useful since it rules out targeting a large group of human beings, and thus helps reduce greatly the overall killing, mayhem, and destruction in war. </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">The consequentialist view of civilian immunity is exposed to two objections: the protection it offers to civilians is too weak, and the ground provided for it indicates a misunderstanding of the moral issue involved</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The protection is too weak because civilian immunity is understood as but a useful convention. This makes it doubly weak. First, </span>__if it is merely a useful convention, if all its moral force is due to its utility, then it will have no such force in cases where it has no utility.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is a familiar flaw of consequentialism. It denies that moral rules have any intrinsic moral significance, and explains their binding force solely in terms of the good consequences of acting in accordance with them. Therefore </span>__it cannot give us any good consequentialist reason to adhere to a moral rule in cases where adhering to it will not have the good consequences it usually has, and where better consequences will be attained by going against the rule__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.6 This means that we should respect civilian immunity when, and only when, doing so will have the good consequences adduced as its ground: when it will indeed reduce the overall killing, maiming, and destruction. On the other hand, whenever we have good reasons to believe that, by targeting civilians, we shall make a significant contribution to our war effort, thus shortening the war and reducing the overall killing and mayhem, that is what we may and indeed ought to do. </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">Civilian immunity is thus made hostage to the vagaries of war, instead of providing civilians with iron-clad protection against them. This is not a purely theoretical concern</span>.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">As Kai Nielsen has pointed out, systematic attacks on civilians in the course of a war of national liberation can make an indispensable contribution to the successful prosecution of such a war. That was indeed the case in Algeria and South Vietnam, and may well have been the case in Angola and Mozambique as well. Then again, </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">if civilian immunity is merely a useful convention, that weakens it by making it hostage to the stance taken by enemy</span> political and military leadership. They may or may not choose to respect the immunity of our civilians. If they do not, on the consequentialist view of this immunity, we are not bound to respect the immunity of their civilians.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Being a convention, it binds only if, or as long as, it is accepted by both parties to the conflict. As an important statement of this view puts it, “for convention-dependent obligations, what one’s opponent does, what ‘everyone is doing,’ etc., are facts of great moral importance. Such facts help to determine within what convention, if any, one is operating, and thus they help one discover what his moral duties are.”8 To be sure, even if no such convention is in place, but we have reason to believe we can help bring about its acceptance by unilaterally acting in accordance with it and thereby encouraging the enemy to do the same, we should do that. But if we have no good reason to believe that, or if we have tried that approach and it has failed, our military are free to kill and maim enemy civilians whenever they feel they need to do that. </span>__Thus our moral choice is determined, be it directly or ultimately, by the moral (or immoral) choice of enemy political and military leaders. So is the fate of enemy civilians. The fact that they are civilians, in itself, counts for nothing__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This brings me to the second objection: </span>__The consequentialist misses what anyone else,__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and in particular any civilian in wartime, </span>__would consider the crux of the matter__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Faced with the prospect of being killed or maimed by enemy fire, </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">a civilian would not make her case in terms of disutility of killing or</span>maiming civilians in <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">war in general, </span>or of killing or maiming her then and there. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">She would rather point out that she is </span>a__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">civilian, not a soldier; a bystander, not a participant; an </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">innocent</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not a guilty party. She would point out that </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">she has done nothing to deserve, or become liable to, such a fate</span>. She would present these personal__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">facts as considerations whose moral significance is intrinsic and decisive, rather than instrumental and </span>__fortuitous__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, mediated by a useful convention (which, in different circumstances, might enjoin limiting war by targeting only civilians). And </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">her argument, couched in personal terms, would seem to be more to the point than the impersonal calculation of good and bad </span>consequences by means of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">which the consequentialist would settle </span>the matter.__</span>

As </span>**__Bush said__** <span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">on 29 January 2002, in a speech that prefigured all the themes of his policy and exposed its underlying ontology, </span>**__History has called America__** <span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">and our allies to action, </span>**__and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom‘s fight__**<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">‘ (State of the Union Address). Jacques Derrida briefly hints at such an unlicensed‘ image of freedom in his 2005 book </span>__Rogues: Two Essays on Reason__<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">, where he writes of Plato‘s and Aristotle‘s concerns </span>__about the consequences of a demo-cracy that is founded upon both liberty and license (eleutheria and exousia), that unites people and power (demos and kratos) in a__<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">practice of freedom that is the faculty or power to do as one pleases, to decide, to </span>__choose, to determine one-self be master‘. He writes: **It has always been hard to distinguish, with regard to free will, between the good of democratic freedom or liberty and the evil of democratic license**__<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. They are hardly different.‘ (Derrida, 2005, pp. 21</span>__-__<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">22) As perceptive as this is, ancient texts cannot quite do the problem justice: we are now dealing with a demo-kratic freedom made greatly </span>__more__ <span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">powerful through the vastly expanded capacities of sovereignty, imperialism and modernity, powers made operative in the figure of the democratic-national Leviathan who nonetheless claims to embody a universal desire and will. In short, </span>**__we are dealing with a freedom that is at once liberty, license and instrumental power.__**<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">What can we say or think in the face of this - in the face of this central </span>__aporia__ <span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">of democracy and this unlicensed, instrumental and sovereign figure of freedom? For his part, Levinas wanted to put into question the good conscience‘ with which freedom operates (Levinas, 1999, p. 78). </span>**__In the wake of 9/11<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">, our critical task is not to help power seek out and destroy the enemies of freedom</span>‘__** __(as Bush put it in his address to Congress of 20 September 2001) **<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">but to question how they were constructed as enemies of freedom‘; to put into question the very categories enemies‘ and freedom‘, so that we can ask about their meaning and effect</span>.

Alternatively, it may be tempting to think that the problem </span>__is directly related to the post-9/11 crisis and the emergence of a radically hawkish and__ <span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">unilateral neo-conservatism in US policy making, and that this should be the limit of our concerns. As salient as these factors are (and without wishing to play down the serious problems created by the Administration‘s militant unilateralism), the problem of freedom that is now so visible runs much deeper, drawing on influential political and philosophical strands in western modernity (Clausewitzian strategy, Hegelian teleology, post-Renaissance secularism) and importantly, in powerful metanarratives </span>__of US exceptionalism‘ and destiny‘.**Despite its thematic intensity for** the **Bush** Presidency<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">, **the rhetoric and ontology of freedom is deep-seated in the American polity**</span> and consciousness.

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="Cite"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Using freedom as a theme for war necessitates the existence of a threat to that freedom - Bush administration deployed rhetoric framing terrorism as the direct assault upon freedom and we have a duty as a nation built on freedom to defend it - this is the primary justification for US exceptionalism which causes us to respond to threats in an overly preemptive manner and perpetuates the same insecurities that military intervention seeks to prevent.</span></span></span>

Daniel Bell argued this in 1975, after the fall of Vietnam to communism, when he described American exceptionalism as: </span>__the idea that, having been born free‘, America would, in the trials of history, get off scott fre__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">e‘. Having common political faith from the start, it would escape the ideological vicissitudes and divisive passions of the European polity, and being an entirely middle class society, without aristocracy or boheme, </span>__it would not become decadent‘, as had every other society in history.

The statement was signed by twenty-four men and one woman, including The End of History author Francis Fukuyama, tycoon Steve Forbes, former Reagan administration figures Dan Quayle, Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney, and international relations professor Aaron Friedberg. They argued that as the 20th century draws to a close</span>__, the United States stands__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">as the world‘s most preeminent power ... If we shirk our responsibilities, we invite challenges to our fundamental interests. The history of the 20th century should have taught us that it is important to shape circumstances before crises emerge, and to meet threats before they become dire. (PNAC, 3 June 1997) The echoes of Henry Luce‘s famous Life essay in the statement are uncanny. In 1941 Luce had attacked the isolationism of previous administrations by saying that whereas their nation became in the 20th century the most powerful and the most vital nation in the world, nevertheless Americans were unable to accommodate themselves spiritually and practically to that fact ... Hence they have failed to play their part as a world power*/a failure which has had disastrous consequences for themselves and for all mankind. And the cure is this: </span>__to accept wholeheartedly our duty__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">and our opportunity </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">as the most powerful and vital nation in the world</span> and in consequence to exert upon the world the full impact of our influence, for such purpose as <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">we see fit and by such means as we see fit.</span>__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">(Luce, 1941, p. 63) The New American Century It is significant is that Luce was not a neo-conservative, but a Rooseveltean internationalist, albeit one with an extremely pragmatic, realist edge who would in the 1950s and 60s become an unyielding cold war hawk (Halberstam, 1992, pp. 18- 19). This shows that </span>__whatever the important departures the Neocons‘ represent, they also draw on a longer US foreign policy tradition__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">(dating at least to the 1890s (Hietala, 1985), and felt most strongly after 1945) and beneath that, upon a nineteenth century philosophical tradition which sought to read western History as the reason-driven story of modernisation and dialectical‘ historical progress. Luce-/ a member of the influential Council on Foreign Relations, which had already initiated planning for a global post-war strategic and capitalist order dominated by the United States-/mixed a rhetoric reminiscent of the German idealist philosophers with a hard-nosed pragmatism. Arguing that the abundant life is predicated on Freedom ... a vision of Freedom under Law‘, he went on to say: </span>__It is for America__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">and for America alone </span>__to determine whether a system of free economic enterprise__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">-/an economic order compatible with freedom and progress-/</span>__shall__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">or shall not </span>__prevail__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">in this century. (Luce, 1941) The Idea of Freedom set out by Luce (and Bush after him) is strongly Hegelian, and could be said to have found its contemporary philosophical justification in the work of Francis Fukuyama (who was, not accidentally, a signatory to the 1997 PNAC statement of principles). Fukuyama‘s 1992 book The End of History and the Last Man argued that </span>__liberal democracy and global free market capitalism had triumphed over their ideological competitors (fascism and communism) and were therefore the end point of mankind‘s ideological evolution__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">... the end of history‘ (Fukuyama, 1992, p xi). Fukuyama drew this argument from Hegel (via Alexandre Koje`ve), citing his argument that History effectively ended after the Battle of Jena in 1806, because the principles on which liberalism was based could not be surpassed (p. 64). This image-/refracted through Luce‘s American century‘ essay-/is repeated in the National Security Strategy, which begins by saying that the twentieth century‘s great struggle of ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality ... is over‘: </span>__The militant visions of class, nation and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">... </span>__we will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity and liberty. The U.S. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">national security strategy will be based on</span> a distinctly <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">American internationalism that reflects</span> the union of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">our values and</span> our national <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">interests.</span>__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">(National Security Strategy, part 1; emphasis added, this phrase being Luce‘s) The source for Fukuyama‘s arguments is Hegel‘s Lectures on the Philosophy of History, which declared that History travels from East To West, for Europe is absolutely the end of History, Asia the beginning‘. Europe stood at the apex of civilisation and development, ahead of Asia (which was at the childhood of History‘) and Africa (which is merely at the threshold of the World‘s History ... still involved in the conditions of mere nature‘ (Hegel, 1990, pp. 91-99, 104, 443). There are two crucial elements of this argument for the development of American exceptionalism. One is the special role of America in Hegel‘s system, and the related image of the North American continent‘s indigenous peoples; the second is the image of freedom and the state (the political ontology of freedom) that he develops and is later entrenched into the core of the US political imagination. Presaging and buttressing the later accounts of American exceptionalism, </span>__Hegel assigned America the most privileged and exalted space__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">in History: the land of the future‘, a land of desire for all those who are weary of the historical lumber room of old Europe‘, where the original nation having vanished, or nearly so ... we witness a prosperous state of things, an increase of industry and population, civil order and firm freedom, and </span>__where the outlet of colonisation‘ remains constantly and widely open__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">, and the multitudes are continually streaming into the plains of the Mississippi‘. Here, in 1822, was a prophecy of the doctrine that would become manifest destiny, where Hegel‘s praise for the subjective unity‘ of the republican constitution, the universal protection for property‘ and the endeavour of the individual after acquisition, commercial profit, and gain‘ mingled with descriptions of the passionless disposi- tion‘, want of spirit‘, crouching submissiveness‘, and inferiority in all respects‘ of the native Americans‘ (Hegel, 1990, pp. 80-87). A more accurate account of what this meant, in human and historical terms, can be found in a letter written by Civil War General William Tecumsah Sherman to another hero of the American west, Buffalo Bill: In my estimation there were around nine and a half million buffalo on the plains between the Missouri and the Rocky mountains in 1862. They have all disappeared, killed for their meat, hides and bones ... At that time there were about 165,000 Pawnees, Sioux, Cheyenne, Kiowa and Apaches, who annually depended upon these buffalo for food. They‘re also gone and have been replaced by two to three times that number of men and women of the white race, who have turned this land into a garden and who can be counted, taxed and governed according to the laws of nature and of civilization. This change has been beneficial and will be carried to the very end. (cited in Clastres, 1998, p. 58) Bush‘s Inauguration address, while briefly acknowledging the shameful history of slavery, said nothing about this massively enabling history of murder, dispossession and genocide without which Bush and the PNAC could not speak of American greatness‘ and success‘ (PNAC, Statement of Principles). Even Fukuyama, in the conclusion to his book, resorted to a naı¨vely chilling use of the western settler- conquest metaphor, saying that mankind will come to seem like a long wagon train strung out along a road‘: some wagons will be pulling into town sharply and crisply‘, others stuck in ruts in the final pass over the mountains‘, and still others, attacked by Indians, will have been set aflame and abandoned along the way‘. But despite these travails, all the wagons will eventually pull into town, and history will vindicate its own rationality‘ (Fukuyama, 1992, p. 339). What makes Bush‘s politics possible, and the neo-Hegelian triumphalism that is its intimate cousin, </span>__is the recycling of a birth myth based on forgetting ... not merely of this history, but of more recent US moral and geopolitical failures such as the use of nuclear weapons against Japan or the Vietnam war__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">. Vietnam in particular was a conflict that occasioned a massive bout of national introspection. </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">The overwhelming sense that the war had punctured American myths of innocence</span> and exceptionalism <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">was the dominant trope</span> in major histories of the war:__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">Stanley Karnow wrote that with the young men who died in Vietnam died the dream of an ―American century</span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">‖</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">‘, and Daniel Bell, in his 1975 Public Interest essay The End of American Exceptionalism‘, wrote that there is no longer a manifest destiny or mission. We have not been immune to the corruption of power ... Our mortality now lies before us‘ (Karnow, 1983, p. 9; Bell, 1975 p. 205; see also Burke, 1999). Yet after 9/11 it was as if nothing had happened. Rather, for Bush, it was as if our entire country looked into a mirror and saw our better selves‘ (State of the Union Address, 29 January 2002). </span>__This is certainly true of the heroism shown by Americans after the attacks,__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">but was it right to imagine the entire nation and its history in such a way, and what kind of knowledge does it close off? Why could Osama bin Laden, in a 1998 ABC interview, attempt to justify his criminal targeting of Americans and Jews by saying: </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">American history does not distinguish between civilians and military,</span> and not even women and children‘? Citing the bombing of Nagasaki, the massacres of Palestinians in Lebanon, and the deaths of a million children in Iraq__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">, he argued that </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">we believe that the biggest thieves in the world and the terrorists are the Americans</span>. The only way for us to fend off these assaults is to use similar means.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">(Miller, 1998) As wrong as this is, it must be acknowledged that someone put this logic into the world. It did not spring fully formed from Bin Laden‘s head; it is, sad to say, not a new historical possibility. However if there is to be a new American century, America must be innocent. And nothing is so dangerous as wounded innocence.</span></span>

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="Cite"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Protection of freedom requires constant challenges to its security - freedom can only be deployed as a tactic by the state in its absence - this logic necessitates constant and endless violence and threats to the soveirgn - and coupled with US exceptionalism causes us to constantly engage in militaristic response to constructed security images.</span></span></span>

The result was that meaning and meaningfulness were transformed into ends‘: this is what happened when Marx took the Hegelian meaning of all history-/</span>__the progressive unfolding and actualisation of the idea of freedom__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">-/</span>__to be an end of human action__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">, and when he furthermore, in accordance with tradition, viewed this ultimate end‘ as the end-product of a manufacturing process ...

(Arendt, 1961, pp. 78-79) With hindsight, we can see that Marx was not the only thinker to understand or posit an end to history (Hegel and Koje`ve did, and Fukuyama after them) and the irony and tragedy is that this end should have been proclaimed in the defeat of socialism and the triumph of liberal-democratic‘ civilisation based on US example and leadership (Fukuyama, 1992). This is the meaning of Fukuyama‘s signature on the PNAC Statement of Principles, a document utterly infused with the grandiose aims‘ of an enframing technological reason masquerading as historical inevitability. Thus we can understand how George W. Bush could follow the invasion of Iraq with the announcement of a forward strategy of freedom in the Middle-East‘, a strategy apparently in the tradition of Wilson‘s fourteen points and Roosevelt‘s four freedoms that requires the same persistence and energy and idealism we have shown before. And it will yield the same results. As in Europe, as in Asia, as in every region of the world, the advance of freedom leads to peace. (Bush, Remarks at the National Endowment for Democracy, 6 November 2003) </span>__This links with a further crucial feature of freedom in the American enlightenment: its Eurocentric and Orientalist nature. Freedom is something the East lacks, and it will be achieved not by the agency of its own people,__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">or the upwelling of some genuinely universal human aspiration, </span>__but by the particular application of American pressure and force.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">The seeds of this view can be glimpsed in Aristotle‘s distinction between Greece‘s love of freedom‘ and Asia‘s despotism, but it was given a distinctively racist and dialectical cast in Hegel‘s system which declared that Africa was at the mere threshold‘ of history, and China at its childhood‘, while Europe was at its end (Hegel, 1990, pp. 104-05). Now America, history‘s future‘ according to Hegel, is to bring the Middle-East into history, into the freedom that is the direction of history‘ and the design of nature‘. Yet </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">the first act in America‘s forward strategy of freedom‘ was to</span> invade and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">subjugate Iraq,</span>suggesting that if peace‘ is its object its means is war__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">: the engine of History is violence, </span>__on a massive and tragic scale, and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">violence is</span> ultimately<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">its only meaning</span>.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">This we can glimpse in Toward a Pacific union‘, a deeply disingenuous chapter of Fukuyama‘s The End of History and the Last Man. This text divides the earth between a post-historical‘ world of affluent developed democracies where the old rules of power-politics have decreasing relevance‘, and a world still stuck in history‘ and riven with a variety of religious, national and ideological conflicts‘. The two worlds will maintain parallel but separate existences‘ and interact only along axes of threat, disturbance and crucial strategic interest: oil, immigration, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

As Bin Laden said in his chilling 1998 interview with John Miller, who asked him if his fatwa‘ calling on all Muslims to kill Americans extended to all Americans: We are surprised this question is coming from Americans. Each action will solicit a similar reaction. We must use such punishment to keep your evil away from Muslims ... America does not have a religion that prevents it from destroying all people. ... The prophet said: A woman entered hell because of a cat‘. She did not feed it and blocked it from finding food on its own. She is going to hell for blocking a cat to death, but [what do you] say to those who agreed and gave reason for the hundreds of thousands of troops to blockade millions of Muslims in Iraq? (Miller, 1998b) Furthermore the rhetoric of freedom and the way of life‘, at both a philosophical and practical level, cannot but inflame the fundamentalist community that serves as a social and cultural basis for al-Qaeda and its associated organisations. It will do so because it is read as a confirmation of the critique*/found in the philosophy of thinkers such as Sayyid Qutb*/of the moral and ethical bankruptcy of western rationalism and its imperialist agenda to dominate and destroy Islam, to perpetuate a state of modern jahiliyya, the conscious usurpation of God‘s authority ... [the] foundational transgression of human hubris‘ (Euben, 2000). </span>__The narrative of freedom that Bush speaks__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">(and the US armed forces enact) </span>__has already been written and interpreted in fundamentalist thought,__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">with a starkly different meaning from that Bush seeks to convey, one </span>__further transformed by every American action in Iraq__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">and throughout the Middle-East. The Bush Administration‘s April 2004 endorsement*/in pointed defiance of countless UN resolutions on the issue*/of the Israeli government‘s unilateral plan under the guise of disengagement‘ to impose a grossly unjust final settlement‘ on the Palestinians, one that will undermine any possibility of meaningful self-determination, is just such an example of arrogance and hubris that will deepen Islamic hatred of the West and rebound upon it in new acts of terror (MacAskill, 2004, p. 1). </span>__This US gesture__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">, portrayed throughout the Arab world as a new Balfour declaration‘</span>__, is yet another example of the callous, strategic‘ use of instrumental reason that treats the Palestinian people as so much human cattle who can be contained and corralled, and whose destiny can be decided by a handful of men in Jerusalem and Washington__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">(Howeidy, 2004; see also Katib, 2004; Alpher, 2004; Beilin, 2004). </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">The arguments of Bin Laden and Bush have one important thing in common: they betray the same deluded,</span> claustrophobic <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">commitment to the easy translation of means into ends</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">, as if either of their policies could protect Muslims, ensure the security of Americans, or bring about the utterly irreconcilable ends‘ of history they seek ( Freedom‘ fights the Caliphate‘, like Punch and Judy dolls squabbling on the arms of History).

In the spirit of Levinas and Arendt*/but perhaps also beyond them*/I would argue that </span>__the limits to freedom must come from nature__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">, the world, the Other; </span>__from the infinite plurality of human society and aspiration within the natural structures that contain them and interact with their social and technological processes so unpredictably.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">If freedom is to exist, if it is to have any kind of positive value, and if it is to be a measure of being, it must be rethought as relationship and responsibility. As Jean-Luc Nancy writes in The Experience of Freedom: Freedom cannot be presented as the autonomy of a subjectivity in charge of itself and its decisions, evolving freely and in permanent independence from every obstacle. What would such an independence mean, if not the impossibility of entering into the slightest relation*/and therefore of exercising the slightest freedom? (Nancy, 1993, p. 66) In short, </span>__freedom arises only in relationships of interconnection, mutual dependence and responsibility, not in separation, control or mastery.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">Freedom, at its most naked and unborn, is a wish sent into a space of existence; a simplistic, childlike hunger growing in a space of complexity and life. It is this space‘ that is most important. Who lives there? What do we all want, in our tension and complexity? How do we adjudicate, mediate, and meet our diverse and so often conflicting claims? How is justice also to live there, in tension, in dialogue, in partnership with freedom? Here we encounter some difficult dilemmas. Firstly, how do we promote human emancipation, and sustainable relationships with others and the environment, when human and/or natural claims and aspirations clash?13 Should freedom be plural and differentiated at the same time as it is universal? </span>__How is conflict to be mediated and resolved to work for freedom, a plural freedom, without being thought as a contradiction‘ that can be dialectically‘ resolved into a higher end or suffocating unity that contains the seeds of new conflict__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">? Secondly, how can we think a limited freedom to act when modern action is, as Arendt (1998, p. 230) argued, </span>__perpetually dangerous and unpredictable yet remains one of the most decisive human experiences‘ without which freedom cannot be possible__<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">? In short, we must ask who and what lives and hopes in the space of freedom, how we interact, and how our actions affect how we might interact. Who lives there are other people, other animals, other forms of matter and life: the societies and ecosystems that sustain and limit us. Complexity and contingency, plural and contested meanings, inhabit and fissure this space, and freedom must learn to accept the uncertainty that comes with it. Arendt argues that </span>__modernity reduced action to making‘ in order to reduce its uncertainty and save human affairs from their frailty‘,__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">yet cautioned that action has no end‘. We are not able to undo or even control reliably any of the process we start through action‘-/uncertainty is its product. She suggests that </span>__the traditional attempt to evade this burden of irreversibility and unpredictability‘ by identifying sovereignty with freedom is no answer, because the result would not so much be sovereign domination of oneself as arbitrary domination of all others‘.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 12px;">The result would be both unjust and meaningless: no man can be sovereign because not one man, but men, inhabit the earth‘. Conversely, any aspiration toward omnipotence always implies-/apart from utopian hubris-/the destruction of plurality‘ (Arendt, 1998, pp. 230-34, 202). In a profound meditation on power in The Human Condition, Arendt argues that plurality-/ the living together of people‘-/is the very condition of freedom, of human power‘. Plurality is its condition and its only limitation‘ (Arendt, 1998, p. 201). Such a recognition of plurality-/a plurality which I would expand from Arendt‘s more limited definition to take in different people, genders, races, religions, nations, sexualities and cultures-/points us towards profound ways of thinking freedom ethically. A plurality that must be further radicalised, in ways that Arendt could not quite conceive, beyond the human so that it takes in animals, plants, ecosystems, so that our terrible ability to act into nature, to turn humans into nature, product and resource simultaneously, is matched by responsibility for that action and possibility (Arendt, 1998, pp. 200-50; Wadiwel, 2002). It is in this sense that the Bush Administration‘s rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, its doctrine of preventive force and fundamentalist belief in the transformative power of war, and its stunning disregard for the daily suffering of millions, are so paradigmatic of an irresponsible exercise of freedom thrown in the very face of creative efforts to recognise and limit the destructive character of modern action and global processes. It is not as if we do not possess the resources and ability to develop such understandings of responsible freedom and contingent action-/in the spheres of the global environment, political economy and security, among others, existing discussions and efforts to organise show valuable evidence of the sensibility I am arguing for here. They need to be cultivated, refined and, most importantly, mobilised at the highest and most potentially destructive levels of politics and organisational power. What this essay has sought to suggest, above all, is that </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">the problem for us does not merely lie with one group of men, one government, or one state.

The implications of that review reverberate through-out the entire mode of thought, demanding a reappraisal as fundamental as the reappraisal ontology has demanded of philosophy. With ontology at issue, the entire foundations or underpinnings of any mode of thought are rendered problematic. This applies as much to any modern discipline of thought as it does to the question of modernity as such, with the exception, it seems, of science, which, having long ago given up the ontological questioning of when it called itself natural philosophy, appears now, in its industrialized and corporatized form, to be invulnerable to ontological perturbation. With its foundations at issue, the very authority of a mode of thought and the ways in which it characterizes the critical issues of freedom and judgment (of what kind of universe human beings inhabit, how they inhabit it, and what counts as reliable knowledge for them in it) is also put in question.</span>__ The very ways in which<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">Nietzsche, Heidegger, and other continental philosophers challenged Western ontology</span>, simultaneously, therefore reposed the fundamental and inescapable difficulty, or aporia, for human being of decision and judgment. __<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In other words, </span>__whatever ontology you subscribe to__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, knowingly or unknowingly,</span>__ as a human being you still have to act. Whether or not you know or acknowledge it, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">the ontology you subscribe to will construe the problem of action</span> for you in one</span>
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">way rather than another. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">You may think ontology is some arcane question of philosophy, but</span> Nietzsche and Heidegger showed that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">it intimately shapes not only a way of thinking, but a way of being, a form of life.</span>__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Decision, a fortiori political decision, in short, is no mere technique. It is instead a way of being that bears an understanding of Being, and of the fundaments of the human way of being within it. This applies, indeed applies most, to those mock -innocent political slaves who claim only to be technocrats of decision making.</span></span>

**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">The creation of Fascism is organized in the social field, determined by each individual. There is no transcendent point or monolithic being with eyes and a mouth and an AK that is War - at a very real level the state, Iraq, and the breath in my lungs all co-exist on a flat plane. In this sense, the ways fascism resonates in the social field is the most important determinate of war. It is not about the destination, but the journey. How we come to the conclusion of war and fascism is only as important as why any given individual would want to murder a brown person in a far away land. Ignoring the desire for war causes fascism to continue unabated, creating an imperialism within all of us that replicates destructive tendencies - a form of self-denying desire that seeks to abolish itself, whether through incremental repression or, once it resonates into the totalitarian state, mass suicide and butchery

Doubtless, fascism invented the concept of the totalitarian State, but there is no reason to define fascism by a concept of its own devising: there are totalitarian States, of the Stalinist or military dictatorship type, that are not fascist. The concept of the totalitarian State applies only at the macropolitical level, to a rigid segmentarity and a particular mode of totalization and centralization.</span>__ __But <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">fascism is inseparable from a proliferation of molecular focuses in interaction, which skip from point to point, before beginning to resonate together in the National Socialist State. Rural fascism and city or neighborhood fascism</span>,__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> youth fascism and war veteran's fascism, fascism of the Left and fascism of the Right, fascism of the couple, family, school, and office</span>__: every fascism is defined by a micro-black hole that stands on its own and communicates with the others, before resonating in a great, generalized central black hole__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">.1' There is fascism when a </span>//war machine// <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">is installed in each hole, in every niche. Even after the National Socialist State had been established, microfascisms persisted that gave it unequaled ability to act upon the "masses." Daniel Guerin is correct to say that </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">if Hitler took power, rather then taking over the German State administration, it was because from the beginning he had at his disposal microorganizations giving him "an unequaled, irreplaceable ability to penetrate every cell of society," in other words, a molecular and supple segmentarity, flows capable of suffusing every kind of cell. Conversely, if capitalism came to consider the fascist experience as catastrophic, if it preferred to ally itself with Stalinist totalitarianism, which from its point of view was much more sensible and manageable, it was because the segmentarity and centralization of the latter was more classical and less fluid. What makes fascism dangerous is its molecular or micropolitical power, for it is a mass movement: a cancerous body rather than a totalitarian organism</span>__**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">.</span>**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> American film has often depicted these molecular focal points; band, gang, sect, family, town, neighborhood, vehicle fascisms spare no one. </span>__Only microfascism provides an answer to the global question: Why does desire desire its own repression, how can it desire its own repression? The masses certainly do not passively submit to power; nor do they "want" to be repressed, in a kind of masochistic hysteria; nor are they tricked by an ideological lure. Desire is never separable from complex assemblages that necessarily tie into molecular levels, from microformations already shaping postures__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">, attitudes, perceptions, </span>__expectations, semiotic systems, etc. Desire is never an undifferentiated instinctual energy, but itself results from a highly developed, engineered setup rich in interactions:__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> a whole supple segmentarity that processes molecular energies and potentially gives desire a fascist determination.

</span>**What does control mean, what is fascism, why do two kids from the Draper ‘burbs continue to talk about philosophy?** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">

</span>**Debate has evolved into hopeless political statements and predictions that can never be actualized – we understand that as a limit; and we want to break away. We want to use this time as a space to create structure and flows open for the examination of military occupation and fascism, and why our desire for security and power has the capability to dominate every social, political, and academic sphere.** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">

</span>**We are interested in the current resolution so that we can learn how pedagogical fascism in both the military and in debate organizes form of discussion and democracy in the present.** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">

</span>**We are using this speech act to problematize military presence and occupation. We agree with an overall decrease in presence, but we also think that ignoring the journey and desire that led to acceptance and proliferation of war can only lead to a re-enactment of all scenarios that the affirmative or negative could ever postulate.** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">

</span>**We have two internal links to support our argument –**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">



</span>**Realization One is Security:** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">
</span>**All I’ve heard my entire life is the instability of the world – muslims coming to kill me, Kim Jong Ill launching nukes at me, Russia invading Sarah Palin’s neighborhood. All of this time, I was being convinced that there is something out there trying to get me – and for what? This topic is probably right, probably justified, yet it calls for action without justification – our incentive for war and imperialism will continue unabated unless we evaluate our desire for security.** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">

</span>**As we come to view chaos and disorder as more harms to solve, we are willing to do worse and worse things to the world to preserve our stasis. Though we may achieve some degree of safety through the production of the desire for fascism, it comes at the cost of mass violence against anything and everything viewed as dangerous which, ultimately is everything in life. The end result is a suicidal drive to purity life that consumes even those that seek security.**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">

In confronting and finally overturning the Oedipal rock on which Man has chosen to take his stand, </span>//Anti-Oedipus// <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">comes as a kind of sequel to another similar venture, the attack on Christ, Christianity, and the herd in Nietzsche's </span>//The AntiChrist.// <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">For who would deny, AntiOedipus begins, that psychoanalysis was from the start, still is, and perhaps always will be a well-constituted church and a form of treatment based on a set of beliefs that only the very faithful could adhere to, ie., those who believe in a security that amounts to being lost in the herd and defined in terms of common and external goals?

Such a set of beliefs, Deleuze and Guattari demonstrate, such a herd instinct, is based on the desire to be led, the desire to have someone else legislate life. </span>__The very desire that was brought so glaringly into focus in Europe with Hitler, Mussolini, and fascism; the desire that is still at work, making us all sick, today**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">.</span>**__ //Anti-Oedipus// <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">starts by reviving Reich's completely serious question with respect to the rise of fascism: </span>__'How could the masses be made to desire their own repression__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">?' This is a question which the English and Americans are reluctant to deal with directly, tending too often to respond: "Fascism is a phenomenon that took place elsewhere, something that could only happen to others, but not to us; it's </span>//their// <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">problem." Is it though</span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__?__ </span>**__Is <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">fascism really a problem for others to deal with? Even revolutionary groups deal gingerly with the fascisizing elements we all carry deep within us, and yet they often possess a rarely analyzed but overriding group 'superego' that leads them to state</span>,__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">much like Nietzsche's man of ressentiment, </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that the other is evil (the Fascist! the Capitalist! the Communist!), and hence that they themselves are good. This conclusion is reached as an afterthought and a justification, a supremely self-righteous rationalization for a politics that can only "squint" at life, through the thick clouds of foul-smelling air that permeates secret meeting places and "security" councils. The man of ressentiment,</span>__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">as Nietzsche explains</span>__, "<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">loves hiding places, secret paths and back doors, everything covert entices him as his world, his security, his refreshment; he understands how to keep silent</span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> how not to forget, how to wait, how to be provisionally self-deprecating and humble."? Such a man, Nietzsche concludes, needs very much to believe in some neutral, independent "subject"-the ego-for he is prompted by an instinct of self-affirmation and self-preservation that cares little about preserving or affirming life, an instinct "in which every lie is sanctified.?" This is the realm of the silent majority. And it is into these back rooms, behind the closed doors of the analyst's office, in the wings of the Oedipal theater, that Deleuze and Guattari weave their way, exclaiming as does Nietzsche that it smells bad there, and that what is needed is "a breath of fresh air, a relationship with the outside world."</span>__In examining the problem of the subject, the behind-the-scenes reactive and reactionary man, Anti-Oedipus develops an approach that is decidedly diagnostic__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">("What constitutes our sickness today?")</span> __and profoundly healing as well. What it attempts to cure us of is the cure itself.__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Deleuze and Guattari term their approach "schizoanalysis," which they oppose on every count to psychoanalysis. Where the latter measures everything against neurosis and castration, schizoanalysis begins with the schizo, his breakdowns and his breakthroughs. For, they affirm, "a schizophrenic out for a walk is a better model than a neurotic lying on the analyst's couch...." </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Against the Oedipal and oedipalized territorialities</span>__ __(Family, Church, School, Nation, Party), <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and especially the territoriality of the individual, Anti-Oedipus seeks to discover the "deterritorialized" flows of desire, the flows that have not been reduced to the Oedipal codes and the neuroticized territorialities, the desiringmachines that escape such codes as lines of escape leading elsewhere.</span>__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Much like R. D. Laing, Deleuze and Guattari aim to develop a materialistically and experientially based analysis of the "breakdowns" and the "breakthroughs" that characterize </span>//some// <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">of those labeled schizophrenic by psychiatry. </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Rather than view the creations and productions of desire-all of desiring-production-from the point of view of the norm and the normal, they force their analysis into the sphere of extremes. From paranoia to schizophrenia, from fascism to revolution, from breakdowns to breakthroughs, what is investigated is the process of life flows as they oscillate from one extreme to the other, on a scale of intensity that goes from 0 ("I never asked to be born ... leave me in peace"), the body without organs, to the nth power ("I am all that exists, all the names in history"), the schizophrenic process of desire**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">//.//</span>**</span>__

</span>**The Second Realization is Binary production:**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">

</span>**This neglect of how the masses desired war or advocated imperialist actions neglects the very biological roots of fascism, especially in a key field of academia where we can create change.** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">
</span>**Why is it we insist that the one who is the most narrow minded, the one that reads the most impact turns, makes the most narrow framework, doesn’t concede anything wins debate?** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">

</span>**Our affirmation is meaningful in that it challenges the dominant hegemonic order of the state and its ability to control both thought and action. We criticize a capital-S State – not necessarily the USFG, but the ideology of imperialism which seeks to expand centralized power at the expense of free spaces. Our affirmation of the rhizome and speech is an action against State fascism. We are against divisions and articulations of place and order. We affirm instead a politics of continuation – of constantly seeking new political outlets and investigating their potential. In this sense, our affirmation is one which cannot be tied down or controlled – we move beyond the simple binary of beginning and ends and seek to explore the vast middle ground of infinite possibilities** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">

In the field of play Deleuze and Guattari often produce hybrid, even viral connections and downplay the presence of genealogies conveyed in the figure of the tree bearing a stock-like trunk. </span>__Rhizomatic connections form open territories that are not constricted by the enclosing frame of a rigid borderline.__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> In the same breath the two philosophers argue for ‘smooth’ spaces of circulation.

It is as anarchists of sorts and with an insistence on aesthetic paradigms that Deleuze and Guattari argue for making connections and for an ongoing smoothing of striated spaces. In the pages to follow, I will argue that today the problem of borders and barriers is as acute as ever. I will probe how Deleuze and Guattari’s findings on rhizomes and smooth spaces elaborated in a post-1968, European, context might work today in a changed world-space. Is the struggle still between a paternal, bourgeois state and its subjects? Are the state and its institutions still targeted in the same way? Is the undoing of the subject – often through aesthetics – still valid, or is there a need for a more situated subject? We will first rehash the Deleuzian concepts of rhizome and smooth space before investigating whether and how these concepts are operative in the contemporary world. Since 1968, the world has undergone many changes. </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Over the last few decades, decolonisation, transportation, and electronic revolutions have transformed the world.

They are producing multiple crossings of external borders that in many places have resulted in local resistance and, in reaction, to the erection of more internal borders that inflect new striated spaces in the form of racism and immigration policy. The ultimate goal for the utopian thinker espousing the cause of rhizomatic thinking is smooth space that would entail the erasure of all borders and the advent of a global citizenry living in ease and without the slightest conflict over religion or ideology. </span>__In the transitional moment in which we find ourselves arguing for smooth space can easily lead to a non-distinction between alternative spaces in which goods and currencies circulate to the detriment of the world at large.__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">To account for the transformation specifically of the state and its subjects in a global world, I will argue by way of recent writings by Etienne Balibar for the continued importance of rhizomatic connectivity and also for a qualified notion of smooth space. </span>__Striated spaces will have to be continually smoothed so that national borders would not simply encircle a territory<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. Borders would have to be made more porous and nationality disconnected from citizenship so as to undo striated space inside the state by inventing new ways of being in common.

Their focus on space reappears at the very time Cartesian philosophies undergo radical changes due to the acceleration of new technologies and rapid globalisation. Many thinkers – Henri Lefebvre, Michel de Certeau, Jean Baudrillard, Paul Virilio – condemn what they perceive as the increasing encroachment of technologies that quickly replace more traditional ways of being in the world. People who find themselves out of synch with their environment urge recourse to the body and new ways of using language. Deleuze and Guattari insert themselves into that line of thinking. Their criticism of the static order is twofold. </span>__They criticise an inherited spatial model defined by vertical orderings that has dominated the West. In that model, space was considered to be pre-existing. It became a simple décor for human action. Deleuze and Guattari propose__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> not only </span>__a criticism of the static model__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> but also invent an entirely new way of thinking space. </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">They propose a more horizontal</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> – and, paradoxically, if seemingly two-dimensional, even more spatial – </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">thinking</span>__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">of the world </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in terms of rhizomatic lines and networks</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. In accordance with Deleuze and Guattari’s way of thinking through connections</span>__, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the two regimes always coexist in an asymmetrical relation. They can never be entirely separated or opposed</span>.__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> In ‘Rhizome’, first published in French in 1976 and translated into English as ‘On the Line’, Deleuze and Guattari claim that for several hundred years it was believed that the world was developing vertically in the shape of a tree (Deleuze and Guattari 1983). </span>__The__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> choice of a </span>__tree limits possibilities. The mature tree is already contained in the seed__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. There is some leeway as to form and size, but </span>__the seed will become nothing more than the tree that it is destined to be.__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> In lieu of the tree, </span>__Deleuze and Guattari propose__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> an adventitious network, </span>__a mobile structure__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> that can be </span>__likened to__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> underground filaments of grass or the mycelia of </span>__fungi. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">A rhizome moves horizontally and produces offshoots</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> from multiple bifurcations at its meristems. </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">It changes its form by connecting and reconnecting. It does not have a finite or ultimate shape. Space does not pre-exist</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> the rhizome; rather, </span>__it <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is created through and between the proliferating lines. Rhizomes</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> connect and </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">open spaces in-between which, in the rooted world of the tree, an inside</span>__ __(the earth<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">) is separated from an outside</span>__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(the atmosphere). Unlike the tree, </span>__the rhizome can never be fixed or reduced to a single point or radical core__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Its movement is contrasted with the stasis of the arborescent model. In ‘Rhizome’ </span>__the vertical, arborescent model contributes to the creation of striated spaces__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. In the ebullient imagination of the two authors it appears that </span>__the latter slow down and even prevent movement of the kind they associate with emancipation and creativity__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Instead of imitating a tree, Deleuze and Guattari exhort their readers to make connections by following multiple itineraries of investigation, much as a rhizome moves about the surface it creates as it goes. </span>__Rhizomes form a territory that is neither fixed nor bears any clearly delimited borders.__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">In addition to this novel way of thinking, rhizomatically, the philosophers make further distinctions between smooth and striated spaces. </span>__Smooth spaces allow optimal circulation and favour connections. Over time, however, smooth spaces tend to become striated. They lose their flexibility. Nodes and barriers appear that slow down circulation__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> and reduce the number of possible connections. Writing </span>//<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Anti-Oedipus</span>//<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> in a post-1968 climate, </span>__Deleuze and Guattari propose rhizomatic connections that continually rearticulate smooth space in order not only to criticise bourgeois capitalism with its institutions – the family, school, church, the medical establishment (especially psychiatry) – but also to avoid what they see as a deadened or zombified state of things.__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> They criticise the state for erecting mental and social barriers and for creating oppositions instead of furthering connections. </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Institutions and the state are</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> seen as the </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">villains that control and immobilize people from the top down</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. They argue that when the family, the church or the ‘psy’ instill guilt in a child, mental barriers and borders are erected. The child’s creativity, indeed its mental and physical mobility are diminished in the process. Such a condition cripples many adults who have trees growing in their heads. Deleuze and Guattari cite the example of Little Hans, a child analysed by Freud and whose creativity, they declare, was blocked by adults who wrongly interpreted his attempts to trace lines of flight within and through the structure of the family into which he had been born (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 14). </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The state, too, functions by ordering, organizing and arresting movement, by creating relations of inclusion and exclusion. The state facilitates the creation of rigid and often ossified institutions</span>____.__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> It enacts laws of inclusion and exclusion that order the family and the social in general. </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">It tries to immobilize and dominate the social world.

In </span>//<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Anti-Oedipus</span>//<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">, the philosophers show how institutions like the family and psychiatry repress sexuality and desire in order to maximize their revenue. They argue for the creation of smooth spaces where desire can circulate freely. In </span>//<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">A Thousand Plateaus</span>//<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">, the bourgeois state ordered by the rules of capitalism is criticised. Deleuze and Guattari rarely contexualise the ‘state’ in any specific historical or political terms. Constructing a universal history of sorts, the philosophers note that the state apparatus appears at different times and in different places. This apparatus is always one of capture. It appropriates what they call a ‘nomadic war machine’ that never entirely disappears. The nomadic war machine eludes capture and traces its own lines of flight. It makes its own smooth spaces. Here Deleuze and Guattari have faith in </span>__‘<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">subjects’ who undermine control by creating new lines of flight. These subjects deviate from the dominant order that uses ‘order-words’ to obtain control. Order-words produce repetitions and reduce differences. They produce molar structures and aggregates that make it more difficult for new lines to take flight.</span> Yet something stirs, something affects a person enough to make her or him deviate from the prescriptive meanings of these words.__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Deleuze and Guattari would say that the subject molecularises the molar structures imposed by the state. </span>__People continually trace new maps and invent lines of flight that open smooth spaces. Deleuze and Guattari call it a ‘becoming-revolutionary’ of the people.__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">In 1980, the philosophers also claim that </span>__humans inaugurate an age of becoming-minoritarian. The majority, symbolized by the 35-year-old, white__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">, working </span>__male__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">, they declare, </span>__no longer prevails. A new world is opening__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">, a world </span>__of becoming-minoritarian in which women, Afro-American, post-colonial and queer subjects of all kinds put the dominant order into variation. Changes of this nature occur at the limit of mental and social territories, from unstable borders without any clearly defined division between inside and outside. They occur in and through affects, desire and language. For Deleuze and Guattari, becoming-minoritarian must be accompanied by a withering of the state and its institutions without which any generalized transformation would be impossible.__ <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Thought they make clear in ‘Rhizome’ that the connections they advocate are different from those of computers that function according to binary oppositions, the philosophers keep open the possibilities of transformations of subjectivities by means of technologies (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 475</span>__).Deleuze and Guattari__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> are keenly aware both of the ways that technologies transform subjectivities </span>//<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">and</span>//<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> of writing in a postcolonial, geopolitical context. Nonetheless, they </span>__write about the state in a rather general and even monolithic way without specifically addressing a given ‘nation-state’. It is as if the real villain were a general European concept of state inherited from the romantic age. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The institutional apparatus of the state</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> dominates and orders its subjects, preventing them from being creative or pursuing their desires.

</span>**We must remove ourselves from institutions of power and the little desire inside to beg for its control. Instead we should use this site of contestation as a beginning to struggle against fascism. Fascism is organized in the social field, determined by each individual. There is no transcendent point or monolithic being with eyes and a mouth and a chainsaw that single-handedly calls for us to destroy the oceans - at a very real level the state, energy, and the breath in my lungs all co-exist on a flat plane – in this sense political resistance can look any way at all. In this sense we cannot be dismissed as "merely" speaking, that the way we engage in debate has very real implications: even if we don't know what they are, even if only for us. Even if there is no one around to hear it, even if there are no Oil Barrens in this room, even if we are not actually making policy, even if this is JUST a debate round, it still has effects on us and on our life-world that have potential to be negative or blissfully joyous.** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">

</span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">During the years 1945-1965</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (I am referring to Europe), </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">there was a certain way of thinking correctly, a certain style of political discourse, a certain ethics of the intellectual</span>____. One had to be on familiar terms with Marx, not let one's dreams stray too far from Freud.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And one had to treat sign-systems-the signifier-with the greatest respect.

But </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">here, inside our walls, what exactly was taking place? An amalgam of revolutionary and anti-repressive politics? A war fought on two fronts: against social exploitation and psychic repression? A surge of libido modulated by the class struggle? Perhaps. At any rate, it is this familiar, dualistic interpretation that has laid claim to the events of those years</span>____. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The dream that cast its spell, between the First World War and fascism,</span> over the dreamiest parts of Europe__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">-the Germany of Wilhelm Reich, and the France of the surrealists-had returned and set fire to reality itself: Marx and Freud in the same incandescent light. </span>__But is that really what happened?__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Had the utopian project of the thirties been resumed, this time on the scale of historical practice? </span>__Or was there, on the contrary, a movement toward political struggles that no longer conformed to the model that Marxist tradition had prescribed? Toward an experience and a technology of desire that were no longer Freudian.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is true that the old banners were raised, but the </span>__combat shifted and spread into new zones__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Anti-Oedipus shows first of all how much ground has been covered. But it does much more than that. It wastes no time in discrediting the old idols, even though it does have a great deal of fun with Freud. Most important, it motivates us to go further. It would be a mistake to read Anti-Oedipus as the new theoretical reference (you know, that much-heralded theory that finally encompasses everything, that finally totalizes and reassures, the one we are told we "need so badly" in our age of dispersion and specialization where "hope" is lacking). </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">One must not look for a "philosophy" amid the extraordinary profusion of new notions and surprise concepts: Anti-Oedipus is not a flashy Hegel</span>____.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I think that </span>__Anti-Oedipus can best be read as an "art," in the sense that is conveyed by the term "erotic art__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">," for example. Informed by the seemingly abstract notions of multiplicities, flows, arrangements, and connections, the analysis of the relationship of desire to reality and to the capitalist "machine" yields answers to concrete questions. </span>__Questions that are less concerned with why this or that than with how to proceed. How does one introduce desire into thought, into discourse, into action? How can and must desire deploy its forces within the political domain and grow more intense in the process of overturning the established order?__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Ars erotica, ars theoretica, ars politica. Whence the three adversaries confronted by Anti-Oedipus. Three adversaries who do not have the same strength, who represent varying degrees of danger, and whom the book combats in different ways: 1. The political ascetics, the sad militants, the terrorists of theory, those who would preserve the pure order of politics and political discourse. Bureaucrats of the revolution and civil servants of Truth. 2. The poor technicians of desire-psychoanalysts and semiologists of every sign and symptom-who would subjugate the multiplicity of desire to the twofold law of structure and lack. 3. Last but not least, </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the major enemy, the strategic adversary is fascism</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (whereas //Anti-Oedipus//' opposition to the others is more of a tactical engagement). </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">And not only historical fascism,</span>__ __the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - which was able to mobilize and use the desire of the masses so effectively - </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">but also the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us.</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I would say that //Anti-Oedipus// (may its authors forgive me) is a book of ethics, the first book of ethics to be written in France in quite a long time (perhaps that explains why its success was not limited to a particular "readership" : being anti-oedipul has become a life style, a way of thinking and living). How does one keep from being fascist, even (especially) when one believes oneself to be a revolutionary militant? How do we rid our speech and our acts, our hearts and our pleasures, of fascism? How do we ferret out the fascism that is ingrained in our behavior? The Christian moralists sought out the traces of the flesh lodged deep within the soul. Deleuze and Guattari, for their part, pursue the slightest traces of fascism in the body. Paying a modest tribute to Saint Francis de Sales, * {*A seventeenth-century priest and Bishop of Geneva, known for his //Introduction to the Devout Life//} one might say that //Anti-Oedipus// is an //Introduction to the Non-Fascist Life//. </span>__This art of living counter to all forms of fascism, whether already present or impending, carries with it a certain number of essential principles which I would summarize as follows__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if I were to make this great book into a manual or guide to everyday life: </span>__Free political action from all unitary and totalizing paranoia. Develop action, thought, and desires by proliferation, juxtaposition, and disjunction, and not by subdivision and pyramidal hierarchization. Withdraw allegiance from the old categories of the Negative__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (law, limit, castration, lack, lacuna), which Western thought has so long held sacred as a form of power and an access to reality</span>__. Prefer what is positive and multiple, difference over uniformity, flows over unities, mobile arrangements over systems. Believe that what is productive is not sedentary but nomadic. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Do not think that one has to be sad in order to be militant, even though the thing one is fighting is abominable. It is the connection of desire to reality</span> (and not its retreat into the forms of representation) <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that possesses revolutionary force. Do not use thought to ground a political practice in Truth; nor political action to discredit, as mere speculation, a line of thought. Use political practice as an intensifier of thought, and analysis as a multiplier of the forms and domains for the intervention of political action. Do not demand of politics that it restore the "rights" of the individual, as philosophy has defined them. The individual is the product of power. What is needed is to "de-individualize" by means of multiplication and displacement, diverse combinations. The group must not be the organic bond uniting hierarchized individuals, but a constant generator of de-individualization. Do not become enamored of power</span>.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.  </span>
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">

</span>**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Finally, Our speech act bears revolutionary potential and has the means to further action. Confining our language through the parameters of pre-determined political form destroys this potential</span>**<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">.

What this type of radio achieved most of all was the short-circuiting of representation in both the aesthetic sense of representing the social realities they dealt with and in the political sense of the delegate or the authorised spokesperson, in favour of generating a space of direct communication in which, as Guattari put it, “it is as if, in some immense, permanent meeting place—given the size of the potential audience—anyone, even the most hesitant, even those with the weakest voices, suddenly have the possibility of expressing themselves whenever they wanted.

Finally, in the much more poetic and manifesto-like preface with which Guattari introduces the translation of texts and documents form Radio Alice, he comes to a conclusion which can perhaps stand as an embryonic formula for the emergence of the post-media era as anticipated by Radio Alice and the Autonomia movement more generally: In Bologna and Rome, the thresholds of a revolution without any relation to the ones that have overturned history up until today have been illuminated, a revolution that will throw out not only capitalist regimes but also the bastions of beaureaucratic socialism [...] , a revolution, the fronts of which will perhaps embrace entire continents but which will also be concentrated sometimes on a specific neighbourhood, a factory, a school. Its wagers concern just as much the great economic and technological choices as attitudes, relations to the world and singularities of desire. Bosses, police officers, politicians, beuareaucrats, professors and psycho-analysts will in vain conjugate their efforts to stop it, channel it, recuperate it, they will in vain sophisticate, diversify and miniaturise their weapons to the infinite, they will no longer succede in gathering up the immense movement of flight and the multitude of molecular mutations of desire that it has already unleashed. The police have liquidated Alice—its animators are hunted, condemned, imprisoned, their sites are pillaged—but its work of revolutionary deterritorialisation is pursued ineluctably right up to the nervous fibres of its persecutors.” This is because </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the revolution unleashed</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> by Alice </span>__<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">was not reducible to a political or media form but was rather an explosion of mutant desire capable of infecting the entire social field because of its slippery ungraspability and irreducibility to existing sociopolitical categories. It leaves the forces of order scratching their heads because they don’t know where the crack-up is coming from since it doesn’t rely on pre-existing identities or even express a future programme but rather only expresses immanently its own movement of auto-referential self-constitution, the proliferation of desires capable of resonating even with the forces of order themselves</span>__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> which now have to police not only these dangerous outsiders but also their own desires. </span>__This shift from fixed political subjectivities and a specified programme is the key to the transformation to a post-political politics and indeed to a post-media era__<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> in that politics becomes an unpredictable, immanent process of becoming rather than the fulfilment of a transcendental narrative. In today’s political language one could say that what counts is the pure potential that another world is possible and the movement towards it rather than speculation as to how that world will be organised. As Guattari concludes: “ The point of view of the Alicians on this question is the following: they consider that the movement that arrives at destroying the gigantic capitalist-beaureaucratic machine will be, a fortiori, completely capable of constructing an other world—the collective competence in the matter will come to it in the course of the journey, without it being necessary, at the present stage to outline projections of societal change.” </span>

**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">We are militarized in debate. We are tools who use a set of rules to expand false and hollow ideologies that then inhibit every original thought. We use philosophical movements, ideologies as tools to win a game, rather than to create change. We eliminate actual change in exchange for status quo of debate – a hollow, shallow excuse for actual free discussion. We exclude people on the basis of the conservativeness of their arguments. We critique people on their aptitude to memorize pointless debate strategy, to silly theoretical justifications. How does this create anything new, move anything forward?


Debate is shaped in the mind of the military, of militarization. In the opportunity in which we can truly problematize our individual connections to military, to international relations, we exclude and insist on objectivity and tick marks. Why can’t I have discussions.
