**The United States federal government should immediately and unconditionally excise its military and police occupation from Iraq**
**Contention 1: Indefinite occupation**
**Despite euphemisms US presence will continue in Iraq indefinitely**

**Violence is not an unintended consequence; it is a structural feature of occupation. US presence can never reduce violence, only promote it. The everyday violence of occupation should be considered more important than low risk disaster prophecies about the effects of withdrawal.**

**Policy making about Iraq must explicitly examine the way past Iraq policies were formulated based on extreme, apocalyptic images of global calamity. The militarization of our democratic discourse is intimately related to the violence of our foreign policy. We must recognize that the desires to secure and order the world are unattainable fantasies before we can produce meaningful policy reform.**

**Military futurism is intimately connected to military presence - the two can't be discussed in isolation. The ideological underpinnings of US base structure are the doom and gloom scenarios concocted by military futurists. Think tanks, the media, and academia are becoming vertically integrated into the military industrial complex because their apocalyptic scenario planning provides the ideological ammyunition for imperialism- the result is endless presence and endless war**

**Contention 2: Decision Calculus**

**An ethical decision about occupation requires a three pronged approach**

**First, the role of the judge is to be a critical intellectual, this role best fulfills your obligation to filter and interpret the knowledge claims and policies of militaristic governments. This role requires a rejection of occupation**

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> In the essay, `Speaking truth to power', Said asks the basic questions ... and the global interact to produce a better world for all.</span>
**Second, Epistemology must be the primary determinant of argument quality.** **The decision of the ballot must be filtered through the historical understanding of US actions in Iraq, this historical diagnosis is a pre-requisite to policy action. The only solution is an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of US presence. A functioning Iraqi state is only possible after an end to the occupation allows political realignment.**

**Third, Positionality.** **Use your ballot to reject security rationales for occupation. US presence is universally reviled by Iraqi citizens as the source of instability- arguments to the contrary are part of a colonial narrative created to sanitize imperial violence. The demand for swift and total withdrawal cannot be compromised or violence will escalate**

**Finally,** **Our demand for immediate and unconditional withdrawal is the crucial starting point for a broader anti war movement to challenge aggressive militarism. Imperial foreign policy requires a network of established, permanent bases. The demand for withdrawal is crucial to revitalize popular movements to restrain US violence**
