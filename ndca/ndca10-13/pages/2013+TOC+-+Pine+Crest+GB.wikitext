Quotidian Redress Aff
====


Observation One is risk segregation:

Risk is distributed inequitably in the status quo—calculations of utility represents marginal tinkering that sustains a fundamentally unjust system—calls for environmental redress in the name of the disenfranchised and disempowered are sounded but not heeded
Bullard 1999 (Robert, driving figure in environmental justice, “Dismantling environmental racism in the USA” Local Environment 4.1)

In the real world, … limited to risk assessment).

Evental and catastrophic time underwrites this symbolic separation and segregation—calls for environmental justice require the generation of an immediate and eventual harm according to the standards of “crisis and urgency” promulgated in official reports of catastrophe and disaster—only prompting and forcing differential relationships to time can create a framework friendly to environmental justice
Pezzullo 2007 (Phaedra, Assistant Professor of Communication at the University of Indiana-Bloomington, Toxic Tours p. 176-179)

"Modern societies;' according to … to aim for both.

Privileging the calamities suffered by the political disposseed and disempowered is the only way to remember environmental catastrophes as expressions of systemic problems rather than “accidents” or “exceptions”
Nixon 2011 (Rob, Professor of English at UW-Madison, Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor  p. 2-3)

Looking back at Chernobyl…forces of slow violence.

The official transcript of political catastrophe remains privileged over a systemic account of disaster and violence because of a symbolic and bodily segregation—distance between those who live in safe communities and those who deal with toxic life regularly maintains a balkanized and mutually reinforcing set of ways to understand existence
Conquergood 2002 (Dwight, Professor of Communication Studies and Performance at Northwestern, “Performance Studies” in The Drama Review 46.2, http://www.culturaldevelopment.net.au/downloads/DwightConquergood.pdf)

But de Certeau’s aphorism, …classes take for granted.

Understanding that our acts of consumption and our own political attitudes create real impacts in the here and now is key: the status quo forces a choice between locating blame in institutions or individuals—the question instead is how we might operationalize or see the agency available
Pezzullo 2007 (Phaedra, Assistant Professor of Communication at the University of Indiana-Bloomington, Toxic Tours p. 65)

The trouble with the …stricter Clean Air Act.

Moreover the question is not a question of means and modes—the resources to eliminate environmental racism are at our disposal—it is a question of will—no community should be sacrificed
Bullard 1999 (Robert, driving figure in environmental justice, “Dismantling environmental racism in the USA” Local Environment 4.1)

¶ The environmental protection apparatus … zone' or dumping ground.

Racism must be resisted—opposition to racism is the only ethical choice
Memmi 2k (Albert, Professor Emeritus of Sociology @ U of Paris, Naiteire, Racism, Translated by Steve Martinot, p. 163-165)

The struggle against racism … the stakes are irresistible.

The failure of the environmental justice movement means extinction
Bryant 95 (Bunyan Professor in the School of Natural Resources and Environment – University of Michigan, Environmental Justice: Issues, Policies, and Solutions, p. 208-212)

Although the post-World … have that as a goal.

Observation Two: Quotidian Redress and Real Violence

The status quo remains committed to understanding violence as discrete acts done by discrete agents—we need to reconceptualize violence along lines atteantive to what can and cannot appear “in public”—we must understand the slow violence now that occurs in communities daily, and how our accession to certain visions of realities constitutes and creates that violence
Nixon 2011 (Rob, Professor of English at UW-Madison, Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor  p. 2-3)

Three primary concerns animate …challenges of our time?

Toxic tours force a reconceptualization of the concepts of time, place, space, and body that contribute to the violence of everyday existence
Pezzullo 2007 (Phaedra, Assistant Professor of Communication at the University of Indiana-Bloomington, Toxic Tours p. 173-175)

Throughout this book I …the concept of"presence."

These toxic tours create a new kind of “public time” that invigorates public dissent, radical politics, and environmental justice
Pezzullo 2007 (Phaedra, Assistant Professor of Communication at the University of Indiana-Bloomington, Toxic Tours p. 179-183)

Like the oppressive relations … can create palpable effects.

PLAN: The United States federal government should substantially increase its toxic tourism transportation infrastructure in the United States.

Federal lands provide a big solvency deficit—they are very toxic
Seymour 2002 (John, Attorney with the DOI, “Transfer of federal lands..” 27 Colum. J. Envtl. L. 173)

Although the defense agencies … conduct of the remedy.

Place matters—without sited protest on federal toxic sites, government accountability and presence in the narrative of violence will be eliminated
Endres and Senda-Cook 2011 (Danielle and Samantha, Professor of Communication at University of Utah and Professor of Communication at Creighton, in “Location Matters” Quarterly Journal of Speech 97.3)

In her examination of … enacting place in protest.

Toxic tours enable a productive reimagiing of time that produces more effective democratic action
Pezzullo 2007 (Phaedra, Assistant Professor of Communication at the University of Indiana-Bloomington, Toxic Tours p. 22-23)

Although toxic tours clearly…our way of living.
