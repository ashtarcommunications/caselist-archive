==Japan BMD Affirmative — Greenhill RR== 

Plan: The United States federal government should discontinue missile defense military presence in Japan.

Advantage One – Crisis Instability

US-Japan missile defense cooperation is quickly expanding and will be complete in March of 2011 – despite its complete ineffectiveness it will encourage Chinese belligerence and Asian instability

The 1998 launch of the North Korean …these programmes as a distinct strategic challenge.

No matter the effectiveness of missile defense, US-Japan cooperation sends signals of containment that causes China to significantly question US intentions in Northeast Asia

The missile defense (MD), especially the theater missile defense …even the system is still under the process of development.

TMD undercuts extended deterrence in Asia

William, William, Asian Perceptions of BMD: Defence or disequilibrium? Contemporary Southeast Asia, Proquest

To reiterate the major argument in this article, the Asian-theatre …to one where deterrence ceases to prevail.

Our evidence is reverse causal – absent TMD deployment China will revert to minimum deterrence and abandon modernization

Secrecy surrounding US-Japan cooperation ensures miscalculations and misperceptions in times of conflict – leads to nuclear war

Gordon, Japan-U.S. Missile Defense Collaboration: Rhetorically Delicious, Deceptively Dangerous, The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs, Scholar
When assessing the Japan-U.S. TMD project, citizens interested in government accountability and nuclear safety would do well to put stock in the old aphorism: you can’t judge a book by its cover. If historical trends continue, there is good reason to expect that the official discourse on Japanese TMD … to nuclear, chemical, or biological attack.46

US-Japan TMD cooperation will lead to war over Taiwan – lowers necessary leverage in peace talks and encourages Taiwanese independence
-lowers their leverage to achieve unification
-will lead to Taiwan independence
Kiziah, Professor at US Air Force Academy, 2k
Rex, Lt. Col. USAF, US-Led Cooperative Theater Missile Defense in Northeast Asia, Air War College, Scholar
Perhaps the most important complicating issue … “three no’s” policy that includes no support for Taiwan’s independence.59

Now is key – the lull in tension won’t last and future escalation is guaranteed

Joshua, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, July/August, http://thebulletin.metapress.com/content/24783518wg6304j7/fulltext.pdf

But the present calm is not guaranteed to last. …prospect of a trans-Pacific strategic arms race before it becomes self-fulfilling.

Escalates rapidly

The actions suggest a lack of civilian control, although after the fact they have been explained as acts of deterrence. …and difficult to control.51 At least there is improved communication between the two militaries; a hotline linking the Pentagon with the Central Military Commission was established in early 2008.

Ching Cheong, senior journalist at The Straits Times and author of two books on Taiwan, “No One Gains in War Over Taiwan”, June 25, Lexis Nexis.
THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war …China puts sovereignty above everything else.

Advantage Two – ASATs

Japanese participation in missile defense structures the US-Japan alliance to promote a belligerent Chinese response
Bisley, Professor of IR, 8
Nick, Securing the “Anchor of Regional Stability”?, The Transformation of the US-Japan Alliance and East Asian Security, Contemporary Southeast Asia: A Journal of International and Strategic Affairs, Volume 30, Number 1, Muse

China’s expansion of its military spending …opposite effect on East Asia’s security order from their intent.

Chinese response leads to ASAT development

Kori, Research Assistant for Project Alliance Tomorrow, China Debates Missile Defense, Survival, vol 46 no 2, Scholar
Significant qualitative enhancements are also expected. The Pentagon's report …establishment is using BMD as a pretext to secure greater budget allocations.6*

No matter the truth value – China perceives US TMD as a first-step towards space weaponization – causes an ASAT arms race

The Chinese leadership is also concerned that TMD will …conventional weapons as it is in terms of weapons of mass destruction.13

Chinese ASATs lead to space accidents and nuclear war

Marko, “Arms Race in Space”, Foreign Policy in Focus, 3-31,<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://www.fpif.org/articles/arms_race_in_space]]</span>
In fact we have just learnt that the Air Force is working on plans to develop a “counter-ASAT” …Space weapons could lead to itchy fingers on nuclear triggers. They would therefore significantly increase the importance nuclear weapon states place upon nuclear deterrence.

Space conflict leads to space debris – this causes US-Russia war – will likely coincide with early-warning false alarms – ensures immediate escalation
Lewis, Postdoctoral Fellow in the Advanced Methods of Cooperative Study Program, 4
Jeffrey, Worked In the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, Center for Defense Information, What if Space Were Weaponized? July, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://www.cdi.org/PDFs/scenarios.pdf]]</span>
This is the second of two scenarios that consider how U.S. space weapons might create incentives …confidence that allows national nuclear forces to operate safely.

Advantage Three – Prolif

Two links - first - global arms control

TMD leads to nuclear proliferation – triggers arms races and undercuts international non-proliferation efforts
Yuan, PhD, Senior Associate @ East Asian Nonproliferation Program, 3
Jing-dong, Chinese Responses to U.S. Missile Defenses, Nonproliferation Review, Spring, Scholar
Second, U.S. missile defenses would inhibit the …suit, having an overall negative impact on global arms control.

Second - Chinese modernization

TMD causes quick Chinese modernization that leads to global nuclear proliferation
Yuan, PhD, Senior Associate @ East Asian Nonproliferation Program, 3
Jing-dong, Chinese Responses to U.S. Missile Defenses, Nonproliferation Review, Spring, Scholar

Owing to its small size and its current deployment mode-in which nuclear …additional funds for foreign acquisitions and purchases. Analysts suggest that based on such rates of increase, China's defense budget could double by 2005.

Asian proliferation can only lead to conflict – missile defense heightens threat perception
Krepon, Founding President of the Stimson Center, 2
Michael, Missile Defense and the Asian Cascade, Stimson Center, Scholar
Nuclear risk reduction in southern Asia …unreliable, and of unequal interest to the parties.

Asian proliferation uniquely contributes to war – lack of rationality, bad command and control and short distances – no risk of a stabilizing effect
Cimbala, Professor of Political Science, 8
Stephen, Distinguished Prof. Pol. Sci. @ Penn. State Brandywine, Comparative Strategy, Anticipatory Attacks: Nuclear Crisis Stability in Future Asia, 27, InformaWorld
If the possibility existed of a mistaken preemption during and immediately …expectations for the obsolescence or marginalization of major interstate warfare.

=Negative= 

==Topicality== 
===1NC Presence Excludes Combat=== 

**A. Interpretation - Presence requires regular, non-combat activities – forces engaged in combat or one-time noncombat missions aren’t part of U.S. presence**
**Thomason, 2** – Project Leader, Institute for Defense Analysis (James, “Transforming US Overseas Military Presence: Evidence and Options for DoD,” July, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.122.1144&rep=rep1&type=pdf

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">WHAT IS OVERSEAS MILITARY PRESENCE? … </span>__contingency should call for them__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**B. Violation** – the aff ends combat missions, not presence missions.

**C. Voting issue -**

1. Limits – allowing combat missions allows affs to change specific strategies in Afghanistan or Iraq, like ending cluster bombing without actually reducing forces themselves, it explodes the literature base

2. Negative ground – presence missions are about deterrence and reassurance – including combat missions avoids core negative disads

Potential abuse is a voting issue – it overstretches research burden and undermines preparedness for all debates

===1NC Military Must Be All=== 

**A. Interpretation – The adjective “military” means the plan must apply to all of the armed forces**
**SPIRITUS TEMPORIS 2005**
(History website, “Military,” http://www.spiritus-temporis.com/military/meaning-of-the-word.html)

In American English, …. military strength and military force.

**B. Violation – the plan only withdraws ground forces**

**C. Vote neg –**
**First, predictable limits—allowing the aff to choose any one service or any combination of them in any combination of countries blows the lid off the topic**

**Second, predictable ground—letting the aff pick any one service shifts the debate away from the question of whether presence is good or bad to arguments about comparing one kind of presence to another—this fundamentally changes negative arguments**

**Potential abuse is a voting issue- overstretches research burden and undermines preparedness for all debates**

===1NC T Substantial -- Iraq=== 

**A. Interpretation – the aff has to be a substantial change from status quo __policy__ – not a reduction based on the hypothetical possibility the U.S. deviates from that policy.**

**Substantially means real at present time**
**Words and Phrases** 19**64** (40 W&P 759) (this edition of W&P is out of print; the page number no longer matches up to the current edition and I was unable to find the card in the new edition. However, this card is also available on google books, Judicial and statutory definitions of words and phrases, Volume 8, p. 7329<span style="color: black;">)</span>

<span style="color: black;">The words “outward …. Bass v. Pease, 79 Ill. App. 308, 318. </span>

**B. Violation -**

**1. The U.S. is committed to the deadlines now, your aff is the status quo**
**Los Angeles Times** **7/29** (Usama Redha, 7/29/10, " Deadly assault exposes Iraq's delicate state of security ", <span style="color: black;">http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iraq-mayhem-20100730,0,4501378.story</span>)

Meanwhile, <span class="Underline">officials say … in June of last year. </span>

**2. Standard for interpreting evidence – only official U.S. policymakers are credible sources. They are in charge of implementing the withdrawal and are the only ones with access to the truth. The 1ac evidence are from outsiders speculating about U.S. policy based on some remarks the military made after the Iraq election was inconclusive.**

<span class="Underline">**C. Voting issue –** </span>

<span class="Underline">**1. No disad ground exists that competes off of the .01% chance that the U.S. doesn’t do the plan now. ALL link arguments are terminally non unique because the aff IS status quo policy.** </span>

<span class="Underline">**2. Mixes burdens – it’s impossible to determine whether the plan is topical in a vacuum. Mixing burdens makes the topic unpredictable and dependent upon effects-based evidence determinations – not the action of the plan. In practice, this means the aff will always win – because it’s a question of probability, and there’s always non-zero chance that the status quo might change.** </span>

<span class="Underline">**3. Even if they’re topical, they’re not inherent – they don’t have attitudinal, structural, or even existential inherency – because their plan is in existence now. This is independently a voting issue because ALL negative arguments and research strategies are premised on an affirmative change.** </span>

===1NC Substantially = 50%=== 

**A. Interpretation – presence refers to the totality of US military power in a country**
**Blechman et al, 97** – President of DFI International, and has held positions in the Department of Defense, the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the Office of Management and Budget (Barry, Strategic Review, Spring, “Military Presence Abroad in a New Era: The Role of Airpower,” p. 14)

The highly complex nature … infrastructure and sustainment capabilities.”2

**A substantial reduction in presence requires at least a 50% decrease**
**Comprehensive Base Closure Reform and Recovery Act, 92** (1992 H.R. 4421 ; 102 H.R. 4421, text of the Comprehensive Base Closure Reform and Recovery Act of 1992, introduced by Olympia Snowe, lexis)

TITLE I-ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION …. and moved to another installation.

**B. Violation – the affirmative is a minor reduction in presence**

**C. Voting issue –**

1. limits – allowing minor reductions allows countless variations of small affs likes reducing a single type of intelligence gathering or a covert op in Afghanistan or arms sales to Japan; it makes adequate research impossible

2. negative ground – topic disads won’t link to minor modifications, and generic ground is vitally important to protect since there are 6 different countries with diverse literature bases
