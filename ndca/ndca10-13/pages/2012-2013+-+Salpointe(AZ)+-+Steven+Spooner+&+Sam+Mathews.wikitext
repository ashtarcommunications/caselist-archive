**CP Text: The USFG should establish a national infrastructure bank to accomplish the Aff plan**

**What Is an Infrastructure Bank?**
Mallett, Maguire, and Kosar, 2011

William J. Mallett, Specialist in Transportation Policy; Steven Maguire, Specialist in Public Finance; and Kevin R. Kosar, Analyst in American National Government, Congressional Research Service, “National Infrastructure Bank: Overview and Current Legislation” December 14, fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42115.pdf
Conceptually, an infrastructure bank is a government-established entity that provides credit assistance to sponsors of infrastructure projects. An infrastructure bank can take many different forms, such as an independent federal agency, a federal corporation, a government-sponsored enterprise, a state government entity, or a private-sector, nonprofit corporation, but is distinguished from a commercial bank or private-sector infrastructure fund by being government established. Unlike government departments that mainly fund infrastructure through grants, an infrastructure bank would be expected mainly to provide credit assistance, typically loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit.3 As with a traditional commercial bank, infrastructure bank borrowers would be expected to repay their loans with interest, and may have to pay other fees associated with the bank’s credit instruments. But unlike a commercial bank, an infrastructure bank takes no deposits and conducts no other “over-the-counter” transactions.

==**Kritiks**== 

===Anthropokemon=== 
**1. In the face of an accelerating ecological crisis, the aff has decided to advocate a strategy of expansionism – increasing infrastructure over the natural world for the sole purpose of human interest.**

Sivil, 2000 (Richard Sivil studied at the University of Durban Westville, and at the University of Natal, Durban. He has been lecturing philosophy since 1996. “WHY WE NEED A NEW ETHIC FOR THE ENVIRONMENT”, 2000, http://www.crvp.org/book/Series02/II-7/chapter_vii.htm)

**2. The plan frames transportation infrastructure anthropocentrically – they only care about efficiency, growth for humans, and the direct effects on the region.**

Bennett, ‘11 (Victoria J. Bennett is a postdoctoral research associate, Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University, “Toward Understanding the Ecological Impact of Transportation Corridors,” www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_gtr846.pdf)


**Impact**

**The demonization of extinction leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy of war and destroying value to life, we control uniqueness as we accept death as an inevitability and see that further meaning comes after the human-ape is gone.**

Gilkinson 1998

Andrew Glikson, Earth and paleo-climate scientist, Australian National University, 1998[10/19/08 http://thomaspainescorner.wordpress.com/2008/10/19/planet-eaters-chain-reactions-black-holes-climate-change-and-existentialist-philosophy/#more-1105]
**Alt**

**The Alt is to embrace non-anthropological ethics. This does not cede the political, but it does entail rejection of the affirmative’s human-centered justifications and framing.**

Eric Katz and Lauren Oechsli, 1993 (Members of the Science, Technology, and Society Program,, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark. Katz is currently Vice President of the International Society for Environmental Ethics , “Moving beyond Anthropocentrism: Environmental Ethics, Development, and the Amazon”, http://www.umweltethik.at/download.php?id=392.)

===Kurzweil Kritik=== 

**The plan conceptualizes that humans are separate from other entities which denies the potential of transhumanism**

Bárd 10 – Master in Philosophy from the University of Vienna (2010, Imre, “Troubles with Posthumanism,” http://othes.univie.ac.at/10994/1/2010-09-08_0349138.pdf, MV)

**Impact**

**The singularity achieves immortality**

Ray Kurzweil 09 (has been described as “the restless genius” by the Wall Street Journal, and “the ultimate thinking machine” by Forbes. Inc. magazine ranked him #8 among entrepreneurs in the United States, calling him the “rightful heir to Thomas Edison,” and PBS included Ray as one of 16 “revolutionaries who made America,” along with other inventors of the past two centuries.¶ As one of the leading inventors of our time, Ray was the principal developer of the first CCD flat-bed scanner, the first omni-font optical character recognition, the first print-to-speech reading machine for the blind, the first text-to-speech synthesizer, the first music synthesizer capable of recreating the grand piano and other orchestral instruments, and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition. Ray’s web site Kurzweil AI.net has over one million readers.¶ Among Ray’s many honors, he is the recipient of the $500,000 MIT-Lemelson Prize, the world's largest for innovation. In 1999, he received the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest honor in technology, from President Clinton in a White House ceremony. And in 2002, he was inducted into the National Inventor's Hall of Fame , established by the US Patent Office.¶ He has received nineteen honorary Doctorates and honors from three U.S. presidents. “Why in 2029 we’ll start living forever” Interview with ray Kurzweil)

**Alt**

**Our alternative is to reject the affirmative as a technologically humanist presentation Technological advancements have brought us to a crossroads – unless transhumanist education is promoted, technology will cause our own extinction**

Tandy 5 – Director and Associate Professor of Humanities at the Center for Interdisciplinary Philosophic Studies at Fooyin University in Taiwan (November 2005, Charles, “The Education of Humans and Transhumans in the Twenty-First Century,” Journal of Futures Studies, Volume 10, Number 2, pp. 85-96, http://www.imamu.edu.sa/Scientific_selections/abstracts/Physics/The%20Education%20of%20Humans%20and%20Transhumans%20in%20the%20Twenty-First%20Century.pdf, MV)

===Herddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd=== 


**Making commerce easier participates in the old rational planning model that promotes a synoptic view of humanity, it creates herds and recreates a spatial over emphasizing of top down dynamics**

Scott 1998 (Professor of Political Science at Yale, Seeing Like a State )


**Impact**

**Herd mentality is RESPONSIBLE for terrorism – only the alternative allows us to finally solve the root cause of terrorism by redefining belonging as distinct from collective mentalities, their affirmative will merely recreate wmd terrorism and in turn extinction.**

Beres 06

[Louis Rene Professor of International Law, Department of Political Science, Purdue University. Ph.D., Princeton University, 1977 Dangers of the herd mentality The Washington Times February 28, 2006 L/N] [ct]


**Future terrorist attacks will cause extinction**

¶ Alexander 03, Director of Inter-University for Terrorism Studies ¶ [Yonah, Washington Times, August 28, LN]



=== === 


===Security Kritik=== 

**Framing governmental support for infrastructure in terms of security legitimizes violence and wholesale destruction in the name of disciplinary control while framing humanity in terms of logistical life**

Reid 8 (Julian – lecturer in International Relations at King’s College, visiting professor in International Relations at the University of Lapland, “Conclusion: The Biopolitics of Critical Infrastructure Protection,” Securing ‘the Homeland:’ Critical Infrastructure, Risk and (In)Security, Ed. Myriam Dunn Cavelty and Kristian Soby Kristensen, p. 178-179)


**Realist security system produces WMD gambles human life in the name of permanent war**

Der Derian, Associate Professor of Political Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst, 1998

(James, On Security, Columbia University Press, Chapter 2: “The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard,” Electronic Version at Columbia International Affairs Online, subscription service, http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz.html, Accessed Sept 7 2005)


**Calculability results in the dehumanization of human life to a zero point holocaust**

Michael Dillon, professor of politics and international relations at the University of Lancaster, April 1999, Political Theory, Vol. 27, No. 2, “Another Justice,” p. 164-5



**Voting negative repudiates the affirmative’s prioritization of a secure world—saying no to the affirmative allows us to educate ourselves beyond this flawed epistemology and remove the security blanket.**

Neocleous, prof. of critique of political economy @ Brunei University, 2008 p. 185-186
