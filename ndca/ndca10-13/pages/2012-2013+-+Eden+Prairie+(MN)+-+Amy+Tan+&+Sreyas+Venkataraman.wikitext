===<span style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5;">**Adv 1: Aesthetics** </span>=== 

**Current conceptions of disability make violence inevitable and promote dehumanization of persons with disabilities. This ensures that oppression based on race, class, and sex is allowed to propagate – notions of disability serve as the trope for all other forms of oppression.**
**Siebers 10** – (Tobin, Professor of Literary and Cultural Criticism @ the University of Michigan, “Disability Aesthetics: (Corporealities: Discourses of Disability)”, Chapter 2: The Aesthetics of Human Disqualification, 2/4/10, http://www.isu.edu/~garijose/Pages/Course%20Syllabi/PDF/Aesthetics/SiebersDisabiityA2.pdf) SIyer
Disqualification as a symbolic process AND minority identities achieved expression.

**These notions are ordered and given meaning to by aesthetic judgments – confronting these judgments is crucial to combat systems of oppression**
**Siebers 10** – (Tobin, Professor of Literary and Cultural Criticism @ the University of Michigan, “Disability Aesthetics: (Corporealities: Discourses of Disability)”, Chapter 2: The Aesthetics of Human Disqualification, 2/4/10, http://www.isu.edu/~garijose/Pages/Course%20Syllabi/PDF/Aesthetics/SiebersDisabiityA2.pdf) SIyer
Oppression is the systematic victimization AND time the final frontier of justifiable human inferiority.

**Questions of aesthetics are tied to politics and deeply embedded in social attitudes – this motivates eugenic violence**
**Davidson 08** – (Michael, Professor of American Literature @ UC San Diego, “Concerto for the Left Hand: Disability and the Defamiliar Body”, University of Michigan Press, 6/9/08, Introduction, Pages 7-8) SIyer
My emphasis on the AND but as a means of thinking through it.

**Aestheticization of politics glorifies violence and death through a lens of artistic appreciation – aesthetic pleasure becomes a priority and motivates violence**
**Jay 92** – (Martin, Sidney Hellman Ehrman Professor of History @ the UC Berkeley, "’The Aesthetic Ideology’ as Ideology; Or, What Does It Mean to Aestheticize Politics?”, Cultural Critique, Spring 1992, JSTOR) SIyer
A politics aestheticized in this sense will AND aroused by this callous apotheosis of art over life.

**Those aesthetics permeate our discussions of transportation infrastructure. The ballot represents a heuristic – The aff is a FORCED, VIOLENT confrontation with disability, shaping our understanding of aesthetics and form.**
**Siebers 10** (Tobin, Professor of Literary and Cultural Criticism @ the University of Michigan, “Disability Aesthetics: (Corporealities: Discourses of Disability)”, Chapter 3: What Can Disability Studies Learn from the Culture Wars? 2/4/10, Print)
These two episodes may seem worlds AND bratty kids that do weird things. (Cited by Fine and Asch 48)

===<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Adv 2: Mobility </span>=== 

**Transportation planning have relegated people with disabilities to the periphery**
**AAPD, 2012** (The American Association of People With Disabilities, “Equity in Transportation for People with Disabilities”, May 23, http://www.infrastructureusa.org/equity-in-transportation-for-people-with-disabilities/)
Transportation and mobility play AND has meant very uneven progress.

**When mobility is viewed as a universal characteristic individual problems become de-characterized and the focus degenerates to anesthetization and exclusion of bodies – status quo planning is entrenched in a universal model of ableism**
**Imrie 2k** – (Robert, Department of Geography @ University of London, “Disability and Discourses of Mobility and Movement”, Environment and Planning, Vol. 32, http://www.environmentandplanning.com/epa/fulltext/a32/a331.pdf)
Barnes et al (1999, page 121), for instance, AND unpredictable, diverse and changeable reality''.

**Mobility should not focus on the body’s incompetence but rather shift to lines of flight away from the static hegemonic conception of liberal identity to recognize difference and individual needs of mobility.**
**Imrie 2k** – (Robert, Department of Geography @ University of London, “Disability and Discourses of Mobility and Movement”, Environment and Planning, Vol. 32, http://www.environmentandplanning.com/epa/fulltext/a32/a331.pdf)
Disabled people's mobility and movement AND needs defined and met by others''.

**The function of universalism is always already based on liberal notions of impairment – that does ontological violence to the disabled body which is a prior question to evaluating consequences**
**Hughes 07** – (Bill, Head of Division of Sociology @ Glasgow Caledonian University, “Being Disabled: Towards a Critical Social Ontology for Disability Studies”, Disability and Society, December 2007, Taylor and Francis) SIyer
In summary, the universalistic approach AND misrepresent and sometimes destroy disabled peoples lives.

**Reforming the manner in which we think about transit and spatiality solves – current conceptions of accessibility ignore factors considering the spatiality of built environments. The plan solves by using transit to construct different spaces that promote the inclusion of PWD’s.**
**Koch 08** – (Tom, Adjunct Professor of Medical Ethics @ the University of British Columbia, “Spaced Out in the City: the Wrinkled World of Transit for Those With Limited Mobility”, Disability Studies Quarterly, Vol. 28 No. 2, Spring, http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/94/94)
The problem, therefore, is not simply AND spaces that cannot be traveled.

===<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Plan Text </span>=== 
**Thus the plan: The United States federal government should provide substantial transportation infrastructure accessibility investment**

===Adv 3: Risk Assessment=== 

**Shifting responsibility towards the other for the sake of rational calculation makes genocide inevitable**
**Hughes, 2002** – (Bill, Glasgow Caledonian University, School of Social Science, Bauman's Strangers, Disability & Society, Vol. 17 No. 5, p. 571-584, EBSCO)
Bureaucracy is ultra-rational, driven to AND recalcitrance to … violent “utopian” solutions.’

**Both the inevitable termination of all matter and the status of life as a being that chooses prove that not only are the ethics of the 1AC vital, but that they are the only impacts you evaluate**
**Clark 10** – Senior Lecturer in Geography at Open University
(Nigel, “Ex-Orbitant Generosity: Gifts of Love in a Cold Cosmos”, Parallax, Vol. 16, No. 1, Pg. 80-95, dml)

Harman has no qualms about positing AND a defining quality. If not us, then who?

**Expert knowledge creates cognitive maps that destroy underlying reality to motivate action via notions of risk**
**Beck 99** – (Ulrich, Professor of Sociology @ the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich, World Risk Society, 1999, pp. 29-30)
The social-ecological approach thus AND the appearance of reality-in-itself is produced.

**Low risk should be dismissed as zero risk**
**Rescher 83** – (Nicholas, Professor of Philosophy @ the University of Pittsburg, “Risk: A Philosophical Introduction to the theory of Risk Evaluation and Management”, University Press of America, Pages 39-40)
But in decision theory there are two AND and taken to lie outside the realm of “real” possibilities.

Strategic stability in the region AND substantial risk for the entire world.

===Ballard Crash CP=== 

**In the hyperreal technophiliac world of JG Ballard’s novel “Crash”, citizens engage in techno-eroticism and rely on their automobiles for everything. Dr. Vaughan, the sinister protagonist of Ballard’s novel, is obsessed with car crashes. In Crash, car accidents represent a form of erotic relief, they are not viewed as things to be avoided but avidly sought after.**
**Ballard explains in 73** – (James Graham, English Novelist and Short Story Writer, “Crash”, Pages 1-2, Published June 1973) SIyer
In his vision of a car-crash with AND infections, by facial injuries and genital wounds.

**Crash’s ambivalence is what helps it serve as the ultimate form of hypercriticism of our obsession with technology. Ballard’s violently sexualized world is devoid of any emotion and therein lays the miracle and utility – it criticizes without judgment and serves as a parody against the hyperreal technologic landscape.**
**Baudrillard 91 –** (Jean, French Philosopher, Ballard’s //Crash//, Pages 318-319, Science Fiction Studies, Vol. 18, No.3, JSTOR) SIyer
In Crash, everything is hyper-functional: AND saturated with an intense initiatory power.

**Contention 2 is the Hyperreality:**

**Absent investigation of the hyperreal – it replaces the events it was to represent blurring the line between fiction and reality**
**Foster, 93** – (Dennis, Professor @ SMU, “J. G. Ballard's Empire of the Senses: Perversion and the Failure of Authority,” Page 520, May 1993, JSTOR) SIyer

**Ballard’s warning against violent technological killing reflect brutal fantasies and harsh reality which has birthed urbicide – the genocide of innocent civilians by technology in our cities**
<span style="background-color: white;">**GRAHAM, 09** – </span>Professor of Human Geography @ Durham University (Stephen, “'Cities as Battlespace: The New Military Urbanism,” City, December 2009, Taylor and Francis) SIyer

At the root of such imaginations of AND a body are aligned and calibrated.

**Contention 3 is the Accident:**

**<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Our affirmation of the accident is key to prevent a global Accident, which causes extinction and turns the case. Only by continually simulating the car crash can we ever hope to reverse the acceleration of technological progress. This acts as a filter to all of their impact scenarios – our reading of Crash liberates from our place as autonomous subjects.</span>**

But let us get back to Europe’s AND<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> long-distance to be connected.</span>

**<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Contention 4: Biopower</span>**

**The fact that the affirmative relies on the state to produce solutions to systems of oppression proves that they can’t solve. The state just reifies the systems that they criticize and perform genocidal atrocities. This turns the case and precludes solvency.**
