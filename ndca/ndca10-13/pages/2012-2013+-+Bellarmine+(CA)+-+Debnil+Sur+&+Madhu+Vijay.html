4.5  LEVINAS’ PHILOSOPHY OF THE ENCOUNTER¶ ‘The other is not<br />
AND<br />
to a response that does not condemn the other through assumptions of recognition.<br />
<br />
Our ethic is a “first philosophy” that <u>precedes</u> and <u>refutes</u> rule systems like utilitarianism, which reduce the Other to a calculable entity – ethics should come from experience, not knowledge<br />
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Introna, professor of ethics, 3</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – Professor of Organization, Technology, and Ethics at Lancaster University (Lucas, 2003, “Workplace Surveillance ‘is’ Unethical and Unfair,” <em>Surveillance &amp; Society</em>, Volume 1, Number 2, pp. 210-216, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://library.queensu.ca/ojs/index.php/surveillance-and-society/article/download/3354/3317" rel="nofollow">http://library.queensu.ca/ojs/index.php/surveillance-and-society/article/download/3354/3317</a>)</span><br />
<br />
For Levinas the ‘force’, or rather the gravity, of ethics lies in<br />
AND<br />
). The force of the Other is fragile, not secure at all.<br />
<br />
Ethical framing conditions all political practice – this recognition solves conflict<br />

 Contention two is totality<br />
<br />
The opposite of <u>infinity</u> is <u>totality</u>, the attempt to break down and understand everything – this leads to impersonal control and tyranny<br />

Hegel and his followers have also seen the accidental biases and eccentricities that make the<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Our ethic is a “first philosophy” that precedes and refutes rule systems like utilitarianism, which reduce the Other to a calculable entity – ethics should come from experience, not knowledge</span><br />

Second is Predictable Limits - The resolution proposes the question the negative is prepared to answer and creates a bounded list of potential affs for us to think about. Debate has unique potential to change attitudes and grow critical thinking skills because it forces pre-round internal deliberation on a of a focused, common ground of debate<br />

In this pre-rational order, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">one finds oneself always already in the presence of others who call forth an ethical response. There is no need to construct a widened community of justice in the manner of Feinberg</span>, for example, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">because the community in which one finds oneself already is that community.¶ The Feinberg technique of arriving at wider ethical communities has been described by David Cooper in terms of an 'expanding circle'. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The expanding circle</span> school <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">argue</span></span>, as we saw in the last chapter, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;">that</span> 'whatever the crucial determinant of moral concern-- happiness, rights, sentiment--the argument is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">that it is irrational to restrict</span> such <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">concerns to human</span> beings, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">since the </span></span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 11pt;">differences</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> between ourselves and some other species which would alone justify such a restriction simply </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 11pt;">do not exist'</span></em> ( Cooper 1995: 139). Cooper criticizes this approach on a number of grounds ( Cooper 1995: 140-1), the most important of which for us reads as follows:¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;">the [expanding</span> circle] <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">'model' implies</span> that moral <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">progress</span> always <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">occurs through recognizing that some</span> previously excluded <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">group... is similar</span></span>, in all relevant respects, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to a group already included in the circle of moral concern. But <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">this</span> is to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">ignore</span> the possibility... <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">that a species ought to engage our concern because</span> of the respects in which <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it </span></span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 11pt;">significantly differs</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;"> from ourselves.</span></span> ( Cooper 1995: 141)¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This last sentence</span>--'this is to ignore the possibility... that a species ought to engage our concern because of the respects in which it significantly differs from ourselves'--<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">provides the background to an alternative to the expanding circle technique</span>, and it may be that this alternative is the one most suited to the intentions of the 'natural value' conception of environmental sustainability. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It is likely to be hard to argue of a great number of the carriers of 'natural value' which lie at the heart of this conception that they are 'similar, in all relevant respects' to human beings</span> (for example). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">if</span>, on the other hand, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">they 'engage our concern' because they differ</span> from us, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">then </span></span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 11pt;">the range of concern is widened at a stroke</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;">.</span></span>¶ It has to be admitted that the intellectual resources at the disposal of the expanding circle school are considerably greater than those at the disposal of the 'difference' school. As Wissenburg has rightly remarked, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">'The reason why we love others, according to Kant and the whole of Western philosophy since the Stoics and long before, is that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">we </span></span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 11pt;">recognise ourselves</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;"> in the other</span>, or to be more specific, we recognise our essence as rational, morally free, and responsible beings with plans, aims and ends'</span> ( Wissenburg 1993: 13). But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there is a subordinate tradition of ethical concern, represented by Emmanuel Levinas</span>, and to which we have already referred, which Wissenburg also mentions ( Wissenburg 1993: 16)--although he chooses not to follow the trail, believing that the demands of a Levinasian approach to ethics are altogether too demanding-- even self-contradictory: <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">'Is it really possible to conceive of nature in terms or concepts which we, and only we understand, without epistemologically and </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 11pt;">ethically colonizing it</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">?</span>' ( Wissenburg 1993: 16).¶ Despite these reservations, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;">it is</span></span> nevertheless <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;">surprising that Levinasian ethics have not received</span> more <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">attention from the environmental community</span>, and particularly from those members of it looking for a way to express their intuition that the natural world</span> (or carriers of 'natural value' in our present terms) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">demands ethical attention because of, not despite, its manifest, differences from ourselves.</span> What follows should not at all be taken as a wholehearted endorsement of a Levinasian approach to environmental ethics (nor, more broadly, of a 'postmodem' approach). 'I simply want to signal the potential available here. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Levinas's view is that difference invites 'nonindifference'</span>:¶ We must note that for Plato <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a relation may be possible between the one and the other, though they</span> are 'dead to the world', and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">lack</span>, as a result, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a shared other; that a relation might be possible without a common ground, that is to say, a relationship in difference; that the difference signifies a nonindifference</span>; that this nonindifference might</span>
