**OBSERVATION ONE:** I will defend the resolution as a general principle, but I am open to alternate interpretations. If the NEG would like me to defend something else, they can ask me to do so in CX.

**OBSERVATION TWO IS FRAMEWORK:** <span style="color: #000000;">I value **justice.** T</span>he nature of our relationships with and obligations towards others form the basis of the requirements of justice.

<span style="color: #000000;">Previous philosophical theories try to distill justice into a single principle that is to be applied to all situations. For example, Kantian ethics establishes human dignity or reflective practical reason as the basis for all ethical reasoning. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Other agents cease to be unique entities that exist independently of ourselves because all knowledge is said to stem from //our// systemic procedures for ethics. </span>

**<span style="color: #000000;">However,</span>**<span style="color: #000000;"> a sound basis for ethics requires a coherent understanding of the other. Failure to recognize and identify with that which is not us prevents us from constructing ourselves as autonomous beings.</span>

**<span style="color: #000000;">Thus</span>**<span style="color: #000000;">, our self-awareness can only arise through our encounter with the Other. Without the capacity to distinguish that which is in our control from that which is not, the external world would appear to be governed by our will so we could not distinguish our own autonomous action from the decisions of the other. This makes it impossible to concpetualize our autonomy. </span>

Thus we must respect the other.

//If the otherness... look at God.//


**<span style="color: #000000;">Therefore,</span>**<span style="color: #000000;"> the AFF **burden** is to prove that animals are an other worthy of ethical consideration.</span>


**<span style="color: #000000;">Further,</span>**<span style="color: #000000;"> prefer this framework for two additional reasons:</span>

**<span style="color: #000000;">First</span>**<span style="color: #000000;">, any coherent conception of ethics arises out of respect for the other. Discussion that precedes a response to the other is internally self-defeating because it tries to attribute characteristics to the other before encountering the other,s. This also allows us to exclude anything outside of our defined interpretation of what the other is. </span>

**<span style="color: #000000;">Second</span>**<span style="color: #000000;">, ethics must accept others because we can never fully understand them. When we encounter the other, it has an independent perspective that eludes my understanding so we have no choice but to respect its otherness</span>

**<span style="color: #000000;">Thus,</span>**<span style="color: #000000;"> justice must recognize the rights of all agents that influence the interaction between ourselves and the other, not just those within the realm of the other. </span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">I </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px;">value **morality** as implied by the resolution</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Morality must be based in humanity’s conception of moral personhood.

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16px;">Humans derive their reasons for acting from their unique perspective and their ability to separate their instincts from reason.**Korsgaard[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn4|**[4]**]]**</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;">But </span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri;">the human …</span>__**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;"> it cannot commit itself or go forward.</span>

**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;">And, Velleman 2[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn5|**[5]**]]</span>**<span style="color: #262626; font-family: Calibri;"> explains why questioning the authority of reasons just purports its own significance.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">And,</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> as rational agents, which seek justification for all actions, the moral rules we determine for ourselves are universal. **Engstrom[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn6|**[6]**]]**</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">All humans set ends for themselves, as the very nature of being a person requires us to seek out certain end states. **Engstrom 2[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn7|**[7]**]]**</span>

**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thus,</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> since we all have our own ends and desires, willing that people help you achieve those ends means that you necessarily must also help others achieve their own ends. **Engstrom 3[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn8|**[8]**]]**</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8px;">Kant explains how …would need assistance. </span>


**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Engstrom 4[[debatecoaches/home#_ftn9|**[9]**]] </span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">continues how living in pursuit of your own happiness ultimately leads to a contradiction in universal maxim, even if pursuing your own happiness is bound by not harming others.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The only place in which a moral obligation could actually be derived from is reason.

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">value is morality</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Inquiring about the nature of the good life for the moral subject is the only way to circumvent the is-ought fallacy that plagues rationalistic moral theory. Alasdair MacIntyre:</span>

Alasdair MacIntyre [Emeritus Prof. of Philosophy, University of Notre Dame], After Virtue, 3rd Edition, Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press (2007), p. 56-59

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Some later moral… a functional concept.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thus the resolution asks what principle is most salient to our moral identities.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">This means the only constant about what constitutes a “good” human is one that seeks self-preservation. West</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">http://www.discovery.org/a/9541. Discovery Institute — Center for Science and Culture. “DOES DARWINISM SUPPORT TRADITIONAL MORALITY?.” May 1, 2009.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">However, before one…. as morally blameworthy.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">My only burden is to demonstrate that deadly force is justified as self-defense against repeated abuse.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">self-preservation is the basis of ethics.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">First, there is no faculty that perceives moral facts in the physical world. Mackie</span>

<span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri;">J.L Mackie. Ethics Inventing Right and Wrong Chapter 1 “The subjectivity of Values”. Page 38.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Even more important… compelled to resort.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">All ethical codes and systems can be explained by evolutionary mechanism. Rauscher</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The fourth application… mechanisms and behaviors.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">This means that the only reason that humans make arguments for ethics and believe them is because evolution has caused them to and ethics does not exist independent of that.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Second, only evolutionary theory explains the structure of justifications.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ratner explains how all justification traces back to evolutionary theory and analyzes the structure of human justification.</span>
