=Observation 1: Inherency= 
====__**Current infrastructure ideas and policies are structured around the car. Though the government has mandated more cycling infrastructure, states continue to ignore this and spatially organize for the automobile. The metropolis has become the autopolis, forcing out the bicycle.**__==== 
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Zack </span><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Furness,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Assistant Professor of Cultural Studies in the Department of Humanities, History, and Social Sciences at Columbia College Chicago,</span> 20<span style="font-size: 16pt;">10</span>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">One Less Car: Bicycling and the Politics of Automobility, Chapter 3: Vélorutionaries and the Right to the (Bikeable) City, Project Muse, [[http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781592136148]], TB</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">" the first time walking and bicycling were seriously recognized as national/federal priorities, in terms of funding and the scope of the policy, was more than a century after the invention of the automobile."</span>

=Plan: The United State federal government should substantially increase its investment in bicycle transportation infrastructure in the United States.= 
=Advantage: automobility= 
====__**This network of infrastructure kills space as a living area, dividing and hierarchizing it and making us further rooted in automobility in an attempt to spatially fix these cracks.**__==== 
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">David </span><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Campbell</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, professor of cultural and political geography at Durham University in the U.K., 20</span><span style="font-size: 16pt;">05</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, //American Quarterly// 57.3 (2005) 943-972, ‘The Biopolitics of Security: Oil, Empire, and the Sports Utility Vehicle’, Project Muse, [[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v057/57.3campbell.html]], TB</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">"While the development of technology was obviously important, a transformation in American urban culture—wherein streets came to be viewed as traffic ways rather than recreational social spaces—was fundamental to the creation of the auto social formation."</span>

====__**We experience nothing between our starting point and destination, using this space as only a means to achieve our travel, making it into a dead zone.**__==== 
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">John </span><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Urry</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Professor of Sociology and Director of the Centre for Mobilities Research, Lancaster University; Edited by Steffen Böhm, Campbell Jones, Chris Land, and Matthew Paterson; “Inhabiting the car,” in “Against Automobility,” The Editorial Board of the Sociological Review 20</span><span style="font-size: 16pt;">06</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, p.21-22</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Simmel makes points relevant to the nature of this inhabiting. Contra much contemporary social theory he considers that the eye is a unique ‘sociological achievement’ (Simmel, 1997: 111).</span>


<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> "</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Especially for the non-car user roads are simply full of moving, dangerous iron cages. There is no reciprocity of the eye and no look is returned from the ‘ghost in the machine’. Communities of people become </span><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">anonymity</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> flows of faceless ghostly machines"</span>

====__**The separation and depersonalization of the car causes a state of diremption in which the world is seen as dead or foreign. This separation is internalized to prevent social interaction and understanding that in turn forms the basis and meaning of life.**__==== 
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Joshua </span><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Fischel</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Senior Project Manager at Thomson Reuters, </span><span class="Author-Date" style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span><span style="font-size: 16pt;">11</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “EDUCATION AFTER MODERNITY: DEWEY, DAVIDSON, AND THE PROSPECTS FOR OVERCOMING DIREMPTION”)</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">"But in the process of attempting to dominate and remove what is seen to be in opposition, the self loses itself and becomes alienated from itself. “Life without meaning, hope, and love breeds a coldhearted, mean-spirited outlook that destroys both the individual and others</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” </span>


====__**The subject of automobility is liquidated, the organization of space gives them no choices and takes them away from life.**__==== 
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Kari </span><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Hensley</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, doctoral candidate at New York University in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication, master's degree in that program as well as an undergraduate degree in the history of art from the University of California, Berkeley, March 20</span><span style="font-size: 16pt;">10</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, American Quarterly, Vol. 62 No. 1, One Nation Behind the Wheel Automobility in U.S. Culture, Project Muse, [[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v062/62.1.hensley.html]]</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">"The "liquidation of the subject," through the blur of the speeding car</span> or other means, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">is similarly the effect of modern consumer society and life in the age of governmentality. Individualism"</span>


=Observation 2: Solvency= 
====__**Bicycling reconnects us with this space – time and space are balanced and speed is restrained enabling us to keep up with our movement and experience travel for what it is.**__==== 
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Zack </span><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Furness</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Assistant Professor of Cultural Studies in the Department of Humanities, History, and Social Sciences at Columbia College Chicago, 20</span><span style="font-size: 16pt;">10</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, One Less Car: Bicycling and the Politics of Automobility, Chapter 3: Vélorutionaries and the Right to the (Bikeable) City, Project Muse, [[http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781592136148]], TB</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">"sees biking as a means of literally and metaphorically “subverting the dominant isolationist, individualistic, over-consumptive car culture,</span>”"

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">“it bears witness to a commitment to change and the possibility of changing the way we think and act.”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">50</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The bicycle, like the automobile, is an object that becomes meaningful through its relationship to an entire field of cultural practices, discourses, and social forces.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> " </span>

BTW BRACE YOUR SELF THIS IS LIKE A REALLY LONG CARD.........
