Plan

Plan: United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in an expanded fuel cell bus program.
Advantage 1 is warming:
Fuel Cell buses lead to the elimination of emissions and prevents warming
FCHEA 11 (Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association, Building a Commercially Viable National Fuel Cell Electric Bus Program, CAFCP, Scholar) 

In just the last few years…renewable sources to produce hydrogen

Recognizing the important role….heavy duty transportation applications.

The plan sparks commercialization-

A. Federal Action
CTE 9 (Center for Transportation and the Environment, A Report on Worldwide Hydrogen Bus Demonstrations, 2002-2007¶ http://www.fuelcells.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/busreport.pdf )

Role of government in….moving the technology forward.

B. Buses are key

Over the past several….public knowledge and acceptance.

C. Testing

As discussed earlier, in-service….next steps toward commercialization.

D. Public awareness Eudy et al 7 (Leslie, Senior Project leader at the Hydrogen Technologies and Systems Center, Kevin Chandler, Christina Gikakis, National Fuel Cell Bus Program Manager, “Fuel Cell Buses in U.S. Transit Fleets: Summary of Experiences and Current Status”, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, September 2007, http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/41967.pdf )

Advantage 1 is the Economy:

Economic collapse now – 3 reasons

1. Bizcon
Smoller 8/16 (Gabriel, Graduate Assistant ASBTDC Lead Center, Small Biz Owners Expect Slow Sales Growth, https://www.asbtdc.org/Documentmaster.aspx?doc=3346, PC)

According to a recent poll from Gallup….or declining revenues during 2012.

2. Double-Dip
Sivy 8/28 (Michael, Chartered Financial Analyst and a former securities analyst for an independent stock research firm. He was an investment columnist at Money for more than 23 years as well as a guest columnist for TIME's international edition, Is the U.S. Headed for a Double-Dip Recession?, http://business.time.com/2012/08/28/is-the-u-s-headed-for-a-double-dip-recession/#ixzz25mPw7R84, PC)

In addition to a host of warnings, last….steady growth and another economic contraction.

3. Stimulus shortfall
Sivy 8/28 (Michael, Chartered Financial Analyst and a former securities analyst for an independent stock research firm. He was an investment columnist at Money for more than 23 years as well as a guest columnist for TIME's international edition, Is the U.S. Headed for a Double-Dip Recession?, http://business.time.com/2012/08/28/is-the-u-s-headed-for-a-double-dip-recession/#ixzz25mPw7R84, PC)

Ordinarily, in a situation like this….the effects of the previous two rounds.


We solve the economy – 5 reasons

First, Megaregions ---- Suburbanization makes US economic growth unsustainable – the US needs a new spatial shift towards the development of megaregions
Florida, ’10 [7/12/10, Richard Florida is Senior Editor at The Atlantic and Director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto, “The Roadmap to a High-Speed Recovery”, http://www.tnr.com/print/article/economy/76961/richard-florida-reset-recovery-economy-future]

That brings me to a central issue….but consume, spurring further demand.

Status quo economic fixes fail and make collapse inevitable – only the development of new mega-regions can create growth, but infrastructure is key
Florida, ’11 [7/5/11, Richard Florida is Senior Editor at The Atlantic and Director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto, “How the Great Reset Has Already Changed America”, http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/07/how-the-great-reset-has-already-changed-america/241200/]

Gradually, our great complexes of cities….can't acknowledge that it has already passed.

HSR is key – it’s shovel-ready, facilitates mega-regions and spurs growth
Florida, ’10 [7/12/10, Richard Florida is Senior Editor at The Atlantic and Director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto, “The Roadmap to a High-Speed Recovery”, http://www.tnr.com/print/article/economy/76961/richard-florida-reset-recovery-economy-future]

Infrastructure is key to powering spatial fixes…..which makes it look like something of a bargain.

Second, The Housing Market ---- HSR development fosters new hubs for housing and jobs which catalyzes an economic recovery
Calthrope, ’12 [Peter Calthrope, “Why I Won’t Give Up on High Speed Rail”, Planning. March 2012, Vol. 78 Issue 3, p50-50. 1p]

Much more than a train ride….we cannot afford not to make.

Third, Traffic Congestion ---- HSR is key to solve highway and airport congestion which hamstrings US business and encourages offshoring – the perception of the plan increases business confidence
McMahon, ’11 [3/29/11, Jeff McMahon, Contributor @ Forbes, “High-Speed Rail Critics Imperil Economic Growth, Bombardier President Says”, http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2011/03/29/high-speed-rail-critics-imperil-economic-growth-bombardier-president-says/]

Opposition to high-speed rail imperils….the heart of economic growth and development.”


Fourth, Competitiveness ---- US is lagging in infrastructure development – HSR solves
Messina 12 [February 2012, Fred Messina is a Vice President in the Transportation business, with a focus on aviation infrastructure @ Booz Allen Hamilton, a technology and strategy consultant company, “Rethinking Mega-Region Air Travel”, http://www.boozallen.com/media/file/Rethinking-Mega-Region-Air-Travel-tl.PDF]

Airport-to-airport high-speed rail …. to our entire transportation system.

Economic recovery and boosting competitiveness are key to prevent the collapse of U.S. power---that causes global great-power wars
Khalilzad 11 Zalmay Khalilzad was the United States ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the United Nations during the presidency of George W. Bush and the director of policy planning at the Defense Department from 1990 to 1992. "The Econom and National Security" Feb 8 www.nationalreview.com/blogs/print/259024

Today, economic and fiscal trends pose….make aggressive moves in their regions.


It triggers multiple scenarios for conflict
Thayer 6 (professor of security studies @ Missouri State Bradley, The National Interest, “In Defense of Primacy”, November/December, p. 32-37)

A grand strategy based on American primacy….to the economic prosperity it provides.

Fifth, Stimulus --- HSR has a multiplier effect on the economy – only the plan solves short and long term growth
Biden 10 – Co-chairman Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC and Adviser to HNTB Corporation, member of the bar in Connecticut, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. He also was on Amtrak’s board of directors, serving as vice chairman from 2007–09. [Hunter Biden, summer 2010, “The Great Multiplier,” InTransit, Pg. 3-4]

The U.S. national high-speed rail program….the keys to realizing that goal.

Austerity has ruined economies before and is ruining ours now – public spending is necessary for economic growth
David Woolner ’11 (is a Senior Fellow and Hyde Park Resident Historian for the Roosevelt Institute, Roosevelt Institute, “Repeating Our Mistakes: The ‘Roosevelt Recession’ and the Danger of Austerity,” http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/new-roosevelt/repeating-our-mistakes-roosevelt-recession-and-danger-austerity)

In 1937, after five years of….the economy than in learning from the past.

Infrastructure spending can solve the economy with a multiplier effect of 2.8 – significantly larger than any other type of fiscal spending

She has also worked as a project manager for Belmark Associates, a marketing research firm. Ms. Han holds a Bachelors degree in Mathematics and Economics from Beloit College, Global Infrastructure Asset Management, Feb 2012, http://www.globalinfrastructurellc.com/Leadership.html)

Besides its improving effects on productive capacity….at least less cuts, on infrastructure projects.

Jobs key to sustained growth and recovery
HINDERY & GERARD 5/15/12 (co-chairs of The Task Force on Jobs Creation. Hindery is also founder of Jobs First 2012 and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Gerard is international president of the United Steelworkers and a member of the executive council of the AFL-CIO[Leo Hindery, Jr. and Leo W. Gerard, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leo-hindery-jr/job-creation_b_1517730.html] )

The big immediate opportunity, however….to turn over and really roar.


Economic decline makes war highly likely

Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215

Less intuitive is how periods of ….considered ancillary to those views.

Advantage 2 is Oil Dependence:

Oil dependence in transportation guarantees peak oil and global resource wars---only high-speed rail solves
Perl 11/19/11 (Professor of Urban Studies and Political Science at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, "How Green is High Speed Rail", CNN, http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/18/world/how-green-is-hsr/index.html)

Any debate about the future …. consumption sooner, rather than later.

The plan resolves oil dependence quickly
USHSRA 12 – (US High Speed Rail Association, “ENERGY SECURITY”, http://www.ushsr.com/benefits/energysecurity.html)

A national high speed rail system ….practical, economical, or sustainable way.

Oil dependence makes us vulnerable to oil shocks – only a move away via transportation solves
Ebinger 6/11/12 – An energy policy advisor to over 50 governments on restructuring their state-owned energy sectors, privatization and the creation of regulatory regimes, former professor of electricity economics at Johns Hopkins, named a "Nuclear Energy Expert" by the Nuclear Energy Institute (Charles, Brookings, “Five Major Energy Problems the Next President Has to Face”, http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2012/06/11-energy-climate-ebinger-avasarala)

The first of these, the Arab Spring….as well as changes in consumer preference.

U.S. dependence means shocks cause nuclear war
Qasem 7 - Islam Yasin Qasem, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Politics and Social Sciences at the University of Pompeu Fabra (UPF) in Barcelona, MA in International Affairs from Columbia, July 9, 2007, “The Coming Warfare of Oil Shortage,” online: http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_islam_ya_070709_the_coming_warfare_o.htm

Recognizing the strategic value ….pursues of national interests are high.

Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its investment for an express train infrastructure system.

Contention 3 is Solvency:

Models prove there will be significant ridership
Cox 11 – (John, California Watch, “High-speed rail panel cites improvements in ridership model”, http://californiawatch.org/dailyreport/high-speed-rail-panel-cites-improvements-ridership-model-12562)

Vote negative to reject the affirmative. Prioritizing the alternative creates real politics.
Butler, professor of rhetoric at Berkeley, 2009 p. 2-4 (Judith, Frames of War)

The precarity of life imposes an obligation….which limits the finality of any of its effects.

==States== 
Text --- In an appropriate test case, the United States Supreme Court should issue a narrow ruling that federal authority over the intelligent transportation system commandeers the states’ legislative functions in violation of the 10th and 11th Amendments. The Supreme Court should devolve authority of this narrow ruling to the State Governments and United States Territories.
The 50 States and relevant U.S. territories should substantially increase its investment in the deployment of Intelligent Transportation Infrastructure, including but not limited to smart antenna, in the United Sates

The Court can make this ruling and devolve power to the states –it won’t be rolled back

GUAM – By the time the 8,500….may need to rise to $1.3 billion.

Voting issue ---

1. Limits --- they explode them- too many small military operations and bases, foreign outweighs- can invest anywhere in the globe- makes neg research impossible

2. Ground --- kills privatization and states- key to test against new affs, no DA’s to small affs- lit is one sided- generics don’t apply to international policy

==Fiscal Cliff==

Strategic stability in the region….substantial risk for the entire world.

==PPP== 

The United States federal government should provide investment in the Next Generation Air Traffic Management System exclusively to areas in which private actors guarantee at least one-third of the funding upfront for a minimum of twenty years. In negotiating these partnerships, the United States federal government should open infrastructure plans to modification, including the possible transfer of project ownership to private actors. The federal government should make all necessary regulatory changes to encourage greater public-private partnerships in the area of air traffic control systems and NextGen and provide necessary technical assistance for implementation.

B. Violation – The aff invests in technology to be used on transportation infrastructure – not the infrastructure itself
C. Voting Issue
a. Limits – We can never predict the amount of accessories they can put on all different transportation infrastructure programs
b. Ground – They justify small affs that can spike out of core stimulus DAs and garner advantages from cheap shot federal key warrants
