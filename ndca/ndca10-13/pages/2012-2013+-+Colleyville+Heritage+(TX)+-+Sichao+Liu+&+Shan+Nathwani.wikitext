**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 13pt;">Interpretation – </span>****<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 13pt;">Transportation infrastructure is facilities – that’s distinct from vehicles</span>**

__<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">As a definition for transport infrastructure we use those immovable capital goods for transport which are characterized by a considerable degree of economies of scale</span>__<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 8pt;"> so that it is usually supplied as a collective input into production. As a consequence, the government has a high degree of control on the level of supply, price, and/or quality. </span>__<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Transport infrastructure includes facilities such as railway lines, railway stations, highways, canals, seaports, and airports</span>__<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 8pt;">. As indicated in Table l, transport infrastructure investments have both temporary and nontemporary effects on the economy. A major temporary effect concerns the stimulation of employment and income during the construction phase via the demand side.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 13pt;">Vehicles are distinct from transportation infrastructure</span>**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 8pt;">Transportation or transport is the carrying of people and goods from one destination to another. The term comes from the Latin trans meaning “across” and //portare//meaning “to carry”. </span>__<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Transportation can be divided into three distinct fields</span>__<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 8pt;">: 1. </span>__<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Infrastructure -</span>__ <span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 8pt;">When we refer to infrastructure it includes </span>__<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">our transport networks such as roads, railways, airways, canals, and pipeline</span>__<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 8pt;">. This also includes the terminals or nodes such as </span>__<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">airports, railway stations, bus stations, and seaports</span>__<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 8pt;">. 2. </span>__<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Vehicle – These comprises of the vehicles that we regularly ride in the networks</span>__<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 8pt;">for instance automobiles (buses, cars, taxis, and etc.), trains and airplanes. 3. Operations – They are the control of the whole transport system including traffic lights/signals on roads, ramp meters, railroad switches, air traffic control, and etc.</span>

__<span style="font-family: Arial;">A land grant is a gift of real estate made to an individual by the government or other authorized agency for services rendered, in particular, for military services performed.</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> Colonial Times. Beginning in the 16th century, land grants were given to individuals and organizations as a means to establish farms, missions, and settlements. England and Spain gave land grants from the land they claimed in America to their people in order to set up colonies in the New World. Early laws required settlers who received land grants to cultivate the land (planting and seeding laws) and build a house on the land. Failure to do this resulted in the land being returned to the government that granted the land. After the Revolutionary War. After the Revolutionary War nine states (Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia) offered 35,000 land grants to war veterans and/or their survivors as a repayment for the military services they performed. 19th Century. In the 19th century, 4 our of 5 of the United States' transcontinental railroads were built using land-grant incentives. </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">Present Day. There has been no use of land grants since the conclusion of the Spanish American War. </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">Land Grant Universities. The original purpose of a land grant college or university was to teach agriculture, military tactics, mechanic arts and classical studies so that members of the lower and middle classes could obtain and afford a liberal and practical education. A land grant university is a college or university that was designated by Congress to receive the benefits of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. There is at least one land grant university in every state in the United States.</span>

__<span style="font-family: Arial;">The federal budget, which presents the government’s expenditures</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> and revenues for each fiscal year, serves many purposes. It </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">enables policymakers to allocate resources to serve national objectives, provides the basis for agencies’ management of federal programs</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">, gives the Treasury needed information for its management of cash and the public debt, and provides businesses and individuals with information to make an informed assessment about the government’s stewardship of the public’s money and resources</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">.

__<span style="font-family: Arial;">Cash equivalents </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">are also highly liquid assets. These assets </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">can</span>____<span style="font-family: Arial;">be converted into cash quickly and tend not to lose value in the process.</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> Examples of cash equivalents include commercial paper (a short-term debt instrument), money market funds, your savings and checking account money and Treasury bills. </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">On financial statements, cash equivalents are totaled in value with cash</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">. Loren Nikolai, author of the textbook "Intermediate Accounting," explains </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">cash equivalents must, by definition, have a maturity date of less than three months.</span>__

__<span style="font-family: Arial;">Long-term investments are less liquid than cash and cash equivalents</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">. Because some of these assets lose value if they are converted before their maturity dates, the owner cannot convert them to cash with ease. Examples of long-term investments are certificates of deposit (CDs), Roth IRAs, bonds and other assets you plan to hold for at least a year. </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">Inventory and physical items such as</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> plants, </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">property</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> and equipment </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">are</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> other </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">assets, but they are not very liquid.

__<span style="font-family: Arial;">The purpose of the cash flow statement is to report how an organization generated and used its cash. Knowing where the cash comes from is important in projecting whether cash will be generated from those sources in the future. Knowing where the cash goes is important in assessing the organization’s future cash needs.</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> When presenting cash flow statements, most companies combine cash and cash equivalents because short-term investments classified as cash equivalents are used primarily as a substitute for cash.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Too many factors affect the value of land – its near impossible to quantify its value. Different people see different values in land – means its value is arbitrary</span>**

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">While the economics of these lands are complex, it is clear that open landscapes managed by the BLM are valuable on many levels. </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">Beyond the easily quantifiable value of </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">public </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">lands, such as the revenue provided by oil and gas production, many economic benefits are more subtly expressed</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">. For example, Las Cienegas National Conservation Area (NCA) and surrounding lands southeast of Tucson, Arizona, are the exclusive source for drinking water for thousands of residents in eastern Pima County. This </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">water is clearly a huge economic asset</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> for the region, yet </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">placing a specific value on it would challenge most economists.</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> Similarly, riparian areas on BLM lands function as natural, low-cost, flood control systems. When these streamside landscapes are altered by development, use, or resource extraction, alternate sources of water and flood protection are needed, and they are costly. </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">An estimated 22 million people</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> in the West </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">reside within 25 minutes of lands managed by the BLM. This proximity provides yet more economic value derived from agency lands. A study</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> by two University of Arizona economics professors </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">found that two popular birding sites in southern Arizona have significant economic value.</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> The San Pedro Riparian NCA and Ramsey Canyon, a nearby preserve managed by The Nature Conservancy, add as much as $16.9 million to the area each year in tourist spending and generate up to 590 jobs spread throughout dozens of local businesses</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">. It is significantly more straightforward to measure the economic impact of visitors</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> to public lands </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">than to quantify the value of critically important factors such as clean air and clean water.</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> As a result, too much emphasis is placed on those studies and too little on the much more significant economic benefits of the public lands that are simply harder to quantify, yet no less valuable. </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">Another area of study is the extent to which public lands attract bright, creative people and their capital, jobs, and innovation. Open spaces</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> such as those administered by the BLM </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">may well exert a substantial economic impact from their ability to attract well-educated and highly paid workers</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">—not just in resource development, but in aerospace, health care, higher education, finance and other fields. </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">These workers are attracted to cities that maintain a connection to wild spaces while cultivating a mature and sophisticated economy,</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> such as Tucson and Sierra Vista, Arizona; Grand Junction, Colorado; and Las Vegas, Nevada. A good example is Sonoran Desert National Monument, a 487,000-acre BLM natural area located just beyond the sprawling golf course developments of the Phoenix metropolitan area. </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">Local economic development officials market and support this and other conservation areas, knowing that these conserved lands help attract highly skilled workers who participate in hiking, mountain biking, and other outdoor recreational activities at a higher rate than the general population.</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> While the most significant impacts of conserved public lands are indeed difficult to quantify, it is important that we do so in order to gain a better understanding of the actual economic and community benefits, and costs, of decisions regarding the conservation and development of public lands.</span>

__<span style="font-family: Arial;">Grants are a form of federal assistance consisting of payments in cash or in kind for a specified purpose</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> and they represent an important tool for achieving national objectives. They vary greatly, including in the types of programs they fund, the methods they use to allocate funds to recipients, and the amount of discretion they give to the grant recipient on how the funds are spent. </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">The</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> Office of Management and Budget (O</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">MB) has previously estimated that grants to state and local governments represent roughly 80 percent of all federal grant funding</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">, with the balance going to recipients such as nonprofit organizations, research institutions, or individuals. In a time of fiscal constraint, continuing to support the current scope and breadth of federal grants to state and local governments will be a challenge.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">The aff has misinterpreted the definitions. Capital spending means spending in capital, not spending capital</span>**

__<span style="font-family: Arial;">In general, capital refers to an investment in goods or services that provide benefits over a period of time after their acquisition. However, a substantial portion of governmental spending could be viewed as providing a stream of benefits over an extended period, beyond those activities typically associated with the term “capital.”1 Specific definitions of capital can vary significantly depending on the purpose. Some definitions focus narrowly on physical infrastructure, such as highways and buildings; others focus more broadly and include intangibles</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">, such as investment in education and social services. Such differentiation greatly affects the scope of what is considered capital. Each classification has potential shortcomings: </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">A broad definition might encompass so many activities as to make the categorization unhelpful</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> and could invite criticism that a capital budget would simply be a device for understating the cost of federal spending; </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">a narrow definition could lead to a bias against spending that does not directly result in the acquisition of physical assets</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

Thus, a father of an illegitimate child is a "parent" only if he complies with one of the five provisions set out in 38 U.S.C. § 765(9). In applying the restrictive definition, it is apparent that while all "parents" are fathers not all fathers are "parents" under the Act.

Since 1991, </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">one-tenth of the Surface Transportation program has to be spent on nonroad “enhancements” to address projects, such as bicycle and pedestrian facilities, historic preserva- tion, and scenic easements</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">.27 </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">__The other items need no explanation, except perhaps the $660 million for the Puerto Rico Highway Program. These funds are definitely for roads, but not for roads traveled by those who pay into the FHTF, as Puerto Rico road users do not pay fuel taxes into the fund__. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">The total of all the “nonroad” items comes to 25.05 per cent—it comprises about a quarter of the expenditure from the FHTF. In other words, at least a quarter of every fuel tax dollar goes to something other than highways. Other estimates have shown that the leakage from the trust fund is as high as 38.5 percent.28</span>

CTS inherits from computer science the aspects of distributed and decentralized computing and spatiotemporal information processing, and from transportation science the aspects of transportation control and management. </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">The discipline goes beyond vehicular technology, and addresses pedestrian systems on handheld devices, non-real-time issues such as data mining, as well as data management issues above the networking layer. CTS studies how to improve </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">the safety, mobility, efficiency, and sustainability of </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">the transport system by taking advantage of information technologies and ubiquitous computing.</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> In particular it needs scholars and practitioners that maintain a body of knowledge and push forward an agenda that is deeply rooted in both established disciplines. We are also the first to admit that drawing the lines between the established and the emerging discipline is to some extent arbitrary. The intention of claiming an emerging discipline is by no means exclusive or divisive; rather it is to draw together work that is otherwise disconnected, and to foster research in this area through recognition.
