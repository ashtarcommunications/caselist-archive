<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Folks, we're here to sell the only thing worth selling or buying and that's immortality. Now here is the simplest sol</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">ution and well on the way. Just replace the worn-out parts and keep the old heap on the road indefinitely."</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">As transplant techniques are perfected and refined, the age-old dream of immortality is now within the grasp of mankind. But who is to decide out of a million applicants for the same heart?</span>There simply aren't enough parts to go around. You need the job lot once a year to save 20 percent, folks. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Big executives use a heart a month just as regular as clockwork. Warlords, paying off their soldiers in livers and kidneys and genitals, depopulate whole areas. Vast hospital cities cover the land from the air-conditioned hospital palaces of the rich, radiating out to field hospitals and open-air operating booths. The poor are rising in mobs. They are attacking government warehouses where the precious parts are stored. Everyone who can afford it has dogs and guards to protect himself from roving bands of parts hunters, like the dreaded Wild Doctors, who operate on each other after the battle, cutting the warm quivering parts from the dead and dying. Cut-and-grab men dart out of doorways and hack out a kidney with a few expert strokes of their four-inch scalpels. People have lost all shame. Here's a man who sold his daughter's last kidney to buy himself a new groin-appears on TV to appeal for funds to buy little Sally an artificial kidney and give her this last Christmas. On his arm is a curvaceous blond known apparently as Bubbles. She calls him Long John; now isn't that cute?</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">A flourishing black market in parts grows up in the gutted cities devastated by parts riots. In terrible slums, scenes from Brueghel and Bosch are reenacted; misshapen masses of rotten scar tissue crawling with maggots supported on crutches and cains, in wheel-chairs and carts.…Brutal-as-butchers practitioners operate without anesthetic in open-air booths surrounded by their bloody knives and saws…the poor wait in parts lines for diseased genitals, a cancerous lung, a cirrhotic liver.They crawl towards the operating booths holding forth nameless things in bottles--that they think are usable parts. Shameless swindlers who buy up operating garbage in job lots prey on the unwary.</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">And here is Mr. Rich Parts. He is three hundred years old. He is still subject to accidental death, and the mere thought of it throws him into paroxysms of idiotterror. For days he cowers in his bunker, two hundred feet down in solid rock, food for fifty years. A trip from one city to another requires months of sifting and checking computerized plans and alternate routes to avoid the possibility of an accident. His idiotic cowardice knows no bounds. There he sits, looking like a Chimu vase with a thick layer of smooth purple scar tissue. Encased as he is in this armor, his movements are slow and hydraulic. It takes him ten minutes to sit down. This layer gets thicker and thicker right down to the bone-the doctors have to operate with power tools. So we leave Mr. Rich Parts and the picturesque parts people their monument, a mountain of scar tissue.</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Mr. Hubbard, said: "The rightest right a man could be would be to live infinitely wrong." I wrote "wrong" for "long" and the slip is significant--for the means by which immortality is realized in science fiction, which will soon be science fact, are indeed infinitely wrong, the wrongest wrong a man can be, vampiric or worse.</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Improved transplant techniques open the question whether the ego itself could be transplanted</span> from one body to another, and the further question as to exactly where this entity resides. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Here is Mr. Hart, a trillionaire dedicated to his personal immortality. Where is this thing called Mr. Hart? Precisely where, in the human nervous system, does this ugly death-sucking, death-dealing, death-fearing thing reside…? Science gives only a tentative answer: the "ego" seems to be located in the midbrain at the top of the head. Well he thinks couldn't we just scoop it out of a healthy youth, throw his in the garbage where it belongs, and slide in MEEEEEEEE?</span> So he starts looking for a brain surgeon, a "scrambled egg" man, and he wants the best. When it comes to a short-order job old Doc Zeit is tops. He can switch eggs in an alley.

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Mr. Hart embodies the competitive, acquisitive, success-minded spirit that formulated American capitalism. The logical extension of this ugly spirit is criminal. Success is its own justification. He who succeeds deserves to succeed; he is RIGHT. The operation is a success.</span> The doctors have discreetly withdrawn. When a man wakes up in a beautiful new bod, he can flip out. It wouldn't pay to be a witness. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Mr. Hart stands up and stretches luxuriously in his new body. He runs his hands over the lean young muscle where his potbelly used to be. All that remains of the donor is a blob of gray matter in a dish. Mr. Hart puts his hands on his hips and leans over the blob.</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">"And how wrong can you be? DEAD."</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">He spits on it and he spits ugly.</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The final convulsions of a universe based on quantitative factors, like money, junk, and time, would seem to be at hand.

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The 1AC constructs transportation infrastructure as a problem of quantity. They assume that there is some amount increase or improvement that will alleviate the conditions of the poverty and violence. This is a false dream. Capitalism, language, and the subject trap us in the politics of time. The time for business as usual is up. In place of the plan we offer a moment of rupture, a moment that resists the politics of business as usual and prepares us for space travel.</span>**

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Lydenberg ’87 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Robin, Associate Prof of English at Boston College, “Word Cultures: Radical Theory and Practice in William S. Burroughs’ Fiction.” p. 52-53)</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The reversibility and flexibility of</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the cut-up text suggests the possibility of a flight, of continual evolution and change. Instead of condensed liquefaction into a single image, Burroughs creates</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">in his experimental writing- particularlyin the cut-up narratives-</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">a random and infinite variety of implosions and explosions, the pulsing rhythm of life itself.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Medical experiements in //Naked Lunch// amuse themselves by arresting or cutting off the life cycle of “tension discharge rest” at the moment of extreme tension: “what would be result of administering curare plus iron lung during acute mania? Possibly the subject, unable to discharge his tensions in motor activity, would succumb on the spot like a jungle rat. Interesting cause of death, what?” (NL 131). </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The cut-up</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">texts </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">offer[s] an antidote to</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">this </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">terminal paralylsis in metonymic condensations that always lead to explosion, dissemination, expansion. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The cycle is always recharged: “You in the Word and the Word in You is a word-lock […] the word-lock that is You, Stop, Change. Start again. Lighten your own life sentence” (TM 61). On a most concrete and obvious level, Burroughs’ own texts resist finality by being constantly reissued in different versions, fragments large and small surfacing in new works and new contexts. The original publication dates of three cut-up novels- The Soft Machine (1961), The Ticket That Exploded (1962) and Nova Express (1964)- suggest a sequence in which the critic might discover some coherent progression or development. Burroughs’ habit of substantially revising manuscripts for each new edition, however, makes any rigid adherence to such a linear model rather awkward. Thus, in addition tot eh common base of fictional material which feeds all the cut-up novels and thus blurs their boundaries, each individual text is subject to the indeterminancy of continual revision. Beyond his challenge to the limitations of conventional linear narrative, Burroughs also attacks the equally restrictive linearity of literary history. A bibliography of Burroughs’ work reads rather like Borges’ catalogue of the writings of the apocryphal Pierre Menard, whose technique of “deliberate anocronism” turns history inside out. The trilogy of cut-up novels has been described by Philippe Mikriammos as a false trilogy, a single book completed in three versions, under three different angles (//William Burroughs// 77). As we shall see in examining th three novels, the prose itself reflects this resistance to closure. Burroughs’ style tends to “anamorphosis,” “It rubs itself out and rewrites itself” (Lemaire 23). The Method: Vigilance and the Risks of Chance. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Released from the burden of subjectivity</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, of authorship and ownership</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, the cut-up text opens up possibilities for what Burroughs calls “space/time travel.”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Such futuristic journeys call for detachment, for scientific rigor and control. While Burroughs had already brought literature and science together in //Naked Lunch//, in the cut-up narratives he makes this connection even more explicit. He insists, for example, that his cut-up techniques are not arguments or “positions” but scientific experiments. The practical work of the writer is a continuous experiment; daily life is transcribed by Burroughs into scrapbook mosaics of word and image, into notebooks and diaries where clippings and photographs are accumulated and coordinated with a variety of texts.</span>

**With this in mind we offer the following: [insert cut up plan text]**

**We return to Burroughs’s discussion of capitalism run amuck:**

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">I postulate that true immortality can only be found in space.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Space exploration is the only goal worth striving for. Over the hills and far away.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> You will know your enemies by those who block your path. Vampiric monopolists would keep you in time like their cattle. “It’s a good thing cows don’t fly,” they say with an evil chuckle. The evil intelligent slave gods. The gullible confused and stupid pose an equal threat owing to the obstructive potential of vast numbers</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I have an interesting slip in my scrapbook. News clipping from The Boulder Camera. Picture of an old woman with a death’s head false teeth smile. She is speaking for the Women’s Christian Temperance Union. “WE OPPOSE CHILD ABUSE, INTEMPERANCE AND IMMORTALITY.” </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The way to immortality is in space and Christianity is buried under slag heaps of dead dogma, sniveling prayers; and empty prayers must oppose immortality in space as the counterfeit always fears and hates the real thing. Resurgent Islam . . . born-again Christians . . . creeds outworn . . . excess baggage . . . 'raus 'mit!Immortality isprolonged future, and the future of any artifact lies in the direction of increased flexibility capacity for change and ultimately mutation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Immortality may be seen as a by-product of function: "</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">to shine in use." Mutation involves changes that are literally unimaginable from the perspective of the future mutant.Coldblooded, non-dreaming creatures living in the comparatively weightless medium of water could not conceive of breathing air, dreaming, and experiencing the force of gravity as a basic fact of life. There will be new fears like the fear of falling, new pleasures, and new necessities. There are distinct advantages to living in a supportive medium like water. Mutation is not a matter of logical choices. The human mutants must take a step into the unknown, a step that no human has taken before. "We were the first that ever burst into that silent sea." “We are such stuff as dreams are made on.”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Recent dream research has turned up a wealth of data but no one has assembled the pieces into a workable field theory. By far the most significant discovery to emerge from precise dream research with volunteer subjects is the fact that dreams are a biological necessity for all warm-blooded animals. Deprived from REM sleep, they show all the symptoms of sleeplessness no matter how much dreamless sleep they are allowed. Continued deprivation would result in death. All dreams in male subjects except nightmares are accompanied by erection. No one has proffered an explanation. It is interesting to not that a male chimpanzee who did finger dab paintings, and was quite good too, went into a sexual frenzy during his creative acts. Cold-blooded animals do not dream. All warm-blooded creatures including birds do dream. John Dunne discovered that dreams contain references to future time as experienced by the dreamer. He published his findings An Experiment With Time in 1924. Dream references, he points out, relate not to the event itself but to the time when the subject learns of the event. The dream refers to the future of the dreamer. He says that anybody who will write his dreams down over a period of time will turn up precognitive references. Dreams involve time travel. Does it follow then that time travel is a necessity? I quote from an article summarizing the discoveries of Professor Michel Jouvet. Jouvet, using rapid eye movement techniques, has been able to detect dreaming in animals in the womb, even developing birds in the egg. He found that animals like calves and foals, who can fend for themselves immediately after birth, dream a lot in the womb and relatively little after that. Humans and kittens dream less in the womb and are unable to fend for themselves at birth. He concluded that human babies could not walk or feed themselves until they had enough practice in dreams. This indicates that </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the function of dreams is the train the being for future conditions.I postulate that the human artifact is biologically designed for space travel. So human dreams can be seen as training for space conditions. Deprived of this vital link with our future in space, with no reason for living, we die. Art serves the same function as dreams. Plato’s Republic is a blueprint for a death camp. An alien invader, or domestic elite, bent on conquest and extermination, would rapidly immobilize the earth by cutting dream lines, just the way we took care of the Indians.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I quote from Black Elk Speaks by John Neihardt (Pocket Books): “</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The nation’s hoop is broken and scattered like a ring of smoke. There is no center any more. The sacred tree is dead and all its birds are gone.”</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Ben/Dropbox/BFBW%20Debate%202012-2013/Krawtiks/Burroughs/Immortality%201NC.doc#_ftn2|[2]]]</span>

**Finally, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">however the cut-up alone only shows us the door. To achieve immortality we must be prepared to take a step into the unknown. Burroughs’ Immortality represents the moment when art leaves the frame </span>and maps itself onto the world. This implosion of the boundary between reality and fiction unwrites static notions of truth perpetuated by the masters and colonizers. Writing fiction onto the world therefore sets the stage for the storytelling of the poor, which fuses a revolutionary force out of the atomized subjects of oppression.**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Timothy S., U of CA, “Wising Up The Marks: The Amodern William Burroughs”]</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Burroughs's literary career is defined by the</span> central <span style="font-size: 11pt;">challenge</span> he sets himself: <span style="font-size: 11pt;">to find an escape route from the linked control systems of capital, subjectivity, and language.</span> His early novels, from Junky (J, 1953) to Naked Lunch (NL, 1959), address the accelerating dialectic of capitalist control of American society, a form of control that functions by transforming the individual into the "addict agent" who is the mirror image of the controller. These novels also articulate a critique of the "administered life" that parallels Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment. He examines the reversibility of hostile social relations and the symmetry of opposed political factions, and he articulates his theory that language, which is a virus that uses the human body as a host, constitutes the most powerful form of control. In these works Burroughs, like Horkheimer and Adorno, cannot yet imagine a form of revolutionary practice to counter these forms of control; <span style="font-size: 11pt;">society appears trapped between the horns of capitalism's constitutive dialectic, which liquidates the singularity of the individual as well as the connections of community in order to produce the false universality of profit.</span> As Burroughs writes later, money "eats quality and shits out quantity" (Burroughs and Odier 74), a situation that the writer cannot change but can only reveal. These works constitute what we might call the modernist subset of his writing. In the aleatory Nova trilogy (196167), however, Burroughs recognizes the sterile form of the dialectic itself as his primary enemy and attempts to escape it by destroying the linguistic control system of syntax and by simultaneously abolishing the dialectical form of the Law. All of his subsequent texts can be understood as increasingly systematic and sophisticated attempts to evade the dialectic, which continually returns in unexpected forms to reinscribe Burroughs's revolutionary enterprise within despotic capital and language; in this, Burroughs's development quite strongly resembles that of Deleuze. 6 In their formal and thematic focus on language, however, the novels of the trilogy abet the postmodern turn away from historical potential and toward structural foreclosure. The "cut-up" experiments eventually lead him out of the cynicism of the Nova trilogy's reflexive postmodernism, however, and toward a renewed commitment to social change; in The Wild Boys and his recent works, Burroughs seeks ways to organize resistance to the new forms of control in the construction of revolutionary fantasies that can produce new social groups. In The Wild Boys (WB, 1971), these countercultural fantasies are still conceived as dialectically destructive forces that negate the given social order but refuse to offer new forms of social organization; thus their failure, like the failure of the radical student movements that inspired them, follows from the persistence of the dialectic. The trilogy Cities of the Red Night (C), The Place of Dead Roads (P), and The Western Lands (WL; 198187) continues this destructive task, but it also offers affirmative ways to reorganize society in order to avoid the powerful dialectics of social and linguistic control. Such reorganization, finally, necessitates a change of terrain for Burroughs's work. He concludes The Western Lands with the admission that "he had reached the end of words, the end of what can be done with words. And then?" (WL 258) The open question suggests that something more is still to be done once language is abandoned. Deleuze uses very similar terms to describe what he sees as the task of revolutionary literature: "This modern literature uncovers a 'strange language within language' and, through an unlimited number of superimposed grammatical constructions, tends towards an atypical form of expression that marks the end of language as such (here we may cite such examples as Mallarmé's book, . . . Artaud's breaths, the agrammaticality of Cummings, Burroughs and his cut-ups and fold-ins, as well as [Raymond] Roussel's proliferations . . . and so on)."7<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The labor of eliminating the dialectic, and with the dialectic its handmaidens language, capital, and the human subject must take us into different realms</span>; accordingly, this study will conclude by tracing the extension of Burroughs's literary project into film and recording to suggest what can happen after "the end of words." This entire project is contained, potentially, in Burroughs's proclamation that "Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted." This phrase is his famous battle-cry against social and personal control, a slogan explicitly cribbed from the legendary Ismâ'îlî holy man-cum-terrorist Hassan i Sabbah. The phrase is quoted in most of Burroughs's books from the Nova trilogy onward, and it serves to conclude the "Invocation" that opens his most recent trilogy (C xviii). In the 1989 text "Apocalypse" (written as the introduction to a Keith Haring exhibition catalog and read by Burroughs on his first compact disc, Dead City Radio), Burroughs offers his own gloss on the phrase: <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Consider an apocalyptic statement: "Nothing is true, everything is permitted"</span>Hassan i Sabbah, the Old Man of the Mountain. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Not to be interpreted as an invitation to</span> all manner of <span style="font-size: 11pt;">unrestrained</span> and <span style="font-size: 11pt;">destructive behavior</span>; that would be a minor episode, which would run its course. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Everything is permitted because nothing is true. It is all make-believe, illusion, dream, art. When art leaves the frame, and the written word leaves the page, not merely the physical frame and page, but the frames and pages of assigned categories, a basic disruption of reality occurs. The literal realization of art. Success will write "apocalypse" across the sky. </span> It is a question of causality and condition: if something is true, then something else must be maligned and prohibited by the Law as false, but<span style="font-size: 11pt;">if nothing is true</span> - which is to say if there is no such thing as essential truth - <span style="font-size: 11pt;">then there can be no prohibition, no Law, and everything is permitted. And it is permitted precisely in the form of creative art, whose only condition and referent is itself. The "basic disruption of reality"</span> which Burroughs demands is neither the modern disruption of traditional structures of value, nor the postmodern disruption of modernist mythologizing; rather, it <span style="font-size: 11pt;">is the "literal realization of art," a realization which simultaneously requires the destruction of art as a separate category, as a mirror to nature and life. "[A]rt leaves the frame, and the written word leaves the page" in order to change material reality, not by asserting some essential truth that they alone could preserve against the ideological falsity of reality, but by multiplying and disseminating the creative power of the false, the untrue, the forgery.</span> Art is falsehood or lie because it does not find its proof outside itself, through a process of truthful representaion, but within itself, as Friedrich Nietzsche and Oscar Wilde argued. In much the same spirit, Deleuze specifies that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the apocalyptic project of art is "not simply to eliminate fiction but to free it from the model of truth which penetrates it, and on the contrary to rediscover the pure and simple story-telling function </span>[fonction de fabulation] which is opposed to this model. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">What is opposed to fiction is not the real; it is not the truth which is always that of the masters or colonizers, it is the story-telling of the poor, in so far as it gives the false the power which makes it into a memory, a legend or a monster"</span> (Deleuze, Cinema-2150). <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Such a memory or monster acts as a catalyst that precipitates a fused, revolutionary force out of the atomized subjects of oppression.</span>This powerful story-telling or fabulatory function is the goal to which Burroughs in his novels and Deleuze in his philosophy spire.

**__Infrastructure encompasses existing__** **__transportation__****__,__** **__communication__** **__and__** **__utility__** **__networks__**. Rebuilding the physical infrastructure of a community improves the local business climate and is critical to the redevelopment of distressed neighborhoods. Infrastructure gets people to their jobs and goods and services to their markets. Many distressed neighborhoods suffer from inadequate infrastructure, decreasing their access to economic opportunities and their ability to integrate into wider city, national, and international markets. Programs to build roads, provide water and waste removal, and offer telecommunications services all bestow substantial economic benefits such as job and business creation and retention to a community. Additionally, modernizing physical infrastructure can help improve the image of a distressed neighborhood.
