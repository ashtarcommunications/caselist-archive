===<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">1ac risk</span>=== 

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Contention Three is Existential Risk:</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Accurate assessment of existential risk is both possible and necessary to meaningful decision-making</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We need realistic pictures of what the future might bring in order to make sound</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">AND</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">. Our actual epistemic location is some offshore place in that gulf.5</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Applying THREE simple principles is key to facilitate accurate impact comparison:</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">First, time-frame is irrelevant – multiplying probability by magnitude is the only way to accommodate uncertainty</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">These concerns are not remotely futuristic - we will surely confront them within next 10</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">AND</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">- and deserve special attention from scientists, policy-makers and ethicists.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A general principle underlying the heuristics-and-biases program is that human beings</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">AND</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">since, obviously, humanity has never yet encountered an extinction event.2</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Third, disjunction outweighs conjunction – the simple probability that a stronger economy and smarter decision-making can mitigate extinction is mathematically greater than the cumulative probability of their internal link chain</span>

Nick Bostrom and Milan Cirkovic, 2008, http://singinst.org/upload/cognitive-biases.pdf)</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This means reducing existential risk by even a tiny amount through our proximate and terminal filters is much more valuable than avoiding one particular impact scenario</span>

Slow growth will persist now – only creating an NIB before pursuing deficit reduction can increase growth rates and insulate the economy from crisis in Europe and China

Global Productivity's Long Decline Slow growth of the world economy and rising unemployment in the

===1ac Ex-Im=== 
Advantage Two is the Export – Import Bank:
Recent reauthorization is insufficient to sustain Ex-Im – a substantial increase in loan authority is key

Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, we have spent months in this House

National coordination of infrastructure investments is vital to support any export strategy

The Obama Administration is deeply committed to expanding globally competitive manufacturing, exports, and

In the American Jobs Act, President Obama reiterated his call for a national infrastructure
AND
green light is all that’s needed to begin rebuilding America and creating jobs.

Effectiveness is key to sustain political support for free trade and prevent domestic protectionism
Richardson 1 (J. David Richardson, visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics, professor of economics and international relations at Syracuse University, “Exports Matter...And So Does Trade Finance,” Chapter 5, The Ex-Im Bank in the 21st Century: A New Approach?, eds.

This chapter argues that deep US export dependence is a good thing— as is
AND
of US marker, cultural, and political information to foreign interests.17

This also deters foreign protectionism and guarantees commitment to trade – resolves any alternate causes
Summers 1 (Lawrence H. Summers, 71st Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, “Continuing the Fight against International Trade Finance Subsidies,” Chapter 20, The Ex-Im Bank in the 21st Century: A New Approach?, eds. Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Rita M. Rodriguez, January 2001, http://www.piie.com/publications/chapters_preview/323/5iie3004.pdf)
In the 65 years since the creation of the US Export-Import Bank,
AND
trade, and corrode the ideals upon which official development assistance Is based.

Otherwise, escalating trade disputes will overwhelm existing settlement mechanisms – results in an uncontrollable wave of global protectionism
Xie 10-11 (Andy Xie, “The End of the WTO's Golden Era,” Caixin Online, 10-11-2012, http://english.caixin.com/2012-10-11/100445876_all.html)
Globalization has been on a rapid pace for two decades. Trade has been rising
AND
be stuck around 2 to 2.5 percent. So would trade.

Global protectionism makes all scenarios for transnational threats and nuclear conflict more likely
Panzner 9 (Michael Panzner, Prof. at the New York Institute of Finance, 25-year veteran of the global stock, bond, and currency markets who has worked in New York and London for HSBC, Soros Funds, ABN Amro, Dresdner Bank, and JPMorgan Chase, Financial Armageddon: Protect Your Future from Economic Collapse, 2009, p. 136-138)
Continuing calls for curbs on the flow of finance and trade will inspire the United
AND
between Muslims and Western societies as the beginnings of a new world war.

And, our impacts are reverse causal and empirically validated – maintaining a commitment to free trade is key to all forms of peace-building – we control the proximate cause of conflict
Griswold 11 (Daniel Griswold is director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute and author of Mad about Trade: Why Main Street America Should Embrace Globalization. “Free Trade and the Global Middle Class,” Hayek Society Journal Vol. 9 http://www.cato.org/pubs/articles/Hayek-Society-Journal-Griswold.pdf)
