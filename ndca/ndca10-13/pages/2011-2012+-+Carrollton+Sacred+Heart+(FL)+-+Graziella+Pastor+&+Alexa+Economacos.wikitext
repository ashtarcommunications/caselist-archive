On February 1, 2003, all seven crew members of the Columbia space shuttle died in a midair disintegration accident. The accident investigation committee concluded that heat-insulating foam fell oﬀ the external tank and damaged the thermal protection tiles on the leading edge of the left wing. Hot gas entered the left wing during atmospheric reentry causing the midair disintegration. After the Columbia accident, NASA suspended shuttle launches. Consequently, the operation period of the International Space Station (ISS), which is due to be completed in 2010, may be extended for various reasons. Extending the ISS operation period may require maintenance, improvements, and repair to damage caused by collisions with debris. When considering ambitious future space development programs, such as the construction of a lunar base, solar power satellites, and other space structures, we clearly need to establish safe space welding and processing technologies.

PC doesn’t influence the passage of legislation
Dickinson, 09 – professor of political science at Middlebury College and taught previously at Harvard University where he worked under the supervision of presidential scholar Richard Neustadt (5/26/09, Matthew, Presidential Power: A NonPartisan Analysis of Presidential Politics, “Sotomayor, Obama and Presidential Power,” <span style="background-color: initial;">[[http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/]]</span>)
As for Sotomayor, from here the path toward almost certain confirmation goes as follows: the Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to hold hearings sometime this summer (this involves both written depositions and of course open hearings), which should lead to formal Senate approval before Congress adjourns for its summer recess in early August. So Sotomayor will likely take her seat in time for the start of the new Court session on October 5. (I talk briefly about the likely politics of the nomination process below).
What is of more interest … present Sotomayor as his nominee.
If we want to measure Obama’s “power”, then, we need to know what his real preference was and why he chose Sotomayor. My guess – and it is only a guess – is that after conferring with leading Democrats and Republicans, he recognized the overriding practical political advantages accruing from choosing an Hispanic woman, with left-leaning credentials. We cannot know if this would have been his ideal choice based on judicial philosophy alone, but presidents are never free to act on their ideal preferences. Politics is the art of the possible. Whether Sotomayer is his first choice or not, however, her nomination is a reminder that the power of the presidency often resides in the president’s ability to dictate the alternatives from which Congress (or in this case the Senate) must choose. Although Republicans will undoubtedly attack Sotomayor for her judicial “activism” (citing in particular her decisions regarding promotion and affirmative action), her comments regarding the importance of gender and ethnicity in influencing her decisions, and her views regarding whether appellate courts “make” policy, they run the risk of alienating Hispanic voters – an increasingly influential voting bloc (to the extent that one can view Hispanics as a voting bloc!) I find it very hard to believe she will not be easily confirmed. In structuring the alternative before the Senate in this manner, then, Obama reveals an important aspect of presidential power that cannot be measured through legislative boxscores.
