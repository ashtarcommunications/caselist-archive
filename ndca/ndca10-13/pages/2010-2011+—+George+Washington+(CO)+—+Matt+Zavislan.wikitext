If anyone wants cites from anything I ran last year, or wants to ask about anything I have up here, Email me at "Matt_<span class="wiki_link_ext">Zavislan@comcast.net"</span>

I am undecided on the issue of disclosure, although I will definitely put stuff up here after I have finished debating on a particular topic. I have seen people abusing the wiki for purposes of reducing workload, and I think that if this is your goal, just to let you know, this is not a winning strategy. The best debaters are the best because they do their own work. Also, its just academically dishonest.
