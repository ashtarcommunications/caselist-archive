Current U.S. strategy in Afghanistan has not been successful and the security and political situations across the country continue to deteriorate. The coalition has failed to defeat the Taliban and there simply aren’t examples of improvement on the ground. The situation is bad everywhere. Counterinsurgency in practice is different than how it was sold in Washington. The only place that counterinsurgency has been tried is in Marjah and the result has not been good, despite some early favorable press reports. There is no similar operation planned in the future. The upcoming offensive in Kandahar will not be counterinsurgency, because there is no way to clear a city of nearly one million people. Furthermore, military operations in Ma rjah and Kandahar are unlikely to alter the course or outcome of the war. Will the upcoming offensive in Kandahar help militarily or politically? Without a credible and reliable local partner in Kandahar, there is virtually no chance for success. Ahmad Wali Karzai, President Karzai’s half brother, is the dominant leader in Kandahar and despite efforts by the United States to have him removed, he will continue to be the local strongman. Under Ahmad Wali Karzai’s control, opportunities to reform the local government will be blocked. Due to low levels of trust in local officials and high levels of corruption in the local judiciary, people in Kandahar routinely seek Taliban judges to settle their disagreements. The total corruption of the local government has enabled the Taliban to set up a shadow government. Also, thousands of coalition troops will not make major gains in a city of almost one million inhabitants. Small tactical successes are within reach, and undoubtedly will be highlighted in U.S. media, but this will not shift support to the Afghan government. Coalition forces are not welcome in Pashtun areas and the heavy fighting will undoubtedly increase tensions and casualties on all sides, further eroding the coalition’s political capital.<br />

<strong>US presence and the perception of an illegitimate Afghani government boost the Taliban</strong><br />
<strong>Galston ‘10</strong> <span style="font-weight: normal;">- Senior Fellow of Governance Studies @ Brookings (William, Senior Fellow of Governance Studies @ Brookings, “A Question of Life and Death: U.S. Policy in Afghanistan,” Brookings, June 15th, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3029:http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2010/0615_afghanistan_galston.aspx --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2010/0615_afghanistan_galston.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2010/0615_afghanistan_galston.aspx</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3029 -->)</span><br />
<br />
Let’s begin at the beginning, with Marja. The holy trinity of modern counterinsurgency is clear, hold, and build. Coalition forces are stalled at step one. After the initial military thrust, many Taliban fighters, including mid-level commanders, swooped back in to the area to intimidate local inhabitants who might otherwise be inclined to cooperate with the coalition and Afghan government. Many other Afghanis sympathize with the core Taliban message that we intend to occupy their country for the long-term with the aim of imposing alien cultural, religious, and political values. It is hard to see what will tip this stalemate in our favor, even harder to see how we can hand over governance and security function to the Afghans in Marja any time soon. Brigadier General Frederick Hodges, one of the leading commanders in southern Afghanistan, puts it this way: “You’ve got to have the governance part ready to go. We talked about doing that in Marja but didn’t realize how hard it was to do. Ultimately, it’s up to the Afghans to step forward.” It’s clear that Hodges is not holding his breath. The next shoe to drop was Kandahar. Ever since this Taliban stronghold was identified as a key target, the tension between the U.S. and Afghan governments on this issue has been palpable—so much so that the coalition is now hesitant to call what it has in mind an “offensive.” Just last week, we learned that the operation scheduled to begin in the spring would fall even farther behind schedule. As The New York Times reports, “The Afghan government has not produced the civilian leadership and trained security forces it was to contribute to the effort, U.S. officials said, and the support from Kandaharis that the United States was counting on Karzai to deliver has not materialized.” Stanley McChrystal, the top commander in Afghanistan, has been admirably frank about a core difficulty: the residents of Kandahar are far from sure that they want the protection we claim to be offering them. On to Kabul, where President Karzai has reportedly lost faith in the coalition’s ability (and that of his own government) to defeat the Taliban and is secretly maneuvering to strike a separate deal with them. If these reports are correct—and Susan Rice, our UN ambassador, disputed them on Sunday (though, notably, she offered no new evidence in support of her assertion that Karzai remains a committed partner)—two events appear to be fueling his growing disenchantment: senior American officials’ claims that his reelection lacked legitimacy, and President Obama’s December announcement that he intended to begin reducing the number of American troops by July 2011. One might be tempted to chalk up the extent of our difficulties in Afghanistan to tendentious reporting. I was skeptical myself—that is, until I stumbled across a stunning NATO/ISAF report completed in March. This report summarizes the results of an in-depth survey conducted in nine of the 16 districts in Kandahar Province to which researchers could safely gain access. Here are some of the findings:<br />
Security is viewed everywhere as a major problem. When asked to name the top dangers experienced while traveling on the roads, far more respondents named Afghan National Army and Police checkpoints than roadside bombs, Taliban checkpoints, or criminals. And the Taliban were rated better than ISAF convoys and checkpoints as well.<br />
Corruption is viewed as a widespread problem and is experienced by respondents on a regular basis. In fact, 84 percent say that corruption is the main reason for the current conflict. Corruption erodes confidence in the Afghan government, and fully two-thirds of respondents believe that this corruption forces them to seek alternatives to government services and authority. Chillingly, 53 percent regard the Taliban as “incorruptible.” <br />
The residents of Kandahar overwhelmingly prefer a process of reconciliation to the prospect of continued conflict. Ninety-four percent say that it is better to negotiate with the Taliban than to fight with them, and they see grounds for believing that these negotiations will succeed. Eighty-five percent regard the Taliban as “our Afghan brothers” (a phrase President Karzai repeated word for word in his address to the recent jirga), and 81 percent say that the Taliban would lay down their arms if given jobs.<br />
Our military commanders in Afghanistan talk incessantly about the need to “shape” the political context in a given area before beginning activities with a significant military component—but if their own research is correct, our chances of “shaping” Kandahar any time soon range from slim to none. Based on General McChrystal’s own logic, then, we cannot proceed there because a key requirement for success is not fulfilled. And if we can’t prevail in Kandahar, then we’re stuck with the Taliban as a long-term military presence and political force in Afghanistan.<br />

If it is a war against extremists and militancy inside Pakistan, it is a civil war because its origins stem from the US, NATO occupation of neighboring Afghanistan. The conflict should be seen as an extension of the ongoing resistance of the Afghan people to alien domination. It is inaccurate to say that the US invaded Afghanistan because of the 9/11 attacks by Al-Qaeda. Former BBC correspondent George Arney reported on September 18, 2001, that Niaz Naik, the former Pakistani foreign secretary, had told him that he was informed by US officials at a UN-sponsored international contact group on Afghanistan in Berlin during July that year that unless Osama bin Laden were handed over swiftly, America would take military action to kill or capture both Bin Laden and Mullah Omar. The wider objective, however, was to topple the Taliban regime and install a transitional government under King Mohammad Zahir Shah. The invasion was to take place in mid-October 2001. Mr. Naik went on to say that he doubted that the US would have abandoned its plan to invade Afghanistan even if Osama were handed over by the Taliban. Arney's story is corroborated by the Guardian correspondent David Leigh in his report published on September 26, 2001, in which he revealed that the Taliban had received specific warning by the US through secret diplomacy in Berlin in July that the Bush Administration would topple the entire regime militarily unless Osama is extradited to the US. This was part of the larger design of US military, industrial complex to bring about regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran. As the US needed bases in Pakistan to accomplish its pre-planned invasion of Afghanistan, the Bush Administration sought to use Islamabad as a cat's paw to pull the chestnuts out of the fire. Fortunately for President Bush, a usurper ruled there, devoid of all legitimacy, legal and moral, and he readily and willingly succumbed to US pressure and made a U-turn by severing all links with the Taliban. He even joined the war against Afghanistan instead of using his leverage with the Taliban to exhaust all means of peaceful settlement of the dispute. The entire region, including Pakistan, was declared a war zone by the US military command, and the flights of all passenger planes were prohibited over a certain altitude, while no merchant ships could enter the harbors of Pakistan, thus bringing maritime trade (which comprises approximately 95 percent of Pakistan's import-export trade) to a standstill. It is no wonder that Pakistan suffered a loss of 34 billion dollars because of its involvement in the Afghan war. America's War As one can see, it was America's war that was imposed upon Pakistan. Whether Pakistan could have avoided the war is a matter of controversy among politicians and political observers. But the war has fuelled insurgency in Pakistan's hitherto peaceful tribal territory adjacent to Afghanistan. This insurgency shows no sign of abatement, as terrorist attacks on military and civilian centers in the capital and major cities of the North-West Frontier Province and Punjab continue with a vengeance, posing threat to the security of the state. In the meantime, routine predator strikes by the US in Waziristan have taken a heavy toll of civilian lives amid accusations of Islamabad's complicity in the piratical attacks on tribespeople, which prompts them to resort to retaliatory strikes on the perpetrators. Not satisfied with Pakistan's military operations in the tribal region, the US Administration has compelled Islamabad's fragile government to pull out its troops from the tense Indo-Pak border and deploy them in the restive tribal belt along the Pak-Afghan border. Now Pakistan faces existential threat from the Taliban and not India, a perception which the country's military leadership is not prepared to share, given the unresolved disputes with New Delhi, which triggered four wars during the last 62 years. At the same time, speculation (not entirely unfounded) is rife about the involvement of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and the former Blackwater (now christened Xe Services) in murder, mayhem, and gunrunning as evidenced by the armed Americans who drive consulate vehicles through cities and, when intercepted, refuse to disclose their identity. It is here that one recalls with dismay the role of General Stanley McChrystal, who until last year headed the Joint Special Operations Command, which runs drone attacks and targeted assassinations with the assistance of the operatives of the former Blackwater. This was revealed by Jeremy Scahill's investigative report published in the US weekly the Nation. That may, perhaps, solve the mystery surrounding a series of assassinations of ulama belonging to various Islamic movements. The sinister motive behind such acts of terror is to incite sectarian violence in Pakistan and lay the blame at the doors of religious extremists. Similar death squads were organized by the CIA in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to carry out political assassinations of nationalists who were opposed to US intervention. At the time, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua complained to the International Court of Justice about the mining of Nicaraguan ports, the violation of the country's airspace, the killing and kidnapping of individuals on the Nicaraguan territory, and the threat or use of force by the US. The court in its decision in June 1986 held that the US was in breach of the customary rules of international law and international humanitarian law. The above case is titled the &quot;Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua.&quot; The precedent set by this case may be invoked by Pakistan to prevent the US drone attacks on its territory. Once the piratical attacks of the US have stopped, the irritant in the tribal insurgency would have gone, paving the way for pacification of the conflict. If this were Pakistan's war, the government would have exercised its own judgment in dealing with the militants at home, either by conciliation or by resort to force. But Islamabad's so-called operation against militants is subordinated to US military designs in the region, aimed at the encirclement of the People's Republic of China and the control of the transit of gas pipelines from Central Asia to South Asia. It is not aimless that China expressed its concern over the concentration of US, NATO troops in the region. India fits in the American scheme of things, hence the US-India nuclear deal. Pakistan's National Interest In this emerging security environment, Pakistan will have to be content with its role as a junior partner of India. Therefore, the sooner Islamabad extricates itself from the US &quot;war on terror,&quot; the better it is for its security and independence. Doesn't Islamabad realize that its military operation against the militants would leave its border with India vulnerable to a New Delhi offensive? If Pakistan permits the US to attack the suspected training centers of militants on its territory, will it be able to prevent India from doing so? With Islamabad embroiled in internecine strife, it cannot negotiate with India from a position of strength. It may be forced to make a compromise that might be detrimental to its national interest. Pakistan's preoccupation with tribal rebellion would not permit it to deal with separatist ethnic forces in Baluchistan. Undoubtedly, this is a threat to the territorial integrity of Pakistan. After the total failure of the military operation in Baluchistan, the federal government has come round to the painful conclusion that political and not military action can bring militancy to an end. Granting general amnesty to the dissidents and engaging them in a meaningful dialogue on contentious issues is a laudable initiative. The same gesture should be made to the militants in the tribal areas. But Islamabad has adopted double standards in dealing with the Baluchistan militants and the Pashtun militants, as if there were good militants and bad ones. This discriminatory policy would intensify the Pashtun insurgency and might drive them toward even more escalation. The rulers have seen the consequences of military operations in the former East Pakistan, Baluchistan, Karachi, Sind, and FATA (federally administered tribal areas). If anything, the situation has only worsened. The surge of US troops, the expansion of war beyond the borders of Afghanistan, and the attacks on Quetta and Muridke as envisaged by Obama's new strategy would mean that US troops are at war with the people of Pakistan. Any Solution? The Obama Administration would be better advised to concentrate on its exit strategy, and to that end, it is imperative that it involve the UN in its peace-making efforts aimed at the establishment of a broad-based government in Afghanistan, because the Karzai Government has no legitimacy. To fill the vacuum, the UN peacekeeping force, made up of troops of states not involved in the Afghan war, may be deployed until a government of national unity is able to assume full responsibility. Here the US can contribute to the postwar reconstruction of Afghanistan under the aegis of the UN. The insurgency in the tribal region is the spillover effect of US military occupation of Afghanistan, but Pakistan faces a far greater threat: the threat of ethnic violence as manifested in the bloody clashes among various linguistic groups in urban and rural Sind. These have been overshadowed by the counterinsurgency operations in FATA, but they may erupt at any moment, thus destabilizing the state.<br />

But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with explosives into a jeep filled with troops today, killing five and wounding as many as 21, including several children who were waiting for a ride to school. Residents of the region where the attack took place are fleeing in terror as gunfire rings out around them, and government forces have been unable to quell the violence. Two regional government officials were beheaded by militants in retaliation for the killing of other militants by government forces. As familiar as this sounds, it did not take place where we have come to expect such terrible events. This, unfortunately, is a whole new ballgame. It is part of another conflict that is brewing, one which puts what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan in deep shade, and which represents a grave and growing threat to us all. Pakistan is now trembling on the edge of violent chaos, and is doing so with nuclear weapons in its hip pocket, right in the middle of one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world. The situation in brief: Pakistan for years has been a nation in turmoil, run by a shaky government supported by a corrupted system, dominated by a blatantly criminal security service, and threatened by a large fundamentalist Islamic population with deep ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan. All this is piled atop an ongoing standoff with neighboring India that has been the center of political gravity in the region for more than half a century. The fact that Pakistan, and India, and Russia, and China all possess nuclear weapons and share the same space means any ongoing or escalating violence over there has the real potential to crack open the very gates of Hell itself.<br />
Recently, the Taliban made a military push into the northwest Pakistani region around the Swat Valley. According to a recent Reuters report: The (Pakistani) army deployed troops in Swat in October 2007 and used artillery and gunship helicopters to reassert control. But insecurity mounted after a civilian government came to power last year and tried to reach a negotiated settlement. A peace accord fell apart in May 2008. After that, hundreds — including soldiers, militants and civilians — died in battles. Militants unleashed a reign of terror, killing and beheading politicians, singers, soldiers and opponents. They banned female education and destroyed nearly 200 girls' schools. About 1,200 people were killed since late 2007 and 250,000 to 500,000 fled, leaving the militants in virtual control. Pakistan offered on February 16 to introduce Islamic law in the Swat valley and neighboring areas in a bid to take the steam out of the insurgency. The militants announced an indefinite cease-fire after the army said it was halting operations in the region. President Asif Ali Zardari signed a regulation imposing sharia in the area last month. But the Taliban refused to give up their guns and pushed into Buner and another district adjacent to Swat, intent on spreading their rule. The United States, already embroiled in a war against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, must now face the possibility that Pakistan could collapse under the mounting threat of Taliban forces there. Military and diplomatic advisers to President Obama, uncertain how best to proceed, now face one of the great nightmare scenarios of our time. &quot;Recent militant gains in Pakistan,&quot; reported The New York Times on Monday, &quot;have so alarmed the White House that the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, described the situation as 'one of the very most serious problems we face.'&quot; &quot;Security was deteriorating rapidly,&quot; reported The Washington Post on Monday, &quot;particularly in the mountains along the Afghan border that harbor al-Qaeda and the Taliban, intelligence chiefs reported, and there were signs that those groups were working with indigenous extremists in Pakistan's populous Punjabi heartland. The Pakistani government was mired in political bickering. The army, still fixated on its historical adversary India, remained ill-equipped and unwilling to throw its full weight into the counterinsurgency fight. But despite the threat the intelligence conveyed, Obama has only limited options for dealing with it. Anti-American feeling in Pakistan is high, and a U.S. combat presence is prohibited. The United States is fighting Pakistan-based extremists by proxy, through an army over which it has little control, in alliance with a government in which it has little confidence.&quot; It is believed Pakistan is currently in possession of between 60 and 100 nuclear weapons. Because Pakistan's stability is threatened by the wide swath of its population that shares ethnic, cultural and religious connections to the fundamentalist Islamic populace of Afghanistan, fears over what could happen to those nuclear weapons if the Pakistani government collapses are very real. &quot;As the insurgency of the Taliban and Al Qaeda spreads in Pakistan,&quot; reported the Times last week, &quot;senior American officials say they are increasingly concerned about new vulnerabilities for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, including the potential for militants to snatch a weapon in transport or to insert sympathizers into laboratories or fuel-production facilities. In public, the administration has only hinted at those concerns, repeating the formulation that the Bush administration used: that it has faith in the Pakistani Army. But that cooperation, according to officials who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity surrounding the exchanges between Washington and Islamabad, has been sharply limited when the subject has turned to the vulnerabilities in the Pakistani nuclear infrastructure.&quot; &quot;The prospect of turmoil in Pakistan sends shivers up the spines of those U.S. officials charged with keeping tabs on foreign nuclear weapons,&quot; reported Time Magazine last month. &quot;Pakistan is thought to possess about 100 — the U.S. isn't sure of the total, and may not know where all of them are. Still, if Pakistan collapses, the U.S. military is primed to enter the country and secure as many of those weapons as it can, according to U.S. officials. Pakistani officials insist their personnel safeguards are stringent, but a sleeper cell could cause big trouble, U.S. officials say.&quot; In other words, a shaky Pakistan spells trouble for everyone, especially if America loses the footrace to secure those weapons in the event of the worst-case scenario. If Pakistani militants ever succeed in toppling the government, several very dangerous events could happen at once. Nuclear-armed India could be galvanized into military action of some kind, as could nuclear-armed China or nuclear-armed Russia. If the Pakistani government does fall, and all those Pakistani nukes are not immediately accounted for and secured, the specter (or reality) of loose nukes falling into the hands of terrorist organizations could place the entire world on a collision course with unimaginable disaster. We have all been paying a great deal of attention to Iraq and Afghanistan, and rightly so. The developing situation in Pakistan, however, needs to be placed immediately on the front burner. The Obama administration appears to be gravely serious about addressing the situation. So should we all.<br />

Contrary to the claims that we should use the U.S. military to stabilize the region and reduce the threat of terrorism, a 2008 study by the RAND Corporation found that U.S. policies emphasizing the use of force tend to create new terrorists. In “How Terrorist Groups End: Lessons for Countering al Qai’da,” Seth Jones and Martin Libicki argue that the U.S. military “should generally resist being drawn into combat operations in Muslim societies, since [a U.S. military] presence is likely to increase terrorist recruitment.”22 Some policymakers claim the war is worth waging because terrorists flourish in failed states. But that argument cannot account for terrorists who thrive in centralized states that have the sovereignty to reject external interference.23 That is one reason why militants find sanctuary in neighboring, nuclear armed Pakistan. In this respect, and perhaps most important, is the belief that our presence in the region helps Pakistan, when in fact the seemingly open-ended U.S. presence in Afghanistan risks creating worse problems for Pakistan. Amassing troops in Afghanistan feeds the perception of a foreign occupation, spawning more terrorist recruits for Pakistani militias and thus placing undue stress on an already weakened nation. Christian Science Monitor correspondent Anand Gopal finds, “In late 2007, as many as 27 groups merged to form an umbrella Taliban movement, the Tehreek-e-Taliban, under guerrilla leader Baitullah Mehsud.” He continues, “Three of the most powerful, once-feuding commanders—Mr. Mehsud and Maulavi Nazeer of South Waziristan and Hafiz Gul Behadur of North Waziristan—formed an alliance in response to US airstrikes.”24 America’s presence has already caused major problems for the government in Islamabad, which is deeply unpopular for many reasons, including its alignment with U.S. policies.25 There are also indications that it has raised tensions in Uzbekistan and other Central Asian countries. For Islamic militants throughout the region, the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan— like the occupation of Iraq—is an increasingly potent recruiting tool. Only by prolonging our military presence do we allow the Taliban, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s Hizb-e Islami, the Haqqani network, and even Pakistani Taliban militants to reframe the conflict and their position within it as a legitimate defense against a foreign occupation. In this respect, policymakers should recognize that not everyone willing to resist U.S. intervention is necessarily an enemy of the United States. Most importantly, we must understand that not every Islamic fundamentalist is a radical Islamist, let alone one who is hell-bent on launching a terrorist attack against the American homeland.<br />

<br />
There exists a fundamental misunderstanding about the relationship of Central Asian states (and Russia, for that matter) to the war on terrorism. We hear about their &quot;cooperation with the US,&quot; as if they are doing us a favor that should be rewarded. Nothing could be further from the truth. For a decade, the Central Asian states have faced the threat of Islamic radicalism, terrorism, and drug trafficking, with which the first two are closely linked. All of the Central Asian states have identified these issues as their main security threat, and Afghanistan as the locus of that threat. So has Russia, which has used the issue to justify the stationing of troops in four of the five countries of the region. To address this threat, Central Asian governments have arrested countless suspects, abrogating the civil rights of many who are doubtless innocent. All of the countries have resorted to the same primitive policies, the differences among them being only of degree, not of kind. Some commentators have argued that these measures are largely responsible for the growth of terrorism in the first place. There is some truth in this, but we must be careful in levying this charge. When we demand that Messers, Musharraf, Arafat, or Mubarrak crack down hard on jihhadist groups, Palestinian terrorists, or Muslim brotherhoods, are we not asking them to do exactly what we criticize Central Asian governments for doing? Americans bridle when our critics abroad blame September 11 on the US' actions, yet we come close to doing the same thing with respect to the Central Asians. Both the Central Asians and the Russians, who have claimed a special role in the region, have been notably unsuccessful in their campaigns against terrorism. But now the situation is changing, thanks to the United States. We are risking American soldiers' lives and expending billions of our citizens' resources to address a threat that hangs over their countries as much as ours. The fact that we have our own interests at heart in no way qualifies this truth. Early signs of progress in the war on terrorism already exceed what has been accomplished locally in a decade. And so let us cease all talk of some payment owed Central Asians (or Russians) for their cooperation. If anything, it is they who should thank us. However, this does not mean that US actions are without risk to the Central Asian states. Quite the contrary. For a decade they have faced not only the dangers arising from Afghanistan but also the constant threat posed by certain groups in Russia, notably the military and security forces, who are not yet reconciled to the loss of empire. This &quot;imperial hangover&quot; is not unique to Russia. France exhibited the same tendencies in Algeria, the Spanish in Cuba and Chile, and the British when they burned the White House in 1812. This imperial hangover will eventually pass, but for the time being it remains a threat. It means that the Central Asians, after cooperating with the US, will inevitably face redoubled pressure from Russia if we leave abruptly and without attending to the long-term security needs of the region. That we have looked kindly into Mr. Putin's soul does not change this reality. The Central Asians face a similar danger with respect to our efforts in Afghanistan. Some Americans hold that we should destroy Bin Laden, Al Queda, and the Taliban and then leave the post-war stabilization and reconstruction to others. Such a course runs the danger of condemning all Central Asia to further waves of instability from the South. But in the next round it will not only be Russia that is tempted to throw its weight around in the region but possibly China, or even Iran or India. All have as much right to claim Central Asia as their &quot;backyard&quot; as Russia has had until now. Central Asia may be a distant region but when these nuclear powers begin bumping heads there it will create terrifying threats to world peace that the U.S. cannot ignore.<br />

MOSCOW -- Russia is reasserting its role in Central Asia with a Kremlin push to eject the U.S. from a vital air base and a Moscow-led pact to form an international military force to rival NATO -- two moves that potentially complicate the new U.S. war strategy in Afghanistan. On Wednesday, Russia announced a financial rescue fund for a group of ex-Soviet allies and won their agreement to form a military rapid reaction force in the region that it said would match North Atlantic Treaty Organization standards. That came a day after Kyrgyzstan announced, at Russian urging, that it planned to evict the U.S. from the base it has used to ferry large numbers of American troops into Afghanistan. Russia said the base may house part of the planned new force instead. The steps mark Russia's most aggressive push yet to counter a U.S. military presence in the region that it has long resented. They pose a challenge for the administration of President Barack Obama, which sees Afghanistan as its top foreign-policy priority and is preparing to double the size of the American military presence there. The developments also underscore the difficulties for Mr. Obama as he seeks to build a closer relationship with Moscow. Russia is signaling that it will be a tough defender of its interests, especially in its traditional backyard of the former Soviet Union. Though its huge cash reserves are rapidly draining because of falling oil prices, the greater needs of its poorer neighbors are still giving it an opening. &quot;Russia would like to reassert itself in the region, and it is using the financial crisis as an opportunity,&quot; said Nikolai Zlobin, senior fellow at the World Security Institute, a Washington think tank.<br />

<strong>U.S. Russian relations are key to reorienting the Russian military and preventing China Russo nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Elliot ’95</strong> <span style="font-weight: normal;">– Time Magazine’s Asia Editor (Michael, Newsweek, 4-15, Lexis) </span><br />
<br />
&quot;Russia,&quot; says Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, &quot;is a big country.&quot; That it is; lop off the newly independent states born within the old Soviet husk and you've still got a lot left -- a highly educated work force sitting on top of some of the globe's most valuable resources. True, much of that vast territory has an awful climate (climate matters-for different reasons than Russia's, it explains why Australia will never be a great power). But unlike India and China, two other &quot;giant&quot; states, Russia will be able to husband its vast resources without the additional strain of feeding -- and employing-more than a billion souls. It also, of course, is the only country that can launch a devastating nuclear attack on the United States. That kind of power demands respect. And sensitive handling. Stephen Sestanovich, head Russia watcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, argues that present U.S. policy is geared too much to &quot;dismantling Russian military might&quot; -- a policy that, since it breeds Russian resentment of Western meddling, is self-defeating. &quot;We have to reorient Russian power,&quot; says Sestanovich, &quot;not eliminate it. Because we can't eliminate it.&quot; Indeed, Washington should prefer a strong Russia. A Russia so weak, for example, that it could not resist a Chinese land grab of its Far East without resorting to nuclear weapons is a 21st-century nightmare.<br />
All this implies a close U.S. -- Russian relationship stretching into the future. American officials say it will be a &quot;pragmatic&quot; one, recognizing that Russian and U.S. national interests will sometimes collide. The danger, for the United States, is that a pragmatic relationship could be dominated by security issues. In Western Europe, some futurists say that in the coming decades Russia will talk to the United States about nuclear weapons but to the European Union about everything else-trade, economic development and the rest.<br />

<strong>Russia China war ends in extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Sharavin 2001</strong><br />
[Alexander, Director of the Institute for Military and Political Analysis, What the Papers Say, Oct 3]<br />
<br />
Chinese propaganda has constantly been showing us skyscrapers in free trade zones in southeastern China. It should not be forgotten, however, that some 250 to 300 million people live there, i.e. at most a quarter of China's population. A billion Chinese people are still living in misery. For them, even the living standards of a backwater Russian town remain inaccessibly high. They have absolutely nothing to lose. There is every prerequisite for &quot;the final throw to the north.&quot; The strength of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (CPLA) has been growing quicker than the Chinese economy. A decade ago the CPLA was equipped with inferior copies of Russian arms from late 1950s to the early 1960s. However, through its own efforts Russia has nearly managed to liquidate its most significant technological advantage. Thanks to our zeal, from antique MiG-21 fighters of the earliest modifications and S-75 air defense missile systems the Chinese antiaircraft defense forces have adopted Su-27 fighters and S-300 air defense missile systems. China's air defense forces have received Tor systems instead of anti-aircraft guns which could have been used during World War II. The shock air force of our &quot;eastern brethren&quot; will in the near future replace antique Tu-16 and Il-28 airplanes with Su-30 fighters, which are not yet available to the Russian Armed Forces! Russia may face the &quot;wonderful&quot; prospect of combating the Chinese army, which, if full mobilization is called, is comparable in size with Russia's entire population, which also has nuclear weapons (even tactical weapons become strategic if states have common borders) and would be absolutely insensitive to losses (even a loss of a few million of the servicemen would be acceptable for China). Such a war would be more horrible than the World War II. It would require from our state maximal tension, universal mobilization and complete accumulation of the army military hardware, up to the last tank or a plane, in a single direction (we would have to forget such &quot;trifles&quot; like Talebs and Basaev, but this does not guarantee success either). Massive nuclear strikes on basic military forces and cities of China would finally be the only way out, what would exhaust Russia's armament completely. We have not got another set of intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-based missiles, whereas the general forces would be extremely exhausted in the border combats. In the long run, even if the aggression would be stopped after the majority of the Chinese are killed, our country would be absolutely unprotected against the &quot;Chechen&quot; and the &quot;Balkan&quot; variants both, and even against the first frost of a possible nuclear winter.<br />

<strong>And it immediately reduces support for the Taliban while increasing government legitimacy</strong><br />

<br />
This three-zone strategy is not, per se, a gamechanger, and it must be accompanied by an incremental, phased withdrawal. The withdrawal would not be a consequence of “stabilization,” but rather an essential part of the process. Since the presence of foreign troops is the most important factor in mobilizing support for the Taliban, the beginning of the withdrawal would change the political game on two levels. First, Jihad would become a motivation for fewer Afghans; instead, the conflict would be mostly seen as a civil war. Second, the pro-government population (or, more exactly, the anti-Taliban one) would rally together because of fear of a Taliban victory. <br />
There is an argument against withdrawing combat troops: namely, that al-Qaeda would retain its sanctuary in Afghanistan because the Afghan state would not have control of some parts of the country, especially in the east. Though superficially compelling, this argument is weak for two reasons. First, the international coalition lacks the resources to control the periphery of the Afghan territory anyway. Second, the withdrawal of combat troops does not preclude targeted operations with the agreement of the Kabul government. So, in terms of physical security, the withdrawal of combat troops does not bring clear gains for al-Qaeda. <br />
There are two important reasons for withdrawal. <br />
First, the mere presence of foreign soldiers fighting a war in Afghanistan is probably the single most important factor in the resurgence of the Taliban. <br />
The convergence of nationalism and Jihad has aided the Taliban in extending its influence. It is sometimes frightening to see how similar NATO military operations are to Soviet ones in the 1980s and how the similarities could affect the perceptions of the population. The majority of Afghans are now deeply opposed to the foreign troops on their soil. The idea that one can “stabilize” Afghanistan with more troops goes against all that one should have learned from the Soviet war. The real issue is not to “stabilize” but to create a new dynamic. The Taliban have successfully framed the war as a Jihad and a liberation war against (non-Muslim) foreign armies. The concrete consequence of this moral victory is that the movement has been able to gain ground in non-Pashtun areas. The situations in Badghris Province (northwest) and in Badakhshan Province (northeast) are extremely worrisome, because the Taliban have been able to attract the support of some Pashtun tribes and fundamentalist networks. A province like Wardak, initially opposed to the Taliban in the 1990s, is now one of its strongholds. Insecurity bred by the narcotics trade and the infighting of local groups in the north also provides the Taliban opportunities to find new allies on a more practical, rather than ideological, ground. This trend is extraordinarily dangerous, since the spread of the war geographically would put Western countries in an untenable position. <br />
Second, withdrawal would create a new dynamic in the country, providing two main benefits. The momentum of the Taliban would slow or stop altogether, because without a foreign occupier the Jihadist and nationalist feelings of the population would be much more difficult to mobilize. Furthermore, the Karzai regime would gain legitimacy. If Karzai (or his successor) receives enough help from the international coalition, he would be able to develop more centralized institutions in the strategic areas or at least keep local actors under control. The regime would remain corrupt but would appear more legitimate if it succeeded in bringing security to the population in the strategic zones without the help of foreign troops. The support of the urban population, which opposes the Taliban, is a critical issue. Corruption is a problem primarily if it accelerates the independence of Afghanistan’s peripheral regions. <br />

<br />
Now, even if the surge had been the deciding factor in the reduction of Iraqi violence, the question is can you transplant that to Afghanistan? Afghanistan is a much different country and a much harder fight to win. Here are some of the reasons: The Taliban has a more zealous insurgency than Iraq. Afghanistan is a bigger country, has more people than Iraq, and there are fewer forces there. According to the U.S. military’s own rules of counterinsurgency warfare, the U.S. would have to have nearly 600,000 troops in Afghanistan to be effective. Now, of course that’s a rule of thumb, but the basic principle is that we’re way under that and there’s no hope that we’ll ever get up that high. So, I think we see the daunting task ahead. Iraq is flat. Afghanistan is mountainous, of course, making it much easier for the guerrillas. Unlike Iraq, the Afghan Taliban have a sanctuary in Pakistan, which is supposedly our ally, but which only goes after the Pakistani Taliban and not the Afghan Taliban. Now, the Afghan Taliban is always useful to the Pakistani government to counter the Indian influence in Afghanistan, especially when the U.S. is likely to leave as the President signaled his intention to at least start pulling out troops by 2011. So that was I think a message to elements of the Pakistani military that they should keep supporting the Afghan Taliban. Now, in Iraq the insurgency was primarily urban whereas in Afghanistan it’s rural. Because of the war, the civil war, and the assassinations, in addition, the tribal leadership is weaker in Afghanistan than in Iraq and there is no Awakening Movement in Afghanistan. The Taliban are Afghans who for the most part don’t target civilians where as Al Qaeda in Iraq is led by foreigners and does purposefully attack civilians to stir up ethno-sectarian hatred. That, of course, has alienated many Sunnis in Iraq, and of course in Afghanistan we have the corrupt Karzai government who stole the election and rules only Kabul so much of Afghanistan is effectively run by the Taliban. In addition, we’ve had eight years where the U.S. has oscillated between a kinetic counter-terrorism strategy and a counter-insurgency strategy that tries to protect people, and we’ve seen the last oscillation of that. This happened during the Bush administration, and now it’s happening again in the Obama administration that we’re moving back to a counter-insurgency strategy.<br />

<strong>Two internal links:</strong><br />
<strong>1. Lack of a coherent Afghanistan policy</strong><br />
<strong>Stewart ‘9</strong> -<span style="font-weight: normal;"> Ryan Family Professor of the Practice of Human Rights and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, studied at Oxford and served briefly in the British army before working in the diplomatic service in Indonesia and as British representative to Montenegro (9/16/09, Rory, “The Future of Afghanistan,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3036:http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan" rel="nofollow">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3036 -->)</span><br />
<br />
The best Afghan policy would be to reduce the number of foreign troops from the current level of 90,000 to far fewer – perhaps 20,000. In that case, two distinct objectives would remain for the international community: development and counter-terrorism. Neither would amount to the building of an Afghan state or winning a counter-insurgency campaign. A reduction in troop numbers and a turn away from state-building should not mean total withdrawal: good projects could continue to be undertaken in electricity, water, irrigation, health, education, agriculture, rural development and in other areas favoured by development agencies. Even a light US presence could continue to allow for aggressive operations against Al Qaeda terrorists, in Afghanistan, who plan to attack the United States. The US has successfully prevent Al Qaeda from re-establishing itself since 2001 (though the result has only been to move bin Laden across the border.). The US military could also (with other forms of assistance) support the Afghan military to prevent the Taliban from seizing a city or taking over the country.<br />
These twin objectives will require a very long-term presence, as indeed is almost inevitable in a country which is as poor, as fragile and traumatized as Afghanistan (and which lacks the internal capacity at the moment to become independent of Foreign aid or control its territory). But a long-term presence will in turn mean a much lighter and more limited presence (if it is to retain US domestic support). We should not control and cannot predict the future of Afghanistan. It may in the future become more violent, or find a decentralised equilibrium or a new national unity, but if its communities continue to want to work with us, we can, over 30 years, encourage the more positive trends in Afghan society and help to contain the more negative.<br />
Such a policy can seem strained, unrealistic, counter-intuitive and unappealing. They appear to betray the hopes of Afghans who trusted us and to allow the Taliban to abuse district towns. No politician wants to be perceived to have underestimated, or failed to address, a terrorist threat; or to write off the ‘blood and treasure’ that we have sunk into Afghanistan; or to admit defeat. Americans are particularly unwilling to believe that problems are insoluble; Obama’s motto is not ‘no we can’t’; soldiers are not trained to admit defeat or to say a mission is impossible. And to suggest that what worked in Iraq won’t work in Afghanistan requires a detailed knowledge of each country’s past, a bold analysis of the causes of development and a rigorous exposition of the differences, for which few have patience. The greatest risk of our inflated ambitions and fears, encapsulated in the current surge is that it will achieve the exact opposite of its intentions and in fact precipitate a total withdrawal. The heavier our footprint, and the more costly, the less we are likely to be able to sustain it. Public opinion is already turning against it. Nato allies are mostly staying in Afghanistan simply to please the United States and have little confidence in our objectives or our reasons. Contemporary political culture tends to encourage black and white solutions: either we garrison or we abandon.<br />
While, I strongly oppose troop increases, I equally strongly oppose a total flight. We are currently in danger of lurching from troop increases to withdrawal and from engagement to isolation. We are threatening to provide instant electro-shock therapy followed by abandonment. This is the last thing Afghanistan needs. The international community should aim to provide a patient, tolerant long-term relationship with a country as poor and traumatized as Afghanistan. Judging by comparable countries in the developing world (and Afghanistan is very near the bottom of the UN Human Development index), making Afghanistan more stable, prosperous and humane is a project which will take decades. It is a worthwhile project in the long-term for us and for Afghans but we will only be able to sustain our presence if we massively reduce our investment and our ambitions and begin to approach Afghanistan more as we do other poor countries in the developing world. The best way of avoiding the mistakes of the 1980s and 1990s – the familiar cycle of investment and abandonment which most Afghan expect and fear and which have contributed so much to instability and danger - is to husband and conserve our resources, limit our objectives to counter-terrorism and humanitarian assistance and work out how to work with fewer troops and less money over a longer period. In Afghanistan in the long-term, less will be more.<br />

<strong>2. Overstretch</strong><br />

<br />
This episode indicates the extent of the confusion over counterterrorism (CT) and counterinsurgency (COIN) that marks the contemporary debate over Afghanistan. Both CT and COIN would envisage military action in Afghanistan, but to very different ends. A CT mission would focus exclusively on Al-Qaeda while offering little or no support to the Karzai government; a COIN mission envisages a comprehensive commitment to defeating the Taleban and rebuilding the Afghan state while destroying Al-Qaeda operatives there. Yet it has now become commonplace for politicians and military officials alike to mention CT and COIN in the same breath, or to treat them as if they were functionally equivalent. The official US government definition now frames counterterrorism in classic ‘hearts and minds’ counterinsurgency language: ‘actions taken directly against terrorist networks and indirectly to influence and render global and regional environments inhospitable to terrorist networks’.12 Terrorist threats are now regularly described as insurgencies and vice versa. The influential US Army and Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual states that ‘today’s operational environment also includes a new kind of insurgency, one which seeks to impose revolutionary change worldwide. Al-Qaeda is a well known example of such an insurgency.’13 An official from US Central Command (CENTCOM), for instance, has gone so far to define counterterrorism as a ‘whole of government COIN’ approach.14 Meanwhile, insurgent threats in places such as Chechnya, Indonesia and Thailand are now regularly redescribed as terrorist threats, as analysts speculate on whether local conflicts will become magnets for Al-Qaeda or otherwise spill out into acts of horrific violence on the international stage.<br />
This confusion over the differences between counterterrorism and counterinsurgency is not new, but it has become more serious over the last eight years.15 Since the events of September 11, these concepts have regularly been conflated as policy-makers have struggled to come to grips with the threat posed by Al-Qaeda. To some extent, this is natural: Al-Qaeda is a global terrorist organization which intervenes directly in local conflicts (often insurgencies, defined here as organized violent attempts to overthrow an existing government) to bait the US and its allies into exhausting wars of attrition. In other words, it is a terrorist organization which dabbles (sometimes successfully, sometimes less so) in insurgencies. But the fact that the threats of terrorism and insurgency are so often intertwined in contemporary conflicts does not make them fundamentally equivalent or susceptible to the same remedies. Nor does it warrant extending counterinsurgency operations on a global level, as some prominent authors have suggested.16 The fusion of the threats from terrorism and insurgency, so often described as symptomatic of the complexity of the modern security challenges, can be misread to imply that the responses to them should be similar or equivalent. In fact, while intermixed in practice, these threats remain distinct, and require a policy response which disaggregates and prioritizes threats and separates those actors who have a negotiable political programme from those who remain incorrigible.<br />
Similarly, the fact that terrorists and insurgents operate in the same theatre, and in some cases function in tandem, is not an argument for a response that seamlessly interweaves elements of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency. Indeed, there is no reason to assume that counterterrorism and counterinsurgency strategies are fully compatible or mutually reinforcing. The record of the war in Afghanistan suggests rather that both models of warfare involve tradeoffs or costs that may offset the gains made by the other. Unless these tradeoffs are properly managed, the simultaneous deployment of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations may operate at cross-purposes and make long-term strategic success more elusive. The fact that US and UK leaders have been so willing to split the difference between counterterrorism and counterinsurgency—and to ignore the offsetting costs of each—may help to account for the current painful stalemate in Afghanistan.<br />
This article will argue that counterterrorism and counterinsurgency are two distinct models of war which can operate at cross-purposes when jointly applied to low-intensity conflicts such as that in Afghanistan. The conflation of these two different models of warfare stems from an intellectual error, which assumes that a fused threat (for example, between a nationalist insurgent group like the Taleban and a transnational terrorist group like Al-Qaeda) must necessarily be met by a joint or blended counterterrorism and counterinsurgency approach. In fact, these two models of warfare involve divergent assumptions about the roles of force, the importance of winning support among the local population, and the necessity of building a strong and representative government. Such approaches are not necessarily mutually reinforcing or even compatible. At the tactical and strategic level, there are at least four possible offsetting costs—popular backlash, countermobilization of enemy networks, a legitimacy gap and diminished leverage—that may be incurred when counterterrorism and counterinsurgency are deployed simultaneously. At the political level, the conflation of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency risks producing an overly interventionist foreign policy which distracts and exhausts the US and UK as they treat an ever-increasing number of localized insurgencies as the incubators of future terrorist threats. <br />

<br />
Finally, this emphasis on a fused threat between terrorists and insurgents can incorrectly imply that the response must also draw in equal measure on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency strategy. Such an approach tends to see each emerging terrorist threat as a new front in a global counterinsurgency effort and imply that the US and its allies need to be concerned with winning the ‘hearts and minds’ of the local populations to prevent its development. This is a fundamentally offensive approach in which the US and its allies need to take the fight to the terrorists wherever they may be while simultaneously persuading the Muslim world to reject Al-Qaeda and its political programme. The obvious risk of such an approach is that it will lead to strategic overreach, especially if the US winds up fighting small wars and engaging in costly nation-building as a method of preventing Al-Qaeda from gaining ground in distant conflicts.<br />
As an example of this danger, consider the conflation of terrorism and insurgency that marked the discussion over the failed attack on a US airline on 25 December 2009. Reports that the failed bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, had received instruction in explosives from Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) immediately raised questions about whether American combat operations would be needed to fight Al-Qaeda-linked insurgents in Yemen. In the US, Senator Joseph Lieberman called Yemen ‘tomorrow’s war’ and urged pre-emptive action against Al-Qaeda operatives there.38 An alternative chorus of voices insisted that additional US funds and civilian trainers would be needed to improve the security forces and governance in that remote country.39 The fact that AQAP activity was intertwined with the tribal revolts which had been threatening the stability of the country appeared to lend superficial support to a quasi-counterinsurgency approach as a way to deal with the threat posed by Al-Qaeda in the peninsula. But the attempted attack was a terrorist act on a US-bound flight from Europe by an African citizen. It is entirely unclear whether improving policing capacity and governance in Yemen would have interrupted the attack, which was carried by a small number of operatives with only limited ties to the local community. The conflation of threats meant that the US looked like sleepwalking into a quasi-COIN strategy in that country, potentially assuming responsibility for areas that may have been irrelevant to Abdulmutallab’s ability to launch a terrorist attack. Worse still, such an expanded role would be viewed with hostility by the local population, which is already suspicious of American encroachment on the country.40 Because current policy is premised on the intellectual error that an interlinked threat demands a comprehensive response, and specifically on the notion that terrorism can be solved through counterinsurgency techniques, US strategy tends to drift towards counterinsurgency—and overextension in foreign conflicts—when a more limited counterterrorism response might be more appropriate.<br />

<br />
There is an even larger question than whether the U.S. will remain the hegemonic state within a western dominated system. How long will the West remain hegemonic in the global system?25 Since Spengler the issue of the decline of the West has been debated. It would be hard to question current western dominance of virtually every global economic, political, military, or ideological system today. In some ways the domination of the West seems even more firm than it was in the past because the West is no longer a group of fiercely competing states but a much more cohesive force. In the era of western domination, breakdown of the rule of each hegemonic state has come because of competition from powerful rival western states at the core of the system leading to system-wide war. The unique characteristic of the Cold War and particularly the post-Cold War system is that the core capitalist states are now to a large degree politically united and increasingly economically integrated. In the 21st century, two factors taking place outside the West seem more of a threat to the reproduction to the hegemony of the American state and the western system than conflict between western states: 1. resistance to western hegemony in the Muslim world and other parts of the subordinated South, and 2. the rise of newly powerful or reformed super states. Relations between the core and periphery have already undergone one massive transformation in the 20th century—decolonization. The historical significance of decolonization was overshadowed somewhat by the emergence of the Cold War and the nuclear age. Recognition of its impact was dampened somewhat by the subsequent relative lack of change of fundamental economic relations between core and periphery. But one of the historical legacies of decolonization is that ideological legitimation has become more crucial in operating the global system. The manufacture of some level of consent, particularly among the elite in the periphery has to some degree replaced brute domination. Less raw force is necessary but in return a greater burden of ideological and cultural legitimation is required. Now it is no longer enough for colonials to obey, willing participants must believe. Therefore, cultural and ideological challenges to the foundations of the liberal capitalist world view assume much greater significance. Thus the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism, ethnic nationalism, and even social democracy in Latin America as ideologies of opposition have increasing significance in a system dependent on greater levels of willing consent. As Ayoob suggests, the sustained resistance within the Islamic world to western hegemony may have a “demonstration effect” on other southern states with similar grievances against the West.26 The other new dynamic is the re-emergence of great states that at one time or another have been brought low by the western hegemonic system. China, in recent centuries low on the international division of labor, was in some ways a classic case of a peripheral state, or today a semi-peripheral state. But its sheer size, its rapid growth, its currency reserves, its actual and potential markets, etc. make it a major power and a potential future counter hegemon. India lags behind China, but has similar aspirations. Russia has fallen from great power to semi-peripheral status since the collapse of the Soviet empire, but its energy resources and the technological skills of its people make recovery of its former greatness possible. No one knows exactly what the resurgence of Asia portends for the future. However, just as half a century ago global decolonization was a blow to western domination, so the shift in economic production to Asia will redefine global power relations throughout the 21st century. Classical theory of hegemonic cycle is useful if not articulated in too rigid a form. Hegemonic systems do not last forever; they do have a life span. The hegemonic state cannot maintain itself as the fastest growing major economy forever and thus eventually will face relative decline against some major power or powers. The hegemon faces recurrent challenges both on the periphery and from other major powers who feel constrained by the hegemon’s power or are ambitious to usurp its place. Techniques of the application of military force and ideological control may become more sophisticated over time, but so too do techniques of guerilla warfare and ideological forms of resistance such as religious fundamentalism, nationalism, and politicization of ethnic identity. World war may not be imminent, but wars on the periphery have become quite deadly, and the threat of the use of nuclear weapons or other WMD by the rising number of powers who possess them looms. The hegemonic state tends to become overstretched, but more importantly the U.S., because of its messianic sense of mission, tends to overreach. Some of the burden the hegemon has to assume is inevitable, but the U.S. is particularly prone to massive miscalculation. <br />

U.S. strategic retrenchment would enable rising powers to significantly narrow the current military gap between them and the United States. Brooks and Wohlforth argue that the rise of a single peer competitor capable of challenging the United States globally is unlikely. They overlook, however, other geopolitical mechanisms that can bring U.S. primacy to an end. At the turn of the twentieth century, Britain’s hegemony ended because London lacked the resources to cope with the simultaneous challenges mounted by regional great powers to its interests in Europe, Asia, and North America and also to deal with wars of empire such as the Boer War—not because it was challenged by a single great power globally. In coming years, there is a good chance that an increasingly overstretched United States could see its hegemony overthrown by a similar process.

Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as “No. 1” and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying — its regional as well as its global predominance. Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. <br />
For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not only on the goodwill of peoples but also on American power. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe’s stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that’s not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world’s great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China’s neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene — even if it remained the world’s most powerful nation — could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe — if it adopted what some call a strategy of “offshore balancing” — this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, “offshore” role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more “even-handed” policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel ’s aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn’t change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn’t changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to “normal” or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.<br />

<strong>Withdrawal boosts US leadership – short term declines in credibility are irrelevant</strong><br />
<strong>Innocent and Carpenter ’9</strong> <span style="font-weight: normal;">- *foreign policy analyst at Cato who focuses on Afghanistan and Pakistan AND vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at Cato (Malou and Ted, “Escaping the Graveyard of Empires: A Strategy to Exit Afghanistan,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3041:http://www.cato.org/pubs/wtpapers/escaping-graveyard-empires-strategy-exit-afghanistan.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/wtpapers/escaping-graveyard-empires-strategy-exit-afghanistan.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pubs/wtpapers/escaping-graveyard-empires-strategy-exit-afghanistan.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3041 -->)</span><br />
<br />
Former national security adviser Henry Kissinger, Council on Foreign Relations scholar Stephen Biddle, and many others, concede that the war in Central Asia will be long, expensive, and risky, yet they claim it is ultimately worth waging because a withdrawal would boost jihadism globally and make America look weak.26 But what we’ve invested in the Afghanistan mission could all fall apart whether we withdraw tomorrow or 20 years from now. In fact, if leaving would make America look weak, trying to stay indefinitely while accomplishing little would appear even worse. If the issue is preventing U.S. soldiers from having died in vain, pursuing a losing strategy would not vindicate their sacrifice. And trying to pacify all of Afghanistan, much less hoping to do so on a permanent basis, is a losing strategy. Regardless, some people invoke memories of America’s ignominious withdrawals from Vietnam, Somalia, and Lebanon to muster support for an open-ended commitment. President Bush in 2007 claimed that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today’s terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility. “Here at home,” he said, “some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently.”27 Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute agrees with that reasoning, writing that “the 1983 withdrawal from Lebanon and the retreat from Somalia a decade later emboldened Islamists who saw the United States as a paper tiger.”28 When opinion leaders in Washington talk about “lessons learned” from Vietnam, Somalia, Lebanon, and other conflicts, they typically draw the wrong lesson: not that America should avoid intervening in someone else’s domestic dispute, but that America should never give up after having intervened, no matter what the cost.29 But the longer we stay and the more money we spend, the more we’ll feel compelled to remain in the country to validate the investment. A similar self-imposed predicament plagued U.S. officials during the war in Vietnam:<br />
After 1968 it became increasingly clear that the survival of the [government of South Vietnam] was not worth the cost of securing it, but by then the United States had another rationale for staying— prestige and precedent setting. The United States said the [South Vietnamese government] would stand, and even those in the administration now long convinced of the hollowness of the domino argument could agree that a U.S. failure in South Vietnam might endanger vital US national interests elsewhere or in the future.30 For decades, the fear of America losing the world’s respect after withdrawing from a conflict has been instrumental in selling the American public bad foreign policy. Perhaps most troubling about the reflexively “stay the course” mentality of some Americans is the widespread insensitivity about the thousands of people—civilian and military, domestic and foreign—killed, maimed, and traumatized in war. But when the stakes seem unrelated to vital national interests, the American public rightly resents their country’s interference in third party problems, and is extremely skeptical of nation building. History shows that, sooner or later, disenchantment will manifest in public and congressional opposition. After nearly a decade in Afghanistan, even the memory of 9/11 might not be sufficient to outweigh the sacrifice in blood and treasure.<br />
Perhaps the most important argument against the “withdrawal is weak-kneed” meme is that America’s military roams the planet, controls the skies and space, faces no peer competitor, and wields one of the planet’s largest nuclear arsenals. America is responsible for almost half of the world’s military spending and can project its power around the globe. Thus, the contention that America would appear “weak” after withdrawing from Afghanistan is ludicrous.<br />
Unfortunately, bureaucratic inertia and a misplaced conception of Washington’s moral obligations (an argument that more often than not legitimizes America’s military occupation of a foreign people) threaten to trap the United States in Afghanistan for decades. Overall, remaining in Afghanistan is more likely to tarnish America’s reputation and undermine U.S. security than would withdrawal.<br />

<strong>A counterterrorism strategy will maintain US influence and solve legitimacy</strong><br />
<strong>Simon and Stevenson ’9 <span style="font-weight: normal;">* adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, AND </span></strong>Professor of Strategic Studies at the US Naval War College, (Steven and Jonathan, “Afghanistan: How Much is Enough?” Survival, 51:5, 47 – 67, October 2009 <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3042:http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409" rel="nofollow">http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3042 -->)<br />
<br />
An effort on that scale would garner majority US domestic support only if the public sees likely victory and Congress, the White House and the Beltway punditry line up decisively behind the policy. The emerging trends are pointing in the contrary direction. As monthly and annual US casualties in Afghanistan reached historical peaks in August 2009, and the Afghan national election loomed, a poll conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post indicated that most Americans did not support an extended US military commitment in Afghanistan.31 Congressional Democrats are balking at anticipated requests for more troops.32 And even conservative columnists, like the influential George F. Will, have turned against a maximalist Afghanistan policy.33 Overall, increasingly strong perceptions of the Karzai government as inept and corrupt are making prospects that the United States could enlist it as an effective counter-insurgency partner and lend it the legitimacy required to rebuild the country seem more and more baseless.<br />
The upshot is that only if the United States establishes a well-calibrated limited policy now will it have the political flexibility to sustain it over the longer-term and thereby to effectively contain the jihadist threat in Central Asia. If, on the other hand, the Obama administration promises more than it can deliver in Afghanistan, a reprise of Vietnam may occur: once failure becomes clear, domestic support will evaporate, the administration will be compelled to withdraw precipitously, and the United States will lose considerable traction in the region.<br />
Congressional democrats are balking at anticipated requests for more troops<br />
These factors suggest that the United States should limit its Afghanistan/Pakistan policy to counter-terrorism and disown country-wide counterinsurgency and state-building in Afghanistan. At the same time, Washington must remain highly sensitive to the dynamic whereby decreased military activity in Afghanistan combined with robust operations in Pakistan could induce al-Qaeda to return to Afghanistan and render it a main threat once again. In that light, any abrupt wholesale American military withdrawal from Afghanistan would be too risky. Instead, the United States should seek to facilitate a glide-path to a substantial drawdown - and with it fewer casualties and lower expenditures in Afghanistan - over the next few years.<br />
Doing so would involve continuing to suppress al-Qaeda in Pakistan with selective and discriminate drone strikes and denying al-Qaeda access to Afghanistan. The former would require bases within Afghan territory from which to deploy airpower and special-operations forces against terrorists and terrorist infrastructure, as well as the troops and equipment to secure these bases. The latter would call for reinforced border security and force protection within Afghanistan, which in themselves would entail a surprisingly large number of soldiers. For these purposes, the United States would continue to bring extensive human intelligence and surveillance capabilities to bear on Afghanistan to detect and assess potential threats to American interests. To mitigate and eliminate such threats, the generous deployment of US special-operations forces to Afghanistan - which currently comprises some 50% of all US special-operations personnel - would have to be maintained over the medium term. Meanwhile, US train-and-equip programmes for Afghan security forces should be intensified in contemplation of a gradual and controlled hand-off of the domestic counter-terrorism mission to them when they are ready, as well as to prepare them for counterinsurgency operations, should the Afghan government wish to use them for that purpose.<br />
The United States should also provide strong political and economic support for the Afghan government, which is likely to remain under Karzai once the votes of the 20 August election are counted and certified. Kabul, however, should be left to take the lead in managing its relationship with the Taliban (as well as anti-narcotics policy). With US encouragement, the Karzai government should make it clear to Pashtuns in the southern and eastern parts of the country that if they support insurgents or terrorists aiming to destabilise the Afghan or Pakistani governments, they will suffer financially and militarily. Again, some US forces would be needed to give such arrangements teeth, but not at the levels required for an all-out counter-insurgency. American insurance against a militant Islamist coup or an uncontrollable level of destabilisation also should be left in place. This could entail a standby stabilisation force with tactical air capabilities based in or near Kabul, along with a robust quick-reaction force.<br />
That policy would reflect the reality that a deeply committed counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan is potentially counterproductive, probably unwinnable and in any event unnecessary. The United States can protect its interests and fulfil its international security obligations with a far more circumscribed counter-terrorism effort focused on Pakistan. Under such an approach, US policy would recognise Afghanistan as the residual problem that it has, in fact, become.<br />

<strong>No turns:</strong><br />
<strong>1. Obama is an interventionist</strong><br />
<strong>Weigel '8</strong> <span style="font-weight: normal;">– editor of Reason Magazine, B.A. in Journalism and poli. sci. @ Northwestern Univ. (David, October 2008, &quot;Obama's Wars: Liberal interventionism makes a comeback,&quot; Reason, October 8 issue, ProQuest, RG)</span><br />
<br />
They are wrong. Obama believes all of what he said six years ago in Chicago. He has called for, or retroactively endorsed, interventions in Zimbabwe, Pakistan, and Sudan. He has advocated a humanitarian-based foreign policy for his entire public career. Since coming to the U.S. Senate in 2005, he has built up a brain trust of academics and ex-Clintonites who, like him, challenge the logic of the Iraq war but not the logic of wars like Iraq. John McCain looks at American military power and sees a way to &quot;roll back&quot; rogue states. Obama looks at American military power and sees a way to solve international and intranational conflict, regardless of the conflict's immediate impact on national security. McCain seeks to aggressively confront imminent threats. Obama wants to do the same, while forestalling threats of tomorrow with just as much military vigor.<br />
Steve Clemons, director of the American Strategy Program at the center-left New American Foundation, has watched with mounting disappointment as Obama clarifies his stance on foreign interventions. &quot;He's not the Obama we thought he was,&quot; Clemons says.<br />
Clemons, not alone among liberal foreign policy analysts, believes Obama listens to two groups of experts: liberal interventionists and &quot;progressive realists.&quot; The latter group, rattled by the Iraq war, agrees with one of Obama's most traditional homilies from his memoir The Audacity of Hope: &quot;There are few examples in history in which the freedom men and women crave is delivered through outside intervention.&quot; But statements like that are not at the heart of Barack Obama's foreign policy. Liberal interventionism is.<br />
It's true Obama doesn't have a long record of foreign policy stances. &quot;He's not fully formed,&quot; argues the conservative military historian (and Obama supporter) Andrew Bacevich. &quot;The paper trail is thin,&quot; says Ted Galen Carpenter, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Nonetheless, the candidate's views are not hard to discern. He believes the United States makes itself safer by promoting &quot;dignity&quot; in other nations through diplomacy and foreign aid. He also believes crumbling societies and failed regimes such as Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe must be confronted by the international community, including the United States, before they ignite and become threats. And while he sees Iraq as a &quot;dumb war,&quot; he's game for smart warfare in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Obama's views started to crystallize when he came to Washington. The new senator fished around for foreign policy talent and scheduled a brief dinner with Samantha Power, a professor at Harvard's Carr Center for Human Rights Policy and the author of the 2002 book &quot;A Problem from Hell&quot;: America and the Age of Genocide. The dinner went on for hours. Soon Power was taking a weekly shuttle from Boston to Washington to tutor Obama on foreign policy.<br />
Power believes the United States creates long-term problems when it fails to intervene in failing states or to protect threatened populations. &quot;Security for Americans at home and abroad is contingent on international stability,&quot; she writes in &quot;A Problem from Hell&quot;, &quot;and there is perhaps no greater source of havoc than a group of well-armed extremists bent on wiping out a people on ethnic, national, or religious grounds.&quot; That is what Obama now believes. In May 2006, he co-sponsored an amendment to an emergency Iraq and Afghanistan funding bill that added $60 million for U.N. peacekeeping efforts in Darfur. At the same time he was writing The Audacity of Hope, where he reiterated the reasons for rescuing states from failure. &quot;If moral claims are insufficient for us to act as a continent implodes,&quot; Obama wrote, &quot;there are certainly instrumental reasons why the United States and its allies should care about failed states.&quot;<br />
Obama's advisers don't pretend that their candidate is moving very far from the legacy of Bill Clinton—a legacy of humanitarian interventionism that provided some of the moral and legal justifications for Iraq. The problems of this decade, in their view, came because the Bush administration looked at unilateral action as a first course of action and multilateralism as a patina, gathering allies after military decisions had already been made. That's the reverse of what Obama says he wants: multilateralism first and unilateralism as a last resort.<br />
In the summer of 2007, Obama voiced support for the use of unilateral tactical strikes in Pakistan if the country's government was unwilling or unable to go after terrorists. The resulting backlash from Republicans, fellow Democrats, and pundits was one of the reasons Obama scheduled an October speech at Chicago's DePaul University to defend his foreign policy. &quot;We cannot—we must not—let the promotion of our values be a casualty of the Iraq war,&quot; he said.<br />
Anti-interventionists such as Bacevich say the prospective president may yet help end the past two presidents' legacy of intervention. &quot;The idea is not that Obama is some kind of closet conservative,&quot; says Bacevich. If elected, &quot;this liberal Democrat has promised to end the U.S. combat role in Iraq,&quot; and &quot;if history renders a negative verdict on Iraq, that judgment will discredit the doctrine of preventive war.&quot;<br />
But it will not discredit all war, at least not for Obama. The senator believes in humanitarian intervention so deeply that he's already blundered by interfering in the affairs of troubled states. Two years ago, on his first senatorial visit to Kenya, his father's birthplace, Obama delivered a speech at the University of Nairobi that blistered the country's rulers for corruption. Graft, Obama said, is &quot;a crisis that's robbing an honest people of opportunities they have fought for.&quot; The speech emboldened the country's opposition, which nearly won the 2007 elections. When reformers didn't win and rioting voters cried theft, Obama begged for calm. &quot;Despite irregularities in the vote tabulation,&quot; he said, now is not the time to throw that strong democracy away.&quot;<br />
There was a lesson in this, but there was no sign that Obama had learned it: If McCain-style neoconservatism can cause blowback, so can wide-ranging liberal interventionism. The two candidates have a rigidity to their worldviews that's unlike anything we saw from the easily led George W. Bush or the desperate-to-look-tough John Kerry. Obama has taken what he likes from Clinton's brain trust and welded it to his own vision of intervention. Plenty of likeminded liberals agreed with Obama about the Iraq war—that it was an aberration, an unusually bad war botched by a Republican president. They may not necessarily share his views about the next war.<br />

<strong>2. Hegemonic perception inevitable</strong><br />
<strong>Drezner '9</strong> <span style="font-weight: normal;">– professor of international politics at the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a senior editor at The National Interest (Daniel W., 7/15/09, &quot;The False Hegemon,&quot; <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3043:http://nationalinterest.org/article/the-false-hegemon-3184 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nationalinterest.org/article/the-false-hegemon-3184" rel="nofollow">http://nationalinterest.org/article/the-false-hegemon-3184</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3043 -->, RG)</span><br />
<br />
The rest of the world certainly seems to treat America as the hegemonic power, for good or ill. According to the New York Times, Latin America is waiting for the United States to break the deadlock in Honduras. Vladimir Putin is incapable of giving a foreign-policy speech in which he does not blast American hegemony as the root of all of Russia's ills. While Chinese officials talk tough about ending the dollar's reign as the world's reserve currency, its leaders also want America to solve the current economic crisis and to take the lead on global warming in the process.<br />
It's not just foreign leaders who are obsessed with American hegemony. Last week, in an example of true hardship duty, I taught a short course in American foreign policy at the Barcelona Institute for International Studies. The students in my class represented a true cross section of nationalities: Spaniards, Germans, Brits, Estonian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian, Thai, Ghanaian, Kenyan, Turkish, Belgian, Mexican, Nicaraguan and, yes, even Americans. I cannot claim that my students represent a scientific cross section of non-Americans (one of them complained that I did not rely on Marxism as a structural explanation for American foreign policy). Still, by and large the students were bright, well informed about world affairs and cautiously optimistic about President Obama.<br />
That said, a persistent trend among my students was their conviction that the U.S. government was the world's puppeteer, consciously manipulating every single event in world politics. For example, many of them were convinced that George W. Bush ordered Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to precipitate last year's war with Russia. The Ghanaian students wanted to know why Obama visited their country last week. The standard &quot;promotion of good democratic governance&quot; answer did not satisfy them. They were convinced that there had to be some deeper, potentially sinister motive to the whole enterprise. Don't even ask what they thought about the reasons behind the war in Iraq.<br />
To be sure, the United States is a powerful actor; the government is trying to influence global events (and Americans are not immune to their own misperceptions). And good social scientists should always search for underlying causes and not take rhetoric at face value. Nevertheless, the belief in an all-powerful America hatching conspiracies left and right frequently did not jibe with the facts. For many of these students, even apparent policy mistakes were merely examples of American subterfuge.<br />
Ironically, at the moment when many Americans are questioning the future of U.S. hegemony, many non-Americans continue to believe that the U.S. government is diabolically manipulating events behind the scenes. Going forward, the persistence of anti-Americanism in the age of Obama might have nothing to do with the president, or his rhetoric or even U.S. government actions. It might, instead, have to do with the congealed habits of thought that place the United States at the epicenter of all global movings and shakings. The tragedy is that such an exaggerated perception of American power and purpose is occurring at precisely the moment when the United States will need to scale back its global ambitions.<br />
Indeed, the external perception of U.S. omnipresence will make the pursuit of a more modest U.S. foreign policy all the more difficult. The Obama administration has consciously adopted a more modest posture in the hopes of improving America's standing abroad. If the rest of the world genuinely believes that the United States causes everything, however, then the attempt at modesty will inevitably fail.<br />

<br />
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad used a brief visit to Afghanistan on Wednesday to lob insults at the United States and argue that international forces won't stop terrorism and only will lead to more civilian deaths. Mr. Ahmadinejad said the United States was playing a &quot;double game&quot; in Afghanistan, fighting militants it once supported.<br />
His comments were a retort to U.S. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who earlier in the week accused Tehran of &quot;playing a double game&quot; by nurturing relations with the Afghan government while supporting insurgents to undermine U.S. and NATO troops. Tehran denies the allegation. Mr. Ahmadinejad threw back the phrase Wednesday.&quot;I believe that they themselves,&quot; who are now fighting militants in Afghanistan, &quot;are playing a double game,&quot; said Mr. Ahmadinejad, who has made several visits to the country. &quot;They themselves created terrorists, and now they're saying that they are fighting terrorists.&quot;During the 10 years that the Soviet Union fought in Afghanistan, the U.S. supplied rebels with everything from mules to advanced weaponry, including Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which helped neutralize Soviet air power. After the U.S. money evaporated, the world watched Afghanistan plunge into chaos and eventually harbor the al Qaeda terrorist network responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks.While the United States has long-running suspicions about Iran's nuclear program, the two nations view the Taliban as a common enemy. Iran believes that the Taliban warped the Islam religion to suit its ideology. Taliban forces killed eight Iranian diplomats in the late 1990s, and the militant group makes money from drug-smuggling operations across Iran's border with Afghanistan.But while Iran supported efforts to oust the repressive Taliban regime from power in Afghanistan, it opposed the U.S.-led offensive to topple the Taliban after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Iran is wary of a long-term U.S. military presence in the region.Mr. Ahmadinejad spoke at a joint news conference with Afghan President Hamid Karzai at his presidential palace, but it was the Iranian leader who did nearly all of the talking. He even took an additional question from a reporter after Mr. Karzai had ended the conference, and then continued his litany of complaints against the United States.&quot;Your country is located on the other side of the world, so what are you doing here?&quot; Mr. Ahmadinejad asked the reporter from a U.S. media outlet.Mr. Ahmadinejad criticized the West, saying that its policies were resulting in Afghan civilians being killed and that its money spent on troops would be better spent on irrigation and other development projects.&quot;Those who say they are fighting terrorists, they are not successful,&quot; he said. The top commander in Afghanistan, U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, has ordered troops to use airstrikes judiciously and fire cautiously to reduce civilian casualties. Still, each report of civilians killed unleashes raw emotions that highlight a growing impatience with coalition forces' inability to secure the nation after more than eight years of war.<br />

<br />
Senior Iranian leaders repeatedly have vowed to target US interests around the world should their country come under attack from the United States or Israel. Accordingly, Tehran is positioning itself to inflict significant pain on the United States and its allies in multiple countries.<br />
Iran has historically been active in Afghanistan, as have Kabul's other powerful neighbours, Pakistan and Russia. However, there is growing evidence that Tehran has recalculated its strategic interests there as tension rises with the United States over its nuclear ambitions.<br />
As the world's largest Shiite country, Iran has been the traditional foreign backer of Afghanistan's Shiites. After Russian withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, Iran became a patron of the Northern Alliance, while Pakistan supported the victorious Taliban. Iran viewed the rise of the Sunni Taliban with deep concern. After the fall of central Afghanistan to the group in 1998, Iran said it had the right to take all necessary action to protect its security interests. It followed up with a number of measures.<br />
Since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, Iran pursued two major strategic objectives in Afghanistan:<br />
1. Partnership. It has developed a close strategic partnership with President Hamid Karzai's government:<br />
• Iran and Afghanistan have joint trade, energy, investment, cultural and scientific projects.<br />
• This year, they are expected to begin work on road and rail links.<br />
• They have also cooperated in efforts to crack down on the rising drug trade.<br />
2. Influence. Tehran also has moved to exert influence in western and central Afghanistan. Tehran's goal is to secure strategic depth and influence in areas close to the border. Some activities are directed at the United States.<br />
The bilateral relationship has been largely cooperative. However, the prospect of conflict with the United States has added a new dimension. Tehran regards its involvement in the country as a hedge against a possible US or Israeli strike against nuclear facilities in Iran. This means that Iran is prepared to undermine US interests in the country should relations between Washington and Tehran deteriorate substantially.<br />
There is scope for friction in three main areas:<br />
1. Taliban. Iranian 'hedging' has involved opening contacts with Afghan insurgent groups over the past two years. There is evidence of direct contacts between Iranian intelligence agents and the Taliban leadership. There are also signs that the Taliban have sought to acquire weapons and weapons technology from Iran. However, there are no indications that Iran has responded to such moves.<br />
2. Other insurgents. Individuals within the Iranian government have provided money and training to a small number of foreign jihadists in eastern Afghanistan. There has been some cooperation between insurgents in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, who use Iran as a transit country.<br />
3. Warlords. Iran could also use its close relationship with warlords further to undermine US efforts in Afghanistan by spreading violence to western and central parts of the country.<br />

<strong>There is a high risk of a miscalculated war.</strong><br />

<br />
Yet there is another side to the US-Iranian polarisation that could prove dangerous not only to Washington but also the Islamic Republic and which arises from the miscalculations of the Iranian leadership itself. Iran's President Ahmadinejad has made himself popular in much of the Arab world, and among Muslims more broadly, for his outspoken denunciations of the US. He has also heartened many by his calls for the destruction of Israel (something he did indeed call for, despite claims by some inside and outside Iran that he was mistranslated: the words mahv bayad bashad [must be wiped out] leave no room for doubt). <br />
Yet Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has also thrown caution, and a due evaluation of the enmity and strength of his enemies, to the wind. (Ayatollah Khomeini once rebuked Ali Akbar Velayati for following him in a violent denunciation of Saudi Arabia, reminding the longstanding the foreign minister that it was his job to maintain relations with other states.) At the same time the president has indulged in a set of ill-conceived economic policies at home, squandering oil revenue to boost consumption, launching retrograde educational and cultural campaigns against secularism, while failing to meet the campaign promises to the poor that, in 2005, secured his surprise election. The failure of his candidates to prevail in the December 2006 elections to the Expediency Council, an important constitutional watchdog, and a growth of criticism even from conservatives and other clerics, augurs ill for his future. <br />
No one can tell where the current confrontation between Tehran and Washington will lead to. Perhaps, as a result of impatience, miscalculation or innate risk-taking, Iran and the US will be at war in the near future. Or it may prove to be the case that both are playing for time: the Iranians want to spin out negotiations with the west over the nuclear issue until the US position in Iraq is even weaker, the US may want to stay its hand in the hope that domestic economic and social problems will further weaken the regime and allow them to precipitate political upheaval. Everything is possible. <br />
The roots of turbulence <br />
In this context it is worth looking more closely at the way in which Iran formulates its foreign policy, and the roots of its high-risk policy. Much is made of the fact that Iran is an ancient imperial power, one of the four countries in the world - along with China, Egypt and Yemen - which can claim continuity as a state over 3,000 years. It may also be some satisfaction to Iranian leaders that with their influence in Lebanon and Palestine, Iran now has a military emplacement on the shores of the Mediterranean for the first time since the Achaemenid empire (c 550-350 BCE). Moreover, Iran's aspiration to nuclear capability, in whatever form, is as much due to the aspiration to be a major power as to military factors, just as is the retention of what are in practice useless and expensive weapons by Britain and France. Certainly, Iranian official, and popular, attitudes towards nearly all their neighbours (with the interesting exception of the Armenians) are replete with prejudice and a sense of superiority. &quot;You colonialists left your goat's droppings around the region, but sooner or later we will sweep them away&quot;, one interlocutor in Tehran said to me. When I asked what these &quot;goat's droppings&quot; were, he replied: &quot;Pakistan, Iraq and Israel&quot;. <br />
It is in part this self-perception which explains one of the most constant features of Iranian foreign policy over the past century, and one to which my diplomat companion was drawing attention during our lunch in Tehran: namely, the recurrent tendency of Iranian leaders to overplay their hand. Even a brief list is striking: <br />
in the second world war, Reza Shah, the first of the two Pahlavi monarchs, thought he could balance British and Russian pressure by maintaining relations with Germany, but in the end, and as soon as Russia entered the war in 1941, Iran was invaded and Reza Shah sent off to exile in Mauritius<br />
in the early 1950s, the nationalist prime minister Mohammad Mossadeq thought he could nationalise Iranian oil (hitherto a monopoly of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, today's BP) on his own terms and avoid a compromise with western governments: in the end, he was overthrown in the CIA and MI6 coup of August 1953 during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, Ayatollah Khomeini failed to grasp the Iraqi near-surrender of 1982, a consequence of his belief that Iranian forces could topple the Iraqi regime and impose a Shi'a substitute; the result was six more years of war, the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iranians, the entry of the US navy into the war on the side of the Iraqis, and (in August 1988) a far less favourable peace.<br />
Much is made too of the fact that Iran is the most important Shi'a state and that the last great Persian dynasty, the Safavid (1502-1736) made Shi'ism a powerful political and military, as well as cultural, force in the region, a rival for centuries to the Sunni Ottoman empire to the west. This Shi'a identity, one that the mullahs have in any case overblown, has also proved to be a mixed blessing for the Islamic republic; for many outside Iran - and even for Shi'a in countries like Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - Iran's projection of its Shi'ism has put them in a difficult situation, not least for the implied claim of the superior authority of clergy, and politicians, based inside Iran. Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the leading Shi'a cleric in Iraq, and himself an Iranian, has long sought to limit such influence, as has, in a much rougher way, the rising Shi'a leader, Muqtada al-Sadr. <br />
Iran's imperial and nationalist past and its Shi'a identity, are not, however, enough to explain the noisy and risky policy Iran is pursuing today. Here two other factors need to be brought into account. The first is that Iran is an oil-producing country, a fact that, especially at a time of high oil prices, gives to the state some leeway simultaneously to mollify the people and pursue expensive military programmes. <br />
The problem is that these expenditures do little to alleviate the long-term problems of the economy and are usually, is the Iranian case, and also that of Venezuela, accompanied by much waste, corruption and factionalism. In this regard, Ahmadinejad and Hugo Chávez are two of a kind: intoxicated with their own rhetoric, insouciant about the longer term economic development of their oil industries and economy as a whole, and wilfully provocative, towards the United States and immediate neighbours alike, in foreign policy. <br />
The second and indeed the most important (and neglected) factor explaining contemporary Iran, however, is a fact evident in its historical origin, policy and rhetoric: that the Islamic Republic of Iran is a country that has emerged from a revolution and that this revolution has far from lost its dynamic, at home or abroad. <br />
It is not in the imperial dreams of ancient Persia, or the global vision of Shi'a clergy, but in the repetition by Iran of the same policies, aspirations and mistakes of previous revolutionary regimes, from France in the 1790s, to Cuba in the 1960s and 1970s that the underlying logic of its actions can be seen. <br />

<strong>This inadvertent war that will quickly escalate</strong><br />
<strong>Chubin ‘8</strong> <span style="font-weight: normal;">– Director of Studies @ Geneva Centre for Security Policy [Shahram Chubin (Former Director of Regional Security Studies @ International Institute for Strategic Studies), “Iran's 'Risk-Taking' in Perspective,” The Institut Français des Relations Internationales (Ifri) Winter 2008]</span><br />
<br />
In Afghanistan as in Iraq, Iran has an interest in the stability of its neighbor, and preventing the emergence of extremism on its doorstep. However, as in Iraq, Iran also sees an interest in weakening the United States. It does this by supporting elements hostile to Western troops, thus running the risk of a political implosion in that country that could harm Iran’s own interests. Iran thus covers all bets by supporting the Karzai government, warlords in the Herat (Shi’i) regions and insurgents opposed to the NATO presence including their former foes, the Taleban.25 While investing in Afghanistan, Iran is also destabilizing it by the forcible mass expulsion of refugees and permitting (if not facilitating) arms trafficking into that country.26<br />
Iranian risk-taking is most clear in recent activities in the Persian Gulf, which raise questions pertinent to its conduct in Iraq and Afghanistan: to what extent is the central government in Tehran actually in control of Iranian policy? Are there freelancers or rogue elements that can influence policy by precipitating crises?<br />
The question of the influence of the Revolutionary Guard has been raised in relation to the Al Qods brigade in Iraq and the arms flows into Afghanistan. It is also posed with regard to Iran’s provocative capture and subsequent release of British marines in the Gulf in March 2007 (An incident that followed a similar one earlier, in 2004). Coming on the heels of increased tensions between Tehran and Washington, and in the wake of a U.S. military build-up in the Gulf, the incident could easily have provoked a crisis if the British had resisted arrest and deaths had occurred. Such a fight might have escalated rapidly. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard appears to have acted on its own initiative, just as earlier they had been responsible for painting graffiti on U.S. warships, another dangerously irresponsible act in a war-zone.27<br />
The evidence that the Iranian government may not be in full control raises the question of civilian control of the military but also suggests that the military may have less concern for the “diplomatic consequences” of specific incidents.28 This insensitivity may be explained by a fixation on domestic politics discussed earlier. More recently attempts to further exploit the incident and “humiliate” the British is suggested by the decision to parade the boats captured in March on the streets of Tehran.29 Another naval incident that risked hostilities and escalation occurred in January 2008. A number of small revolutionary guards in well armed, high speed boats converged on the US fleet near the Hormuz straits while making threatening noises and demands. Interpretations differed. What an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman called “an ordinary occurrence”, President Bush called a “provocative act” noting “this not the time for any provocation in the region.” Admiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, while warning Iran not to underestimate US resolve said “We are not anxious to see a miscalculation here which could occur, and certainly not anxious to get into combat with them.”30 France considered Iran’s behavior dangerous. This was also the view of the GCC states, although they remained silent.31<br />
What made this incident especially risky was the fact that the overall context of Iran-US relations was tense with Iran’s proxy war in Iraq and U.S. hints of military strikes on facilities and retaliation. But over and above that, the incident was indicative of the two states’ perceptions. The US was concerned about the vulnerability of its fleet in an enclosed area, to landbased missiles, mines and the swarming of fast patrol-boats that could overload its timely means of detection and retaliation, and inflict a major loss on it.32 In probing and posturing Iran may have been testing U.S. defences, U.S. will, or simply demonstrating the Guards’ swashbuckling reliance on asymmetrical war. Whatever the explanation, the risks of an inadvertent clash that could escalate was high. Again the question raised, but not answered, was whether the incident was centrally controlled and planned, or the product of local – i.e. Guards – initiative. Pg. 18-19<br />

<br />
In the end of course we will all lose. Because the nuclear genie, unleashed from its bottle in the war against Iran, will never retreat. And just like the US could develop nuclear weapons in only 4 years with completely new technology 60 years ago, many more countries and groups will be highly motivated to do it in the coming year.s<br />
Think about the current disproportionate response of Israel, applied in a conflict where the contenders have nuclear weapons. 10 to 1 retaliation, starting with a mere 600 casualties, wipes out the entire Earth's population in eight easy steps. Who will be willing to stop the escalation? The country that lost 60,000 citizens in the last hit? The one that lost 600,000? 6 million?<br />
As the nuclear holocaust unfolds, some will remember the Lebanon conflict and subsequent Iran war and blame it on Israel. Others will properly blame Americans, for having allowed their Executive to erase the 60-year old taboo against the use of nuclear weapons, first in doctrine and then in practice, despite having the most powerful conventional military force in the world. Others of course will blame &quot;Muslim extremism&quot;.<br />
And then the blaming will wither away as a three-billion-year old experiment, life on planet Earth, comes to an end. <br />

Iranian president has called on the US to withdraw its troops from the Gulf region and Afghanistan.<br />
&quot;The region has no need for alien troops and they should return home and let the regional states take care of their own affairs,&quot; Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a speech marking the country's annual Army Day on Sunday.&quot;They must leave the region and this is not a request but an order, and the will of the regional nations,&quot; he said.He said the deployment of US and Nato troops in Iraq and Afghanistan under the pretext of fighting terrorism had not only failed, but also increased insecurity in both countries.The president also said that Israel, the &quot;main instigator of conflict&quot; in the Middle East, was on its way to collapse and that regional powers wanted it uprooted.&quot;This is the will of the regional nations that after 60 odd years, the root of this corrupt microbe and the main reason for insecurity in the region be pulled out,&quot; Ahmadinejad said.<br />
He said that except the &quot;Zionist regime (Israel),&quot; Iran considered all other countries as &quot;friend and brother&quot; with whom the Islamic state wanted peaceful co-existence. On the day that Iran was exhibiting its latest military hardware, Ahmadinejad vowed that the country would use all its military potential in case of any armed aggression.<br />

<br />
Over the past thirty years, U.S. relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran have fluctuated between bad and very bad. The primary issue from the United States’ view has been Iran’s attempts to overturn the regional order in the Middle East through revolutionary activity. It has now been seven years since the revelations about Iran’s undeclared nuclear activities first surfaced. Since then, little discernible progress has been made in uncovering the full scope of Iran’s program and whether it includes a weapons program. Attempts since 2002 to roll back or at least slow Iran’s nuclear ambitions have proven fruitless, imparting a sense of urgency to the issue. Neither threats of punishment nor inducements have worked. Instead, threats unify Iranians behind an unloved regime while inducements threaten the regime’s foundations, which are built on hostility to the world, embattlement, and ‘‘resistance.’’ In addition, Iran fears the U.S./West’s friendship more than its enmity.The dilemma today for the United States is that neither the military nor the diplomatic track appears likely to yield results soon. This dilemma is further accentuated since the June 12, 2009 elections highlighted the fractures in Iranian elite, as well as society, and the current regime’s sickening repression of the public. The elections also brought forth the regime’s newfound interest in at least tactically engaging the West, as in Geneva in October 2009. By engagement, the regime not only hopes to deflect external pressures, but also to gain a measure of legitimacy and to dishearten its political opponents.Yet, contrary to conventional thinking, Iran’s nuclear policy has never been publicly debated and has never enjoyed a national consensus beyond the broad,<br />
Divisions on the nuclear question exist and are in fact a surrogate for a broader question: how should Iran relate to the international community? Differences exist between those who seek a larger role for Iran in the international community as a normal state, accommodating international concerns, and those who wish to acquire a nuclear weapons capability to continue to confront the West, but with an ‘‘equalizer.’’<br />
There is a diplomatic conundrum in dealing with Iran. Fixing the nuclear issue, however urgent, is a stop-gap solution. Ultimately, concerns about Iran’s nuclear ambitions stem from an absence of trust. This is the product of Iran’s behavior over the past thirty years and the nature of the regime itself, characterized by opacity and subterfuge. Ironically, Tehran recognizes that the real issue is the regime itself. It argues that the West’s focus on the nuclear issue is merely an excuse an opening wedge to achieve regime change. This, they conclude, means that any substantive compromise or concession on their part will only lead to a series of escalating demands that will empty Iran of its revolutionary content in other words, lead to regime change. The implication of this analysis is that everything is connected and that only a ‘‘grand bargain’’ can work. Yet, such a bargain without a change in the regime’s behavior cannot be feasible.<br />

<br />
The US military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan has certainly altered the substance of US-Iran relations. Although Iran welcomed the toppling by the United States of two of its foes — the Taliban and the Ba'athist regime in Iraq — it has been disquieted by the United States' categorizing it as part of an &quot;axis of evil,&quot; and, more recently, branding it as a new Cold War enemy requiring the United States to forge an anti-Iran alliance in the broader Middle East.<br />
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, Iran is interested in deepening the new political processes that have brought Iran-friendly regimes to power. In Iraq, Iran has vested its interests in the institutionalization of the post-Saddam political order, which is why Tehran has welcomed the latest political compact among Iraq's ruling factions (as has the United States). In addition to a generous $1 billion credit, Tehran has been assisting Iraq's economic reconstruction by signing trade, energy, and border security agreements.<br />
That means the United States must take Iran's offer of cooperation on Iraq's security seriously, in light of three rounds of trilateral talks in Baghdad culminating in the agreement to set up a joint committee of experts. Unfortunately, such significant developments are potentially jeopardized by the contradictory stance of the United States, reflected in its refusal to release the five Iranians it kidnapped in Erbil, Kurdistan.<br />
That would be a pity, seeing how long and difficult it has been for the United States and Iran to overcome their apprehensions about direct dialogue, not to mention the prospects of a broader dialogue on such thorny issues as regional security and antiterrorism. Good-faith negotiations by both sides can lead to concrete confidence-building measures and tangible benefits, in light of Iran's influence with the Shi'ite groups in Iraq.<br />
What's more, as Ali Larijani, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, has repeatedly said, the US-Iran dialogue can have a positive impact on talks about Iran's nuclear program. The linkage between the two can be positive or negative, but US policy makers would be remiss not to see the linkage.<br />
True, Iran has not suspended its uranium enrichment program, but it has not ignored the UN Security Council resolutions on Iran either, as can be discerned in the latest report by the International Atomic Energy Agency citing &quot;significant progress&quot; in Iran-IAEA cooperation. With the United States and Iran talking in Iraq and Iran-IAEA cooperation yielding concrete results in terms of Iran's nuclear transparency, the stage is potentially set for de-escalating the US-Iran tensions, particularly if both sides adopt a long-term view and sort out the security dimension.<br />
A mutual moratorium on demonization of the other side, coupled with earnest attempts to explore areas of potential cooperation between the United States and Iran, is needed in order to remove what former president Mohammad Khatami once referred to as the tall &quot;wall of distrust&quot; between the two sides.<br />

<strong>Now or never – talks now key to solve nuclear standoff before its too late</strong><br />

<br />
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, said Wednesday that talks about his country's nuclear programme will not take place &quot;under the shadow&quot; of threats. The United States and other countries should grasp this opportunity, rein in the rhetoric of military action and return to talks with Iran without delay. The time is ripe to take steps towards a negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear conundrum.<br />
Previous diplomatic efforts with Iran failed because the United States was not at the table and because Iran seemed immune to outside pressure and did not have much to gain by talking to Europe alone. Now, the circumstances are fundamentally improved. Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief, who is expected to spearhead prospective talks between major powers and Iran, still needs more than a favourable climate for successful negotiations. To find a solution to the Iranian nuclear standoff, the US needs to be ready to offer Iran a security assurance; and other countries must be willing to go beyond the current set of economic sanctions if Tehran continues to violate nonproliferation rules.<br />
The US refusal to engage fully and talk directly with Iran wrecked the prospects for earlier diplomatic endeavours with Iran. But direct talks are now a key pillar of President Obama's nonproliferation strategy vis-à-vis Tehran. And with American negotiators present, what Iran wants most – a broader discussion about its national security in the regional context – can be addressed in a credible manner because the US is the only state that can ultimately assuage Iran's security concerns.<br />
Moreover, despite President Ahmadinejad's early dismissal of the new sanctions, there is evidence suggesting that the stepped-up economic punishment is adversely affecting Iran. Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Agency, recently became the first senior Iranian official to admit that UN sanctions could slow the country's nuclear efforts.<br />
On this point, Tehran and Washington find rare common ground. In early August, President Obama said that &quot;the costs of the sanctions are going to be higher than Iran would have anticipated.&quot; US, EU, Canadian and Australian unilateral sanctions are also likely to increase the pressure on an already mismanaged Iranian economy.<br />
So with efforts at achieving a first round of talks on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York in September underway, how can Ashton exercise influence? Since becoming the EU's top diplomat in December 2009, Ashton has made the Iranian issue a top priority. Throughout the spring, she continuously urged Iran to return to the negotiation table, while at the same time maintaining that her approach included both carrots and sticks – supporting UN sanctions and then coordinating unilateral EU economic measures against Iran.<br />
On 20 July 2010, Ashton met Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, to stress renewed negotiations. Days later, after some diplomatic pressure applied by Turkey, President Ahmadinejad agreed to renew discussions with the P5+1 (US, Russia, China, the UK, France and Germany).<br />
That Iran has agreed to talks is not only confirmation that Ashton's diplomatic outreach worked, it also increases her international clout. But it is not only Ashton, Obama and international and unilateral economic pressure that have facilitated the upcoming return of negotiations. Tehran also deserves a measure of credit for creating space for compromise over its nuclear programme. Following the announcement that Tehran was ready to discuss with the P5+1, Salehi said that so long as nuclear fuel to Iran would be guaranteed, the country was ready to rethink its controversial decision to enrich uranium to 20%.<br />
While this statement and recent developments could be another move from the Iranian nuclear playbook of delay and deception, it may also indicate that there is flexibility over its nuclear programme. The US must now be willing to put an Iranian security assurance on the table, even while other countries involved should be prepared to increase economic pressure on Tehran if it continues its nuclear trickery.<br />
It is this combination of carrots and sticks that has brought Iran back to talks, and these will be the baseline conditions for a nuclear weapons-free Iran. So let's talk with Iran: a negotiated solution is now on the horizon.<br />
<br />
<strong>Withdrawing from Afghanistan is vital to credible deterrence to denuclearize Iran – prevents proliferation and nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Garfinkle, 9</strong> <span style="font-weight: normal;">– editor of The American Interest, former professor of Middle East Politics at the University of Pennsylvania and at the School of Advanced International Studies of The Johns Hopkins University (Adam, “The real linkage: Afghanistan and Iran,” 11/4, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3052:http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/mesh/2009/11/the-real-linkage-afghanistan-and-iran/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/mesh/2009/11/the-real-linkage-afghanistan-and-iran/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/mesh/2009/11/the-real-linkage-afghanistan-and-iran/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3052 -->)</span><br />
<br />
As President Obama decides how to proceed in the Afghan war, he needs to add one more variable that is rarely mentioned: Iranian determination to acquire nuclear weapons. An ongoing Afghanistan campaign means that resort to force against Iran would be tantamount to starting a second war. The politics being what they are, that will knock the military option against Iran off the table, with negative implications for an empowered diplomacy toward Iran.<br />
Consider the timelines of the Afghan and Iranian policy portfolios, as President Obama must. Whether or not Iran parts with some of its fissile material in coming months in accord with the recent Geneva deal, it will still have enough nuclear “stuff” for one at least bomb within 18 months. (It may have more than that if, as looks increasingly likely, the recent Qom revelation displayed the tail end of a significant and protracted effort.) It will probably have overcome its weaponization and delivery-system challenges within 36-48 months. In 36-48 months U.S. and NATO forces will probably still be fighting in Afghanistan, whether Obama decides on a minimalist, counterterrorism-plus approach or General Stanley McChrystal’s counterinsurgency-minus one.<br />
The logic and overlapping timetables of the Afghan-Iran linkage suggest a need to choose. How should we think about that choice?<br />
Both problems are consequential, but an Iranian nuclear breakout poses more serious long-term security dangers to the region and to the United States than any likely fallout from the Afghan war. Losing in Afghanistan could boost the morale of Islamist extremists worldwide, harm NATO and possibly exacerbate the situation in Pakistan. But acquiescing to an Iranian nuclear capability would spell the collapse of the Non-Proliferation Treaty regime and likely set off a proliferation race in and around the region that could catalyze a regional nuclear war. Unlike the Cold War deterrence relationship many of us remember, which involved just two sides with mostly secure weapons and command-and-control systems, a multifaceted nuclear Middle East without stable second-strike arsenals would be extremely crisis unstable and accident-prone, and could “leak” dangerous materiel to terrorists, as well. It is facile to assert that a deterrence relationship which worked in one context will also work in others; that assumption with respect to Iran is a textbook example of the “lesser-included case” fallacy.<br />
If American interests require the prevention of an Iranian bomb, then major combat operations in Afghanistan must end before the moment to decide on Iran is at hand. That’s not the track we’re now on. General McChrystal’s plan is a stop-loss effort that cannot achieve a level playing field upon which to drive a new Afghan diplomacy, let alone achieve anything remotely resembling victory in three years or less.<br />
There are only two alternatives to preserve a credible military option, and hence a credible diplomacy, with regard to Iran: accept defeat in Afghanistan, whatever we may call it, and leave; or surge militarily to reverse the perception of Taliban ascendancy, and then drive a new political arrangement there to end the war within the next 18-24 months.<br />
Either option is preferable to a protracted and inconclusive bloodletting, but the latter option—depending more on air power and avoiding the massive (and counterproductive) garrisoning of the country with foreign forces—is preferable. It would avoid the optic of defeat. A new Afghan coalition government, blessed by a Loya Jirga within and supported by high-level contact-group diplomacy from without, would have at least a chance of creating a stable environment over the longer run—something that cannot reliably be said about the current regime in Kabul.<br />
A success in Afghanistan also would lift the admittedly modest prospects that diplomacy can persuade the Iranians to step back from the nuclear precipice, just as failure to turn the tide would likely tempt them forward. And if the Iranians do not step back, a success in Afghanistan will better undergird the diplomacy that must accompany any military operation directed toward them.<br />
Clearly, however, no McChrystal-plus option is on the table. This suggests that, barring some major out-of-the-blue event, like the collapse of the Iranian regime, the administration will be unable to consider using force against Iran when the time comes to decide, even if it might wish to do so. And Tehran’s knowledge that all U.S. military options are off the table is not liable to be helpful.<br />

US President George W. Bush said a nuclear Iran would mean World War III. Israeli newscasts featured Gog &amp; Magog maps of the likely alignment of nations in that potential conflict. Channel 2 and Channel 10 TV showed the world map, sketching the basic alignment of the two opposing axes in a coming world war, in a manner evoking associations of the Gog and Magog prophecy for many viewers. The prophecy of Gog and Magog refers to a great world war centered on the Holy Land and Jerusalem and first appears in the book of Yechezkel (Ezekiel). On one side were Israel, the United States, Britain, France and Germany. On the other were Iran, Russia, China, Syria and North Korea. US President Bush said Wednesday during a press conference that Iran attaining nuclear weapons raises the risk of “World War III. If Iran had a nuclear weapon, it’d be a dangerous threat to world peace,” Bush said. “So I told people that if you’re interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought to be interested [in preventing a nuclear Iran]…I take the threat of Iran with a nuclear weapon very seriously.”Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Iran Tuesday and slammed the US’s refusal to rule out the use of force against Iran’s nuclear project. “Not only should we reject the use of force, but also the mention of force as a possibility,” he said. Russia has blocked tougher UN sanctions in the UN Security Council, where it has veto power. The Russian president asserts that there is no evidence Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons rather than a peaceful nuclear power program.Israel’s Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni called for a new Security Council resolution against Iran at a press conference following her meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Wednesday. “I do believe there is a need for another Security Council resolution,” she told reporters. “In the past, the need to get everybody on board – including Russia and China – led to some compromises on the nature of the sanctions. I hope this will not be the case this time.” Prime Minister Ehud Olmert announced Wednesday a sudden trip to Moscow Thursday morning, where he will meet with Putin about Iran. Other topics of discussion will reportedly be Russia’s continued supply of weapons to Syria, which have then made their way into the hands of various terrorist groups based there as well.<br />

<strong>Most likely scenario for nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Cirincione ‘8</strong> <span style="font-weight: normal;">(Joseph, Pres. Ploughshares Fund, Current History, “A Mideast Nuclear Chain Reaction?” December, Esbso)</span><br />
<br />
A nuclear arms race has begun in the Middle East. It is not overt—no country has declared its desire for nuclear weapons, and none is rushing to build a bomb through a “Manhattan Project.” But there is a race nonetheless, one with the potential to be truly catastrophic. In the past two years, over a dozen Middle Eastern nations have declared their interest in civilian nuclear power or research programs. While several nations in the region already have small nuclear research reactors, and Israel has used its research reactor to produce enough plutonium for 100 to 180 nuclear weapons, the only Middle East nation to build a nuclear power plant has been Iran. In all of Africa, meanwhile, there are only two nuclear power reactors, both in South Africa. But suddenly, 63 years after the dawn of the nuclear age, these dozen states in the Middle East are rushing to invest billions in nuclear plants. This is not about energy; this is about Iran. It is not Iran’s nuclear reactor that concerns its neighbors—more than 40 nations around the world have nuclear power reactors. What is ringing alarm bells around the region is Iran’s drive to build facilities to enrich uranium and produce plutonium. The same centrifuges that can enrich uranium to low levels for fuel can be used to produce highly enriched uranium for bombs. The same factories that can reprocess nuclear fuel rods for waste disposal can separate out plutonium for bombs from the spent fuel. Once Iran’s plants are fully operational, the nation will be just a political decision away from a nuclear weapon. A US National Intelligence Estimate on Iran in December 2007 concluded that, while Iran had ended its dedicated nuclear weapons programs in 2003 and had not resumed them since, it would be technically capable of producing enough highly enriched uranium for a weapon some time between 2010 and 2015. Iran denies wanting nuclear weapons, and public opinion polls show most Iranians want the right to make nuclear fuel and energy but do not want the weapons. (I confirmed these views in interviews during a visit to Iran in 2005.) Nor does it appear that an official decision has been made to acquire nuclear weapons. Most likely, there is a consensus among the ruling factions to acquire the technologies that would allow Tehran to build weapons in the future should it decide to do so—a situation similar to Japan’s. The likely factors driving Iran’s considerations are those that influence most nations: the three P’s of power, prestige, and politics. Nuclear weapons would offer some protection against attacks by the United States or Israel and enhance Iran’s ability to project power throughout the region. Nuclear bombs are also still seen as a totem of great power status, a status that Iranians believe their history and geopolitical role warrant. Finally, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has skillfully used the nuclear issue to mobilize nationalist sentiment behind his otherwise unpopular government. By posing as the warrior leader defending Iran from the United States and Israel, he is able to distract attention—at least for a while—from his failed economic and reform policies. Tit for tat In any case, the Sunni Arab and Turkish rivals of this Shiite Persian state have decided that they cannot allow Iran alone to gain the military, political, and diplomatic advantage that nuclear weapons confer. They are now embarked on the decades-long process of acquiring the technological and industrial capacity to match Iran. And it is all legal—all allowed under the rules of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that each of the nations has signed. These nations claim that their purpose in developing nuclear capacity is to diversify energy sources, combat global warming, and preserve oil for export. And perhaps it is for some. But King Abdullah of Jordan, in a rare moment of candor, admitted in January 2007: “The rules have changed on the nuclear subject through the whole region. Where I think Jordan was saying, ‘We’d like to have a nuclear-free zone in the area,’ after this summer, everybody’s going for nuclear programs.” The summer of 2006 was indeed a critical time, but not because any breakthroughs were achieved regarding the cost, safety, or waste disposal problems of nuclear reactors, nor because of regional screenings of the climate change documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Instead, Sunni Muslim states decided at that time to hedge their nuclear bets as US and European efforts to rein in Iran’s enrichment program faltered; as the United States appeared bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan, limiting its ability to confront Iran militarily even as its removal of two regional rivals strengthened Tehran; and as Iran demonstrated its expanded strategic reach in the 2006 Lebanon war, thwarting Israel through its ally, Hezbollah. Egypt and Turkey, two of Iran’s main rivals, have progressed the furthest in the nuclear race. Both have flirted with nuclear weapons programs in the past and both have now announced ambitious nuclear construction plans. In March 2008, Egypt signed a $1.5 billion agreement with Russia that will result in the first of several Egyptian nuclear power reactors that were proposed by President Hosni Mubarak in October 2007. Turkey plans to build three reactors, with the first slated to start construction by the end of 2008. Not to be outdone, Saudi Arabia this year has signed nuclear energy agreements with France and the United States. The United States in May agreed to help Saudi Arabia “develop civilian nuclear energy for use in medicine, industry, and power generation.” This followed France’s winning a multibillion-dollar deal in January to assist in the construction of nuclear power stations. France, in fact, has been the most aggressive of the nuclear salesmen rushing to the region. In addition to working with Saudi Arabia, France in January agreed to a $3.4 billion deal to build nuclear power stations in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. France over the past year also has inked nuclear agreements with Algeria, Jordan, Morocco, and Libya. The Gulf Cooperation Council (representing Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates) is conducting a joint study on the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. An overall umbrella for such initiatives was provided by the Arab League when, at the end of its summit meeting in March 2007, it called on the Arab states to expand the use of peaceful nuclear technology in all domains. Thus far, only Turkey has hinted that its nuclear plans could include uranium enrichment facilities. But if the nuclear programs proceed and nations in the region acquire a broad range of nuclear technology and skills, enrichment or reprocessing capabilities would be far easier to justify (as a necessary domestic source of fuel) and to develop (as foreign companies transfer nuclear skills and knowledge to national engineers and scientists). A recipe for nuclear war Thus, the true danger of Iran’s developing the ability to make a nuclear weapon is not that Iran would use the weapon against its neighbors or the United States. The threat of instant and overwhelming response would deter such use. Nor is the critical danger that Iran would willingly provide a nuclear weapon to a terrorist group. No nation ever has, not China during the Cultural Revolution nor North Korea over the 20 years that it has had bomb material. The real danger is that Iran’s nuclearization would help create a region in which four or five nations are nucleararmed, instead of just one (Israel). If existing territorial, political, and religious disputes remain unresolved, this is a recipe for nuclear war. John Chipman, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, warns of “a regional cascade of proliferation among Iran’s neighbors.” He adds that “Iran’s program could become a powerful regional proliferation driver, building on regional rivalry, security concerns, and one-upmanship.” A report prepared for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in February 2008 similarly warned of a chain reaction. The authors concluded that Saudi Arabia was “the state most likely to pursue nuclear weapons in response” to Iran’s actions. Egypt “would perceive a nuclear-armed Iran as especially threatening,” the report found, predicting “significant pressure on Egypt to follow suit.” Such pressure could push Turkey toward acquiring nuclear weapons as well. The clock is ticking. CIA Director Michael Hayden warned in September 2008: “Our judgment is that [Iran could achieve nuclear capability] toward the middle of the next decade. It can be accelerated, it can be decelerated, based on a variety of factors.”<br />

<strong>Middle East prolif would be chain reaction ending in multiple nuclear wars.</strong><br />
<strong>Kurtz ‘6</strong> (Stanley, “Our Fallout-Shelter Future”, 8-28, L/N)<br />
<br />
Proliferation optimists, on the other hand, see reasons for hope in the record of nuclear peace during the Cold War. While granting the risks, proliferation optimists point out that the very horror of the nuclear option tends, in practice, to keep the peace. Without choosing between hawkish proliferation pessimists and dovish proliferation optimists, Rosen simply asks how we ought to act in a post-proliferation world. Rosen assumes (rightly I believe) that proliferation is unlikely to stop with Iran. Once Iran gets the bomb, Turkey and Saudi Arabia are likely to develop their own nuclear weapons, for self-protection, and so as not to allow Iran to take de facto cultural-political control of the Muslim world. (I think you've got to at least add Egypt to this list.) With three, four, or more nuclear states in the Muslim Middle East, what becomes of deterrence? A key to deterrence during the Cold War was our ability to know who had hit whom. With a small number of geographically separated nuclear states, and with the big opponents training satellites and specialized advance-guard radar emplacements on each other, it was relatively easy to know where a missile had come from. But what if a nuclear missile is launched at the United States from somewhere in a fully nuclearized Middle East, in the middle of a war in which, say, Saudi Arabia and Iran are already lobbing conventional missiles at one another? Would we know who had attacked us? Could we actually drop a retaliatory nuclear bomb on someone without being absolutely certain? And as Rosen asks, What if the nuclear blow was delivered against us by an airplane or a cruise missile? It might be almost impossible to trace the attack back to its source with certainty, especially in the midst of an ongoing conventional conflict. More Terror We're familiar with the horror scenario of a Muslim state passing a nuclear bomb to terrorists for use against an American city. But imagine the same scenario in a multi-polar Muslim nuclear world. With several Muslim countries in possession of the bomb, it would be extremely difficult to trace the state source of a nuclear terror strike. In fact, this very difficulty would encourage states (or ill-controlled elements within nuclear states -- like Pakistan's intelligence services or Iran's Revolutionary Guards) to pass nukes to terrorists. The tougher it is to trace the source of a weapon, the easier it is to give the weapon away. In short, nuclear proliferation to multiple Muslim states greatly increases the chances of a nuclear terror strike. Right now, the Indians and Pakistanis &quot;enjoy&quot; an apparently stable nuclear stand-off. Both countries have established basic deterrence, channels of communication, and have also eschewed a potentially destabilizing nuclear arms race. Attacks by Kashmiri militants in 2001 may have pushed India and Pakistan close to the nuclear brink. Yet since then, precisely because of the danger, the two countries seem to have established a clear, deterrence-based understanding. The 2001 crisis gives fuel to proliferation pessimists, while the current stability encourages proliferation optimists. Rosen points out, however, that a multi-polar nuclear Middle East is unlikely to follow the South Asian model. Deep mutual suspicion between an expansionist, apocalyptic, Shiite Iran, secular Turkey, and the Sunni Saudis and Egyptians (not to mention Israel) is likely to fuel a dangerous multi-pronged nuclear arms race. Larger arsenals mean more chance of a weapon being slipped to terrorists. The collapse of the world's non-proliferation regime also raises the chances that nuclearization will spread to Asian powers like Taiwan and Japan. And of course, possession of nuclear weapons is likely to embolden Iran, especially in the transitional period before the Saudis develop weapons of their own. Like Saddam, Iran may be tempted to take control of Kuwait's oil wealth, on the assumption that the United States will not dare risk a nuclear confrontation by escalating the conflict. If the proliferation optimists are right, then once the Saudis get nukes, Iran would be far less likely to make a move on nearby Kuwait. On the other hand, to the extent that we do see conventional war in a nuclearized Middle East, the losers will be sorely tempted to cancel out their defeat with a nuclear strike. There may have been nuclear peace during the Cold War, but there were also many &quot;hot&quot; proxy wars. If conventional wars break out in a nuclearized Middle East, it may be very difficult to stop them from escalating into nuclear confrontations.<br />

<strong>Middle East proliferation dramatically increases the risk of regional nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Allison ‘6</strong> (Graham, Dir. – Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs – Harvard JFK School of Gov., Boston globe, “The Nightmare This Time”, 3-12, L/N)<br />
<br />
Barry Posen, professor of political science at MIT, has presented the most cogent argument for the proposition that &quot;we could readily manage a nuclear Iran.&quot; Writing recently on The New York Times op-ed page, he identified and refuted the two most commonly cited reasons for opposing a nuclear Iran: that it would attempt to destroy Israel or strike the United States. Such an action, he rightly argues, would be suicidal for the Iranian regime. In either case, a nuclear attack would trigger overwhelming retaliation that could end life in Persia for a century to come. Yet Posen's attempt to deal with a third concern-namely, Iran's transfer of nuclear weapons to terrorists who might use them-is less satisfactory. Relying on the Cold War logic of deterrence, he asserts that &quot;Iran would have to worry that the victim would discover the weapon's origin and visit a terrible revenge on Iran.&quot; Worry, yes. But Israel and the US have to worry even more about an Iranian president who denies the Holocaust and asserts that &quot;Israel must be wiped off the map.&quot; Might he not also believe that he could sneak a weapon to Al Qaeda, Hamas, or Hezbollah with no fingerprints? Tehran might not be overly concerned about getting caught-and with good reason. If a terrorist exploded a nuclear bomb in Tel Aviv or Boston, Iran would not be the only suspected source. The bomb could have come from Pakistan, Russia, or elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, where thousands of potential nuclear weapons are vulnerable to theft. The US government is actively pursuing improvements in its nuclear forensic capability to increase the likelihood that it could identify the fissile material that powered a terrorist's bomb. But it's worth noting that more than two years after Libya's Khadafy disclosed his nuclear activities, the US has yet to conclude which nation provided him with enough uranium hexafluoride to make a nuclear bomb. Before accepting the answer that the US can deal with an Iranian nuclear bomb, four further risks must be weighed: the threat of proliferation, the danger of an accidental or unauthorized nuclear launch, the risk of theft of an Iranian weapon or materials, and the prospect of a preemptive Israeli attack. 'A cascade of proliferation' The current nonproliferation regime is a set of agreements between the nuclear &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots,&quot; including the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, in which 184 nations agreed to eschew nuclear weapons and existing nuclear weapons states pledged to sharply diminish the role of such weapons in international politics. Since 1970, the treaty has stopped the spread of nuclear weapons with only two exceptions (India and Pakistan). UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change warned in December 2004 that current developments in Iran and North Korea threatened to erode the entire nonproliferation regime to a point of &quot;irreversibility&quot; that could trigger a &quot;cascade of proliferation.&quot; If Iran crosses its nuclear finish line, a Middle Eastern cascade of new nuclear weapons states could produce the first multiparty nuclear arms race, far more volatile than the Cold War competition between the US and USSR. Given Egypt's historic role as the leader of the Arab Middle East, the prospects of it living unarmed alongside a nuclear Persia are very low. The International Atomic Energy Agency's reports of clandestine nuclear experiments hint that Cairo may have considered this possibility. Were Saudi Arabia to buy a dozen nuclear warheads that could be mated to the Chinese medium-range ballistic missiles it purchased secretly in the 1980s, few in the American intelligence community would be surprised. Given its role as the major financier of Pakistan's clandestine nuclear program in the 1980s, it is not out of the question that Riyadh and Islamabad have made secret arrangements for this contingency. In 1962, bilateral competition between the US and the Soviet Union led to the Cuban missile crisis, which historians now call &quot;the most dangerous moment in human history.&quot; After the crisis, President Kennedy estimated the likelihood of nuclear war as &quot;between 1 in 3 and even.&quot; A multiparty nuclear arms race in the Middle East would be like playing Russian roulette with five bullets in a six-chamber revolver-dramatically increasing the likelihood of a regional nuclear war. Accidental or unauthorized nuclear launch A new nuclear state goes through a period of &quot;nuclear adolescence&quot; that poses special dangers of accidental or unauthorized use-and Iran would be no different. When a state first acquires a small number of nuclear weapons, those weapons become a tempting target: Successful attack would disarm any capacity to retaliate with nuclear weapons. Fearing preemption, new nuclear weapons states rationally adopt loose command and control arrangements. But control arrangements loose enough to guard against decapitation inherently mean more fingers on more triggers and consequently more prospects of a nuclear weapons launch.<br />

<strong>Two internal links:</strong><br />
<strong>1. Lack of a coherent Afghanistan policy</strong><br />
<strong>Stewart ‘9</strong> – Ryan Family Professor of the Practice of Human Rights and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, studied at Oxford and served briefly in the British army before working in the diplomatic service in Indonesia and as British representative to Montenegro (9/16/09, Rory, “The Future of Afghanistan,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3054:http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan" rel="nofollow">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3054 -->)<br />
<br />
The best Afghan policy would be to reduce the number of foreign troops from the current level of 90,000 to far fewer – perhaps 20,000. In that case, two distinct objectives would remain for the international community: development and counter-terrorism. Neither would amount to the building of an Afghan state or winning a counter-insurgency campaign. A reduction in troop numbers and a turn away from state-building should not mean total withdrawal: good projects could continue to be undertaken in electricity, water, irrigation, health, education, agriculture, rural development and in other areas favoured by development agencies. Even a light US presence could continue to allow for aggressive operations against Al Qaeda terrorists, in Afghanistan, who plan to attack the United States. The US has successfully prevent Al Qaeda from re-establishing itself since 2001 (though the result has only been to move bin Laden across the border.). The US military could also (with other forms of assistance) support the Afghan military to prevent the Taliban from seizing a city or taking over the country.<br />
These twin objectives will require a very long-term presence, as indeed is almost inevitable in a country which is as poor, as fragile and traumatized as Afghanistan (and which lacks the internal capacity at the moment to become independent of Foreign aid or control its territory). But a long-term presence will in turn mean a much lighter and more limited presence (if it is to retain US domestic support). We should not control and cannot predict the future of Afghanistan. It may in the future become more violent, or find a decentralised equilibrium or a new national unity, but if its communities continue to want to work with us, we can, over 30 years, encourage the more positive trends in Afghan society and help to contain the more negative.<br />
Such a policy can seem strained, unrealistic, counter-intuitive and unappealing. They appear to betray the hopes of Afghans who trusted us and to allow the Taliban to abuse district towns. No politician wants to be perceived to have underestimated, or failed to address, a terrorist threat; or to write off the ‘blood and treasure’ that we have sunk into Afghanistan; or to admit defeat. Americans are particularly unwilling to believe that problems are insoluble; Obama’s motto is not ‘no we can’t’; soldiers are not trained to admit defeat or to say a mission is impossible. And to suggest that what worked in Iraq won’t work in Afghanistan requires a detailed knowledge of each country’s past, a bold analysis of the causes of development and a rigorous exposition of the differences, for which few have patience. The greatest risk of our inflated ambitions and fears, encapsulated in the current surge is that it will achieve the exact opposite of its intentions and in fact precipitate a total withdrawal. The heavier our footprint, and the more costly, the less we are likely to be able to sustain it. Public opinion is already turning against it. Nato allies are mostly staying in Afghanistan simply to please the United States and have little confidence in our objectives or our reasons. Contemporary political culture tends to encourage black and white solutions: either we garrison or we abandon.<br />
While, I strongly oppose troop increases, I equally strongly oppose a total flight. We are currently in danger of lurching from troop increases to withdrawal and from engagement to isolation. We are threatening to provide instant electro-shock therapy followed by abandonment. This is the last thing Afghanistan needs. The international community should aim to provide a patient, tolerant long-term relationship with a country as poor and traumatized as Afghanistan. Judging by comparable countries in the developing world (and Afghanistan is very near the bottom of the UN Human Development index), making Afghanistan more stable, prosperous and humane is a project which will take decades. It is a worthwhile project in the long-term for us and for Afghans but we will only be able to sustain our presence if we massively reduce our investment and our ambitions and begin to approach Afghanistan more as we do other poor countries in the developing world. The best way of avoiding the mistakes of the 1980s and 1990s – the familiar cycle of investment and abandonment which most Afghan expect and fear and which have contributed so much to instability and danger - is to husband and conserve our resources, limit our objectives to counter-terrorism and humanitarian assistance and work out how to work with fewer troops and less money over a longer period. In Afghanistan in the long-term, less will be more.<br />

<br />
Over the winter break I had an epiphany about the interrelation of U.S. hard and soft power: I now oppose a counterinsurgency (COIN) strategy in Afghanistan and advocate a purely counterterror (CT) strategy (PDF link) there instead.<br />
Blame history—or histories—that I've read recently, starting with Livy's works on early Rome (books I-V) last spring and Donald Kagan's The Peloponnesian War at the end of 2009. I've taken occasional dips back into Robert Kaplan's Warrior Politics and his source materials (Churchill, the Federalists, Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and several others).<br />
What I've taken from that reading is that the U.S. must pull back from its current efforts to remake Iraq and Afghanistan in the image of a Western democracy, or risk long-term political and economic exhaustion.<br />
What follows is not an argument about morality, and readers may find much of it amoral. It is about making cold-blooded political and economic calculations about where U.S. national interests will lie in the next decade. They do not lie in an open-ended COIN mission.<br />
The history of the Peloponnesian War is particularly relevant here. Athens began fighting Sparta with the resources of an empire and thousands of talents of silver in the bank—enough to fight expensive, far-flung naval and land campaigns for three years without lasting financial consequences.<br />
Athens was rich, and if peace with Sparta had come by the end of the third year, Athens would have continued to prosper and rule over much of the Mediterranean. (Athens had a &quot;hard&quot;—conquered or cowed—empire as opposed to the &quot;soft&quot; empire of alliances and treaties the U.S. currently has.)<br />
But the war with Sparta dragged on for decades, despite occasional peace overtures by both sides. By war's end—despite the spoils of battle and increased taxes and tribute extracted from its shrinking dominion—Athens was broke, depopulated by fighting and plague, bereft of its empire, and could no longer project power into the Mediterranean. Where its former interests ranged from Black Sea Turkey to southern Italy, it spent decades as a small-bore power and never regained its former strength or influence.<br />
I worry that the U.S. is similarly locked into an open-ended commitment to democratize a nation that is of regional rather than global importance—a parallel to Athens convincing itself that it had to conquer distant, militarily insignificant Sicily.<br />
&quot;Winning&quot; in Afghanistan<br />
The U.S. could &quot;win&quot; in Afghanistan where victory is defined as a stable, legitimate central government that can project power within its own borders. I don't doubt that the U.S. and its allies could accomplish this given enough time and resources. But I think—as many COIN experts also do—that it will take at least another decade or more of blood and treasure to produce such a result, if ever.<br />
Of course I'd like to see the results of a successful COIN campaign: a stable democracy, women's rights, and general prosperity for Afghans, who among all Asia's peoples surely deserve those things. I certainly want to end al-Qa'ida's ability to operate freely in South Asia and elsewhere.<br />
The U.S. is the only country that would both conceive of these missions and attempt to carry them out. But goals beyond keeping al-Qa'ida on the run don't serve the long-term interests of the U.S., and I am more interested in regaining and preserving U.S. hard power than I am in the rewards that would come from &quot;winning&quot; a lengthy COIN war.<br />
I fear the U.S. people and government becoming exhausted from the costs of a lengthy COIN effort, just as they are already exhausted from (and have largely forgotten about) the Iraq war. I worry that if this fatigue sits in, the U.S. will abandon foreign-policy leadership as it has done periodically throughout history.<br />
This outcome would be worse than a resurgent Taliban, worse than Afghan women and men being further oppressed, and worse than al-Qa'ida having plentiful additional caves to plot in.<br />
Here are some signs of an exhaustion of U.S. power: The U.S. is already overextended, with commitments in Iraq (shrinking for now), Afghanistan (expanding), Yemen (pending) and Iran (TBD). At home, the U.S. economy remains feeble and in the long term is increasingly hostage to other nations for goods and services it no longer produces (and increasingly, no longer can produce).<br />
Even more worrisome is the U.S. credit situation. The wars, and much other U.S. government spending, are now heavily underwritten by other countries' purchases of debt the U.S. issues. It has borrowed trillions from foreign countries and especially China, which continues its steady, highly rational policy of promoting exports while freeriding under the American security umbrella (just as the U.S. once rode for free beneath Britain's).<br />
Over time, those countries accrue enough debt to have a say in U.S. policies that may threaten the dollar's value, which is why you now see high U.S. officials flying to Beijing to soothe PRC nerves and explain why America keeps borrowing money.<br />
At home, there are few resources to apply following a major disaster, such as a Katrina-style hurricane or a major earthquake.<br />
The U.S. needs to start rebuilding its reserves—of capital, of credit, of political goodwill abroad, of military force—to be ready for these and more serious crises, for which we currently have few resources to spare. Such challenges may involve humanitarian crises (think Darfur, a Rwanda-style genocide, Indian Ocean tsunamis); Latin American instability (Mexico, Venezuela, post-Castro Cuba); rogue-state nuclear development (Iran, North Korea); or complex challenges from a rising power (China, a reinvigorated Russia).<br />

<br />
This episode indicates the extent of the confusion over counterterrorism (CT) and counterinsurgency (COIN) that marks the contemporary debate over Afghanistan. Both CT and COIN would envisage military action in Afghanistan, but to very different ends. A CT mission would focus exclusively on Al-Qaeda while offering little or no support to the Karzai government; a COIN mission envisages a comprehensive commitment to defeating the Taleban and rebuilding the Afghan state while destroying Al-Qaeda operatives there. Yet it has now become commonplace for politicians and military officials alike to mention CT and COIN in the same breath, or to treat them as if they were functionally equivalent. The official US government definition now frames counterterrorism in classic ‘hearts and minds’ counterinsurgency language: ‘actions taken directly against terrorist networks and indirectly to influence and render global and regional environments inhospitable to terrorist networks’.12 Terrorist threats are now regularly described as insurgencies and vice versa. The influential US Army and Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual states that ‘today’s operational environment also includes a new kind of insurgency, one which seeks to impose revolutionary change worldwide. Al-Qaeda is a well known example of such an insurgency.’13 An official from US Central Command (CENTCOM), for instance, has gone so far to define counterterrorism as a ‘whole of government COIN’ approach.14 Meanwhile, insurgent threats in places such as Chechnya, Indonesia and Thailand are now regularly redescribed as terrorist threats, as analysts speculate on whether local conflicts will become magnets for Al-Qaeda or otherwise spill out into acts of horrific violence on the international stage.<br />
This confusion over the differences between counterterrorism and counterinsurgency is not new, but it has become more serious over the last eight years.15 Since the events of September 11, these concepts have regularly been conflated as policy-makers have struggled to come to grips with the threat posed by Al-Qaeda. To some extent, this is natural: Al-Qaeda is a global terrorist organization which intervenes directly in local conflicts (often insurgencies, defined here as organized violent attempts to overthrow an existing government) to bait the US and its allies into exhausting wars of attrition. In other words, it is a terrorist organization which dabbles (sometimes successfully, sometimes less so) in insurgencies. But the fact that the threats of terrorism and insurgency are so often intertwined in contemporary conflicts does not make them fundamentally equivalent or susceptible to the same remedies. Nor does it warrant extending counterinsurgency operations on a global level, as some prominent authors have suggested.16 The fusion of the threats from terrorism and insurgency, so often described as symptomatic of the complexity of the modern security challenges, can be misread to imply that the responses to them should be similar or equivalent. In fact, while intermixed in practice, these threats remain distinct, and require a policy response which disaggregates and prioritizes threats and separates those actors who have a negotiable political programme from those who remain incorrigible.<br />
Similarly, the fact that terrorists and insurgents operate in the same theatre, and in some cases function in tandem, is not an argument for a response that seamlessly interweaves elements of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency. Indeed, there is no reason to assume that counterterrorism and counterinsurgency strategies are fully compatible or mutually reinforcing. The record of the war in Afghanistan suggests rather that both models of warfare involve tradeoffs or costs that may offset the gains made by the other. Unless these tradeoffs are properly managed, the simultaneous deployment of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations may operate at cross-purposes and make long-term strategic success more elusive. The fact that US and UK leaders have been so willing to split the difference between counterterrorism and counterinsurgency—and to ignore the offsetting costs of each—may help to account for the current painful stalemate in Afghanistan.<br />
This article will argue that counterterrorism and counterinsurgency are two distinct models of war which can operate at cross-purposes when jointly applied to low-intensity conflicts such as that in Afghanistan. The conflation of these two different models of warfare stems from an intellectual error, which assumes that a fused threat (for example, between a nationalist insurgent group like the Taleban and a transnational terrorist group like Al-Qaeda) must necessarily be met by a joint or blended counterterrorism and counterinsurgency approach. In fact, these two models of warfare involve divergent assumptions about the roles of force, the importance of winning support among the local population, and the necessity of building a strong and representative government. Such approaches are not necessarily mutually reinforcing or even compatible. At the tactical and strategic level, there are at least four possible offsetting costs—popular backlash, countermobilization of enemy networks, a legitimacy gap and diminished leverage—that may be incurred when counterterrorism and counterinsurgency are deployed simultaneously. At the political level, the conflation of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency risks producing an overly interventionist foreign policy which distracts and exhausts the US and UK as they treat an ever-increasing number of localized insurgencies as the incubators of future terrorist threats. <br />

<strong>COIN makes involvement in future conflicts inevitable –collapses US power</strong><br />

<br />
Finally, this emphasis on a fused threat between terrorists and insurgents can incorrectly imply that the response must also draw in equal measure on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency strategy. Such an approach tends to see each emerging terrorist threat as a new front in a global counterinsurgency effort and imply that the US and its allies need to be concerned with winning the ‘hearts and minds’ of the local populations to prevent its development. This is a fundamentally offensive approach in which the US and its allies need to take the fight to the terrorists wherever they may be while simultaneously persuading the Muslim world to reject Al-Qaeda and its political programme. The obvious risk of such an approach is that it will lead to strategic overreach, especially if the US winds up fighting small wars and engaging in costly nation-building as a method of preventing Al-Qaeda from gaining ground in distant conflicts.<br />
As an example of this danger, consider the conflation of terrorism and insurgency that marked the discussion over the failed attack on a US airline on 25 December 2009. Reports that the failed bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, had received instruction in explosives from Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) immediately raised questions about whether American combat operations would be needed to fight Al-Qaeda-linked insurgents in Yemen. In the US, Senator Joseph Lieberman called Yemen ‘tomorrow’s war’ and urged pre-emptive action against Al-Qaeda operatives there.38 An alternative chorus of voices insisted that additional US funds and civilian trainers would be needed to improve the security forces and governance in that remote country.39 The fact that AQAP activity was intertwined with the tribal revolts which had been threatening the stability of the country appeared to lend superficial support to a quasi-counterinsurgency approach as a way to deal with the threat posed by Al-Qaeda in the peninsula. But the attempted attack was a terrorist act on a US-bound flight from Europe by an African citizen. It is entirely unclear whether improving policing capacity and governance in Yemen would have interrupted the attack, which was carried by a small number of operatives with only limited ties to the local community. The conflation of threats meant that the US looked like sleepwalking into a quasi-COIN strategy in that country, potentially assuming responsibility for areas that may have been irrelevant to Abdulmutallab’s ability to launch a terrorist attack. Worse still, such an expanded role would be viewed with hostility by the local population, which is already suspicious of American encroachment on the country.40 Because current policy is premised on the intellectual error that an interlinked threat demands a comprehensive response, and specifically on the notion that terrorism can be solved through counterinsurgency techniques, US strategy tends to drift towards counterinsurgency—and overextension in foreign conflicts—when a more limited counterterrorism response might be more appropriate.<br />

There is an even larger question than whether the U.S. will remain the hegemonic state within a western dominated system. How long will the West remain hegemonic in the global system?25 Since Spengler the issue of the decline of the West has been debated. It would be hard to question current western dominance of virtually every global economic, political, military, or ideological system today. In some ways the domination of the West seems even more firm than it was in the past because the West is no longer a group of fiercely competing states but a much more cohesive force. In the era of western domination, breakdown of the rule of each hegemonic state has come because of competition from powerful rival western states at the core of the system leading to system-wide war. The unique characteristic of the Cold War and particularly the post-Cold War system is that the core capitalist states are now to a large degree politically united and increasingly economically integrated. In the 21st century, two factors taking place outside the West seem more of a threat to the reproduction to the hegemony of the American state and the western system than conflict between western states: 1. resistance to western hegemony in the Muslim world and other parts of the subordinated South, and 2. the rise of newly powerful or reformed super states. Relations between the core and periphery have already undergone one massive transformation in the 20th century—decolonization. The historical significance of decolonization was overshadowed somewhat by the emergence of the Cold War and the nuclear age. Recognition of its impact was dampened somewhat by the subsequent relative lack of change of fundamental economic relations between core and periphery. But one of the historical legacies of decolonization is that ideological legitimation has become more crucial in operating the global system. The manufacture of some level of consent, particularly among the elite in the periphery has to some degree replaced brute domination. Less raw force is necessary but in return a greater burden of ideological and cultural legitimation is required. Now it is no longer enough for colonials to obey, willing participants must believe. Therefore, cultural and ideological challenges to the foundations of the liberal capitalist world view assume much greater significance. Thus the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism, ethnic nationalism, and even social democracy in Latin America as ideologies of opposition have increasing significance in a system dependent on greater levels of willing consent. As Ayoob suggests, the sustained resistance within the Islamic world to western hegemony may have a “demonstration effect” on other southern states with similar grievances against the West.26 The other new dynamic is the re-emergence of great states that at one time or another have been brought low by the western hegemonic system. China, in recent centuries low on the international division of labor, was in some ways a classic case of a peripheral state, or today a semi-peripheral state. But its sheer size, its rapid growth, its currency reserves, its actual and potential markets, etc. make it a major power and a potential future counter hegemon. India lags behind China, but has similar aspirations. Russia has fallen from great power to semi-peripheral status since the collapse of the Soviet empire, but its energy resources and the technological skills of its people make recovery of its former greatness possible. No one knows exactly what the resurgence of Asia portends for the future. However, just as half a century ago global decolonization was a blow to western domination, so the shift in economic production to Asia will redefine global power relations throughout the 21st century. Classical theory of hegemonic cycle is useful if not articulated in too rigid a form. Hegemonic systems do not last forever; they do have a life span. The hegemonic state cannot maintain itself as the fastest growing major economy forever and thus eventually will face relative decline against some major power or powers. The hegemon faces recurrent challenges both on the periphery and from other major powers who feel constrained by the hegemon’s power or are ambitious to usurp its place. Techniques of the application of military force and ideological control may become more sophisticated over time, but so too do techniques of guerilla warfare and ideological forms of resistance such as religious fundamentalism, nationalism, and politicization of ethnic identity. World war may not be imminent, but wars on the periphery have become quite deadly, and the threat of the use of nuclear weapons or other WMD by the rising number of powers who possess them looms. The hegemonic state tends to become overstretched, but more importantly the U.S., because of its messianic sense of mission, tends to overreach. Some of the burden the hegemon has to assume is inevitable, but the U.S. is particularly prone to massive miscalculation. <br />

Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as “No. 1” and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying — its regional as well as its global predominance. Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. <br />
For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not only on the goodwill of peoples but also on American power. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe’s stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that’s not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world’s great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China’s neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene — even if it remained the world’s most powerful nation — could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe — if it adopted what some call a strategy of “offshore balancing” — this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, “offshore” role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more “even-handed” policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel ’s aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn’t change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn’t changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to “normal” or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.<br />

<strong>Decline triggers positional competition and war – bargaining becomes impossible</strong><br />
<strong>Wohlforth ‘9</strong> – Professor of government @ Dartmouth College (William C., January 2009, “Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War,” World Politics, Volume 61, Number 1, Pg. 33-35)<br />
<br />
Second, I question the dominant view that status quo evaluations are relatively independent of the distribution of capabilities. If the status of states depends in some measure on their relative capabilities, and if states derive utility from status, then different distributions of capabilities may affect levels of satisfaction, just as different income distributions may affect levels of status competition in domestic settings. 6 Building on research in psychology and sociology, I argue that even capabilities distributions among major powers foster ambiguous status hierarchies, which generate more dissatisfaction and clashes over the status quo. And the more stratified the distribution of capabilities, the less likely such status competition is. <br />
Unipolarity thus generates far fewer incentives than either bipolarity or multipolarity for direct great power positional competition over status. Elites in the other major powers continue to prefer higher status, but in a unipolar system they face comparatively weak incentives to translate that preference into costly action. And the absence of such incentives matters because social status is a positional good—something whose value depends on how much one has in relation to others.7 “If everyone has high status,” Randall Schweller notes, “no one does.”8 While one actor might increase its status, all cannot simultaneously do so. High status is thus inherently scarce, and competitions for status tend to be zero sum.9<br />
I begin by describing the puzzles facing predominant theories that status competition might solve. Building on recent research on social identity and status seeking, I then show that under certain conditions the ways decision makers identify with the states they represent may prompt them to frame issues as positional disputes over status in a social hierarchy. I develop hypotheses that tailor this scholarship to the domain of great power politics, showing how the probability of status competition is likely to be linked to polarity. The rest of the article investigates whether there is sufficient evidence for these hypotheses to warrant further refinement and testing. I pursue this in three ways: by showing that the theory advanced here is consistent with what we know about large-scale patterns of great power conflict through history; by [End Page 30] demonstrating that the causal mechanisms it identifies did drive relatively secure major powers to military conflict in the past (and therefore that they might do so again if the world were bipolar or multipolar); and by showing that observable evidence concerning the major powers’ identity politics and grand strategies under unipolarity are consistent with the theory’s expectations. <br />
Puzzles of Power and War<br />
Recent research on the connection between the distribution of capabilities and war has concentrated on a hypothesis long central to systemic theories of power transition or hegemonic stability: that major war arises out of a power shift in favor of a rising state dissatisfied with a status quo defended by a declining satisfied state.10 Though they have garnered substantial empirical support, these theories have yet to solve two intertwined empirical and theoretical puzzles—each of which might be explained by positional concerns for status. <br />
First, if the material costs and benefits of a given status quo are what matters, why would a state be dissatisfied with the very status quo that had abetted its rise? The rise of China today naturally prompts this question, but it is hardly a novel situation. Most of the best known and most consequential power transitions in history featured rising challengers that were prospering mightily under the status quo. In case after case, historians argue that these revisionist powers sought recognition and standing rather than specific alterations to the existing rules and practices that constituted the order of the day. <br />
In each paradigmatic case of hegemonic war, the claims of the rising power are hard to reduce to instrumental adjustment of the status quo. In R. Ned Lebow’s reading, for example, Thucydides’ account tells us that the rise of Athens posed unacceptable threats not to the security or welfare of Sparta but rather to its identity as leader of the Greek world, which was an important cause of the Spartan assembly’s vote for war.11 The issues that inspired Louis XIV’s and Napoleon’s dissatisfaction with the status quo were many and varied, but most accounts accord [End Page 31] independent importance to the drive for a position of unparalleled primacy. In these and other hegemonic struggles among leading states in post-Westphalian Europe, the rising challenger’s dissatisfaction is often difficult to connect to the material costs and benefits of the status quo, and much contemporary evidence revolves around issues of recognition and status.12<br />
Wilhemine Germany is a fateful case in point. As Paul Kennedy has argued, underlying material trends as of 1914 were set to propel Germany’s continued rise indefinitely, so long as Europe remained at peace.13 Yet Germany chafed under the very status quo that abetted this rise and its elite focused resentment on its chief trading partner—the great power that presented the least plausible threat to its security: Great Britain. At fantastic cost, it built a battleship fleet with no plausible strategic purpose other than to stake a claim on global power status.14 Recent historical studies present strong evidence that, far from fearing attacks from Russia and France, German leaders sought to provoke them, knowing that this would lead to a long, expensive, and sanguinary war that Britain was certain to join.15 And of all the motivations swirling round these momentous decisions, no serious historical account fails to register German leaders’ oft-expressed yearning for “a place in the sun.” <br />
The second puzzle is bargaining failure. Hegemonic theories tend to model war as a conflict over the status quo without specifying precisely what the status quo is and what flows of benefits it provides to states.16 Scholars generally follow Robert Gilpin in positing that the underlying issue concerns a “desire to redraft the rules by which relations among nations work,” “the nature and governance of the system,” and “the distribution of territory among the states in the system.”17 If these are the [End Page 32] issues at stake, then systemic theories of hegemonic war and power transition confront the puzzle brought to the fore in a seminal article by James Fearon: what prevents states from striking a bargain that avoids the costs of war? 18 Why can’t states renegotiate the international order as underlying capabilities distributions shift their relative bargaining power? <br />
Fearon proposed that one answer consistent with strict rational choice assumptions is that such bargains are infeasible when the issue at stake is indivisible and cannot readily be portioned out to each side. Most aspects of a given international order are readily divisible, however, and, as Fearon stressed, “both the intrinsic complexity and richness of most matters over which states negotiate and the availability of linkages and side-payments suggest that intermediate bargains typically will exist.”19 Thus, most scholars have assumed that the indivisibility problem is trivial, focusing on two other rational choice explanations for bargaining failure: uncertainty and the commitment problem.20 In the view of many scholars, it is these problems, rather than indivisibility, that likely explain leaders’ inability to avail themselves of such intermediate bargains. <br />
Yet recent research inspired by constructivism shows how issues that are physically divisible can become socially indivisible, depending on how they relate to the identities of decision makers.21 Once issues surrounding the status quo are framed in positional terms as bearing on the disputants’ relative standing, then, to the extent that they value their standing itself, they may be unwilling to pursue intermediate bargaining solutions. Once linked to status, easily divisible issues that theoretically provide opportunities for linkages and side payments of various sorts may themselves be seen as indivisible and thus unavailable as avenues for possible intermediate bargains. <br />
The historical record surrounding major wars is rich with evidence suggesting that positional concerns over status frustrate bargaining: expensive, protracted conflict over what appear to be minor issues; a propensity on the part of decision makers to frame issues in terms of relative rank even when doing so makes bargaining harder; decision-makers’ [End Page 33] inability to accept feasible divisions of the matter in dispute even when failing to do so imposes high costs; demands on the part of states for observable evidence to confirm their estimate of an improved position in the hierarchy; the inability of private bargains to resolve issues; a frequently observed compulsion for the public attainment of concessions from a higher ranked state; and stubborn resistance on the part of states to which such demands are addressed even when acquiescence entails limited material cost. <br />
The literature on bargaining failure in the context of power shifts remains inconclusive, and it is premature to take any empirical pattern as necessarily probative. Indeed, Robert Powell has recently proposed that indivisibility is not a rationalistic explanation for war after all: fully rational leaders with perfect information should prefer to settle a dispute over an indivisible issue by resorting to a lottery rather than a war certain to destroy some of the goods in dispute. What might prevent such bargaining solutions is not indivisibility itself, he argues, but rather the parties’ inability to commit to abide by any agreement in the future if they expect their relative capabilities to continue to shift.22 This is the credible commitment problem to which many theorists are now turning their attention. But how it relates to the information problem that until recently dominated the formal literature remains to be seen.23<br />
The larger point is that positional concerns for status may help account for the puzzle of bargaining failure. In the rational choice bargaining literature, war is puzzling because it destroys some of the benefits or flows of benefits in dispute between the bargainers, who would be better off dividing the spoils without war. Yet what happens to these models if what matters for states is less the flows of material benefits themselves than their implications for relative status? The salience of this question depends on the relative importance of positional concern for status among states. <br />
Do Great Powers Care about Status?<br />
Mainstream theories generally posit that states come to blows over an international status quo only when it has implications for their security or material well-being. The guiding assumption is that a state’s satisfaction [End Page 34] with its place in the existing order is a function of the material costs and benefits implied by that status.24 By that assumption, once a state’s status in an international order ceases to affect its material wellbeing, its relative standing will have no bearing on decisions for war or peace. But the assumption is undermined by cumulative research in disciplines ranging from neuroscience and evolutionary biology to economics, anthropology, sociology, and psychology that human beings are powerfully motivated by the desire for favorable social status comparisons. This research suggests that the preference for status is a basic disposition rather than merely a strategy for attaining other goals.25 People often seek tangibles not so much because of the welfare or security they bring but because of the social status they confer. Under certain conditions, the search for status will cause people to behave in ways that directly contradict their material interest in security and/or prosperity. <br />

<strong>Former national security adviser Henry Kissinger, Council on Foreign Relations scholar Stephen Biddle, and many others, concede that the war in Central Asia will be long, expensive, and risky, yet they claim it is ultimately worth waging because a withdrawal would boost jihadism globally and make America look weak.26 But what we’ve invested in the Afghanistan mission could all fall apart whether we withdraw tomorrow or 20 years from now. In fact, if leaving would make America look weak, trying to stay indefinitely while accomplishing little would appear even worse. If the issue is preventing U.S. soldiers from having died in vain, pursuing a losing strategy would not vindicate their sacrifice. And trying to pacify all of Afghanistan, much less hoping to do so on a permanent basis, is a losing strategy. Regardless, some people invoke memories of America’s ignominious withdrawals from Vietnam, Somalia, and Lebanon to muster support for an open-ended commitment. President Bush in 2007 claimed that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today’s terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility. “Here at home,” he said, “some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently.”27 Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute agrees with that reasoning, writing that “the 1983 withdrawal from Lebanon and the retreat from Somalia a decade later emboldened Islamists who saw the United States as a paper tiger.”28 When opinion leaders in Washington talk about “lessons learned” from Vietnam, Somalia, Lebanon, and other conflicts, they typically draw the wrong lesson: not that America should avoid intervening in someone else’s domestic dispute, but that America should never give up after having intervened, no matter what the cost.29 But the longer we stay and the more money we spend, the more we’ll feel compelled to remain in the country to validate the investment. A similar self-imposed predicament plagued U.S. officials during the war in Vietnam:</strong><br />
<strong>After 1968 it became increasingly clear that the survival of the [government of South Vietnam] was not worth the cost of securing it, but by then the United States had another rationale for staying— prestige and precedent setting. The United States said the [South Vietnamese government] would stand, and even those in the administration now long convinced of the hollowness of the domino argument could agree that a U.S. failure in South Vietnam might endanger vital US national interests elsewhere or in the future.30 For decades, the fear of America losing the world’s respect after withdrawing from a conflict has been instrumental in selling the American public bad foreign policy. Perhaps most troubling about the reflexively “stay the course” mentality of some Americans is the widespread insensitivity about the thousands of people—civilian and military, domestic and foreign—killed, maimed, and traumatized in war. But when the stakes seem unrelated to vital national interests, the American public rightly resents their country’s interference in third party problems, and is extremely skeptical of nation building. History shows that, sooner or later, disenchantment will manifest in public and congressional opposition. After nearly a decade in Afghanistan, even the memory of 9/11 might not be sufficient to outweigh the sacrifice in blood and treasure.</strong><br />
<strong>Perhaps the most important argument against the “withdrawal is weak-kneed” meme is that America’s military roams the planet, controls the skies and space, faces no peer competitor, and wields one of the planet’s largest nuclear arsenals. America is responsible for almost half of the world’s military spending and can project its power around the globe. Thus, the contention that America would appear “weak” after withdrawing from Afghanistan is ludicrous.</strong><br />
<strong>Unfortunately, bureaucratic inertia and a misplaced conception of Washington’s moral obligations (an argument that more often than not legitimizes America’s military occupation of a foreign people) threaten to trap the United States in Afghanistan for decades. Overall, remaining in Afghanistan is more likely to tarnish America’s reputation and undermine U.S. security than would withdrawal.</strong><br />

A counterterrorism strategy will maintain US influence and solve legitimacy <br />
Simon and Stevenson ’9 <strong>* adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, AND</strong> Professor of Strategic Studies at the US Naval War College, (Steven and Jonathan, “Afghanistan: How Much is Enough?” Survival, 51:5, 47 – 67, October 2009 <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3061:http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409" rel="nofollow">http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3061 -->)<br />
<br />
An effort on that scale would garner majority US domestic support only if the public sees likely victory and Congress, the White House and the Beltway punditry line up decisively behind the policy. The emerging trends are pointing in the contrary direction. As monthly and annual US casualties in Afghanistan reached historical peaks in August 2009, and the Afghan national election loomed, a poll conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post indicated that most Americans did not support an extended US military commitment in Afghanistan.31 Congressional Democrats are balking at anticipated requests for more troops.32 And even conservative columnists, like the influential George F. Will, have turned against a maximalist Afghanistan policy.33 Overall, increasingly strong perceptions of the Karzai government as inept and corrupt are making prospects that the United States could enlist it as an effective counter-insurgency partner and lend it the legitimacy required to rebuild the country seem more and more baseless.<br />
The upshot is that only if the United States establishes a well-calibrated limited policy now will it have the political flexibility to sustain it over the longer-term and thereby to effectively contain the jihadist threat in Central Asia. If, on the other hand, the Obama administration promises more than it can deliver in Afghanistan, a reprise of Vietnam may occur: once failure becomes clear, domestic support will evaporate, the administration will be compelled to withdraw precipitously, and the United States will lose considerable traction in the region.<br />
Congressional democrats are balking at anticipated requests for more troops<br />
These factors suggest that the United States should limit its Afghanistan/Pakistan policy to counter-terrorism and disown country-wide counterinsurgency and state-building in Afghanistan. At the same time, Washington must remain highly sensitive to the dynamic whereby decreased military activity in Afghanistan combined with robust operations in Pakistan could induce al-Qaeda to return to Afghanistan and render it a main threat once again. In that light, any abrupt wholesale American military withdrawal from Afghanistan would be too risky. Instead, the United States should seek to facilitate a glide-path to a substantial drawdown - and with it fewer casualties and lower expenditures in Afghanistan - over the next few years.<br />
Doing so would involve continuing to suppress al-Qaeda in Pakistan with selective and discriminate drone strikes and denying al-Qaeda access to Afghanistan. The former would require bases within Afghan territory from which to deploy airpower and special-operations forces against terrorists and terrorist infrastructure, as well as the troops and equipment to secure these bases. The latter would call for reinforced border security and force protection within Afghanistan, which in themselves would entail a surprisingly large number of soldiers. For these purposes, the United States would continue to bring extensive human intelligence and surveillance capabilities to bear on Afghanistan to detect and assess potential threats to American interests. To mitigate and eliminate such threats, the generous deployment of US special-operations forces to Afghanistan - which currently comprises some 50% of all US special-operations personnel - would have to be maintained over the medium term. Meanwhile, US train-and-equip programmes for Afghan security forces should be intensified in contemplation of a gradual and controlled hand-off of the domestic counter-terrorism mission to them when they are ready, as well as to prepare them for counterinsurgency operations, should the Afghan government wish to use them for that purpose.<br />
The United States should also provide strong political and economic support for the Afghan government, which is likely to remain under Karzai once the votes of the 20 August election are counted and certified. Kabul, however, should be left to take the lead in managing its relationship with the Taliban (as well as anti-narcotics policy). With US encouragement, the Karzai government should make it clear to Pashtuns in the southern and eastern parts of the country that if they support insurgents or terrorists aiming to destabilise the Afghan or Pakistani governments, they will suffer financially and militarily. Again, some US forces would be needed to give such arrangements teeth, but not at the levels required for an all-out counter-insurgency. American insurance against a militant Islamist coup or an uncontrollable level of destabilisation also should be left in place. This could entail a standby stabilisation force with tactical air capabilities based in or near Kabul, along with a robust quick-reaction force.<br />
That policy would reflect the reality that a deeply committed counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan is potentially counterproductive, probably unwinnable and in any event unnecessary. The United States can protect its interests and fulfil its international security obligations with a far more circumscribed counter-terrorism effort focused on Pakistan. Under such an approach, US policy would recognise Afghanistan as the residual problem that it has, in fact, become.<br />

<strong>No turns – hegemonic perception inevitable</strong><br />
<strong>Drezner '9</strong> – professor of international politics at the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a senior editor at The National Interest (Daniel W., 7/15/09, &quot;The False Hegemon,&quot; <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3062:http://nationalinterest.org/article/the-false-hegemon-3184 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nationalinterest.org/article/the-false-hegemon-3184" rel="nofollow">http://nationalinterest.org/article/the-false-hegemon-3184</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3062 -->, RG)<br />
<br />
The rest of the world certainly seems to treat America as the hegemonic power, for good or ill. According to the New York Times, Latin America is waiting for the United States to break the deadlock in Honduras. Vladimir Putin is incapable of giving a foreign-policy speech in which he does not blast American hegemony as the root of all of Russia's ills. While Chinese officials talk tough about ending the dollar's reign as the world's reserve currency, its leaders also want America to solve the current economic crisis and to take the lead on global warming in the process.<br />
It's not just foreign leaders who are obsessed with American hegemony. Last week, in an example of true hardship duty, I taught a short course in American foreign policy at the Barcelona Institute for International Studies. The students in my class represented a true cross section of nationalities: Spaniards, Germans, Brits, Estonian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian, Thai, Ghanaian, Kenyan, Turkish, Belgian, Mexican, Nicaraguan and, yes, even Americans. I cannot claim that my students represent a scientific cross section of non-Americans (one of them complained that I did not rely on Marxism as a structural explanation for American foreign policy). Still, by and large the students were bright, well informed about world affairs and cautiously optimistic about President Obama.<br />
That said, a persistent trend among my students was their conviction that the U.S. government was the world's puppeteer, consciously manipulating every single event in world politics. For example, many of them were convinced that George W. Bush ordered Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to precipitate last year's war with Russia. The Ghanaian students wanted to know why Obama visited their country last week. The standard &quot;promotion of good democratic governance&quot; answer did not satisfy them. They were convinced that there had to be some deeper, potentially sinister motive to the whole enterprise. Don't even ask what they thought about the reasons behind the war in Iraq.<br />
To be sure, the United States is a powerful actor; the government is trying to influence global events (and Americans are not immune to their own misperceptions). And good social scientists should always search for underlying causes and not take rhetoric at face value. Nevertheless, the belief in an all-powerful America hatching conspiracies left and right frequently did not jibe with the facts. For many of these students, even apparent policy mistakes were merely examples of American subterfuge.<br />
Ironically, at the moment when many Americans are questioning the future of U.S. hegemony, many non-Americans continue to believe that the U.S. government is diabolically manipulating events behind the scenes. Going forward, the persistence of anti-Americanism in the age of Obama might have nothing to do with the president, or his rhetoric or even U.S. government actions. It might, instead, have to do with the congealed habits of thought that place the United States at the epicenter of all global movings and shakings. The tragedy is that such an exaggerated perception of American power and purpose is occurring at precisely the moment when the United States will need to scale back its global ambitions.<br />
Indeed, the external perception of U.S. omnipresence will make the pursuit of a more modest U.S. foreign policy all the more difficult. The Obama administration has consciously adopted a more modest posture in the hopes of improving America's standing abroad. If the rest of the world genuinely believes that the United States causes everything, however, then the attempt at modesty will inevitably fail.<br />

<br />
Well 2010 will be a period of consolidation for Russia. It now has a sphere of influence that stretches into the Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Putin once said that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical disaster in 20th century history. He also said he had no intention of rebuilding that political union. The former statement was true; but we are seeing signs that the latter was just rhetoric. Putin does have political designs over the states of the former Soviet Union – the Customs Union that has just entered into force between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan is the clearest example of this. His intention will be to eventually integrate them into a new Russian political union for it is the next logical step in Russia’s resurgence. A customs union is designed to reintegrate the industrial and strategic economic sectors of the old Soviet grid. Mutual economic benefits will flow from this and former Soviet states outside it will find it incredibly appealing to join (or Russia will make them ‘an offer they cannot refuse’). Once integration is done the weaker states of the customs union have two options - resist political integration while maintaining economic connections (a delicate balancing act), or politically integrate. What is interesting here are the analogies we can take from the EU experience. The EU economic project is intended by French and German elites to eventually create a European superpower. But to do so requires the smaller states to become subservient to the national interests of the larger members (and these interests often diverge). Absent a serious external threat it becomes very hard for the smaller states to convince their populations they should become a tool in a larger, potentially global, geopolitical game the French and German want to gain entry into. This becomes even more difficult when the smaller states are democratic - as we've seen with the referendums in Ireland and eventual acceptance of the watered down 'Lisbon Treaty' instead of the 'Constitutional Treaty'. The states Russia wants to pull back into a political union are not stable and established democracies. Therefore the elites of these states do not need to submit themselves to the will of their population. Furthermore, if joining Russia in a new political union guarantees their monopoly of power (since the Kremlin gains an interest in bolstering these elites) they will be far more willing to go along with it. In a way, former Soviet states will sue for what they can; but take what they must. The reality is that most of them are already economically dependent upon Russia anyway. Furthermore Russia’s great power relative to them means they cannot realistically resist Russian expansion anyway because, as Ukraine, Belarus and Georgia all found out, if you disagree with the political designs of the Kremlin Putin can simply shut off the gas, close down a border, deny them primary goods, or, should need be, smash them with its far superior military power (as Georgia found out). It is the will to use power that makes others fearful and compels them to accommodate one’s interests; not the existence of power itself. Putin has shown time and time again the will to use Russia’s power against its neighbours. For the elites in states adjacent to Russia (and their populations) the message is clear: align with Moscow or face the consequences. As a consequence the next state to fall back into Moscow’s camp will be Ukraine after its upcoming elections. Obama and the Afghan Surge American military power is going to be absolutely bogged down in the Middle East throughout 2010. Obama seems to be escalating the conflict for political and diplomatic reasons: US presidents cannot just declare failure and retreat – it’s not in the DNA of the American political system. They have 'to show' that they will fight 'the bad guys' as hard as they can before they can make the rational decision to remove American military power. But Obama has announced that the surge in Afghan is temporary. The 'pull-out' begins in 2011. Meanwhile the US will be drawing down troops from Iraq (which is set for an extremely unstable year). This means that, all going to plan, by sometime in 2011 American troops should be in reserve and available to be deployed to counter the Russians or to any other hotspot. But the Russians know this and it gives them one year - 2010 - to completely lock down their influence and eject any remnants of American or European influence. Whether they entirely succeed or not is beside the point; by the end of 2010 any move to remove them from their position will have to be momentous and overt. At the same time whatever Obama's plans may be they are not really his to make, for there are simply too many players now involved in the Middle Eastern cesspool of crises. The most important in the coming year will be the one centred upon Iran. An Escalating Crisis 2009 saw an escalation in the Iranian-American standoff over its nuclear program. Firstly, Obama and co. released proof of a covert Iranian nuclear plant followed by a series of highly significant leaks that seemed to show the Iranians were driving towards nuclear weapons. But this crisis also became consumed by the Russo-American standoff as Russian support for Iran became overt as it seeks to use Iran as a bargaining chip. But the outcome of the crisis is also dependent upon the calculations of Israel. If they actually believe that a nuclear Iran is an 'existential threat' they will have to act against is before it attains nuclear weapons, or at least show America they will act unless it gets tough on Iran. However, for America 'to act' short of war it needs Russian help to impose sanctions. Thus far Russia has given vague signals that it will help if the price is right. The price being American acquiescence to a new Russian political sphere of influence around it’s near abroad (which it already has). Obama and Biden have declared that they will not do this owing to Russia's declining long term geopolitical position (although its power is growing in the short term). Biden, on a trip to Eastern Europe last year, even went so far to announce the Obama's administrations intentions to support efforts by US-friendly governments in the region to counter Russia's push. That means end-game for any Russo-American alignment on Iranian sanctions. At the same time Obama is escalating a war in Afghanistan and needs all the help from regional powers to 'win' this thing - even Iran. If America can accept the inevitability of a nuclear Iran and even the eventual hegemonic domination by Iran over parts of the Middle East and Gulf region then America can do a 'deal' with it whereby it would gain Iranian help to suppress the multiple crises in the Middle East. This would allow the US to drawdown military forces and reorient them back to the greater geopolitical enemy - Russia. Therefore Russia has an interest in keeping Iran close and ensuring that a rapprochement between Iran and the US remains impossible. <br />

<br />
MOSCOW -- Russia is reasserting its role in Central Asia with a Kremlin push to eject the U.S. from a vital air base and a Moscow-led pact to form an international military force to rival NATO -- two moves that potentially complicate the new U.S. war strategy in Afghanistan. On Wednesday, Russia announced a financial rescue fund for a group of ex-Soviet allies and won their agreement to form a military rapid reaction force in the region that it said would match North Atlantic Treaty Organization standards. That came a day after Kyrgyzstan announced, at Russian urging, that it planned to evict the U.S. from the base it has used to ferry large numbers of American troops into Afghanistan. Russia said the base may house part of the planned new force instead. The steps mark Russia's most aggressive push yet to counter a U.S. military presence in the region that it has long resented. They pose a challenge for the administration of President Barack Obama, which sees Afghanistan as its top foreign-policy priority and is preparing to double the size of the American military presence there. The developments also underscore the difficulties for Mr. Obama as he seeks to build a closer relationship with Moscow. Russia is signaling that it will be a tough defender of its interests, especially in its traditional backyard of the former Soviet Union. Though its huge cash reserves are rapidly draining because of falling oil prices, the greater needs of its poorer neighbors are still giving it an opening. &quot;Russia would like to reassert itself in the region, and it is using the financial crisis as an opportunity,&quot; said Nikolai Zlobin, senior fellow at the World Security Institute, a Washington think tank.<br />

<strong>Russian expansionism in Central Asia triggers global nuclear war and extinction</strong><br />

<br />
Proliferators or nuclear states like China and Russia can then deter regional or intercontinental attacks either by denial or by threat of retaliation.168 Given a multipolar world structure with little ideological rivalry among major powers, it is unlikely that they will go to war with each other. Rather, like Russia, they will strive for exclusive hegemony in their own “sphere of influence” and use nuclear instruments towards that end. However, wars may well break out between major powers and weaker “peripheral” states or between peripheral and semiperipheral states given their lack of domestic legitimacy, the absence of the means of crisis prevention, the visible absence of crisis management mechanisms, and their strategic calculation that asymmetric wars might give them the victory or respite they need.169 Simultaneously, The states of periphery and semiperiphery have far more opportunities for political maneuvering. Since war remains a political option, these states may find it convenient to exercise their military power as a means for achieving political objectives. Thus international crises may increase in number. This has two important implications for the use of WMD. First, they may be used deliberately to offer a decisive victory (or in Russia’s case, to achieve “intra-war escalation control”—author170) to the striker, or for defensive purposes when imbalances 67 in military capabilities are significant; and second, crises increase the possibilities of inadvertent or accidental wars involving WMD.171 Obviously nuclear proliferators or states that are expanding their nuclear arsenals like Russia can exercise a great influence upon world politics if they chose to defy the prevailing consensus and use their weapons not as defensive weapons, as has been commonly thought, but as offensive weapons to threaten other states and deter nuclear powers. Their decision to go either for cooperative security and strengthened international military-political norms of action, or for individual national “egotism” will critically affect world politics. For, as Roberts observes, But if they drift away from those efforts [to bring about more cooperative security], the consequences could be profound. At the very least, the effective functioning of inherited mechanisms of world order, such as the special responsibility of the “great powers” in the management of the interstate system, especially problems of armed aggression, under the aegis of collective security, could be significantly impaired. Armed with the ability to defeat an intervention, or impose substantial costs in blood or money on an intervening force or the populaces of the nations marshaling that force, the newly empowered tier could bring an end to collective security operations, undermine the credibility of alliance commitments by the great powers, [undermine guarantees of extended deterrence by them to threatened nations and states] extend alliances of their own, and perhaps make wars of aggression on their neighbors or their own people.172<br />

President Obama and Russian President Dimitri Medvedev are scheduled to Wednesday in London during the G-20 summit. They must not let the current economic crisis keep them from focusing on one of the greatest threats confronting humanity: the danger of nuclear war. Since the end of the Cold War, many have acted as though the danger of nuclear war has ended. It has not. There remain in the world more than 20,000 nuclear weapons. Alarmingly, more than 2,000 of these weapons in the U.S. and Russian arsenals remain on ready-alert status, commonly known as hair-trigger alert. They can be fired within five minutes and reach targets in the other country 30 minutes later. Just one of these weapons can destroy a city. A war involving a substantial number would cause devastation on a scale unprecedented in human history. A study conducted by Physicians for Social Responsibility in 2002 showed that if only 500 of the Russian weapons on high alert exploded over our cities, 100 million Americans would die in the first 30 minutes. An attack of this magnitude also would destroy the entire economic, communications and transportation infrastructure on which we all depend. Those who survived the initial attack would inhabit a nightmare landscape with huge swaths of the country blanketed with radioactive fallout and epidemic diseases rampant. They would have no food, no fuel, no electricity, no medicine, and certainly no organized health care. In the following months it is likely the vast majority of the U.S. population would die. Recent studies by the eminent climatologists Toon and Robock have shown that such a war would have a huge and immediate impact on climate world wide. If all of the warheads in the U.S. and Russian strategic arsenals were drawn into the conflict, the firestorms they caused would loft 180 million tons of soot and debris into the upper atmosphere — blotting out the sun. Temperatures across the globe would fall an average of 18 degrees Fahrenheit to levels not seen on earth since the depth of the last ice age, 18,000 years ago. Agriculture would stop, eco-systems would collapse, and many species, including perhaps our own, would become extinct. It is common to discuss nuclear war as a low-probabillity event. But is this true? We know of five occcasions during the last 30 years when either the U.S. or Russia believed it was under attack and prepared a counter-attack. The most recent of these near misses occurred after the end of the Cold War on Jan. 25, 1995, when the Russians mistook a U.S. weather rocket launched from Norway for a possible attack. Jan. 25, 1995, was an ordinary day with no major crisis involving the U.S. and Russia. But, unknown to almost every inhabitant on the planet, a misunderstanding led to the potential for a nuclear war. The ready alert status of nuclear weapons that existed in 1995 remains in place today. <br />

<strong>This is the only existential threat</strong><br />
<strong>Bostrom ‘2</strong> – Ph.D. and Professor at Oxford University [Nick, www.transhumanist.com/volume9/risks.html]<br />
<br />
A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a substantial probability and with consequences that might have been persistent enough to qualify as global and terminal. There was a real worry among those best acquainted with the information available at the time that a nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or permanently destroy human civilization. Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation, either accidentally or deliberately. There is also a risk that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. Note however that a smaller nuclear exchange, between India and Pakistan for instance, is not an existential risk, since it would not destroy or thwart humankind’s potential permanently.<br />

The war in Afghanistan is at a crossroads, as it is at all times. The December Review, in which the generals running the war make a last desperate attempt to prolong it, is rapidly approaching, as is the July 2011 deadline to begin the slow drawdown of troops. In Washington, one can see the full spectacle of bureaucratic and political streetfighting over the outcome — an endless cavalcade of anonymously sourced stories from inside the White House, Department of Defense, and other agencies; the endless op-eds about how to win the war (or withdraw) this time around; the admonitions, self-congratulations, accusations of cowardice and bloodlust.<br />
Underneath the public theater, however, is a very serious set of decisions President Obama must make. Within the next year, Obama will be choosing a replacement for Robert Gates, arguably the best defense secretary in decades; he will also have to choose replacements for all of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen. These personnel decisions will dramatically affect the political and operational context of the department of defense — either continuing it on its current course, or shifting it in an entirely new direction.<br />
So it is with that in mind — the intense wrangling over strategy, along with a major shift in high-level leadership — that we can evaluate the groundswell of opposition within the Pentagon towards General Petraeus’ plans for Afghanistan. One of the most visible ways this has been expressed is the fight to control the narrative of Kandahar. Last month, I explored some of the ways General Petraeus is trying to shape the media narrative by feeding upbeat stories to reporters. In short order, military intelligence officials quietly pushed back, feeding their beliefs that the very high-profile attempts to kill or negotiate with the mid-level Taliban leadership haven’t noticeably affected the insurgency to still more reporters. <br />
As the public leaking and pundit-wrangling has crested, the Obama administration has also hinted strongly that it will simply disregard the July 2011 deadline for drawdown. Yet the public message of what Obama plans is not at all clear. While there’s little doubt the July 2011 deadline won’t mean that much (if anything, there will be a small-to-moderate reduction of surge troops and little else over the following year), the administration still maintains that it can begin the “transition” phase of its Afghanistan strategy (i.e. handing areas of control over to Afghan troops) ahead of schedule. The timing of this latest announcement is impeccable, seeing as it comes right when President Karzai is demanding the U.S. reduce its footprint in the country. But how can anyone make sense of this? The last month of news about Afghanistan has sown, if anything, confusion: Either we are staying or we are not; we are handing over responsibility, or we’re not; either NATO is there until 2014 or it is not. Seemingly week by week new stories emerge (all from various official sources within different agencies of the executive branch) all saying different things. Barring anything substantially tragic happening in the interim, it’s unlikely the actual strategy of the war will change much. It’s been an open secret that General Petraeus would be unable to achieve any real signs of progress before next summer — and you can see his attempt to do so by reframing a war he once said wasn’t about body counts into purely a function of how many bad guys get killed on the deeply unpopular special operations night raids (the latest number is that more than 350 insurgents have been killed since Petraeus took over, but I’m hard-pressed to say how that’s improved things). At the same time, because of the bizarre politics over Obama’s firing of General McChrystal this past summer, it’s unlikely Obama will<br />
feel comfortable or politically strong enough to contravene Petraeus’ public bidding for more time to accomplish something. <br />
And what to make of all the public and contradictory wrangling over positions, troops and strategy? This is, sadly, what Washington has become in recent years: a mad dash, in public, for power, influence and triumph at all costs. I tend to regard such things as signal noise to be ignored, rather than detailed accounts of the policy process. Much more worrying is how boxed-in Obama has become on Afghanistan. The congressional elections seriously weakened his ability to push back against a military hell-bent on continuing or even expanding further the war; earlier missteps, like firing not just one but two respected generals in Afghanistan, have further constrained his ability to exercise executive oversight over the specifics of military strategy. In a very real sense, we can consider the war in Afghanistan as existing outside civilian control. It has been for a while, if Bob Woodward’s recent book (which reveals a clique of generals deliberately excluding alternative courses of action from Obama’s policy process) is anything to go by. So no surprises, then? Only in an immediate sense. The Afghan war might not present us any surprises — expect another month of record casualties, record violence against civilians, and record Taliban activity any time now — but we should all be surprised at how thoroughly the military has coopted U.S. foreign policy. The balance of traditional civil-military relations is badly out of whack, and while some are fighting back against it, the anonymous leaks to Washington Post reporters won’t fundamentally change that. To reset the civ-mil balance, as its called, requires strong leadership at the top: the president, the secretary of defense, and even the Joint Chiefs of Staff. <br />

<strong>Caving to the military on Afghanistan has eviscerated Obama’s international credibility</strong><br />

&quot;The President is an elected king,&quot; wrote Randolph Bourne nearly a century ago, &quot;but the fact that he is elected has proved to be of far less significance ... than the fact that he is pragmatically a king.&quot; Bourne thereby identified a central truth of modern American politics: Stripped to its essence, our democracy has become an elaborate process of conferring enormous power on a single individual. What we choose to call an inauguration is more accurately a coronation. Nominally a chief executive, the president today occupies a position more akin to that of emperor, and Americans both expect much and demand much of their emperor. To be &quot;the most powerful man in the world&quot; is to be simultaneously worshiped and despised. To occupy the Oval Office is to become the modern-day equivalent of a Sun King, commanding deference, while also becoming the subject of endless gossip, envy, jealousy, and intrigue, all to be reported at length and ad nauseam by Bob Woodward. What lends this arrangement a semblance of legitimacy is the expectation that our president-monarch knows how to wield power effectively. Through the exercise of royal prerogatives, the king demonstrates his worthiness for high office. Should a president demonstrate an absence of mastery — if he comes across as a weakling or a ditherer — profound dysfunction results. Recall the Carter era. Jimmy Carter's inability to resolve the Iran hostage crisis reduced him to a figure of contempt and left Americans with a sense that the country itself was adrift. In short order, they stripped Carter of his crown. Yet presidential weakness — even an inkling of weakness — can have international as well as domestic implications. This is notably the case in matters related to national security. If the occupant of the Oval Office appears less than fully in command, friend and foe alike will wonder who exactly is in charge. Confusion about American priorities and intentions can thereby result. Out of confusion can come miscalculation, as allies revise downward their estimate of American reliability and adversaries persuade themselves that they can get away with mischief. In other words, the implications of weakness extend beyond the who’s up, who’s down preoccupations of garden-variety politics. This confusion describes where we find ourselves today. There is no doubting that President Obama is smart, talented, well intentioned, and smooth as they come. Yet whether he possesses the temperament to govern is fast becoming an open question. Put simply, the question is this: Does Obama have sufficient backbone? The release of Bob Woodward's new book Obama’s Wars has raised this question to new heights. It depicts a president who not only gets rolled but who knows when he is getting rolled and still allows it to happen. With regard to how to proceed on Afghanistan — the most important foreign policy decision to cross Obama’s desk thus far — the president last year demanded that the Pentagon present him with distinctive policy options. The king didn’t want to be handed the solution; he wanted to choose. In fact, however, the members of his court offered him three variations of a single course of action, the one that the Pentagon itself preferred — a textbook example of how the theory of “civilian control” differs from actual practice. Particularly disturbing is the fact that our very smart president understood exactly what was happening. Woodward shows Obama complaining loudly. Having registered that complaint, the president more or less meekly rubber-stamped the policy that the Pentagon was foisting on him. In effect, on Afghanistan he thereby forfeited to others the power to decide. Once Obama endorsed choices made by unelected subordinates, the office of commander-in-chief had acquired additional tenants. That was back in December 2009, of course. Here in October 2010, the Pentagon's preferred plan for Afghanistan shows little sign of succeeding anytime soon. Obama's wariness about escalating the war there — now about to enter its tenth year — looks increasingly sound, which makes his complicity in going along with that escalation all the more damning. Yet perhaps all is not lost — at least not entirely so. The president may yet have one last chance to retrieve the situation and to reverse the impression that he is less than fully in control of his administration. The next Afghanistan &quot;milestone&quot; is a strategic assessment promised for this coming December, one full year after Obama announced his (or the Pentagon's) Afghan surge. The military — General David Petraeus in the vanguard — will exert itself to minimize the importance of this mid-course review. So too will members of the Petraeus Lobby, currently challenging AIPAC, the trial lawyers, the pharmaceutical industry and all the rest of the powerful interest groups vying for preeminence in Washington. You can take it to the bank: The military backed by militarists in mufti will press for more time. They will argue for postponing any serious decisions until July 2011, intending in the mean time to chip away at the president's vaguely stated promise to begin withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan next summer. If Obama wishes to salvage his presidency and demonstrate his capacity to lead and to govern, he will reject that effort. He will instead seize the opportunity presented by the mid-course review. December is the time to render a verdict on the Afghanistan war. If the Afghan surge is still not showing clear signs of success by year's end, waiting another seven months won’t make a difference. December also presents Obama with an opportunity — perhaps his last one — to reverse the impression that he is not fully in control of his own administration. Decisive action just might enable the president to reassure Americans and the rest of the world that he is, after all, up to the job. Should he squander this last opportunity, however, the king is likely to find himself soon thereafter seeking new employment.<br />

<strong>This signals weakness and leads to belligerence</strong><br />
<strong>Bolton ‘9</strong> - Senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute [John R. Bolton (Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations) “The danger of Obama's dithering,” Los Angeles Times, October 18, 2009, pg. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3068:http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/18/opinion/oe-bolton18 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/18/opinion/oe-bolton18" rel="nofollow">http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/18/opinion/oe-bolton18</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3068 -->]<br />
<br />
Weakness in American foreign policy in one region often invites challenges elsewhere, because our adversaries carefully follow diminished American resolve. Similarly, presidential indecisiveness, whether because of uncertainty or internal political struggles, signals that the United States may not respond to international challenges in clear and coherent ways.<br />
Taken together, weakness and indecisiveness have proved historically to be a toxic combination for America's global interests. That is exactly the combination we now see under President Obama. If anything, his receiving the Nobel Peace Prize only underlines the problem. All of Obama's campaign and inaugural talk about &quot;extending an open hand&quot; and &quot;engagement,&quot; especially the multilateral variety, isn't exactly unfolding according to plan. Entirely predictably, we see more clearly every day that diplomacy is not a policy but only a technique. Absent presidential leadership, which at a minimum means clear policy direction and persistence in the face of criticism and adversity, engagement simply embodies weakness and indecision.<br />
Obama is no Harry Truman. At best, he is reprising Jimmy Carter. At worst, the real precedent may be Ethelred the Unready, the turn-of the-first-millennium Anglo-Saxon king whose reputation for indecisiveness and his unsuccessful paying of Danegeld -- literally, &quot;Danish tax&quot; -- to buy off Viking raiders made him history's paradigmatic weak leader.<br />
Beyond the disquiet (or outrage for some) prompted by the president's propensity to apologize for his country's pre-Obama history, Americans increasingly sense that his administration is drifting from one foreign policy mistake to another. Worse, the current is growing swifter, and the threats more pronounced, even as the administration tries to turn its face away from the world and toward its domestic priorities. Foreign observers, friend and foe alike, sense the same aimlessness and drift. French President Nicolas Sarkozy had to remind Obama at a Sept. 24 U.N. Security Council meeting that &quot;we live in the real world, not a virtual one.&quot;<br />
Examples of weakness abound, and the consequences are readily foreseeable.<br />
Canceling the Polish and Czech missile defense bases is understood in Moscow and Eastern European capitals as backing down in the face of Russian bluster and belligerence. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev threatened the day after our 2008 election to deploy missiles targeting these assets unless they were canceled, a threat duly noted by the Russian media when Obama canceled the sites. Given candidate Obama's reaction to the 2008 Russia-Georgia war -- calling on both sides to exercise restraint -- there is little doubt that Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's project to re-extend Russian hegemony over as much of the former Soviet Union as he can will continue apace. Why should he worry about Washington?<br />
Obama's Middle East peace process has stalled, most recently because he set a target for an end to Israeli settlement expansion, couldn't meet it and then proceeded as though he hadn't meant what he said originally. By insisting that Israel freeze settlements as a precondition to renewing Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, Obama drew a clear line. But when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu withstood Obama's pressure, Obama caved, hosting a photo-op with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas that strengthened Netanyahu and weakened Abbas just when Obama wanted to achieve exactly the opposite. However one views the substantive outcome of this vignette, Obama himself looked the weakest of all. It could well be years before his Middle East policy gets back up off the ground.<br />
On nuclear nonproliferation, North Korea responded to the &quot;open hand&quot; of engagement by testing its second nuclear device, continuing an aggressive ballistic missile testing program, cooperating with other rogue states and kidnapping and holding hostage two American reporters. Obama's reaction is to press for more negotiations, which simply encourages Pyongyang to up the ante.<br />
Iran is revealed to have been long constructing an undeclared, uninspected nuclear facility that makes a mockery of almost seven years of European Union negotiation efforts. Forced to deal publicly with this deeply worrying threat, Obama proposes the equivalent of money-laundering for nuclear threats: Iranian uranium enriched in open, unambiguous defiance of four Security Council resolutions will be enriched to higher levels in Russia, and then returned to be burned in a Tehran reactor -- ostensibly for peaceful purposes. Sarkozy again captured the growing international incredulity in his noteworthy Security Council speech: &quot;I support America's 'extended hand.' But what have these proposals for dialogue produced for the international community? Nothing but more enriched uranium and more centrifuges.&quot;<br />
Finally, Obama's agonizing, very public reappraisal of his own 7-month-old Afghanistan policy epitomizes indecisiveness. While there is no virtue in sustaining policy merely for continuity's sake, neither is credit due for too-quickly adopting policies without appreciating the risks entailed and then fleeing precipitously when the risks become manifest. The administration's stated reason for its policy re-evaluation was widespread fraud in Afghanistan's Aug. 20 presidential election. But this explanation is simply not credible. Did not the administration's generals and diplomats on the ground, not to mention United Nations observers, see the election mess coming? Was the Hamid Karzai administration's cupidity and corruption overlooked or ignored during Obama's original review and revision of his predecessor's policy?<br />
The unmistakable inference is that Obama did not carefully think through his March Afghan policy, or did not have full confidence then or now in Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal or Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke, or that it is now politically inconvenient among increasingly antiwar Democrats to follow through on that policy.<br />
None of these explanations reflect credit on the president. He is dithering. Whatever decision Obama reaches on Afghanistan, his credibility and leadership have been badly wounded by his continuing public display of indecisiveness.<br />
Our international adversaries undoubtedly welcome all of these &quot;resets&quot; in U.S. foreign policy, but Americans should be appalled at how much of our posture in the world has already been given away. If Obama's first nine months indicate the direction of the next 39, we still have a long way to fall.<br />

<br />
BC: Are we currently sending a message of weakness to our foes and allies? Can anything good result from President Obama’s marked submissiveness before the world?<br />
Dr. Hanson: Obama is one bow and one apology away from a circus. The world can understand a kowtow gaffe to some Saudi royals, but not as part of a deliberate pattern. Ditto the mea culpas. Much of diplomacy rests on public perceptions, however trivial. We are now in a great waiting game, as regional hegemons, wishing to redraw the existing landscape — whether China, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Syria, etc. — are just waiting to see who’s going to be the first to try Obama — and whether Obama really will be as tenuous as they expect. If he slips once, it will be 1979 redux, when we saw the rise of radical Islam, the Iranian hostage mess, the communist inroads in Central America, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, etc.<br />
BC: With what country then — Venezuela, Russia, Iran, etc. — do you believe his global repositioning will cause the most damage?<br />
Dr. Hanson: I think all three. I would expect, in the next three years, Iran to get the bomb and begin to threaten ever so insidiously its Gulf neighborhood; Venezuela will probably cook up some scheme to do a punitive border raid into Colombia to apprise South America that U.S. friendship and values are liabilities; and Russia will continue its energy bullying of Eastern Europe, while insidiously pressuring autonomous former republics to get back in line with some sort of new Russian autocratic commonwealth. There’s an outside shot that North Korea might do something really stupid near the 38th parallel and China will ratchet up the pressure on Taiwan. India’s borders with both Pakistan and China will heat up. I think we got off the back of the tiger and now no one quite knows whom it will bite or when. <br />

Today's gobsmacking quote from the new Woodward book. &quot;Mr. President,&quot; Tien said, &quot;I don't see how you can defy your military chain here. We kind of are where we are. Because if you tell General [Stanley A.] McChrystal [the U.S. commander in Afghanistan], 'I got your assessment, got your resource constructs, but I've chosen to do something else,' you're going to probably have to replace him. You can't tell him, 'Just do it my way, thanks for your hard work.' And then where does that stop?&quot; The colonel did not have to elaborate. His implication was that not only McChrystal but the entire military high command might go in an unprecedented toppling - Gates; Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Gen. David H. Petraeus, then head of U.S. Central Command. Perhaps no president could weather that, especially a 48-year-old with four years in the U.S. Senate and 10 months as commander in chief. Excuse me while I count all the ways in which Colonel Tien's statement is reflective of the ongoing civ-mil crisis in this country. A) &quot;Mr. President,&quot; Tien said, &quot;I don't see how you can defy your military chain here.&quot; Hmm. The very idea that the President of the United States could ever be in a situation where he &quot;defies&quot; the military chain of command on a decision related to national security decision-making pretty much turns the 230-year tradition of civilian control of the military on its head. What I have trouble seeing here is how Col. Tien could possibly say this to the President of the United States. B) &quot;Because if you tell General [Stanley A.] McChrystal [the U.S. commander in Afghanistan], 'I got your assessment, got your resource constructs, but I've chosen to do something else,' you're going to probably have to replace him. You can't tell him, 'Just do it my way, thanks for your hard work.'&quot; Putting aside for a second that the President is under no obligation whatsoever to accept the military judgment of any of his military commander . .. the President can actually quite easily tell McChrystal to do it his way. You know why? He's the f*ing President of the United States. If McChrystal didn't want to be overruled by POTUS perhaps he should have offered him a series of recommendations for what to do in Afghanistan - not COIN or nothing - and perhaps he should have made damn sure his assessment didn't leak to the press, which of course helped to limit Obama's options. Or perhaps McChrystal and Petraeus should have stopped incessantly leaking to the press about why only escalation AND COIN could save the day in Afghanistan. It takes some real chutzpah to spend the summer and fall of 2009 publicly and privately trying to force the President's hand on escalation and then argue that because of this inappropriate pressure Obama has no choice but to go along with it or risk a rift with the same people that are surreptitiously trying to box him in. C) &quot;The colonel did not have to elaborate. His implication was that not only McChrystal but the entire military high command might go in an unprecedented toppling - Gates; Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Gen. David H. Petraeus, then head of U.S. Central Command.&quot; Can we be very clear what this implicit threat represents - political blackmail by the military on the commander-in-chief. Go along with our strategy or we're all going to resign and embarrass the hell out of you. How does that NOT represent a crisis in civil-military relations? You have generals; even civilians like Gates acting as though they get a veto over the President's decision-making on national security. What is perhaps most troubling about this is Colonel Tien, General Petraeus, Admiral Mullen, General McChrystal have all risen through the military ranks. Surely they've had the principle of civilian control of the military drilled in their heads throughout their military career. And yet here you have four individuals basically acting in a way that violates the most basic tenets of civil-military relations in this country. That's a crisis folks. <br />

<strong>Russia models US CMR – they are in need of civilian leadership</strong><br />
<strong>Huntington ’95</strong> – Eaton Professor of the Science of Government and director of the John M. Olin Institute for Strategic Studies at Harvard University (Samuel, 1995, “Reforming Civil Military Relations”, Journal of Democracy 6.4, Project MUSE, RG)<br />
Why have new democracies generally been so successful in restructuring their civil-military relations? Several factors have probably played a role. First, there has been a broad diffusion and acceptance of the [End Page 12] norms of military professionalism and civilian control by militaries around the world. In past cases where Latin American military personnel have attempted coups or have been unmasked as torturers, liberal U.S. congressmen and journalists have immediately cited these acts as consequences of their education in U.S. military schools. That U.S. military officers could teach their Latin American counterparts how to organize a coup or torture prisoners, however, seems highly improbable. In fact, exposure to the U.S. military and training in its schools have been major factors in the diffusion and acceptance by military officers elsewhere of the liberal democratic norms of military professionalism and civilian control. The George C. Marshall Center in Bavaria represents an important extension of this effort into the post-Soviet world. Second, movement toward objective civilian control has been in the interest of both military and civilian leaders. Military officers have learned that there are no easy solutions to the intractable economic, social, and political problems confronting their respective countries, and that sustained involvement in politics has disastrous effects on the coherence, efficiency, and discipline of the army. It sacrifices, in Stepan's terms, the military as institution to the military as government, which is one reason why so many military regimes in Latin America voluntarily surrendered power. 5 Elected political leaders, on the other hand, recognize that playing politics with the military is playing with a two-edged sword and that a politically neutral professional establishment is most congruent with their interests. As a result, opposition to progress in civil-military relations has generally been limited to small groups of disaffected midlevel officers and to extreme-nationalist civilian politicians on the margins of the political arena. Third, unlike economic reform, civil-military reform imposes few costs on society and produces widespread benefits: reductions in military service, cuts in military spending, curtailment of military abuses of human rights, and the transfer to private hands of military-run enter-prises. These measures are obviously popular and arouse little or no opposition from groups outside the military. The comparative success of new democracies in reforming civil-military relations does not mean that there are not major civil-military problems in some countries, and less urgent but still significant problems in many others. Two countries, in particular, face rather unique challenges. South Africa is struggling to integrate the guerrillas of the African National Congress's force, the Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), with the South African Defense Force, a force with an overwhelmingly Afrikaner officer corps and a tradition of commitment to apartheid. The government of President Nelson Mandela has undertaken efforts at integration that have produced a significant, presumably temporary, increase in the military budget. It appears that the integration of MK officers is proceeding reasonably well, but the integration of the rank-and-file [End Page 13] guerrillas has produced demonstrations, a protest march on President Mandela's headquarters, small-scale mutinies, large-scale absenteeism, and warnings from Mandela that he will not tolerate &quot;an army of criminals&quot; and will discharge from the military those former guerrillas unwilling to accept the discipline required in a regular force. In South Africa, the central problem is the military's integration; in Russia, the central problem is its disintegration. As Benjamin Lambeth has pointed out, unlike any other contemporary military establishment, the Russian military has lost not only manpower, money, and mission, but also a war, an alliance, and a country. 6 The result is a thoroughly disorganized and demoralized military, which is not only incapable of conducting a war but is also so divided against itself that it is, in all probability, incapable of conducting a coup. The Russian armed forces seem to be thoroughly politicized and divided into factions and personalistic cliques. To compensate for a lack of funds, soldiers increasingly turn to commercial activities and the sale of military supplies. They are overwhelmingly contemptuous of both President Boris Yeltsin and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and await the appearance of a new leader who will provide leadership and discipline. <br />

<strong>What this episode also shows is that the military’s victory on the nature of the threat and policy prescriptions to meet it was only possible to the degree that powerful civilian political actors accepted or agreed with its position. Where that is not the case, as in the defense reform, the military can only resort to obstruction, a tactic of dubious value, not least because it has nothing to offer but more of the same. Thus, the government professes to have bought the military’s threat assessment but has launched a defense reform that points in an entirely different direction than would have been indicated by this acceptance. So it is not surprising that a vicious struggle is currently roiling the entire military establishment. That struggle is continuing, attesting to the failure to establish either regular government or democratic and truly civilian control over the armed forces. For instance, we are now told that in the forthcoming defense doctrine, there will be closed or classified sections, specifically those relating to the legal aspects of the army and navy’s employment, including the use of nuclear weapons. Only the military-political sections will be publicized.95 Then, in October 2009, Patrushev openly discussed the doctrine and its forthcoming nuclear provisions.96 Apart from the fact that those provisions are highly dangerous in discussing options for a preventive or preemptive first use of nuclear weapons even in a local war, the contradiction between prior concealment and now public openness attests to the unresolved struggles over the doctrine as of October 2009. The earlier move towards concealment represents a hugely regressive step away from both democratic and civilian control, and although the General Staff claims it is only doing what is done in the United States and other Western countries, that is not the case (although there are classified annexes to key documents, they are often debated or discussed in the chambers of Congress).97 But it represented both another attempt to create a kind of Chinese wall behind which the military can shelter itself free of any accountability to anyone, and a further step towards militarization of state policy along neo-Soviet lines. Thus the debate continues as before.</strong><br />

Revitalizing civilian control in Russian CMR is key to stop a civil war and nuclear theft <br />
David ‘99 <strong>(Stephen – Professor of Political Science at Johns Hopkins University. Saving America from the Coming Civil Wars. Foreign Affairs Magazine, Jan/ Feb, Proquest)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A future conflict would quickly draw in Russia's military. In the Soviet days civilian rule kept the powerful armed forces in check. But with the Communist Party out of office, what little civilian control remains relies on an exceedingly fragile foundation-personal friendships between government leaders and military commanders. Meanwhile, the morale of Russian soldiers has fallen to a dangerous low. Drastic cuts in spending mean inadequate pay, housing, and medical care. A new emphasis on domestic missions has created an ideological split between the old and new guard in the military leadership, increasing the risk that disgruntled generals may enter the political fray and feeding the resentment of soldiers who dislike being used as a national police force. Newly enhanced ties between military units and local authorities pose another danger. Soldiers grow ever more dependent on local governments for housing, food, and wages. Draftees serve closer to home, and new laws have increased local control over the armed forces. Were a conflict to emerge between a regional power and Moscow, it is not at all clear which side the military would support. Divining the military's allegiance is crucial, however, since the structure of the Russian Federation makes it virtually certain that regional conflicts will continue to erupt. Russia's 89 republics, krais, and oblasts grow ever more independent in a system that does little to keep them together. As the central government finds itself unable to force its will beyond Moscow (if even that far), power devolves to the periphery. With the economy collapsing, republics feel less and less incentive to pay taxes to Moscow when they receive so little in return. Three-quarters of them already have their own constitutions, nearly all of which make some claim to sovereignty. Strong ethnic bonds promoted by shortsighted Soviet policies may motivate non-Russians to secede from the Federation. Chechnya's successful revolt against Russian control inspired similar movements for autonomy and independence throughout the country. If these rebellions spread and Moscow responds with force, civil war is likely. Should Russia succumb to internal war, the consequences for the United States and Europe will be severe. A major power like Russia-even though in decline-does not suffer civil war quietly or alone. An embattled Russian Federation might provoke opportunistic attacks from enemies such as China. Massive flows of refugees would pour into central and western Europe. Armed struggles in Russia could easily spill into its neighbors. Damage from the fighting, particularly attacks on nuclear plants, would poison the environment of much of Europe and Asia. Within Russia, the consequences would be even worse. Just as the sheer brutality of the last Russian civil war laid the basis for the privations of Soviet communism, a second civil war might produce another horrific regime. Most alarming is the real possibility that the violent disintegration of Russia could lead to loss of control over its nuclear arsenal. No nuclear state has ever fallen victim to civil war, but even without a clear precedent the grim consequences can be foreseen. Russia retains some 20,ooo nuclear weapons and the raw material for tens of thousands more, in scores of sites scattered throughout the country. So far, the government has managed to prevent the loss of any weapons or much materiel. If war erupts, however, Moscow's already weak grip on nuclear sites will slacken, making weapons and supplies available to a wide range of anti-American groups and states. Such dispersal of nuclear weapons represents the greatest physical threat America now faces. And it is hard to think of anything that would increase this threat more than the chaos that would follow a Russian civil war.</strong><br />

Pentagon report concludes war is not working – Taliban getting stronger<br />

<br />
<strong>The Pentagon's semiannual report to Congress on the war in Afghanistan paints a picture of a country where corruption remains rampant, violence has increased, and a well-funded Taliban insurgency continues to make troubling gains. The report, “Progress Toward Security and Stability in Afghanistan,” which was released this week, actually cites little in the way of progress in the war, a major US undertaking that is rapidly losing popular support among Americans and threatens to become a political burden on President Obama. The number of Afghans rating their security situation as “bad” is “the highest since the nationwide survey began in September 2008,” the report’s authors write, noting that the “downward trend in security perception is likely due to the steady increase in total violence over the past nine months.” The rise in violence, however, was an anticipated outcome of the ramped up US military operations in the country, the Pentagon says. A senior defense official who briefed reporters on the findings Tuesday afternoon said the violence is “exactly what we expected. It’s what we predicted.” It is the result, he says, of an influx of US troops into the country – a US presence that is now at an all-time high of some 100,000 military personnel – running headlong into an active insurgency. According to the report, the Taliban insurgency’s capabilities and operational reach “have been qualitatively and geographically expanding” with plentiful sources of funding. Iran, meanwhile, often cited by US commanders as a catalyst for violence in Iraq at the height of the insurgency there, has not sought to expand its influence in Afghanistan, according to the report. While the country continues to provide “small arms, ammunition, RPGs, and materials used to create IEDs,” or improvised explosive devices, intelligence from the past year “indicates neither a significant increase in Iranian support, nor the provision of more advanced Iranian signature weaponry.” Rampant corruption remains a concern for US officials. According to the report, 80 percent of Afghans believe that corruption impacts their daily lives. “This is consistent with the view that corruption is preventing the Afghan government from connecting with the people and remains a key reason for Afghans supporting the insurgency,” says the report. Much of that corruption, senior defense officials concede, is the result of US-funded contractors, who may inadvertently be funneling money to the Taliban. “A lot of what we’re doing is, when we talk about the issue of corruption and enabling people, we need to look in the mirror first and see what we’re doing,” said the senior defense official. This is a complicated prospect, he added. So, too, is the training of Afghan security forces, though it was one of the rare upbeat points in the Pentagon report. As of September, growth in the Afghan army and police force “are among Afghanistan’s most promising areas of progress.” Attrition, however, remains a problem, as does a shortage of NATO trainers – a shortage “that will grow more acute through the fall and into next year, if troop contributions do not meet the growing need for training.… This shortfall poses significant strategic risk and threatens to delay the upcoming transition process.”</strong><br />

<strong>There are important implications here for Obama. He is about a month away from a mandated National Security Council review of the war. If the military's public performance is any indication, it seems likely that Obama's generals will regale him with signs of halting progress divorced from Afghanistan's bleak reality. Indeed, the president's commander in Afghanistan has already offered a possible preview of what was to come. According to Bob Woodward's Obama's Wars, Petraeus told White House &quot;war czar&quot; Gen. Douglas Lute last year, &quot;All we have to do is begin to show progress and that will be sufficient to add time to the clock and we'll get what we need.&quot; The simple fact is that ever since the president announced a July 2011 deadline for commencing withdrawals the military has chafed against what its views as an arbitrary deadline for pulling the plug on the operation. Rather than following Obama's admonition to not send troops into areas that could not be realistically handed over to the Afghan security forces by 2011, NATO and U.S. forces have engaged in a &quot;clear, hold, and build strategy&quot; in places where there is limited chance of turnover any time soon. It's hard to square that approach with a White House that seems desperate to embrace political reality and find the Afghan exit ramp. But by spinning an optimistic tale of progress -- and pushing stories to journalists that suggest success is just around the corner -- the military could see only a nominal decrease of troops in July 2011. At the very least, it will put more public pressure on the White House to stay the course and fudge the troop withdrawal deadline. To be fair, military leaders appear to believe they are doing what it is necessary for the United States to &quot;win&quot; in Afghanistan. And as Woodward's book laid out in dispiriting detail, they will push the president as far as they can to embrace their vision of what success requires. But that doesn't mean anyone -- least of all the White House or the American people -- should confuse the military's assessment of the situation in Afghanistan with the truth.</strong><br />

<br />
If it is a war against extremists and militancy inside Pakistan, it is a civil war because its origins stem from the US, NATO occupation of neighboring Afghanistan. The conflict should be seen as an extension of the ongoing resistance of the Afghan people to alien domination. It is inaccurate to say that the US invaded Afghanistan because of the 9/11 attacks by Al-Qaeda. Former BBC correspondent George Arney reported on September 18, 2001, that Niaz Naik, the former Pakistani foreign secretary, had told him that he was informed by US officials at a UN-sponsored international contact group on Afghanistan in Berlin during July that year that unless Osama bin Laden were handed over swiftly, America would take military action to kill or capture both Bin Laden and Mullah Omar. The wider objective, however, was to topple the Taliban regime and install a transitional government under King Mohammad Zahir Shah. The invasion was to take place in mid-October 2001. Mr. Naik went on to say that he doubted that the US would have abandoned its plan to invade Afghanistan even if Osama were handed over by the Taliban. Arney's story is corroborated by the Guardian correspondent David Leigh in his report published on September 26, 2001, in which he revealed that the Taliban had received specific warning by the US through secret diplomacy in Berlin in July that the Bush Administration would topple the entire regime militarily unless Osama is extradited to the US. This was part of the larger design of US military, industrial complex to bring about regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran. As the US needed bases in Pakistan to accomplish its pre-planned invasion of Afghanistan, the Bush Administration sought to use Islamabad as a cat's paw to pull the chestnuts out of the fire. Fortunately for President Bush, a usurper ruled there, devoid of all legitimacy, legal and moral, and he readily and willingly succumbed to US pressure and made a U-turn by severing all links with the Taliban. He even joined the war against Afghanistan instead of using his leverage with the Taliban to exhaust all means of peaceful settlement of the dispute. The entire region, including Pakistan, was declared a war zone by the US military command, and the flights of all passenger planes were prohibited over a certain altitude, while no merchant ships could enter the harbors of Pakistan, thus bringing maritime trade (which comprises approximately 95 percent of Pakistan's import-export trade) to a standstill. It is no wonder that Pakistan suffered a loss of 34 billion dollars because of its involvement in the Afghan war. America's War As one can see, it was America's war that was imposed upon Pakistan. Whether Pakistan could have avoided the war is a matter of controversy among politicians and political observers. But the war has fuelled insurgency in Pakistan's hitherto peaceful tribal territory adjacent to Afghanistan. This insurgency shows no sign of abatement, as terrorist attacks on military and civilian centers in the capital and major cities of the North-West Frontier Province and Punjab continue with a vengeance, posing threat to the security of the state. In the meantime, routine predator strikes by the US in Waziristan have taken a heavy toll of civilian lives amid accusations of Islamabad's complicity in the piratical attacks on tribespeople, which prompts them to resort to retaliatory strikes on the perpetrators. Not satisfied with Pakistan's military operations in the tribal region, the US Administration has compelled Islamabad's fragile government to pull out its troops from the tense Indo-Pak border and deploy them in the restive tribal belt along the Pak-Afghan border. Now Pakistan faces existential threat from the Taliban and not India, a perception which the country's military leadership is not prepared to share, given the unresolved disputes with New Delhi, which triggered four wars during the last 62 years. At the same time, speculation (not entirely unfounded) is rife about the involvement of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and the former Blackwater (now christened Xe Services) in murder, mayhem, and gunrunning as evidenced by the armed Americans who drive consulate vehicles through cities and, when intercepted, refuse to disclose their identity. It is here that one recalls with dismay the role of General Stanley McChrystal, who until last year headed the Joint Special Operations Command, which runs drone attacks and targeted assassinations with the assistance of the operatives of the former Blackwater. This was revealed by Jeremy Scahill's investigative report published in the US weekly the Nation. That may, perhaps, solve the mystery surrounding a series of assassinations of ulama belonging to various Islamic movements. The sinister motive behind such acts of terror is to incite sectarian violence in Pakistan and lay the blame at the doors of religious extremists. Similar death squads were organized by the CIA in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to carry out political assassinations of nationalists who were opposed to US intervention. At the time, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua complained to the International Court of Justice about the mining of Nicaraguan ports, the violation of the country's airspace, the killing and kidnapping of individuals on the Nicaraguan territory, and the threat or use of force by the US. The court in its decision in June 1986 held that the US was in breach of the customary rules of international law and international humanitarian law. The above case is titled the &quot;Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua.&quot; The precedent set by this case may be invoked by Pakistan to prevent the US drone attacks on its territory. Once the piratical attacks of the US have stopped, the irritant in the tribal insurgency would have gone, paving the way for pacification of the conflict. If this were Pakistan's war, the government would have exercised its own judgment in dealing with the militants at home, either by conciliation or by resort to force. But Islamabad's so-called operation against militants is subordinated to US military designs in the region, aimed at the encirclement of the People's Republic of China and the control of the transit of gas pipelines from Central Asia to South Asia. It is not aimless that China expressed its concern over the concentration of US, NATO troops in the region. India fits in the American scheme of things, hence the US-India nuclear deal. Pakistan's National Interest In this emerging security environment, Pakistan will have to be content with its role as a junior partner of India. Therefore, the sooner Islamabad extricates itself from the US &quot;war on terror,&quot; the better it is for its security and independence. Doesn't Islamabad realize that its military operation against the militants would leave its border with India vulnerable to a New Delhi offensive? If Pakistan permits the US to attack the suspected training centers of militants on its territory, will it be able to prevent India from doing so? With Islamabad embroiled in internecine strife, it cannot negotiate with India from a position of strength. It may be forced to make a compromise that might be detrimental to its national interest. Pakistan's preoccupation with tribal rebellion would not permit it to deal with separatist ethnic forces in Baluchistan. Undoubtedly, this is a threat to the territorial integrity of Pakistan. After the total failure of the military operation in Baluchistan, the federal government has come round to the painful conclusion that political and not military action can bring militancy to an end. Granting general amnesty to the dissidents and engaging them in a meaningful dialogue on contentious issues is a laudable initiative. The same gesture should be made to the militants in the tribal areas. But Islamabad has adopted double standards in dealing with the Baluchistan militants and the Pashtun militants, as if there were good militants and bad ones. This discriminatory policy would intensify the Pashtun insurgency and might drive them toward even more escalation. The rulers have seen the consequences of military operations in the former East Pakistan, Baluchistan, Karachi, Sind, and FATA (federally administered tribal areas). If anything, the situation has only worsened. The surge of US troops, the expansion of war beyond the borders of Afghanistan, and the attacks on Quetta and Muridke as envisaged by Obama's new strategy would mean that US troops are at war with the people of Pakistan. Any Solution? The Obama Administration would be better advised to concentrate on its exit strategy, and to that end, it is imperative that it involve the UN in its peace-making efforts aimed at the establishment of a broad-based government in Afghanistan, because the Karzai Government has no legitimacy. To fill the vacuum, the UN peacekeeping force, made up of troops of states not involved in the Afghan war, may be deployed until a government of national unity is able to assume full responsibility. Here the US can contribute to the postwar reconstruction of Afghanistan under the aegis of the UN. The insurgency in the tribal region is the spillover effect of US military occupation of Afghanistan, but Pakistan faces a far greater threat: the threat of ethnic violence as manifested in the bloody clashes among various linguistic groups in urban and rural Sind. These have been overshadowed by the counterinsurgency operations in FATA, but they may erupt at any moment, thus destabilizing the state.<br />

But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with explosives into a jeep filled with troops today, killing five and wounding as many as 21, including several children who were waiting for a ride to school. Residents of the region where the attack took place are fleeing in terror as gunfire rings out around them, and government forces have been unable to quell the violence. Two regional government officials were beheaded by militants in retaliation for the killing of other militants by government forces. As familiar as this sounds, it did not take place where we have come to expect such terrible events. This, unfortunately, is a whole new ballgame. It is part of another conflict that is brewing, one which puts what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan in deep shade, and which represents a grave and growing threat to us all. Pakistan is now trembling on the edge of violent chaos, and is doing so with nuclear weapons in its hip pocket, right in the middle of one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world. The situation in brief: Pakistan for years has been a nation in turmoil, run by a shaky government supported by a corrupted system, dominated by a blatantly criminal security service, and threatened by a large fundamentalist Islamic population with deep ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan. All this is piled atop an ongoing standoff with neighboring India that has been the center of political gravity in the region for more than half a century. The fact that Pakistan, and India, and Russia, and China all possess nuclear weapons and share the same space means any ongoing or escalating violence over there has the real potential to crack open the very gates of Hell itself.<br />
Recently, the Taliban made a military push into the northwest Pakistani region around the Swat Valley. According to a recent Reuters report: The (Pakistani) army deployed troops in Swat in October 2007 and used artillery and gunship helicopters to reassert control. But insecurity mounted after a civilian government came to power last year and tried to reach a negotiated settlement. A peace accord fell apart in May 2008. After that, hundreds — including soldiers, militants and civilians — died in battles. Militants unleashed a reign of terror, killing and beheading politicians, singers, soldiers and opponents. They banned female education and destroyed nearly 200 girls' schools. About 1,200 people were killed since late 2007 and 250,000 to 500,000 fled, leaving the militants in virtual control. Pakistan offered on February 16 to introduce Islamic law in the Swat valley and neighboring areas in a bid to take the steam out of the insurgency. The militants announced an indefinite cease-fire after the army said it was halting operations in the region. President Asif Ali Zardari signed a regulation imposing sharia in the area last month. But the Taliban refused to give up their guns and pushed into Buner and another district adjacent to Swat, intent on spreading their rule. The United States, already embroiled in a war against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, must now face the possibility that Pakistan could collapse under the mounting threat of Taliban forces there. Military and diplomatic advisers to President Obama, uncertain how best to proceed, now face one of the great nightmare scenarios of our time. &quot;Recent militant gains in Pakistan,&quot; reported The New York Times on Monday, &quot;have so alarmed the White House that the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, described the situation as 'one of the very most serious problems we face.'&quot; &quot;Security was deteriorating rapidly,&quot; reported The Washington Post on Monday, &quot;particularly in the mountains along the Afghan border that harbor al-Qaeda and the Taliban, intelligence chiefs reported, and there were signs that those groups were working with indigenous extremists in Pakistan's populous Punjabi heartland. The Pakistani government was mired in political bickering. The army, still fixated on its historical adversary India, remained ill-equipped and unwilling to throw its full weight into the counterinsurgency fight. But despite the threat the intelligence conveyed, Obama has only limited options for dealing with it. Anti-American feeling in Pakistan is high, and a U.S. combat presence is prohibited. The United States is fighting Pakistan-based extremists by proxy, through an army over which it has little control, in alliance with a government in which it has little confidence.&quot; It is believed Pakistan is currently in possession of between 60 and 100 nuclear weapons. Because Pakistan's stability is threatened by the wide swath of its population that shares ethnic, cultural and religious connections to the fundamentalist Islamic populace of Afghanistan, fears over what could happen to those nuclear weapons if the Pakistani government collapses are very real. &quot;As the insurgency of the Taliban and Al Qaeda spreads in Pakistan,&quot; reported the Times last week, &quot;senior American officials say they are increasingly concerned about new vulnerabilities for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, including the potential for militants to snatch a weapon in transport or to insert sympathizers into laboratories or fuel-production facilities. In public, the administration has only hinted at those concerns, repeating the formulation that the Bush administration used: that it has faith in the Pakistani Army. But that cooperation, according to officials who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity surrounding the exchanges between Washington and Islamabad, has been sharply limited when the subject has turned to the vulnerabilities in the Pakistani nuclear infrastructure.&quot; &quot;The prospect of turmoil in Pakistan sends shivers up the spines of those U.S. officials charged with keeping tabs on foreign nuclear weapons,&quot; reported Time Magazine last month. &quot;Pakistan is thought to possess about 100 — the U.S. isn't sure of the total, and may not know where all of them are. Still, if Pakistan collapses, the U.S. military is primed to enter the country and secure as many of those weapons as it can, according to U.S. officials. Pakistani officials insist their personnel safeguards are stringent, but a sleeper cell could cause big trouble, U.S. officials say.&quot; In other words, a shaky Pakistan spells trouble for everyone, especially if America loses the footrace to secure those weapons in the event of the worst-case scenario. If Pakistani militants ever succeed in toppling the government, several very dangerous events could happen at once. Nuclear-armed India could be galvanized into military action of some kind, as could nuclear-armed China or nuclear-armed Russia. If the Pakistani government does fall, and all those Pakistani nukes are not immediately accounted for and secured, the specter (or reality) of loose nukes falling into the hands of terrorist organizations could place the entire world on a collision course with unimaginable disaster. We have all been paying a great deal of attention to Iraq and Afghanistan, and rightly so. The developing situation in Pakistan, however, needs to be placed immediately on the front burner. The Obama administration appears to be gravely serious about addressing the situation. So should we all.<br />

<strong>Whatever US officials might concede privately, the White House, State Department and Pentagon have thus far not acknowledged publicly the possibility that greater American intrusiveness in Afghanistan might mean less Pakistani cooperation. That, however, appears to be the case. To be sure, Pakistan has pragmatically responded to US pressure to thwart the Taliban in its tribal areas. But it is more significant in the broader strategic context that Pakistan has objected to expanded US military operations in Afghanistan on two grounds. Firstly, they would cause a cross-border spillover of militants into Pakistan and increase the counter-insurgency burden on the Pakistani military. Secondly, they would foment political instability in Pakistan by intensifying popular perceptions of American military occupation of the region and the Pakistani government’s complicity with the Americans in suppressing a group that was not even considered an enemy of Pakistan. Indeed, in a July briefing, Pakistani officials made it clear that, however concerned the United States was about the Taliban, they still regard India as their top strategic priority and the Taliban militants a little more than a containable nuisance and, in the long term, potential allies.5</strong><br />
<strong>In this light, the realistic American objective should not be to ensure Afghanistan’s political integrity by neutralising the Taliban and containing Pakistani radicalism, which is probably unachievable. Rather, its aim should be merely to ensure that al-Qaeda is denied both Afghanistan and Pakistan as operating bases for transnational attacks on the United States and its allies and partners.</strong><br />

<strong>An alternative to the present U.S. strategy calls for the United States to address the threat of international terrorism in Afghanistan with a military and civilian posture that is significantly smaller, more affordable, and less vulnerable.50 A “light footprint,”—some argue as few as ten thousand to twenty thousand troops—led by Special Operations Forces armed with cash, weapons, surveillance, and the ability to call in U.S. airpower, could partner with elements of the Afghan state and nonstate power brokers to continue counterterror missions long after the bulk of NATO forces have pulled out. Even if the Kabul government is unable to retain control over large portions of its territory, a force of this sort would attempt to prop up enough partners to retain sufficient bases inside Afghanistan. Washington would also continue to partner with Islamabad on the other side of the border. A smaller military force would be less reliant upon Pakistani supply lines, creating an added benefit of reducing Islamabad’s leverage over U.S. operations.</strong><br />
<strong>By demonstrating that the United States is primarily concerned with combating international terrorists, Washington might find new opportunities to negotiate with some members of the Afghan Taliban, cleaving them from al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups with more extreme global ambitions. The reduced NATO commitment to Afghanistan could lead states like China, Iran, and Russia—which contribute little to security efforts and pursue self-serving agendas—to think more seriously about issues of regional security. It might spark a new round of regional diplomacy with the potential to create a messy but workable Afghan peace settlement. As for shoring up Pakistan’s stability, U.S. forces could try to assist Islamabad against militant threats that emerge on the Afghan side of the border while Washington continues to work against other Pakistan-based terrorist networks, like LeT.</strong><br />

Shifting to CT is the most effective strategy<br />

<strong>The lesson learned from history must be to do what we know to be doable and to avoid what we have learned is not. Thus, in place of nation-building in the Muslim world, the U.S. must switch to an aggressive counterterror (CT) strategy that makes maximum use of CIA/military special operations forces, increased air strikes, and even more hunter-killer drones to eradicate the jihadi leadership. These CT operations should be combined with unconventional warfare (UW) to promote civil wars that exploit the tribal, ethnic, and Sunni-Shia cleavages in Afghanistan. The British successfully blunted Islam in the Asian subcontinent through &quot;divide and conquer.&quot; The same grievances the British exploited are still there and on display daily. The change in mission from COIN to CT/UW would significantly reduce the number of U.S. casualties by taking U.S. forces out of the high-risk task of population protection (with its rules of engagement that seem to sacrifice U.S. soldiers on the altar of &quot;hearts-and-minds&quot; that reach out in peace one day only to strap a bomb on the next) to one of our choosing when and where to fight without the need to hold static positions. The objective would change from &quot;winning&quot; (whatever that would mean in Afghanistan) or &quot;building a stable Afghan nation&quot; (an even more uncertain objective) to continually keeping al-Qaeda and the Pashtun Taliban off-balance by assisting the Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Turkmenis, and Baluchis to make war on al-Qaeda and the Pashtun Taliban. Such a war is something they will have to do even without us. None of these ethnic groups want to again be dominated by al-Qaeda and the Pashtun Taliban. While this strategy objective lacks the clarity of a date certain for departure and a defined end state, it can be maintained as long as conditions warrant, which is what is required to fight our Islamic jihadi enemy, who is in it for the long haul. It would also add what is currently lacking in our strategy (which dooms it to fail): evidence to our &quot;allies&quot; in Afghanistan that we are not cutting and running on them. Therefore, we will demonstrate that we all share a common commitment to a long-term objective -- prohibiting the return of al-Qaeda and Pashtun Taliban domination of Afghanistan. A &quot;stable&quot; Afghan government under Hamid Karzai is a losing proposition that should be carefully abandoned as inconspicuously and quickly as possible.</strong><br />

<strong>Second, a U.S. drawdown would not make Al Qaeda substantially more lethal. In order for events in Afghanistan to enhance Al Qaeda’s ability to threaten the U.S. homeland, three separate steps must occur: 1) the Taliban must seize control of a substantial portion of the country, 2) Al Qaeda must relocate there in strength, and 3) it must build facilities in this new “safe haven” that will allow it to plan and train more effectively than it can today. Each of these three steps is unlikely, however, and the chances of all three together are very remote. For starters, a Taliban victory is unlikely even if the United States reduces its military commitment. The Taliban is a rural insurgency rooted primarily in Afghanistan’s Pashtun population, and its seizure of power in the 1990s was due to unusual circumstances that no longer exist and are unlikely to be repeated. Non-Pashtun Afghans now have ample experience with Taliban rule, and they are bound to resist any Taliban efforts to regain control in Kabul. Moreover, the U.S. military presence has helped the Taliban rally its forces, meaning that the group may well fragment and suffer a loss of momentum in the face of a U.S. drawdown. Surveys suggest that popular support for the Taliban among Afghans is in the single digits. Even with significantly reduced troop levels, we can build a credible defense against a Taliban takeover through support for local security forces, strategic use of airpower, and deployment in key cities without committing ourselves to a costly and counterproductive COIN (counterinsurgency) campaign in the south. And if power-sharing and political inclusion is negotiated, the relevance of the Taliban as an alternative to Kabul is likely to decline. And even if the Taliban were to regain power in some of Afghanistan, it would likely not invite Al Qaeda to re-establish a significant presence there. The Taliban may be reluctant to risk renewed U.S. attacks by welcoming Al Qaeda onto Afghan soil. Bin Laden and his associates may well prefer to remain in Pakistan, which is both safer and a better base from which to operate than isolated and land-locked Afghanistan. Most importantly, no matter what happens in Afghanistan in the future, Al Qaeda will not be able to build large training camps of the sort it employed prior to the 9/11 attacks. Simply put, the U.S. would remain vigilant and could use air power to eliminate any Al Qaeda facility that the group might attempt to establish. Bin Laden and his associates will likely have to remain in hiding for the rest of their lives, which means Al Qaeda will have to rely on clandestine cells instead of large encampments. Covert cells can be located virtually anywhere, which is why the outcome in Afghanistan is not critical to addressing the threat from Al Qaeda. In short, a complete (and unlikely) victory in Afghanistan and the dismantling of the Taliban would not make Al Qaeda disappear; indeed, it would probably have no appreciable effect on Al Qaeda. At the same time, dramatically scaling back U.S. military engagement will not significantly increase the threat from Al Qaeda. Third, the current U.S. military effort is helping fuel the very insurgency we are attempting to defeat. An expanded U.S. presence has reinforced perceptions of the United States as a foreign occupier. Religious extremists have used the U.S. presence as an effective recruiting tool for their cause. Efforts to limit civilian casualties and other forms of collateral damage have been only partially successful, leading additional Afghans to take up arms against us. Fourth, the expanded U.S. presence and a more energetic counterinsurgency effort in Afghanistan and Pakistan have reinforced a tacit alliance among different extremist groups whose agendas are not identical. The Taliban is itself a loose coalition of Pashtuns, many of whom are motivated by local concerns rather than by any deep commitment to global jihad. Al Qaeda, by contrast, is a global network of radical Islamists seeking to topple governments throughout the Middle East. The “Pakistani Taliban” are a separate alliance of different Islamist groups challenging the authority of the Pakistani state. The Haqqani network in Waziristan is led by a local warlord who is strongly opposed to foreign interference but reportedly also a sometime ally of Pakistan’s Inter-Service Intelligence agency (ISI). Although cooperation among these disparate groups has increased in recent years, this development is largely a reaction to the increased foreign presence in the region and our efforts to convince the Pakistani government to take more aggressive action against these groups. Thus, our current strategy is helping drive these groups together, when our real aim should be to drive wedges between as many of them as possible and to win over those who do not share Al Qaeda’s anti-Western agenda or its commitment to global jihad. Fifth, keeping 100,000-plus U.S. troops in yet another Muslim country lends credence to jihadi propaganda about America’s alleged hostility to Islam. Their presence may actually be increasing the overall danger that we face back home. Anger at U.S. military action in the Af/Pak theater inspired Faisal Shahzad, a U.S. citizen, to attempt an unsuccessful car bomb attack in Times Square, and other home-grown terrorists appear to have been inspired by similar motivations.</strong><br />

<strong>Three internal links:</strong><br />
<strong>1. Lack of a coherent Afghanistan policy</strong><br />
<strong>Stewart ‘9</strong> – Ryan Family Professor of the Practice of Human Rights and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, studied at Oxford and served briefly in the British army before working in the diplomatic service in Indonesia and as British representative to Montenegro (9/16/09, Rory, “The Future of Afghanistan,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3079:http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan" rel="nofollow">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3079 -->)<br />
<br />
The best Afghan policy would be to reduce the number of foreign troops from the current level of 90,000 to far fewer – perhaps 20,000. In that case, two distinct objectives would remain for the international community: development and counter-terrorism. Neither would amount to the building of an Afghan state or winning a counter-insurgency campaign. A reduction in troop numbers and a turn away from state-building should not mean total withdrawal: good projects could continue to be undertaken in electricity, water, irrigation, health, education, agriculture, rural development and in other areas favoured by development agencies. Even a light US presence could continue to allow for aggressive operations against Al Qaeda terrorists, in Afghanistan, who plan to attack the United States. The US has successfully prevent Al Qaeda from re-establishing itself since 2001 (though the result has only been to move bin Laden across the border.). The US military could also (with other forms of assistance) support the Afghan military to prevent the Taliban from seizing a city or taking over the country.<br />
These twin objectives will require a very long-term presence, as indeed is almost inevitable in a country which is as poor, as fragile and traumatized as Afghanistan (and which lacks the internal capacity at the moment to become independent of Foreign aid or control its territory). But a long-term presence will in turn mean a much lighter and more limited presence (if it is to retain US domestic support). We should not control and cannot predict the future of Afghanistan. It may in the future become more violent, or find a decentralised equilibrium or a new national unity, but if its communities continue to want to work with us, we can, over 30 years, encourage the more positive trends in Afghan society and help to contain the more negative.<br />
Such a policy can seem strained, unrealistic, counter-intuitive and unappealing. They appear to betray the hopes of Afghans who trusted us and to allow the Taliban to abuse district towns. No politician wants to be perceived to have underestimated, or failed to address, a terrorist threat; or to write off the ‘blood and treasure’ that we have sunk into Afghanistan; or to admit defeat. Americans are particularly unwilling to believe that problems are insoluble; Obama’s motto is not ‘no we can’t’; soldiers are not trained to admit defeat or to say a mission is impossible. And to suggest that what worked in Iraq won’t work in Afghanistan requires a detailed knowledge of each country’s past, a bold analysis of the causes of development and a rigorous exposition of the differences, for which few have patience. The greatest risk of our inflated ambitions and fears, encapsulated in the current surge is that it will achieve the exact opposite of its intentions and in fact precipitate a total withdrawal. The heavier our footprint, and the more costly, the less we are likely to be able to sustain it. Public opinion is already turning against it. Nato allies are mostly staying in Afghanistan simply to please the United States and have little confidence in our objectives or our reasons. Contemporary political culture tends to encourage black and white solutions: either we garrison or we abandon.<br />
While, I strongly oppose troop increases, I equally strongly oppose a total flight. We are currently in danger of lurching from troop increases to withdrawal and from engagement to isolation. We are threatening to provide instant electro-shock therapy followed by abandonment. This is the last thing Afghanistan needs. The international community should aim to provide a patient, tolerant long-term relationship with a country as poor and traumatized as Afghanistan. Judging by comparable countries in the developing world (and Afghanistan is very near the bottom of the UN Human Development index), making Afghanistan more stable, prosperous and humane is a project which will take decades. It is a worthwhile project in the long-term for us and for Afghans but we will only be able to sustain our presence if we massively reduce our investment and our ambitions and begin to approach Afghanistan more as we do other poor countries in the developing world. The best way of avoiding the mistakes of the 1980s and 1990s – the familiar cycle of investment and abandonment which most Afghan expect and fear and which have contributed so much to instability and danger - is to husband and conserve our resources, limit our objectives to counter-terrorism and humanitarian assistance and work out how to work with fewer troops and less money over a longer period. In Afghanistan in the long-term, less will be more.<br />

<br />
Over the winter break I had an epiphany about the interrelation of U.S. hard and soft power: I now oppose a counterinsurgency (COIN) strategy in Afghanistan and advocate a purely counterterror (CT) strategy (PDF link) there instead.<br />
Blame history—or histories—that I've read recently, starting with Livy's works on early Rome (books I-V) last spring and Donald Kagan's The Peloponnesian War at the end of 2009. I've taken occasional dips back into Robert Kaplan's Warrior Politics and his source materials (Churchill, the Federalists, Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and several others).<br />
What I've taken from that reading is that the U.S. must pull back from its current efforts to remake Iraq and Afghanistan in the image of a Western democracy, or risk long-term political and economic exhaustion.<br />
What follows is not an argument about morality, and readers may find much of it amoral. It is about making cold-blooded political and economic calculations about where U.S. national interests will lie in the next decade. They do not lie in an open-ended COIN mission.<br />
The history of the Peloponnesian War is particularly relevant here. Athens began fighting Sparta with the resources of an empire and thousands of talents of silver in the bank—enough to fight expensive, far-flung naval and land campaigns for three years without lasting financial consequences.<br />
Athens was rich, and if peace with Sparta had come by the end of the third year, Athens would have continued to prosper and rule over much of the Mediterranean. (Athens had a &quot;hard&quot;—conquered or cowed—empire as opposed to the &quot;soft&quot; empire of alliances and treaties the U.S. currently has.)<br />
But the war with Sparta dragged on for decades, despite occasional peace overtures by both sides. By war's end—despite the spoils of battle and increased taxes and tribute extracted from its shrinking dominion—Athens was broke, depopulated by fighting and plague, bereft of its empire, and could no longer project power into the Mediterranean. Where its former interests ranged from Black Sea Turkey to southern Italy, it spent decades as a small-bore power and never regained its former strength or influence.<br />
I worry that the U.S. is similarly locked into an open-ended commitment to democratize a nation that is of regional rather than global importance—a parallel to Athens convincing itself that it had to conquer distant, militarily insignificant Sicily.<br />
&quot;Winning&quot; in Afghanistan<br />
The U.S. could &quot;win&quot; in Afghanistan where victory is defined as a stable, legitimate central government that can project power within its own borders. I don't doubt that the U.S. and its allies could accomplish this given enough time and resources. But I think—as many COIN experts also do—that it will take at least another decade or more of blood and treasure to produce such a result, if ever.<br />
Of course I'd like to see the results of a successful COIN campaign: a stable democracy, women's rights, and general prosperity for Afghans, who among all Asia's peoples surely deserve those things. I certainly want to end al-Qa'ida's ability to operate freely in South Asia and elsewhere.<br />
The U.S. is the only country that would both conceive of these missions and attempt to carry them out. But goals beyond keeping al-Qa'ida on the run don't serve the long-term interests of the U.S., and I am more interested in regaining and preserving U.S. hard power than I am in the rewards that would come from &quot;winning&quot; a lengthy COIN war.<br />
I fear the U.S. people and government becoming exhausted from the costs of a lengthy COIN effort, just as they are already exhausted from (and have largely forgotten about) the Iraq war. I worry that if this fatigue sits in, the U.S. will abandon foreign-policy leadership as it has done periodically throughout history.<br />
This outcome would be worse than a resurgent Taliban, worse than Afghan women and men being further oppressed, and worse than al-Qa'ida having plentiful additional caves to plot in.<br />
Here are some signs of an exhaustion of U.S. power: The U.S. is already overextended, with commitments in Iraq (shrinking for now), Afghanistan (expanding), Yemen (pending) and Iran (TBD). At home, the U.S. economy remains feeble and in the long term is increasingly hostage to other nations for goods and services it no longer produces (and increasingly, no longer can produce).<br />
Even more worrisome is the U.S. credit situation. The wars, and much other U.S. government spending, are now heavily underwritten by other countries' purchases of debt the U.S. issues. It has borrowed trillions from foreign countries and especially China, which continues its steady, highly rational policy of promoting exports while freeriding under the American security umbrella (just as the U.S. once rode for free beneath Britain's).<br />
Over time, those countries accrue enough debt to have a say in U.S. policies that may threaten the dollar's value, which is why you now see high U.S. officials flying to Beijing to soothe PRC nerves and explain why America keeps borrowing money.<br />
At home, there are few resources to apply following a major disaster, such as a Katrina-style hurricane or a major earthquake.<br />
The U.S. needs to start rebuilding its reserves—of capital, of credit, of political goodwill abroad, of military force—to be ready for these and more serious crises, for which we currently have few resources to spare. Such challenges may involve humanitarian crises (think Darfur, a Rwanda-style genocide, Indian Ocean tsunamis); Latin American instability (Mexico, Venezuela, post-Castro Cuba); rogue-state nuclear development (Iran, North Korea); or complex challenges from a rising power (China, a reinvigorated Russia).<br />

<strong>2. Overstretch – COIN causes an over-interventionist state that exhausts us</strong><br />

<br />
This episode indicates the extent of the confusion over counterterrorism (CT) and counterinsurgency (COIN) that marks the contemporary debate over Afghanistan. Both CT and COIN would envisage military action in Afghanistan, but to very different ends. A CT mission would focus exclusively on Al-Qaeda while offering little or no support to the Karzai government; a COIN mission envisages a comprehensive commitment to defeating the Taleban and rebuilding the Afghan state while destroying Al-Qaeda operatives there. Yet it has now become commonplace for politicians and military officials alike to mention CT and COIN in the same breath, or to treat them as if they were functionally equivalent. The official US government definition now frames counterterrorism in classic ‘hearts and minds’ counterinsurgency language: ‘actions taken directly against terrorist networks and indirectly to influence and render global and regional environments inhospitable to terrorist networks’.12 Terrorist threats are now regularly described as insurgencies and vice versa. The influential US Army and Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual states that ‘today’s operational environment also includes a new kind of insurgency, one which seeks to impose revolutionary change worldwide. Al-Qaeda is a well known example of such an insurgency.’13 An official from US Central Command (CENTCOM), for instance, has gone so far to define counterterrorism as a ‘whole of government COIN’ approach.14 Meanwhile, insurgent threats in places such as Chechnya, Indonesia and Thailand are now regularly redescribed as terrorist threats, as analysts speculate on whether local conflicts will become magnets for Al-Qaeda or otherwise spill out into acts of horrific violence on the international stage.<br />
This confusion over the differences between counterterrorism and counterinsurgency is not new, but it has become more serious over the last eight years.15 Since the events of September 11, these concepts have regularly been conflated as policy-makers have struggled to come to grips with the threat posed by Al-Qaeda. To some extent, this is natural: Al-Qaeda is a global terrorist organization which intervenes directly in local conflicts (often insurgencies, defined here as organized violent attempts to overthrow an existing government) to bait the US and its allies into exhausting wars of attrition. In other words, it is a terrorist organization which dabbles (sometimes successfully, sometimes less so) in insurgencies. But the fact that the threats of terrorism and insurgency are so often intertwined in contemporary conflicts does not make them fundamentally equivalent or susceptible to the same remedies. Nor does it warrant extending counterinsurgency operations on a global level, as some prominent authors have suggested.16 The fusion of the threats from terrorism and insurgency, so often described as symptomatic of the complexity of the modern security challenges, can be misread to imply that the responses to them should be similar or equivalent. In fact, while intermixed in practice, these threats remain distinct, and require a policy response which disaggregates and prioritizes threats and separates those actors who have a negotiable political programme from those who remain incorrigible.<br />
Similarly, the fact that terrorists and insurgents operate in the same theatre, and in some cases function in tandem, is not an argument for a response that seamlessly interweaves elements of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency. Indeed, there is no reason to assume that counterterrorism and counterinsurgency strategies are fully compatible or mutually reinforcing. The record of the war in Afghanistan suggests rather that both models of warfare involve tradeoffs or costs that may offset the gains made by the other. Unless these tradeoffs are properly managed, the simultaneous deployment of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations may operate at cross-purposes and make long-term strategic success more elusive. The fact that US and UK leaders have been so willing to split the difference between counterterrorism and counterinsurgency—and to ignore the offsetting costs of each—may help to account for the current painful stalemate in Afghanistan.<br />
This article will argue that counterterrorism and counterinsurgency are two distinct models of war which can operate at cross-purposes when jointly applied to low-intensity conflicts such as that in Afghanistan. The conflation of these two different models of warfare stems from an intellectual error, which assumes that a fused threat (for example, between a nationalist insurgent group like the Taleban and a transnational terrorist group like Al-Qaeda) must necessarily be met by a joint or blended counterterrorism and counterinsurgency approach. In fact, these two models of warfare involve divergent assumptions about the roles of force, the importance of winning support among the local population, and the necessity of building a strong and representative government. Such approaches are not necessarily mutually reinforcing or even compatible. At the tactical and strategic level, there are at least four possible offsetting costs—popular backlash, countermobilization of enemy networks, a legitimacy gap and diminished leverage—that may be incurred when counterterrorism and counterinsurgency are deployed simultaneously. At the political level, the conflation of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency risks producing an overly interventionist foreign policy which distracts and exhausts the US and UK as they treat an ever-increasing number of localized insurgencies as the incubators of future terrorist threats. <br />
Finally, this emphasis on a fused threat between terrorists and insurgents can incorrectly imply that the response must also draw in equal measure on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency strategy. Such an approach tends to see each emerging terrorist threat as a new front in a global counterinsurgency effort and imply that the US and its allies need to be concerned with winning the ‘hearts and minds’ of the local populations to prevent its development. This is a fundamentally offensive approach in which the US and its allies need to take the fight to the terrorists wherever they may be while simultaneously persuading the Muslim world to reject Al-Qaeda and its political programme. The obvious risk of such an approach is that it will lead to strategic overreach, especially if the US winds up fighting small wars and engaging in costly nation-building as a method of preventing Al-Qaeda from gaining ground in distant conflicts.<br />
As an example of this danger, consider the conflation of terrorism and insurgency that marked the discussion over the failed attack on a US airline on 25 December 2009. Reports that the failed bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, had received instruction in explosives from Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) immediately raised questions about whether American combat operations would be needed to fight Al-Qaeda-linked insurgents in Yemen. In the US, Senator Joseph Lieberman called Yemen ‘tomorrow’s war’ and urged pre-emptive action against Al-Qaeda operatives there.38 An alternative chorus of voices insisted that additional US funds and civilian trainers would be needed to improve the security forces and governance in that remote country.39 The fact that AQAP activity was intertwined with the tribal revolts which had been threatening the stability of the country appeared to lend superficial support to a quasi-counterinsurgency approach as a way to deal with the threat posed by Al-Qaeda in the peninsula. But the attempted attack was a terrorist act on a US-bound flight from Europe by an African citizen. It is entirely unclear whether improving policing capacity and governance in Yemen would have interrupted the attack, which was carried by a small number of operatives with only limited ties to the local community. The conflation of threats meant that the US looked like sleepwalking into a quasi-COIN strategy in that country, potentially assuming responsibility for areas that may have been irrelevant to Abdulmutallab’s ability to launch a terrorist attack. Worse still, such an expanded role would be viewed with hostility by the local population, which is already suspicious of American encroachment on the country.40 Because current policy is premised on the intellectual error that an interlinked threat demands a comprehensive response, and specifically on the notion that terrorism can be solved through counterinsurgency techniques, US strategy tends to drift towards counterinsurgency—and overextension in foreign conflicts—when a more limited counterterrorism response might be more appropriate.<br />

While such a conclusion has merit, COIN operations are tremendously costly. In terms of personnel, one counter-insurgent per fifty persons in the population is considered a minimum force for effective COIN (this would suggest that nearly 700,000 troops are needed to secure Afghanistan). Many insurgents have economic motivations, requiring significant outlays of development assistance. This is further complicated by the vast array of ungoverned spaces where extremists might seek refuge--places like Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan, the Sudan, Gaza, Aceh and Kashmir to name just a handful. The Unites States budget deficit now checks in at $13 trillion. The conflict in Iraq runs an estimated $720 million each day while the effort in Afghanistan has been estimated at $82 million per day. Though the buzzwords of ungoverned spaces and COIN have been thrown about less frequently by the current administration, the concepts still clearly inform the debate--yet they are costly in blood and treasure. Examination of intransigent insurgencies such as the Kurdistan Workers Party, The Shining Path and Chechen/North Caucuses groups should demonstrate the long term challenge of defeating such movements. We do well to remember that many analysts attribute the fiscal collapse of the Soviet Union to overextension in their own Afghan occupation. The United States cannot afford such costly long term commitments.<br />

<strong>The U.S. government is incurring debt at a historically unprecedented and ultimately unsustainable rate. The Congressional Budget Office projects that within ten years, federal debt could reach 90 percent of GDP, and even this estimate is probably too optimistic given the low rates of economic growth that the United States is experiencing and likely to see for years to come. The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff paper comes closer to the mark by projecting that federal debt could equal total GDP as soon as 2015. These levels approximate the relative indebtedness of Greece and Italy today. Leaving aside the period during and immediately after World War II, the United States has not been so indebted since recordkeeping began, in 1792. Right now, with dollar interest rates low and the currency more or less steady, this fiscal slide is more a matter of conversation than concern. But this calm will not last. As the world's biggest borrower and the issuer of the world's reserve currency, the United States will not be allowed to spend ten years leveraging itself to these unprecedented levels. If U.S. leaders do not act to curb this debt addiction, then the global capital markets will do so for them, forcing a sharp and punitive adjustment in fiscal policy' The result will be an age of American austerity. No category of federal spending will be spared, including entitlements and defense. Taxes on individuals and businesses will be raised. Economic growth, both in the United States and around the world, will suffer. There will be profound consequences, not just for Americans' standard of living but also for U.S. foreign policy and the coming era of international relations.</strong><br />
<strong>A related cost of the United States' debt has even greater consequences: the diminished appeal of the American model of market-based capitalism. Foreign policy is carried out as much by a country's image as it is by its deeds. And the example of a thriving economy and high living standards based on such capitalism was a powerful instrument of American power, especially during the Cold War, when the American model was competing with Soviet-style communism around the world.</strong><br />
<strong>Now, however, the competition comes from Chinese-style authoritarianism: a top-heavy political system married to a directed and hybrid form of capitalism. The recent stellar performance of China's economy in the midst of Western economic troubles has enhanced the appeal of its system. Reinforcing this trend is the reality that the U.S. approach (one associated with a system of little oversight and regulation) is widely seen as risk-prone and discredited after the recent financial crisis. If the United States is unable to address its own debt crisis and a solution is forced on it, then the appeal of democracy and market-based capitalism will take a further blow.</strong><br />
<strong>Shrinking budgets are likely to have an even greater impact on the future of the U.S. role in Afghanistan. The war there is now more than twice as expensive as the war in Iraq, and the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan has been increasing. Obama has pledged to begin drawing down U.S. forces there this coming July, but the signs are growing that any initial drawdown in U.S. force levels may be a token one.</strong><br />
<strong>Unknown are the pace of any subsequent reductions and the scale of any residual force. But a U.S. military presence in Afghanistan at or close to 100,000 soldiers will cost around $100 billion a year. The coming fiscal austerity and the need to find cost savings in the defense sphere argue against maintaining that expense. Indeed, economic and strategic arguments both call into question the counterinsurgency approach of fighting the Taliban and the nation-building approach of investing heavily in the development of the Afghan government's capabilities and institutions. They suggest a more modest counterterrorism approach: going after the terrorists directly with drones, cruise missiles, and special forces, much as the United States is doing in Yemen and Somalia.</strong><br />

Decline causes the US to become uncooperative and desperate – hegemonic wars will ensue <br />
Goldstein ‘7 <strong>- Professor of Global Politics and International Relations @ University of Pennsylvania [Avery Goldstein, “Power transitions, institutions, and China's rise in East Asia: Theoretical expectations and evidence,” Journal of Strategic Studies, Volume 30, Issue 4 &amp; 5 August 2007, pages 639 – 682]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Two closely related, though distinct, theoretical arguments focus explicitly on the consequences for international politics of a shift in power between a dominant state and a rising power. In War and Change in World Politics, Robert Gilpin suggested that peace prevails when a dominant state’s capabilities enable it to ‘govern’ an international order that it has shaped. Over time, however, as economic and technological diffusion proceeds during eras of peace and development, other states are empowered. Moreover, the burdens of international governance drain and distract the reigning hegemon, and challengers eventually emerge who seek to rewrite the rules of governance. As the power advantage of the erstwhile hegemon ebbs, it may become desperate enough to resort to the ultima ratio of international politics, force, to forestall the increasingly urgent demands of a rising challenger. Or as the power of the challenger rises, it may be tempted to press its case with threats to use force. It is the rise and fall of the great powers that creates the circumstances under which major wars, what Gilpin labels ‘hegemonic wars’, break out.13 Gilpin’s argument logically encourages pessimism about the implications of a rising China. It leads to the expectation that international trade, investment, and technology transfer will result in a steady diffusion of American economic power, benefiting the rapidly developing states of the world, including China. As the US simultaneously scurries to put out the many brushfires that threaten its far-flung global interests (i.e., the classic problem of overextension), it will be unable to devote sufficient resources to maintain or restore its former advantage over emerging competitors like China. While the erosion of the once clear American advantage plays itself out, the US will find it ever more difficult to preserve the order in Asia that it created during its era of preponderance. The expectation is an increase in the likelihood for the use of force – either by a Chinese challenger able to field a stronger military in support of its demands for greater influence over international arrangements in Asia, or by a besieged American hegemon desperate to head off further decline. Among the trends that alarm those who would look at Asia through the lens of Gilpin’s theory are China’s expanding share of world trade and wealth (much of it resulting from the gains made possible by the international economic order a dominant US established); its acquisition of technology in key sectors that have both civilian and military applications (e.g., information, communications, and electronics linked with to forestall, and the challenger becomes increasingly determined to realize the transition to a new international order whose contours it will define. the ‘revolution in military affairs’); and an expanding military burden for the US (as it copes with the challenges of its global war on terrorism and especially its struggle in Iraq) that limits the resources it can devote to preserving its interests in East Asia.14 Although similar to Gilpin’s work insofar as it emphasizes the importance of shifts in the capabilities of a dominant state and a rising challenger, the power-transition theory A. F. K. Organski and Jacek Kugler present in The War Ledger focuses more closely on the allegedly dangerous phenomenon of ‘crossover’– the point at which a dissatisfied challenger is about to overtake the established leading state.15 In such cases, when the power gap narrows, the dominant state becomes increasingly desperate. Though suggesting why a rising China may ultimately present grave dangers for international peace when its capabilities make it a peer competitor of America, Organski and Kugler’s power-transition theory is less clear about the dangers while a potential challenger still lags far behind and faces a difficult struggle to catch up. This clarification is important in thinking about the theory’s relevance to interpreting China’s rise because a broad consensus prevails among analysts that Chinese military capabilities are at a minimum two decades from putting it in a league with the US in Asia.16 Their theory, then, points with alarm to trends in China’s growing wealth and power relative to the United States, but especially looks ahead to what it sees as the period of maximum danger – that time when a dissatisfied China could be in a position to overtake the US on dimensions believed crucial for assessing power. Reports beginning in the mid-1990s that offered extrapolations suggesting China’s growth would give it the world’s largest gross domestic product (GDP aggregate, not per capita) sometime in the first few decades of the twentieth century fed these sorts of concerns about a potentially dangerous challenge to American leadership in Asia.17 The huge gap between Chinese and American military capabilities (especially in terms of technological sophistication) has so far discouraged prediction of comparably disquieting trends on this dimension, but inklings of similar concerns may be reflected in occasionally alarmist reports about purchases of advanced Russian air and naval equipment, as well as concern that Chinese espionage may have undermined the American advantage in nuclear and missile technology, and speculation about the potential military purposes of China’s manned space program.18 Moreover, because a dominant state may react to the prospect of a crossover and believe that it is wiser to embrace the logic of preventive war and act early to delay a transition while the task is more manageable, Organski and Kugler’s power-transition theory also provides grounds for concern about the period prior to the possible crossover.19 pg. 647-650</strong><br />

Unipolarity solves positional competition and war – key to bargainning <br />
Wohlforth ‘9 <strong>– Professor of government @ Dartmouth College (William C., January 2009, “Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War,” World Politics, Volume 61, Number 1, Pg. 33-35)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Second, I question the dominant view that status quo evaluations are relatively independent of the distribution of capabilities. If the status of states depends in some measure on their relative capabilities, and if states derive utility from status, then different distributions of capabilities may affect levels of satisfaction, just as different income distributions may affect levels of status competition in domestic settings. 6 Building on research in psychology and sociology, I argue that even capabilities distributions among major powers foster ambiguous status hierarchies, which generate more dissatisfaction and clashes over the status quo. And the more stratified the distribution of capabilities, the less likely such status competition is.</strong><br />
<strong>Unipolarity thus generates far fewer incentives than either bipolarity or multipolarity for direct great power positional competition over status. Elites in the other major powers continue to prefer higher status, but in a unipolar system they face comparatively weak incentives to translate that preference into costly action. And the absence of such incentives matters because social status is a positional good—something whose value depends on how much one has in relation to others.7 “If everyone has high status,” Randall Schweller notes, “no one does.”8 While one actor might increase its status, all cannot simultaneously do so. High status is thus inherently scarce, and competitions for status tend to be zero sum.9</strong><br />
<strong>I begin by describing the puzzles facing predominant theories that status competition might solve. Building on recent research on social identity and status seeking, I then show that under certain conditions the ways decision makers identify with the states they represent may prompt them to frame issues as positional disputes over status in a social hierarchy. I develop hypotheses that tailor this scholarship to the domain of great power politics, showing how the probability of status competition is likely to be linked to polarity. The rest of the article investigates whether there is sufficient evidence for these hypotheses to warrant further refinement and testing. I pursue this in three ways: by showing that the theory advanced here is consistent with what we know about large-scale patterns of great power conflict through history; by [End Page 30] demonstrating that the causal mechanisms it identifies did drive relatively secure major powers to military conflict in the past (and therefore that they might do so again if the world were bipolar or multipolar); and by showing that observable evidence concerning the major powers’ identity politics and grand strategies under unipolarity are consistent with the theory’s expectations.</strong><br />
<strong>Puzzles of Power and War</strong><br />
<strong>Recent research on the connection between the distribution of capabilities and war has concentrated on a hypothesis long central to systemic theories of power transition or hegemonic stability: that major war arises out of a power shift in favor of a rising state dissatisfied with a status quo defended by a declining satisfied state.10 Though they have garnered substantial empirical support, these theories have yet to solve two intertwined empirical and theoretical puzzles—each of which might be explained by positional concerns for status.</strong><br />
<strong>First, if the material costs and benefits of a given status quo are what matters, why would a state be dissatisfied with the very status quo that had abetted its rise? The rise of China today naturally prompts this question, but it is hardly a novel situation. Most of the best known and most consequential power transitions in history featured rising challengers that were prospering mightily under the status quo. In case after case, historians argue that these revisionist powers sought recognition and standing rather than specific alterations to the existing rules and practices that constituted the order of the day.</strong><br />
<strong>In each paradigmatic case of hegemonic war, the claims of the rising power are hard to reduce to instrumental adjustment of the status quo. In R. Ned Lebow’s reading, for example, Thucydides’ account tells us that the rise of Athens posed unacceptable threats not to the security or welfare of Sparta but rather to its identity as leader of the Greek world, which was an important cause of the Spartan assembly’s vote for war.11 The issues that inspired Louis XIV’s and Napoleon’s dissatisfaction with the status quo were many and varied, but most accounts accord [End Page 31] independent importance to the drive for a position of unparalleled primacy. In these and other hegemonic struggles among leading states in post-Westphalian Europe, the rising challenger’s dissatisfaction is often difficult to connect to the material costs and benefits of the status quo, and much contemporary evidence revolves around issues of recognition and status.12</strong><br />
<strong>Wilhemine Germany is a fateful case in point. As Paul Kennedy has argued, underlying material trends as of 1914 were set to propel Germany’s continued rise indefinitely, so long as Europe remained at peace.13 Yet Germany chafed under the very status quo that abetted this rise and its elite focused resentment on its chief trading partner—the great power that presented the least plausible threat to its security: Great Britain. At fantastic cost, it built a battleship fleet with no plausible strategic purpose other than to stake a claim on global power status.14 Recent historical studies present strong evidence that, far from fearing attacks from Russia and France, German leaders sought to provoke them, knowing that this would lead to a long, expensive, and sanguinary war that Britain was certain to join.15 And of all the motivations swirling round these momentous decisions, no serious historical account fails to register German leaders’ oft-expressed yearning for “a place in the sun.”</strong><br />
<strong>The second puzzle is bargaining failure. Hegemonic theories tend to model war as a conflict over the status quo without specifying precisely what the status quo is and what flows of benefits it provides to states.16 Scholars generally follow Robert Gilpin in positing that the underlying issue concerns a “desire to redraft the rules by which relations among nations work,” “the nature and governance of the system,” and “the distribution of territory among the states in the system.”17 If these are the [End Page 32] issues at stake, then systemic theories of hegemonic war and power transition confront the puzzle brought to the fore in a seminal article by James Fearon: what prevents states from striking a bargain that avoids the costs of war? 18 Why can’t states renegotiate the international order as underlying capabilities distributions shift their relative bargaining power?</strong><br />
<strong>Fearon proposed that one answer consistent with strict rational choice assumptions is that such bargains are infeasible when the issue at stake is indivisible and cannot readily be portioned out to each side. Most aspects of a given international order are readily divisible, however, and, as Fearon stressed, “both the intrinsic complexity and richness of most matters over which states negotiate and the availability of linkages and side-payments suggest that intermediate bargains typically will exist.”19 Thus, most scholars have assumed that the indivisibility problem is trivial, focusing on two other rational choice explanations for bargaining failure: uncertainty and the commitment problem.20 In the view of many scholars, it is these problems, rather than indivisibility, that likely explain leaders’ inability to avail themselves of such intermediate bargains.</strong><br />
<strong>Yet recent research inspired by constructivism shows how issues that are physically divisible can become socially indivisible, depending on how they relate to the identities of decision makers.21 Once issues surrounding the status quo are framed in positional terms as bearing on the disputants’ relative standing, then, to the extent that they value their standing itself, they may be unwilling to pursue intermediate bargaining solutions. Once linked to status, easily divisible issues that theoretically provide opportunities for linkages and side payments of various sorts may themselves be seen as indivisible and thus unavailable as avenues for possible intermediate bargains.</strong><br />
<strong>The historical record surrounding major wars is rich with evidence suggesting that positional concerns over status frustrate bargaining: expensive, protracted conflict over what appear to be minor issues; a propensity on the part of decision makers to frame issues in terms of relative rank even when doing so makes bargaining harder; decision-makers’ [End Page 33] inability to accept feasible divisions of the matter in dispute even when failing to do so imposes high costs; demands on the part of states for observable evidence to confirm their estimate of an improved position in the hierarchy; the inability of private bargains to resolve issues; a frequently observed compulsion for the public attainment of concessions from a higher ranked state; and stubborn resistance on the part of states to which such demands are addressed even when acquiescence entails limited material cost.</strong><br />
<strong>The literature on bargaining failure in the context of power shifts remains inconclusive, and it is premature to take any empirical pattern as necessarily probative. Indeed, Robert Powell has recently proposed that indivisibility is not a rationalistic explanation for war after all: fully rational leaders with perfect information should prefer to settle a dispute over an indivisible issue by resorting to a lottery rather than a war certain to destroy some of the goods in dispute. What might prevent such bargaining solutions is not indivisibility itself, he argues, but rather the parties’ inability to commit to abide by any agreement in the future if they expect their relative capabilities to continue to shift.22 This is the credible commitment problem to which many theorists are now turning their attention. But how it relates to the information problem that until recently dominated the formal literature remains to be seen.23</strong><br />
<strong>The larger point is that positional concerns for status may help account for the puzzle of bargaining failure. In the rational choice bargaining literature, war is puzzling because it destroys some of the benefits or flows of benefits in dispute between the bargainers, who would be better off dividing the spoils without war. Yet what happens to these models if what matters for states is less the flows of material benefits themselves than their implications for relative status? The salience of this question depends on the relative importance of positional concern for status among states.</strong><br />
<strong>Do Great Powers Care about Status?</strong><br />
<strong>Mainstream theories generally posit that states come to blows over an international status quo only when it has implications for their security or material well-being. The guiding assumption is that a state’s satisfaction [End Page 34] with its place in the existing order is a function of the material costs and benefits implied by that status.24 By that assumption, once a state’s status in an international order ceases to affect its material wellbeing, its relative standing will have no bearing on decisions for war or peace. But the assumption is undermined by cumulative research in disciplines ranging from neuroscience and evolutionary biology to economics, anthropology, sociology, and psychology that human beings are powerfully motivated by the desire for favorable social status comparisons. This research suggests that the preference for status is a basic disposition rather than merely a strategy for attaining other goals.25 People often seek tangibles not so much because of the welfare or security they bring but because of the social status they confer. Under certain conditions, the search for status will cause people to behave in ways that directly contradict their material interest in security and/or prosperity.</strong><br />

Collapse causes global nuclear war<br />
Müller ‘8 <strong>(Harold, Director – Peace Research Institute and Professor of International Relations – Frankfurt University, “The Future of Nuclear Weapons in an Interdependent World”, Washington Quarterly, Spring, Lexis)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A power transition creates dangerous times. 9 Most challenges to a hegemon in world history, whether successful or not, have precipitated war or a series of wars. Today's interdependence will surely serve to make great powers cautious about armed conflict, but it cannot completely guarantee such a conflict will not occur. Bones of contention exist, notably between the United States and China: Taiwan, the South China Sea, and the competition for Persian Gulf and Central Asian energy resources. Although there exists a naive belief that great-power war has been eliminated as a possibility in world politics, exaggerated complacency could become extremely dangerous. Interdependence itself and advanced weaponry, nuclear weapons included, would mean that a violent contest among the big powers would be an unmitigated catastrophe. The relationships among those powers must be carefully managed if a clash is to be avoided, and nuclear weapons reductions are an essential contribution to this management.</strong><br />

Counterterrorism will maintain US influence and solve legitimacy <br />
Simon and Stevenson ’9 <strong>* adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, AND</strong> Professor of Strategic Studies at the US Naval War College, (Steven and Jonathan, “Afghanistan: How Much is Enough?” Survival, 51:5, 47 – 67, October 2009 <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3084:http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409" rel="nofollow">http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3084 -->)<br />
<br />
An effort on that scale would garner majority US domestic support only if the public sees likely victory and Congress, the White House and the Beltway punditry line up decisively behind the policy. The emerging trends are pointing in the contrary direction. As monthly and annual US casualties in Afghanistan reached historical peaks in August 2009, and the Afghan national election loomed, a poll conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post indicated that most Americans did not support an extended US military commitment in Afghanistan.31 Congressional Democrats are balking at anticipated requests for more troops.32 And even conservative columnists, like the influential George F. Will, have turned against a maximalist Afghanistan policy.33 Overall, increasingly strong perceptions of the Karzai government as inept and corrupt are making prospects that the United States could enlist it as an effective counter-insurgency partner and lend it the legitimacy required to rebuild the country seem more and more baseless.<br />
The upshot is that only if the United States establishes a well-calibrated limited policy now will it have the political flexibility to sustain it over the longer-term and thereby to effectively contain the jihadist threat in Central Asia. If, on the other hand, the Obama administration promises more than it can deliver in Afghanistan, a reprise of Vietnam may occur: once failure becomes clear, domestic support will evaporate, the administration will be compelled to withdraw precipitously, and the United States will lose considerable traction in the region.<br />
Congressional democrats are balking at anticipated requests for more troops<br />
These factors suggest that the United States should limit its Afghanistan/Pakistan policy to counter-terrorism and disown country-wide counterinsurgency and state-building in Afghanistan. At the same time, Washington must remain highly sensitive to the dynamic whereby decreased military activity in Afghanistan combined with robust operations in Pakistan could induce al-Qaeda to return to Afghanistan and render it a main threat once again. In that light, any abrupt wholesale American military withdrawal from Afghanistan would be too risky. Instead, the United States should seek to facilitate a glide-path to a substantial drawdown - and with it fewer casualties and lower expenditures in Afghanistan - over the next few years.<br />
Doing so would involve continuing to suppress al-Qaeda in Pakistan with selective and discriminate drone strikes and denying al-Qaeda access to Afghanistan. The former would require bases within Afghan territory from which to deploy airpower and special-operations forces against terrorists and terrorist infrastructure, as well as the troops and equipment to secure these bases. The latter would call for reinforced border security and force protection within Afghanistan, which in themselves would entail a surprisingly large number of soldiers. For these purposes, the United States would continue to bring extensive human intelligence and surveillance capabilities to bear on Afghanistan to detect and assess potential threats to American interests. To mitigate and eliminate such threats, the generous deployment of US special-operations forces to Afghanistan - which currently comprises some 50% of all US special-operations personnel - would have to be maintained over the medium term. Meanwhile, US train-and-equip programmes for Afghan security forces should be intensified in contemplation of a gradual and controlled hand-off of the domestic counter-terrorism mission to them when they are ready, as well as to prepare them for counterinsurgency operations, should the Afghan government wish to use them for that purpose.<br />
The United States should also provide strong political and economic support for the Afghan government, which is likely to remain under Karzai once the votes of the 20 August election are counted and certified. Kabul, however, should be left to take the lead in managing its relationship with the Taliban (as well as anti-narcotics policy). With US encouragement, the Karzai government should make it clear to Pashtuns in the southern and eastern parts of the country that if they support insurgents or terrorists aiming to destabilise the Afghan or Pakistani governments, they will suffer financially and militarily. Again, some US forces would be needed to give such arrangements teeth, but not at the levels required for an all-out counter-insurgency. American insurance against a militant Islamist coup or an uncontrollable level of destabilisation also should be left in place. This could entail a standby stabilisation force with tactical air capabilities based in or near Kabul, along with a robust quick-reaction force.<br />
That policy would reflect the reality that a deeply committed counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan is potentially counterproductive, probably unwinnable and in any event unnecessary. The United States can protect its interests and fulfil its international security obligations with a far more circumscribed counter-terrorism effort focused on Pakistan. Under such an approach, US policy would recognise Afghanistan as the residual problem that it has, in fact, become.<br />

<strong>Military bias over the war has spread to the White House – killing credibility</strong><br />
<strong>Cohen 12/29</strong> (Michael Cohen, Senior Fellow at the American Security Project, serves on the board of the National Security Network and has taught at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, served in the U.S. Department of State, former Senior Vice President at the strategic communications firm of Robinson, Lerer and Montgomery, bachelor’s degree in international relations from American University and a master’s degree from Columbia University, “The White House’s Growing ‘Credibility Gap’ on Afghanistan,” 12/29/10)<br />
<br />
Since then, things on this front have only gotten worse and the credibility gap has extended from the Pentagon to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In recent weeks, the Obama Administration has followed the military's lead by putting out a number of optimistic statements about the war in Afghanistan that, as difficult as it is to say, are misleading the American people about the actual security situation in Afghanistan.<br />
First there was the White House's Afghan Strategy Review, which made the following assertions:<br />
in Afghanistan, the momentum achieved by the Taliban in recent years has been arrested in much of the country and reversed in some key areas.<br />
The surge in coalition military and civilian resources, along with an expanded special operations forces targeting campaign and expanded local security measures at the village level, has reduced overall Taliban influence and arrested the momentum they had achieved in recent years in key parts of the country.<br />
In Afghanistan last month, President Obama said;<br />
&quot;Today we can be proud that there are fewer areas under Taliban control and more Afghans have a chance to build a more hopeful future.&quot;<br />
And Secretary Gates was even more specific:<br />
&quot;As a result of the tough fight under way, the Taliban control far less territory today than they did a year ago.&quot;<br />
Nowhere in the review, and as near I can tell, the remarks of Gates and Obama is it reflected that in many parts of the country the security situation has actually deteriorated or that Afghan civilian deaths have increased significantly over the past year.<br />
In fact, the statements above are contradicted by a litany of facts that offer a far more pessimistic view on the progress of the war. In fact, over the past week or so there have been several major pieces of evidence that demonstrate the extent to which the US military and now the White House are misleading the American people about the tenuous security situation in Afghanistan.<br />
First the Wall Street Journal reported on a UN report about security in Afghanistan:<br />
Internal United Nations maps show a marked deterioration of the security situation in Afghanistan during this year's fighting season, countering the Obama administration's optimistic assessments of military progress since the surge of additional American forces began a year ago.<br />
In the October map, just as in March's, virtually all of southern Afghanistan—the focus of the coalition's military offensives—remained painted the red of &quot;very high risk,&quot; with no noted security improvements. At the same time, the green belt of &quot;low risk&quot; districts in northern, central and western Afghanistan shriveled considerably.<br />
The U.N.'s October map upgraded to &quot;high risk&quot; 16 previously more secure districts in Badghis, Sar-e-Pul, Balkh, Parwan, Baghlan, Samangan, Faryab, Laghman and Takhar provinces; only two previously &quot;high risk&quot; districts, one in Kunduz and one in Herat province, received a safer rating.<br />
Today, McClatchy reports on the findings of the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office and in particular its reporting on deterioration in northern Afghanistan: (I heard similar things from their representative in Mazar in September):<br />
&quot;Absolutely, without any reservation, it is our opinion that the situation is a lot more insecure this year than it was last year,&quot; said Nic Lee, the director of the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office, an independent organization that analyzes security dangers for aid groups.<br />
While U.S.-led forces have driven insurgents out of their strongholds in southern Afghanistan, Taliban advances in the rest of the country may have offset those gains, a cross section of year-end estimates suggests.<br />
Insurgent attacks have jumped at least 66 percent this year, according to the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office. Security analysts say that Taliban shadow governors still exert control in all but one of Afghanistan's 34 provinces.<br />
&quot;I can't understand how they can say it is more secure than last year,&quot; said Hashim Mayar, the acting director of the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief, an umbrella group that represents more than 100 Afghan and international aid groups working in Afghanistan. &quot;Insecurity has extended to some parts of the county that were relatively safe last year.&quot;<br />
Perhaps most damningly, a recent Pentagon report to Congress drew similar conclusions:<br />
The insurgency’s capabilities and operational reach have been qualitatively and geographically expanding, as evidenced by a greater frequency and wider dispersion of insurgent-initiated attacks; however, that spread is being increasingly challenged by the ISAF surge forces conducting operations. Despite the increase in ANSF and ISAF capabilities to counter insurgent attacks, the insurgents’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) continue to evolve in sophistication. In addition, the insurgency continues to inhibit the expansion of a legitimate Afghan Government through an effective shadow governance process that provides dispute resolution, rule of law, and other traditional services in a number of areas.<br />
Keep in mind, this is a Pentagon report - and it appears to directly contradict the words of the President and the Secretary of Defense.<br />

&quot;The President is an elected king,&quot; wrote Randolph Bourne nearly a century ago, &quot;but the fact that he is elected has proved to be of far less significance ... than the fact that he is pragmatically a king.&quot; Bourne thereby identified a central truth of modern American politics: Stripped to its essence, our democracy has become an elaborate process of conferring enormous power on a single individual. What we choose to call an inauguration is more accurately a coronation. Nominally a chief executive, the president today occupies a position more akin to that of emperor, and Americans both expect much and demand much of their emperor. To be &quot;the most powerful man in the world&quot; is to be simultaneously worshiped and despised. To occupy the Oval Office is to become the modern-day equivalent of a Sun King, commanding deference, while also becoming the subject of endless gossip, envy, jealousy, and intrigue, all to be reported at length and ad nauseam by Bob Woodward. What lends this arrangement a semblance of legitimacy is the expectation that our president-monarch knows how to wield power effectively. Through the exercise of royal prerogatives, the king demonstrates his worthiness for high office. Should a president demonstrate an absence of mastery — if he comes across as a weakling or a ditherer — profound dysfunction results. Recall the Carter era. Jimmy Carter's inability to resolve the Iran hostage crisis reduced him to a figure of contempt and left Americans with a sense that the country itself was adrift. In short order, they stripped Carter of his crown. Yet presidential weakness — even an inkling of weakness — can have international as well as domestic implications. This is notably the case in matters related to national security. If the occupant of the Oval Office appears less than fully in command, friend and foe alike will wonder who exactly is in charge. Confusion about American priorities and intentions can thereby result. Out of confusion can come miscalculation, as allies revise downward their estimate of American reliability and adversaries persuade themselves that they can get away with mischief. In other words, the implications of weakness extend beyond the who’s up, who’s down preoccupations of garden-variety politics. This confusion describes where we find ourselves today. There is no doubting that President Obama is smart, talented, well intentioned, and smooth as they come. Yet whether he possesses the temperament to govern is fast becoming an open question. Put simply, the question is this: Does Obama have sufficient backbone? The release of Bob Woodward's new book Obama’s Wars has raised this question to new heights. It depicts a president who not only gets rolled but who knows when he is getting rolled and still allows it to happen. With regard to how to proceed on Afghanistan — the most important foreign policy decision to cross Obama’s desk thus far — the president last year demanded that the Pentagon present him with distinctive policy options. The king didn’t want to be handed the solution; he wanted to choose. In fact, however, the members of his court offered him three variations of a single course of action, the one that the Pentagon itself preferred — a textbook example of how the theory of “civilian control” differs from actual practice. Particularly disturbing is the fact that our very smart president understood exactly what was happening. Woodward shows Obama complaining loudly. Having registered that complaint, the president more or less meekly rubber-stamped the policy that the Pentagon was foisting on him. In effect, on Afghanistan he thereby forfeited to others the power to decide. Once Obama endorsed choices made by unelected subordinates, the office of commander-in-chief had acquired additional tenants. That was back in December 2009, of course. Here in October 2010, the Pentagon's preferred plan for Afghanistan shows little sign of succeeding anytime soon. Obama's wariness about escalating the war there — now about to enter its tenth year — looks increasingly sound, which makes his complicity in going along with that escalation all the more damning. Yet perhaps all is not lost — at least not entirely so. The president may yet have one last chance to retrieve the situation and to reverse the impression that he is less than fully in control of his administration. The next Afghanistan &quot;milestone&quot; is a strategic assessment promised for this coming December, one full year after Obama announced his (or the Pentagon's) Afghan surge. The military — General David Petraeus in the vanguard — will exert itself to minimize the importance of this mid-course review. So too will members of the Petraeus Lobby, currently challenging AIPAC, the trial lawyers, the pharmaceutical industry and all the rest of the powerful interest groups vying for preeminence in Washington. You can take it to the bank: The military backed by militarists in mufti will press for more time. They will argue for postponing any serious decisions until July 2011, intending in the mean time to chip away at the president's vaguely stated promise to begin withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan next summer. If Obama wishes to salvage his presidency and demonstrate his capacity to lead and to govern, he will reject that effort. He will instead seize the opportunity presented by the mid-course review. December is the time to render a verdict on the Afghanistan war. If the Afghan surge is still not showing clear signs of success by year's end, waiting another seven months won’t make a difference. December also presents Obama with an opportunity — perhaps his last one — to reverse the impression that he is not fully in control of his own administration. Decisive action just might enable the president to reassure Americans and the rest of the world that he is, after all, up to the job. Should he squander this last opportunity, however, the king is likely to find himself soon thereafter seeking new employment.<br />

<strong>This signals weakness and leads to belligerence</strong><br />
<strong>Bolton ‘9</strong> - Senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute [John R. Bolton (Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations) “The danger of Obama's dithering,” Los Angeles Times, October 18, 2009, pg. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3086:http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/18/opinion/oe-bolton18 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/18/opinion/oe-bolton18" rel="nofollow">http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/18/opinion/oe-bolton18</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3086 -->]<br />
<br />
Weakness in American foreign policy in one region often invites challenges elsewhere, because our adversaries carefully follow diminished American resolve. Similarly, presidential indecisiveness, whether because of uncertainty or internal political struggles, signals that the United States may not respond to international challenges in clear and coherent ways.<br />
Taken together, weakness and indecisiveness have proved historically to be a toxic combination for America's global interests. That is exactly the combination we now see under President Obama. If anything, his receiving the Nobel Peace Prize only underlines the problem. All of Obama's campaign and inaugural talk about &quot;extending an open hand&quot; and &quot;engagement,&quot; especially the multilateral variety, isn't exactly unfolding according to plan. Entirely predictably, we see more clearly every day that diplomacy is not a policy but only a technique. Absent presidential leadership, which at a minimum means clear policy direction and persistence in the face of criticism and adversity, engagement simply embodies weakness and indecision.<br />
Obama is no Harry Truman. At best, he is reprising Jimmy Carter. At worst, the real precedent may be Ethelred the Unready, the turn-of the-first-millennium Anglo-Saxon king whose reputation for indecisiveness and his unsuccessful paying of Danegeld -- literally, &quot;Danish tax&quot; -- to buy off Viking raiders made him history's paradigmatic weak leader.<br />
Beyond the disquiet (or outrage for some) prompted by the president's propensity to apologize for his country's pre-Obama history, Americans increasingly sense that his administration is drifting from one foreign policy mistake to another. Worse, the current is growing swifter, and the threats more pronounced, even as the administration tries to turn its face away from the world and toward its domestic priorities. Foreign observers, friend and foe alike, sense the same aimlessness and drift. French President Nicolas Sarkozy had to remind Obama at a Sept. 24 U.N. Security Council meeting that &quot;we live in the real world, not a virtual one.&quot;<br />
Examples of weakness abound, and the consequences are readily foreseeable.<br />
Canceling the Polish and Czech missile defense bases is understood in Moscow and Eastern European capitals as backing down in the face of Russian bluster and belligerence. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev threatened the day after our 2008 election to deploy missiles targeting these assets unless they were canceled, a threat duly noted by the Russian media when Obama canceled the sites. Given candidate Obama's reaction to the 2008 Russia-Georgia war -- calling on both sides to exercise restraint -- there is little doubt that Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's project to re-extend Russian hegemony over as much of the former Soviet Union as he can will continue apace. Why should he worry about Washington?<br />
Obama's Middle East peace process has stalled, most recently because he set a target for an end to Israeli settlement expansion, couldn't meet it and then proceeded as though he hadn't meant what he said originally. By insisting that Israel freeze settlements as a precondition to renewing Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, Obama drew a clear line. But when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu withstood Obama's pressure, Obama caved, hosting a photo-op with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas that strengthened Netanyahu and weakened Abbas just when Obama wanted to achieve exactly the opposite. However one views the substantive outcome of this vignette, Obama himself looked the weakest of all. It could well be years before his Middle East policy gets back up off the ground.<br />
On nuclear nonproliferation, North Korea responded to the &quot;open hand&quot; of engagement by testing its second nuclear device, continuing an aggressive ballistic missile testing program, cooperating with other rogue states and kidnapping and holding hostage two American reporters. Obama's reaction is to press for more negotiations, which simply encourages Pyongyang to up the ante.<br />
Iran is revealed to have been long constructing an undeclared, uninspected nuclear facility that makes a mockery of almost seven years of European Union negotiation efforts. Forced to deal publicly with this deeply worrying threat, Obama proposes the equivalent of money-laundering for nuclear threats: Iranian uranium enriched in open, unambiguous defiance of four Security Council resolutions will be enriched to higher levels in Russia, and then returned to be burned in a Tehran reactor -- ostensibly for peaceful purposes. Sarkozy again captured the growing international incredulity in his noteworthy Security Council speech: &quot;I support America's 'extended hand.' But what have these proposals for dialogue produced for the international community? Nothing but more enriched uranium and more centrifuges.&quot;<br />
Finally, Obama's agonizing, very public reappraisal of his own 7-month-old Afghanistan policy epitomizes indecisiveness. While there is no virtue in sustaining policy merely for continuity's sake, neither is credit due for too-quickly adopting policies without appreciating the risks entailed and then fleeing precipitously when the risks become manifest. The administration's stated reason for its policy re-evaluation was widespread fraud in Afghanistan's Aug. 20 presidential election. But this explanation is simply not credible. Did not the administration's generals and diplomats on the ground, not to mention United Nations observers, see the election mess coming? Was the Hamid Karzai administration's cupidity and corruption overlooked or ignored during Obama's original review and revision of his predecessor's policy?<br />
The unmistakable inference is that Obama did not carefully think through his March Afghan policy, or did not have full confidence then or now in Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal or Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke, or that it is now politically inconvenient among increasingly antiwar Democrats to follow through on that policy.<br />
None of these explanations reflect credit on the president. He is dithering. Whatever decision Obama reaches on Afghanistan, his credibility and leadership have been badly wounded by his continuing public display of indecisiveness.<br />
Our international adversaries undoubtedly welcome all of these &quot;resets&quot; in U.S. foreign policy, but Americans should be appalled at how much of our posture in the world has already been given away. If Obama's first nine months indicate the direction of the next 39, we still have a long way to fall.<br />

<strong>Multiple scenarios for global war</strong><br />
<strong>Hanson ‘9</strong> – Senior Fellow in Residence in Classics and Military History @ Hoover Institution, Stanford University [Dr. Victor Davis Hanson, “Change, Weakness, Disaster, Obama: Answers from Victor Davis Hanson,” Interview with the Oregon Patriots, Resistnet.com, December 7, 2009 at 3:52pm, pg. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3087:http://www.resistnet.com/group/oregon/forum/topics/change-weakness-disaster-obama/showLastReply --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.resistnet.com/group/oregon/forum/topics/change-weakness-disaster-obama/showLastReply" rel="nofollow">http://www.resistnet.com/group/oregon/forum/topics/change-weakness-disaster-obama/showLastReply</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3087 -->.]<br />
<br />
BC: Are we currently sending a message of weakness to our foes and allies? Can anything good result from President Obama’s marked submissiveness before the world?<br />
Dr. Hanson: Obama is one bow and one apology away from a circus. The world can understand a kowtow gaffe to some Saudi royals, but not as part of a deliberate pattern. Ditto the mea culpas. Much of diplomacy rests on public perceptions, however trivial. We are now in a great waiting game, as regional hegemons, wishing to redraw the existing landscape — whether China, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Syria, etc. — are just waiting to see who’s going to be the first to try Obama — and whether Obama really will be as tenuous as they expect. If he slips once, it will be 1979 redux, when we saw the rise of radical Islam, the Iranian hostage mess, the communist inroads in Central America, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, etc.<br />
BC: With what country then — Venezuela, Russia, Iran, etc. — do you believe his global repositioning will cause the most damage?<br />
Dr. Hanson: I think all three. I would expect, in the next three years, Iran to get the bomb and begin to threaten ever so insidiously its Gulf neighborhood; Venezuela will probably cook up some scheme to do a punitive border raid into Colombia to apprise South America that U.S. friendship and values are liabilities; and Russia will continue its energy bullying of Eastern Europe, while insidiously pressuring autonomous former republics to get back in line with some sort of new Russian autocratic commonwealth. There’s an outside shot that North Korea might do something really stupid near the 38th parallel and China will ratchet up the pressure on Taiwan. India’s borders with both Pakistan and China will heat up. I think we got off the back of the tiger and now no one quite knows whom it will bite or when. <br />

<strong>The plan restores credibility – gives Obama cover</strong><br />
<strong>Stewart, 10</strong> – Professor of the Practice of Human Rights and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard, studied at Oxford and served briefly in the British army before working in the diplomatic service in Indonesia and as British representative to Montenegro (Rory, “Afghanistan: What Could Work”, New York Review of Books, 1/14, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3088:http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jan/14/afghanistan-what-could-work/?page=3 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jan/14/afghanistan-what-could-work/?page=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jan/14/afghanistan-what-could-work/?page=3</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3088 -->)<br />
<br />
But this moderate tone gains Obama the leverage that Bush lacked. As long as the US asserted that Afghanistan was an existential threat, the front line in the war on terror, and that, therefore, failure was not an option, the US had no leverage over Karzai. The worse Afghanistan behaved—the more drugs it grew and terrorists it fostered—the more money it received. If it sorted out its act, it risked being relegated to a minor charitable recipient like Tajikistan. A senior Afghan official warned me this year “to stop referring to us as a humanitarian crisis: we must be the number one terrorist threat in the world, because if we are not we won’t get any money.” By asserting convincingly that Afghanistan is not the be-all and end-all and that the US could always ultimately withdraw, Obama escapes this codependent trap and regains some leverage over the Afghan government. In his politer words:<br />
It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.<br />
But perhaps even more importantly, defining a more moderate and limited strategy gives him leverage over his own generals. By refusing to endorse or use the language of counterinsurgency in the speech, he escapes their doctrinal logic. By no longer committing the US to defeating the Taliban or state-building, he dramatically reduces the objectives and the costs of the mission. By talking about costs, the fragility of public support, and other priorities, he reminds the generals why this surge must be the last. All of this serves to “cap” the troop increases at current levels and provide the justification for beginning to reduce numbers in 2011.<br />
But the brilliance of its moderate arguments cannot overcome that statement about withdrawal. With seven words, “our troops will begin to come home,” he loses leverage over the Taliban, as well as leverage he had gained over Karzai and the generals. It is a cautious, lawyerly statement, expressed again as “[we will] begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011.” It sets no final exit date or numbers. But the Afghan students who were watching the speech with me ignored these nuances and saw it only as departure.<br />
This may be fatal for Obama’s ambition to “open the door” to the Taliban. The lighter, more political, and less but still robust militarized presence that his argument implies could facilitate a deal with the Taliban, if it appeared semi-permanent. As the President asserted, the Taliban are not that strong. They have nothing like the strength or appeal that they had in 1995. They cannot take the capital, let alone recapture the country. There is strong opposition to their presence, particularly in the center and the north of the country. Their only hope is to negotiate. But the Taliban need to acknowledge this. And the only way they will is if they believe that we are not going to allow the Kabul government to collapse.<br />
Afghanistan has been above all a project not of force but of patience. It would take decades before Afghanistan achieved the political cohesion, stability, wealth, government structures, or even basic education levels of Pakistan. A political settlement requires a reasonably strong permanent government. The best argument against the surge, therefore, was never that a US operation without an adequate Afghan government partner would be unable to defeat the Taliban—though it won’t. Nor that the attempt to strengthen the US campaign will intensify resistance, though it may. Nor because such a deployment of over 100,000 troops at a cost of perhaps $100 billion a year would be completely disproportional to the US’s limited strategic interests and moral obligation in Afghanistan—though that too is true.<br />
Instead, Obama should not have requested more troops because doing so intensifies opposition to the war in the US and Europe and accelerates the pace of withdrawal demanded by political pressures at home. To keep domestic consent for a long engagement we need to limit troop numbers and in particular limit our casualties. The surge is a Mephistophelian bargain, in which the President has gained force but lost time.<br />
What can now be done to salvage the administration’s position? Obama has acquired leverage over the generals and some support from the public by making it clear that he will not increase troop strength further. He has gained leverage over Karzai by showing that he has options other than investing in Afghanistan. Now he needs to regain leverage over the Taliban by showing them that he is not about to abandon Afghanistan and that their best option is to negotiate. In short, he needs to follow his argument for a call strategy to its conclusion. The date of withdrawal should be recast as a time for reduction to a lighter, more sustainable, and more permanent presence. This is what the administration began to do in the days following the speech. As National Security Adviser General James Jones said, “That date is a ‘ramp’ rather than a cliff.” And as Hillary Clinton said in her congressional testimony on December 3, their real aim should be to “develop a long-term sustainable relationship with Afghanistan and Pakistan so that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, primarily our abandonment of that region.”<br />
A more realistic, affordable, and therefore sustainable presence would not make Afghanistan stable or predictable. It would be merely a small if necessary part of an Afghan political strategy. The US and its allies would only moderate, influence, and fund a strategy shaped and led by Afghans themselves. The aim would be to knit together different Afghan interests and allegiances sensitively enough to avoid alienating independent local groups, consistently enough to regain their trust, and robustly enough to restore the security and justice that Afghans demand and deserve from a national government.<br />
What would this look like in practice? Probably a mess. It might involve a tricky coalition of people we refer to, respectively, as Islamists, progressive civil society, terrorists, warlords, learned technocrats, and village chiefs. Under a notionally democratic constitutional structure, it could be a rickety experiment with systems that might, like Afghanistan’s neighbors, include strong elements of religious or military rule. There is no way to predict what the Taliban might become or what authority a national government in Kabul could regain. Civil war would remain a possibility. But an intelligent, long-term, and tolerant partnership with the United States could reduce the likelihood of civil war and increase the likelihood of a political settlement. This is hardly the stuff of sound bites and political slogans. But it would be better for everyone than boom and bust, surge and flight. With the right patient leadership, a political strategy could leave Afghanistan in twenty years’ time more prosperous, stable, and humane than it is today. That would be excellent for Afghans and good for the world.<br />
Meanwhile, Obama’s broader strategic argument must not be lost. He has grasped that the foreign policy of the president should not consist in a series of extravagant, brief, Manichaean battles, driven by exaggerated fears, grandiloquent promises, and fragile edifices of doctrine. Instead the foreign policy of a great power should be the responsible exercise of limited power and knowledge in concurrent situations of radical uncertainty. Obama, we may hope, will develop this elusive insight. And then it might become possible to find the right places in which to deploy the wealth, the courage, and the political capital of the United States. We might hope in South Asia, for example, for a lighter involvement in Afghanistan but a much greater focus on Kashmir.<br />

<strong>COIN is failing and the war sucks – multiple experts – plan’s key</strong><br />
<strong>Wood 1/11</strong> – head military correspondent for Politics Daily, holds the 2008 Gerald Ford Prize for Distinguished Reporting on National Defense (David, 2011, &quot;Counterinsurgency Strategy Not Working in Afghanistan, Critics Say,&quot; <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3089:http://www.politicsdaily.com/2011/01/11/counterinsurgency-strategy-not-working-in-afghanistan-critics-s/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.politicsdaily.com/2011/01/11/counterinsurgency-strategy-not-working-in-afghanistan-critics-s/" rel="nofollow">http://www.politicsdaily.com/2011/01/11/counterinsurgency-strategy-not-working-in-afghanistan-critics-s/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3089 -->, RG)<br />
<br />
The counterinsurgency strategy the United States has relied on to win the Afghan war is producing disappointing progress at best and, at worst, is wasting billions of dollars and prolonging the nine-year war, according to a wide range of informed critics. Experts on Afghanistan and on counterinsurgency, among them active-duty and retired military officers, analysts and academics, are pushing to have the U.S. mission in Afghanistan significantly narrowed in scope.<br />
Their message, in brief: Drop the hearts 'n' minds stuff. Go kill the enemy.<br />
It's increasingly clear to the critics, at least, that the enemy is not the Taliban, the local Afghan insurgents. It is, rather, the remnants of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan who continue to plot against the United States.<br />
Sending American soldiers and Marines headlong against Afghanistan's &quot;inadequate governance, corruption, and abuse of power,'' as the most recent guidance of Gen. David Petraeus demands, is too broad, too costly and potentially self-defeating, many critics say.<br />
&quot;Most people in and around policy-making circles agree that the U.S. and NATO missions in Afghanistan should transition away from counterinsurgency and toward a strategy combining counter-terror activities with a train-and-equip mission,'' Andrew M. Exum, a former Army officer and adviser to Petraeus, wrote this week in his counterinsurgency blog.C. Christine Fair, a regional expert and Georgetown University professor, writes that &quot;General David Petraeus' COIN doctrine simply may not apply to Afghanistan.<br />
Whether their suggestions will have any impact is unclear. &quot;People are so set on the current strategy that they become bothered and angry by a serious questioning,'' said a vociferous critic, Army Col. Gian P. Gentile, director of military history at West Point and a two-tour combat veteran of Iraq.<br />
&quot;There are alternatives'' to the current strategy, Gentile said in an interview. &quot;But they are hard to articulate with an Army and senior leaders who've been doing this for nine years and are morally committed to it because we've shed blood and they believe they can make it work.''<br />
With the Obama administration's war strategy being questioned, Vice President Joe Biden (who has advocated abandoning counterinsurgency and focusing only on killing al-Qaeda terrorists) flew into Kabul Monday to confer with Petraeus, commander of U.S. and allied forces, U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and Afghan President Hamid Karzai.<br />
&quot;This is a pivot point in our policy,'' an unnamed senior official confided to reporters aboard Biden's plane en route to Afghanistan Monday. On Tuesday, Biden issued a statement seeming to back away from a full-fledged counterinsurgency strategy. &quot;It is not our intention to govern or nation-build,'' he said. &quot;This is the responsibility of the Afghan government and they are fully capable of it.''<br />
Petraeus, co-author of the 2006 military manual on counterinsurgency, often puts a forward spin on the war, saying that the U.S.-led coalition finally has &quot;all the inputs right,'' meaning he has enough troops (97,000 U.S. and 40,000 European and others), enough civilian advisers and trainers, and the right strategy, to win.<br />
But he and the Obama administration, in what seemed a tacit acknowledgment of slow progress, last November agreed to extend the U.S. and NATO commitment for another four years, through the end of 2014. Previously, Obama had said flatly that in July of this year, &quot;our troops will begin to come home.''<br />
One disconcerting sign of the lack of progress is that tips from the Afghan public about newly emplaced IEDs -- a key indicator of how safe people feel from Taliban retribution -- have declined. According to data released by the Pentagon's Joint IED Defeat Organization, the number of IEDs turned in each month fell from 34 in January 2010 to 12 in May, while U.S. and allied casualties (killed and wounded) by IEDs rose from 174 in January to 284 in May.<br />
Another indication of what's going wrong comes in a recent chilling series in the British newspaper the Guardian. Reporter Gaith Abdul-Ahad talked with key Taliban leaders, including an elderly mid-level Taliban administrator in the eastern city of Khost. He explained a key reason why the U.S. strategy of protecting the people against the Taliban isn't working.<br />
&quot;The government is besieged in its fortresses and can't come to the people, and corruption is paralyzing it,'' the elder told the Guardian. &quot;One of the main reasons for our popularity is the failure of this government.&quot; The Taliban official explained that he supervises local governing councils set up by the Taliban in &quot;liberated'' areas.<br />
&quot;I am a representative of the movement and I walk among the people and everyone knows me,'' the elderly Taliban said. &quot;I move between the people and the commanders, watching the commanders' behavior. I listen to the people and convey the picture to the supreme leaders,&quot; he said.<br />
At home, the strategy debate rumbling across Washington hinges on a critical but unresolved question: When fighting a guerrilla force entrenched within the population, do you win by defeating the bad guys militarily -- killing or capturing their leaders, cutting their supply lines and offering the survivors a safe return to society? Or do you push them away from the population and, by providing security, good government services, education and economic progress, win the population over to the government's side?<br />
Since the U.S. attacked and overthrew the Taliban government in Afghanistan in late 2001, its strategy has wandered back and forth. Lt. Gen. David Barno, who led U.S. forces there from 2003 to 2005, quickly discovered that sending troops out into the countryside on raids wasn't working. &quot;It was putting your fist into a bucket of water and taking it back out again, with very little to no impact on the enemy,'' Barno said in an interview.<br />
Instead, he sent his battalions out to live in critical areas, seeking out and working with local leaders and enabling the first national elections to take place in 2004. (In another depressing sign, more people took part in that election six years ago than in any since.) Barno tripled the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams, from four to 12, to spur economic development and local government.<br />
But that effort to win over the local population didn't continue after Barno left, especially after NATO took over in 2007.<br />
He acknowledged, however, that the promise of &quot;hearts and minds'' counterinsurgency -- that the Americans can bring to local people a dramatically better way of life -- has turned out to be misleading. For many Afghans, life has improved since 2001: More children are in school and security in many areas has tightened. But it is also true that the expectations of most Afghans were &quot;grossly inflated'' when American troops arrived, Barno said. Over the nine years that have followed, the reality of what the United States has delivered &quot;has fallen short,'' he said.<br />
That's the chief problem with the U.S. strategy, according to Amitai Etzione, professor at George Washington University in Washington. By pursuing &quot;in effect a do-over of the social, economic, cultural and political foundations'' of Afghanistan, &quot;one invited failure by setting goals that cannot be reached and by raising expectations that are bound to be disappointed,'' he wrote this month in Joint Forces Quarterly, a professional journal published by the National Defense University.<br />
Among the inherent promises of counterinsurgency that are unrealistic or counterproductive, in the view of Etzione and others: building a strong, secular, democratic and effective central government, cleaning up official corruption, establishing women's rights, creating a Western-style Afghan army, and holding democratic elections as a panacea to Afghanistan's problems.<br />
Building schools for girls, for example, reflects American values -- but alienates large sections of Afghanistan's Pashtun population from which the Taliban insurgency springs.<br />
Expanding, training and equipping the Afghan army make sense, Etzione writes. But requiring Afghan soldiers to carry the American M-16 rifle makes no sense: the Russian-designed Kalashnikov is superior in the local heat and dust, and is familiar and simple enough for new soldiers to use.<br />
Elections, a key part of the U.S. effort, have been divisive occasions, seeming to unite Afghans only in their belief that the process was deeply corrupt. Straining to produce a strong, secular central government makes little sense in a land of strong belief that Islam should govern daily life, and that the best government is local government.<br />
Counterinsurgency is called for in Afghanistan, Etzione concludes. &quot;But if COIN is to work, it must be profoundly recast.'' For a start, he writes, &quot;We should leave the local people to work out what they will tolerate and what they will balk at.''<br />
Two recent studies suggest a different way forward. The Center for a New American Security, a centrist Washington think tank, recommends shifting decisively away from the current large-scale counterinsurgency campaign to focus the military effort on al-Qaeda. Fighting the Taliban should be increasingly a job for the Afghan army and police. U.S. and allied forces could be cut substantially to between 25,000 and 35,000, the CNAS report said.<br />
And the United States should refocus its efforts on helping build local government -- not the central government.<br />
A similar study published this week jointly by the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of War also calls for a refocus on local, not national, government and security forces. The report, co-authored by Fred and Kimberly Kagan, acknowledges that achieving a better balance of power between Kabul and local towns and districts is critical. But that &quot;will be very difficult and it may prove impossible,'' they conclude.<br />
The CNAS report, written by Barno and Exum, also ends on a grim note: &quot;After nine years of inconclusive fighting,'' they write, &quot;all outcomes are likely to be suboptimal for the United States, its allies and the Afghan people.''<br />

<strong>If it is a war against extremists and militancy inside Pakistan, it is a civil war because its origins stem from the US, NATO occupation of neighboring Afghanistan. The conflict should be seen as an extension of the ongoing resistance of the Afghan people to alien domination. It is inaccurate to say that the US invaded Afghanistan because of the 9/11 attacks by Al-Qaeda. Former BBC correspondent George Arney reported on September 18, 2001, that Niaz Naik, the former Pakistani foreign secretary, had told him that he was informed by US officials at a UN-sponsored international contact group on Afghanistan in Berlin during July that year that unless Osama bin Laden were handed over swiftly, America would take military action to kill or capture both Bin Laden and Mullah Omar. The wider objective, however, was to topple the Taliban regime and install a transitional government under King Mohammad Zahir Shah. The invasion was to take place in mid-October 2001. Mr. Naik went on to say that he doubted that the US would have abandoned its plan to invade Afghanistan even if Osama were handed over by the Taliban. Arney's story is corroborated by the Guardian correspondent David Leigh in his report published on September 26, 2001, in which he revealed that the Taliban had received specific warning by the US through secret diplomacy in Berlin in July that the Bush Administration would topple the entire regime militarily unless Osama is extradited to the US. This was part of the larger design of US military, industrial complex to bring about regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran. As the US needed bases in Pakistan to accomplish its pre-planned invasion of Afghanistan, the Bush Administration sought to use Islamabad as a cat's paw to pull the chestnuts out of the fire. Fortunately for President Bush, a usurper ruled there, devoid of all legitimacy, legal and moral, and he readily and willingly succumbed to US pressure and made a U-turn by severing all links with the Taliban. He even joined the war against Afghanistan instead of using his leverage with the Taliban to exhaust all means of peaceful settlement of the dispute. The entire region, including Pakistan, was declared a war zone by the US military command, and the flights of all passenger planes were prohibited over a certain altitude, while no merchant ships could enter the harbors of Pakistan, thus bringing maritime trade (which comprises approximately 95 percent of Pakistan's import-export trade) to a standstill. It is no wonder that Pakistan suffered a loss of 34 billion dollars because of its involvement in the Afghan war. America's War As one can see, it was America's war that was imposed upon Pakistan. Whether Pakistan could have avoided the war is a matter of controversy among politicians and political observers. But the war has fuelled insurgency in Pakistan's hitherto peaceful tribal territory adjacent to Afghanistan. This insurgency shows no sign of abatement, as terrorist attacks on military and civilian centers in the capital and major cities of the North-West Frontier Province and Punjab continue with a vengeance, posing threat to the security of the state. In the meantime, routine predator strikes by the US in Waziristan have taken a heavy toll of civilian lives amid accusations of Islamabad's complicity in the piratical attacks on tribespeople, which prompts them to resort to retaliatory strikes on the perpetrators. Not satisfied with Pakistan's military operations in the tribal region, the US Administration has compelled Islamabad's fragile government to pull out its troops from the tense Indo-Pak border and deploy them in the restive tribal belt along the Pak-Afghan border. Now Pakistan faces existential threat from the Taliban and not India, a perception which the country's military leadership is not prepared to share, given the unresolved disputes with New Delhi, which triggered four wars during the last 62 years. At the same time, speculation (not entirely unfounded) is rife about the involvement of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and the former Blackwater (now christened Xe Services) in murder, mayhem, and gunrunning as evidenced by the armed Americans who drive consulate vehicles through cities and, when intercepted, refuse to disclose their identity. It is here that one recalls with dismay the role of General Stanley McChrystal, who until last year headed the Joint Special Operations Command, which runs drone attacks and targeted assassinations with the assistance of the operatives of the former Blackwater. This was revealed by Jeremy Scahill's investigative report published in the US weekly the Nation. That may, perhaps, solve the mystery surrounding a series of assassinations of ulama belonging to various Islamic movements. The sinister motive behind such acts of terror is to incite sectarian violence in Pakistan and lay the blame at the doors of religious extremists. Similar death squads were organized by the CIA in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to carry out political assassinations of nationalists who were opposed to US intervention. At the time, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua complained to the International Court of Justice about the mining of Nicaraguan ports, the violation of the country's airspace, the killing and kidnapping of individuals on the Nicaraguan territory, and the threat or use of force by the US. The court in its decision in June 1986 held that the US was in breach of the customary rules of international law and international humanitarian law. The above case is titled the &quot;Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua.&quot; The precedent set by this case may be invoked by Pakistan to prevent the US drone attacks on its territory. Once the piratical attacks of the US have stopped, the irritant in the tribal insurgency would have gone, paving the way for pacification of the conflict. If this were Pakistan's war, the government would have exercised its own judgment in dealing with the militants at home, either by conciliation or by resort to force. But Islamabad's so-called operation against militants is subordinated to US military designs in the region, aimed at the encirclement of the People's Republic of China and the control of the transit of gas pipelines from Central Asia to South Asia. It is not aimless that China expressed its concern over the concentration of US, NATO troops in the region. India fits in the American scheme of things, hence the US-India nuclear deal. Pakistan's National Interest In this emerging security environment, Pakistan will have to be content with its role as a junior partner of India. Therefore, the sooner Islamabad extricates itself from the US &quot;war on terror,&quot; the better it is for its security and independence. Doesn't Islamabad realize that its military operation against the militants would leave its border with India vulnerable to a New Delhi offensive? If Pakistan permits the US to attack the suspected training centers of militants on its territory, will it be able to prevent India from doing so? With Islamabad embroiled in internecine strife, it cannot negotiate with India from a position of strength. It may be forced to make a compromise that might be detrimental to its national interest. Pakistan's preoccupation with tribal rebellion would not permit it to deal with separatist ethnic forces in Baluchistan. Undoubtedly, this is a threat to the territorial integrity of Pakistan. After the total failure of the military operation in Baluchistan, the federal government has come round to the painful conclusion that political and not military action can bring militancy to an end. Granting general amnesty to the dissidents and engaging them in a meaningful dialogue on contentious issues is a laudable initiative. The same gesture should be made to the militants in the tribal areas. But Islamabad has adopted double standards in dealing with the Baluchistan militants and the Pashtun militants, as if there were good militants and bad ones. This discriminatory policy would intensify the Pashtun insurgency and might drive them toward even more escalation. The rulers have seen the consequences of military operations in the former East Pakistan, Baluchistan, Karachi, Sind, and FATA (federally administered tribal areas). If anything, the situation has only worsened. The surge of US troops, the expansion of war beyond the borders of Afghanistan, and the attacks on Quetta and Muridke as envisaged by Obama's new strategy would mean that US troops are at war with the people of Pakistan. Any Solution? The Obama Administration would be better advised to concentrate on its exit strategy, and to that end, it is imperative that it involve the UN in its peace-making efforts aimed at the establishment of a broad-based government in Afghanistan, because the Karzai Government has no legitimacy. To fill the vacuum, the UN peacekeeping force, made up of troops of states not involved in the Afghan war, may be deployed until a government of national unity is able to assume full responsibility. Here the US can contribute to the postwar reconstruction of Afghanistan under the aegis of the UN. The insurgency in the tribal region is the spillover effect of US military occupation of Afghanistan, but Pakistan faces a far greater threat: the threat of ethnic violence as manifested in the bloody clashes among various linguistic groups in urban and rural Sind. These have been overshadowed by the counterinsurgency operations in FATA, but they may erupt at any moment, thus destabilizing the state.</strong><br />

<strong>But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with explosives into a jeep filled with troops today, killing five and wounding as many as 21, including several children who were waiting for a ride to school. Residents of the region where the attack took place are fleeing in terror as gunfire rings out around them, and government forces have been unable to quell the violence. Two regional government officials were beheaded by militants in retaliation for the killing of other militants by government forces. As familiar as this sounds, it did not take place where we have come to expect such terrible events. This, unfortunately, is a whole new ballgame. It is part of another conflict that is brewing, one which puts what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan in deep shade, and which represents a grave and growing threat to us all. Pakistan is now trembling on the edge of violent chaos, and is doing so with nuclear weapons in its hip pocket, right in the middle of one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world. The situation in brief: Pakistan for years has been a nation in turmoil, run by a shaky government supported by a corrupted system, dominated by a blatantly criminal security service, and threatened by a large fundamentalist Islamic population with deep ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan. All this is piled atop an ongoing standoff with neighboring India that has been the center of political gravity in the region for more than half a century. The fact that Pakistan, and India, and Russia, and China all possess nuclear weapons and share the same space means any ongoing or escalating violence over there has the real potential to crack open the very gates of Hell itself.</strong><br />
<strong>Recently, the Taliban made a military push into the northwest Pakistani region around the Swat Valley. According to a recent Reuters report: The (Pakistani) army deployed troops in Swat in October 2007 and used artillery and gunship helicopters to reassert control. But insecurity mounted after a civilian government came to power last year and tried to reach a negotiated settlement. A peace accord fell apart in May 2008. After that, hundreds — including soldiers, militants and civilians — died in battles. Militants unleashed a reign of terror, killing and beheading politicians, singers, soldiers and opponents. They banned female education and destroyed nearly 200 girls' schools. About 1,200 people were killed since late 2007 and 250,000 to 500,000 fled, leaving the militants in virtual control. Pakistan offered on February 16 to introduce Islamic law in the Swat valley and neighboring areas in a bid to take the steam out of the insurgency. The militants announced an indefinite cease-fire after the army said it was halting operations in the region. President Asif Ali Zardari signed a regulation imposing sharia in the area last month. But the Taliban refused to give up their guns and pushed into Buner and another district adjacent to Swat, intent on spreading their rule. The United States, already embroiled in a war against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, must now face the possibility that Pakistan could collapse under the mounting threat of Taliban forces there. Military and diplomatic advisers to President Obama, uncertain how best to proceed, now face one of the great nightmare scenarios of our time. &quot;Recent militant gains in Pakistan,&quot; reported The New York Times on Monday, &quot;have so alarmed the White House that the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, described the situation as 'one of the very most serious problems we face.'&quot; &quot;Security was deteriorating rapidly,&quot; reported The Washington Post on Monday, &quot;particularly in the mountains along the Afghan border that harbor al-Qaeda and the Taliban, intelligence chiefs reported, and there were signs that those groups were working with indigenous extremists in Pakistan's populous Punjabi heartland. The Pakistani government was mired in political bickering. The army, still fixated on its historical adversary India, remained ill-equipped and unwilling to throw its full weight into the counterinsurgency fight. But despite the threat the intelligence conveyed, Obama has only limited options for dealing with it. Anti-American feeling in Pakistan is high, and a U.S. combat presence is prohibited. The United States is fighting Pakistan-based extremists by proxy, through an army over which it has little control, in alliance with a government in which it has little confidence.&quot; It is believed Pakistan is currently in possession of between 60 and 100 nuclear weapons. Because Pakistan's stability is threatened by the wide swath of its population that shares ethnic, cultural and religious connections to the fundamentalist Islamic populace of Afghanistan, fears over what could happen to those nuclear weapons if the Pakistani government collapses are very real. &quot;As the insurgency of the Taliban and Al Qaeda spreads in Pakistan,&quot; reported the Times last week, &quot;senior American officials say they are increasingly concerned about new vulnerabilities for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, including the potential for militants to snatch a weapon in transport or to insert sympathizers into laboratories or fuel-production facilities. In public, the administration has only hinted at those concerns, repeating the formulation that the Bush administration used: that it has faith in the Pakistani Army. But that cooperation, according to officials who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity surrounding the exchanges between Washington and Islamabad, has been sharply limited when the subject has turned to the vulnerabilities in the Pakistani nuclear infrastructure.&quot; &quot;The prospect of turmoil in Pakistan sends shivers up the spines of those U.S. officials charged with keeping tabs on foreign nuclear weapons,&quot; reported Time Magazine last month. &quot;Pakistan is thought to possess about 100 — the U.S. isn't sure of the total, and may not know where all of them are. Still, if Pakistan collapses, the U.S. military is primed to enter the country and secure as many of those weapons as it can, according to U.S. officials. Pakistani officials insist their personnel safeguards are stringent, but a sleeper cell could cause big trouble, U.S. officials say.&quot; In other words, a shaky Pakistan spells trouble for everyone, especially if America loses the footrace to secure those weapons in the event of the worst-case scenario. If Pakistani militants ever succeed in toppling the government, several very dangerous events could happen at once. Nuclear-armed India could be galvanized into military action of some kind, as could nuclear-armed China or nuclear-armed Russia. If the Pakistani government does fall, and all those Pakistani nukes are not immediately accounted for and secured, the specter (or reality) of loose nukes falling into the hands of terrorist organizations could place the entire world on a collision course with unimaginable disaster. We have all been paying a great deal of attention to Iraq and Afghanistan, and rightly so. The developing situation in Pakistan, however, needs to be placed immediately on the front burner. The Obama administration appears to be gravely serious about addressing the situation. So should we all.</strong><br />

CT focus key to stabiltiy<br />
Simon and Stevenson ‘9 <strong>– * adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, AND</strong> Professor of Strategic Studies at the US Naval War College, (Steven and Jonathan, “Afghanistan: How Much is Enough?” Survival, 51:5, 47 – 67, October 2009 <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3092:http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409" rel="nofollow">http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a915362559&amp;fulltext=7132409</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3092 -->)<br />

Whatever US officials might concede privately, the White House, State Department and Pentagon have thus far not acknowledged publicly the possibility that greater American intrusiveness in Afghanistan might mean less Pakistani cooperation. That, however, appears to be the case. To be sure, Pakistan has pragmatically responded to US pressure to thwart the Taliban in its tribal areas. But it is more significant in the broader strategic context that Pakistan has objected to expanded US military operations in Afghanistan on two grounds. Firstly, they would cause a cross-border spillover of militants into Pakistan and increase the counter-insurgency burden on the Pakistani military. Secondly, they would foment political instability in Pakistan by intensifying popular perceptions of American military occupation of the region and the Pakistani government’s complicity with the Americans in suppressing a group that was not even considered an enemy of Pakistan. Indeed, in a July briefing, Pakistani officials made it clear that, however concerned the United States was about the Taliban, they still regard India as their top strategic priority and the Taliban militants a little more than a containable nuisance and, in the long term, potential allies.5<br />
In this light, the realistic American objective should not be to ensure Afghanistan’s political integrity by neutralising the Taliban and containing Pakistani radicalism, which is probably unachievable. Rather, its aim should be merely to ensure that al-Qaeda is denied both Afghanistan and Pakistan as operating bases for transnational attacks on the United States and its allies and partners.<br />

<strong>COIN fails in Afghanistan – CT solves all their disads</strong><br />
<strong>Fair 1/11</strong> C. Christine Fair is an assistant professor at Georgetown University and the author of Cuisines of the Axis of Evil and Other Irritating States. (January 11, 2011, C. Christine Fair, “‘Counterterrorism Plus’ Is The Way Forward In Afghanistan”, Foreign Policy, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3093:http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/11/false_choices_in_afghanistan --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/11/false_choices_in_afghanistan" rel="nofollow">http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/11/false_choices_in_afghanistan</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3093 -->) <br />
<br />
Advocates of the current U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan deploy false choices and flawed assumptions to defend the status quo. Proponents of &quot;staying the course&quot; delegitimize the pursuit of better options for ending this deadly nine-year war by reducing the debate to a dubious binary: maintain a long-term counterinsurgency (COIN) campaign against the Taliban or leave Afghanistan after ignominiously &quot;cutting and running.&quot; It is time to reframe this public discourse over the costly status quo and consider a new way forward.<br />
Vice President Joe Biden, who is currently in Afghanistan and headed to Pakistan shortly, has argued, among others, that a policy of &quot;Counterterrorism Plus&quot; will more effectively secure genuine U.S. security objectives. He's right.<br />
This approach calls for a much smaller deployment of forces that would focus upon al-Qaeda, including continued drone attacks on al-Qaeda and international militants both in Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal areas. Proponents of such a plan argue for continuing the training mission of Afghan National Security Forces with a dedicated focus upon sustainability as well as continued and long-term initiatives to develop civilian capacity in the Afghan government. Obviously, this implies a sustained -- albeit a different and perhaps smaller -- U.S. presence in Afghanistan. This is not &quot;cut and run.&quot;<br />
As a proponent of some variant of a &quot;Counterterrorism Plus&quot; approach, I argue that the U.S. enemies are al-Qaeda and international terrorist groups -- not the largely parochial Afghan Taliban. Clearly, the United States must deny al-Qaeda access to Afghanistan. However, U.S. intelligence officials note that this goal largely has been accomplished: only 50 to 100 al-Qaeda operatives are presently in Afghanistan with many more in Pakistan. Yet Washington must work to ensure that Afghanistan does not again become an al-Qaeda sanctuary.<br />
Abandoning the current aggressive COIN effort in favor of an approach targeting terrorists rather than Taliban insurgents would also be welcomed by many Afghans. Polls show that Afghans are increasingly disapproving in their assessment of both the presence and performance of U.S. and NATO forces in their country. Afghan President Hamid Karzai himself requested the United States to decrease the intensity of the conflict and &quot;reduce the intrusiveness into the daily Afghan life.&quot; Contrary to COIN proponents who argue that abandoning COIN will degrade U.S. intelligence about al-Qaeda, intelligence is just as likely to improve as Afghans, who dislike al-Qaeda, may be more open to sharing information when the disliked COIN effort is scaled back and abandoned.<br />
Washington must continue development assistance, investing in Afghan governance capacity and strengthening the Afghan National Security Forces while working vigorously to redress corruption in the Afghan government and in the donor community. To succeed, Washington will need to secure a strategic partnership with Afghanistan that permits the United States to maintain a critical presence in Regional Commands East and South to effectively operate against al-Qaeda and other international terrorists ensconced along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.<br />
Karzai is likely to accede to such a partnership. He wants the COIN campaign to end, but he needs U.S. assistance, fears al-Qaeda, and resents the sanctuaries in Pakistan.<br />
This course of action hinges upon several assumptions that are routinely rebuffed by COIN proponents who have little empirical evidence for their own claims. Each merits genuine debate.<br />
First, today's Taliban -- a confederation of local commanders -- differ from the Taliban of September 10, 2001. The mid-level leadership has been consistently eliminated and replaced. Many of these new commanders were teenagers when Mullah Omar consolidated his organization. Pakistan recognizes that the erstwhile Quetta Shura is a declining asset, that it has little control over this new generation and thus, is struggling to control this emergent &quot;Neo-Taliban.&quot;<br />
COIN's proponents ignore these realities and rehearse the Taliban's refusal to hand over Osama bin Laden some nine years ago. However, other regional experts with decades of experience there believe that many -- by no means all -- Taliban-allied commanders would negotiate away ties with al-Qaeda with an appropriate process of reconciliation. Contrary to popular opinion, al-Qaeda is not present throughout Afghanistan; rather, it is generally rooted in the northern provinces of Kunar and Nuristan and is far removed from the Taliban in the southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar. Those who remain committed to violence would become targets of the invigorated counterterrorism campaign.<br />
Second, this option implicitly assumes that some sort of reconciliation with the Taliban is inevitable if not necessary. While Washington opposes this, it is an exclusively Afghan domestic affair. Washington's only legitimate interest is precluding a return of al-Qaeda. Afghans have an inalienable right to decide their future -- even if it includes actors that are deemed reprehensible elsewhere.<br />
Third, a &quot;counterterrorism plus&quot; strategy assumes that the Taliban -- despite their increasingly global Islamist rhetoric -- remain focused upon Afghanistan and ousting foreigners and are less threatening to U.S. and international security than the raft of Islamist militants based in Pakistan, which are tied to international terrorism. The logistical dependence upon Pakistan to supply the counterinsurgency in Afghanistan limits the U.S.'s ability to demand that Pakistan abandon groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and the al-Qaeda-linked Haqqani network.<br />
Fourth, this counterterrorism approach repudiates the conventional wisdoms about the &quot;successes in Iraq&quot; and the much-lauded surge there. While history alone will tell whether Iraq has in fact been a &quot;success,&quot; scholars are increasingly interrogating the common wisdom that these ostensible successes in Iraq were due to the surge and General David Petraeus' COIN strategy rather than critical internal changes in Iraqi politics.<br />
More fundamentally, the assumptions of Petraeus' COIN doctrine simply may not apply to Afghanistan where there are no functional line ministries, where the insurgents are rural and cannot easily be extricated from the local population, and where the insurgents are interlaced with families who may disapprove of their relatives' activities but do not want them dead.<br />
Some skeptics of this proposed way forward predictably will deploy the &quot;women's rights&quot; or &quot;human rights&quot; cards to reject such a policy on the basis of the Taliban's appalling savagery. They have a point. But the U.S. and NATO have cultivated shady allies across Afghanistan for purely instrumental purposes, including warlords, drug traffickers, and other unsavory characters whose own records on these same issues are equally repugnant.<br />
The values of a counterterrorism plus strategy are manifold. First, it decreases the loss of American life and treasure as well as many more Afghan lives. Second, reducing the combat operations will likely increase the amount and quality of intelligence that will better enable the fight against al-Qaeda and other international terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Third, it will temper a powerful narrative of jihadis everywhere that the U.S. presence in Afghanistan is an occupation force. Fourth and perhaps most importantly, it will relieve the U.S. dependence upon Pakistan to sustain the war, freeing up U.S. national power to focus upon the international terrorists there. The Obama administration must reject these prevailing false choices and get down to the business of defining a new and better way forward.<br />

<strong>No risk of Taliban takeover or terrorism with CT</strong><br />
<strong>ASG ‘10</strong> —The Afghanistan Study Group, an ad hoc group of public policy practitioners, former U.S. government officials, academics, business representatives, policy-concerned activists and association leaders concerned with the Obama administration’s policy course in Afghanistan, 8/16/10, (“What’s Wrong With The Current U.S Strategy,” A New Way Forward: Rethinking U.S. Strategy in Afghanistan”) <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3094:http://www.afghanistanstudygroup.org/2010/08/13/the-way-fo-rward-a-five-point-approach/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afghanistanstudygroup.org/2010/08/13/the-way-fo-rward-a-five-point-approach/" rel="nofollow">http://www.afghanistanstudygroup.org/2010/08/13/the-way-fo-rward-a-five-point-approach/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3094 -->)<br />
Second, a U.S. drawdown would not make Al Qaeda substantially more lethal. In order for events in Afghanistan to enhance Al Qaeda’s ability to threaten the U.S. homeland, three separate steps must occur: 1) the Taliban must seize control of a substantial portion of the country, 2) Al Qaeda must relocate there in strength, and 3) it must build facilities in this new “safe haven” that will allow it to plan and train more effectively than it can today. Each of these three steps is unlikely, however, and the chances of all three together are very remote. For starters, a Taliban victory is unlikely even if the United States reduces its military commitment. The Taliban is a rural insurgency rooted primarily in Afghanistan’s Pashtun population, and its seizure of power in the 1990s was due to unusual circumstances that no longer exist and are unlikely to be repeated. Non-Pashtun Afghans now have ample experience with Taliban rule, and they are bound to resist any Taliban efforts to regain control in Kabul. Moreover, the U.S. military presence has helped the Taliban rally its forces, meaning that the group may well fragment and suffer a loss of momentum in the face of a U.S. drawdown. Surveys suggest that popular support for the Taliban among Afghans is in the single digits. Even with significantly reduced troop levels, we can build a credible defense against a Taliban takeover through support for local security forces, strategic use of airpower, and deployment in key cities without committing ourselves to a costly and counterproductive COIN (counterinsurgency) campaign in the south. And if power-sharing and political inclusion is negotiated, the relevance of the Taliban as an alternative to Kabul is likely to decline. And even if the Taliban were to regain power in some of Afghanistan, it would likely not invite Al Qaeda to re-establish a significant presence there. The Taliban may be reluctant to risk renewed U.S. attacks by welcoming Al Qaeda onto Afghan soil. Bin Laden and his associates may well prefer to remain in Pakistan, which is both safer and a better base from which to operate than isolated and land-locked Afghanistan. Most importantly, no matter what happens in Afghanistan in the future, Al Qaeda will not be able to build large training camps of the sort it employed prior to the 9/11 attacks. Simply put, the U.S. would remain vigilant and could use air power to eliminate any Al Qaeda facility that the group might attempt to establish. Bin Laden and his associates will likely have to remain in hiding for the rest of their lives, which means Al Qaeda will have to rely on clandestine cells instead of large encampments. Covert cells can be located virtually anywhere, which is why the outcome in Afghanistan is not critical to addressing the threat from Al Qaeda. In short, a complete (and unlikely) victory in Afghanistan and the dismantling of the Taliban would not make Al Qaeda disappear; indeed, it would probably have no appreciable effect on Al Qaeda. At the same time, dramatically scaling back U.S. military engagement will not significantly increase the threat from Al Qaeda. Third, the current U.S. military effort is helping fuel the very insurgency we are attempting to defeat. An expanded U.S. presence has reinforced perceptions of the United States as a foreign occupier. Religious extremists have used the U.S. presence as an effective recruiting tool for their cause. Efforts to limit civilian casualties and other forms of collateral damage have been only partially successful, leading additional Afghans to take up arms against us. Fourth, the expanded U.S. presence and a more energetic counterinsurgency effort in Afghanistan and Pakistan have reinforced a tacit alliance among different extremist groups whose agendas are not identical. The Taliban is itself a loose coalition of Pashtuns, many of whom are motivated by local concerns rather than by any deep commitment to global jihad. Al Qaeda, by contrast, is a global network of radical Islamists seeking to topple governments throughout the Middle East. The “Pakistani Taliban” are a separate alliance of different Islamist groups challenging the authority of the Pakistani state. The Haqqani network in Waziristan is led by a local warlord who is strongly opposed to foreign interference but reportedly also a sometime ally of Pakistan’s Inter-Service Intelligence agency (ISI). Although cooperation among these disparate groups has increased in recent years, this development is largely a reaction to the increased foreign presence in the region and our efforts to convince the Pakistani government to take more aggressive action against these groups. Thus, our current strategy is helping drive these groups together, when our real aim should be to drive wedges between as many of them as possible and to win over those who do not share Al Qaeda’s anti-Western agenda or its commitment to global jihad. Fifth, keeping 100,000-plus U.S. troops in yet another Muslim country lends credence to jihadi propaganda about America’s alleged hostility to Islam. Their presence may actually be increasing the overall danger that we face back home. Anger at U.S. military action in the Af/Pak theater inspired Faisal Shahzad, a U.S. citizen, to attempt an unsuccessful car bomb attack in Times Square, and other home-grown terrorists appear to have been inspired by similar motivations. <br />

Less than four months from now, the mid-term elections will determine if the Democrats lose control of the Senate and their ability to set the national agenda. The November balloting will also lay the foundation for President Obama’s next two years in office – and his re-election campaign. Any number of scenarios could undermine Obama in 2012. If (God forbid) a 9/11-style attack hits the United States that summer, or, say, the economy goes into a deep tailspin, then Obama will become the first one-term president since George H.W. Bush. In Obama’s wake, the Republican Piranha who’ve been circling the White House since 2008 (Palin, Romney, et al.) will feast on the Democrats’ political carcass. Here are three scenarios: President Whitman: After narrowly beating Jerry Brown for the California governorship in 2010, former eBay CEO Meg Whitman gets drafted for the 2012 presidential campaign and reluctantly accepts – then steamrolls her way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Whitman’s appeal – the first woman Republican to head the ticket; her success in Silicon Valley; her (anti-Palinesque) ability to speak coherently about the economy, foreign affairs, and her vision for America – makes her the surprising choice for independents and conservative liberals who helped springboard Obama in 2008. Whitman’s running mate, Newt Gingrich, secures her standing among Conservatives, especially in the South, and – like Joe Biden in 2008 with Obama – he reassures a potentially jittery public that his ticket has the necessary experience. War in Iran: The Republicans’ ascension marks the return of chickenhawk diplomacy. Instead of the Obama administration’s reasoned approach to Iran, the new administration relies on all-or-nothing antagonism, leading to the third Gulf War in two decades. What ensues are thousands of new military deaths, a dangerously destabilized Middle East, and an oil crisis that shocks Western economies for years. As in Afghanistan and Iraq, the U.S. tries to shepherd in a friendlier government, but now all three countries – connected geographically, religiously and historically – become the world’s leading front for insurgency against the United States.<br />

<strong>Middle east was goes global and nuclear</strong><br />
<strong>Steinbach ‘2</strong> [John Steinbach, nuclear specialist, Secretary of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki Peace Committee of the National Capitol Area, 2002, Centre for Research on Globalisation, “Israeli Weapons of Mass Destruction: a Threat to Peace,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3096:http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/STE203A.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/STE203A.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/STE203A.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3096 -->]<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the existence of an arsenal of mass destruction in such an unstable region in turn has serious implications for future arms control and disarmament negotiations, and even the threat of nuclear war. Seymour Hersh warns, &quot;Should war break out in the Middle East again,... or should any Arab nation fire missiles against Israel, as the Iraqis did, a nuclear escalation, once unthinkable except as a last resort, would now be a strong probability.&quot;(41) and Ezar Weissman, Israel's current President said &quot;The nuclear issue is gaining momentum(and the) next war will not be conventional.&quot;(42) Russia and before it the Soviet Union has long been a major(if not the major) target of Israeli nukes. It is widely reported that the principal purpose of Jonathan Pollard's spying for Israel was to furnish satellite images of Soviet targets and other super sensitive data relating to U.S. nuclear targeting strategy. (43) (Since launching its own satellite in 1988, Israel no longer needs U.S. spy secrets.) Israeli nukes aimed at the Russian heartland seriously complicate disarmament and arms control negotiations and, at the very least, the unilateral possession of nuclear weapons by Israel is enormously destabilizing, and dramatically lowers the threshold for their actual use, if not for all out nuclear war. In the words of Mark Gaffney, &quot;... if the familar pattern(Israel refining its weapons of mass destruction with U.S. complicity) is not reversed soon- for whatever reason- the deepening Middle East conflict could trigger a world conflagration.&quot; (44)<br />

<strong>Oil shocks risk extinction.</strong><br />
<strong>Roberts ‘4</strong> (Paul, Regular Contributor to Harpers and NYT Magazine, “The End of Oil: On The Edge of a Perilous New World”, p. 93-94)<br />
The obsessive focus on oil is hardly surprising, given the stakes. In the fast-moving world of oil politics, oil is not simply a source of world power, but a medium for that power as well, a substance whose huge importance enmeshes companies, communities, and entire nations in a taut global web that is sensitive to the smallest of vibrations. A single oil &quot;event&quot; — a pipeline explosion in Iraq, political unrest in Venezuela, a bellicose exchange between the Russian and Saudi oil ministers — sends shockwaves through the world energy order, pushes prices up or down, and sets off tectonic shifts in global wealth and power. Each day that the Saudi-Russian spat kept oil supplies high and prices low, the big oil exporters were losing hundreds of millions of dollars and, perhaps, moving closer to financial and political disaster — while the big consuming nations enjoyed what amounted to a massive tax break. Yet in the volatile world of oil, the tide could quickly turn. A few months later, as anxieties over a second Iraq war drove prices up to forty dollars, the oil tide abruptly changed directions, transferring tens of billions of dollars from the economies of the United States, Japan, and Europe to the national banks in Riyadh, Caracas, Kuwait City, and Baghdad, and threatening to strangle whatever was left of the global economic recovery. So embedded has oil become in today's political and economic spheres that the big industrial governments now watch the oil markets as closely as they once watched the spread of communism — and with good reason: six of the last seven global recessions have been preceded by spikes in the price of oil, and fear is growing among economists and policymakers that, in today's growth-dependent, energy-intensive global economy, oil price volatility itself may eventually pose more risk to prosperity and stability and simple survival than terrorism or even war.<br />

<strong>COIN is the cause of dollar vulnerability – collapses hegemony and causes currency wars</strong><br />
<strong>Layne ’10</strong> – Professor and Robert M. Gates Chair in National Security at Texas, 10 (Christopher Layne, “Graceful Decline,” The American Conservative, May, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3097:http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/may/01/00030/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/may/01/00030/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/may/01/00030/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3097 -->) <br />
The dollar’s vulnerability is the United States’ geopolitical Achilles’ heel. Its role as the international economy’s reserve currency ensures American preeminence, and if it loses that status, hegemony will be literally unaffordable. As Cornell professor Jonathan Kirshner observes, the dollar’s vulnerability “presents potentially significant and underappreciated restraints upon contemporary American political and military predominance.”<br />
Fears for the dollar’s long-term health predated the current financial and economic crisis. The meltdown has amplified them and highlighted two new factors that bode ill for continuing reserve-currency status. First, the other big financial players in the international economy are either military rivals (China) or ambiguous allies (Europe) that have their own ambitions and no longer require U.S. protection from the Soviet threat. Second, the dollar faces an uncertain future because of concerns that its value will diminish over time. Indeed, China, which has holdings estimated at nearly $2 trillion, is worried that America will leave it with huge piles of depreciated dollars. China’s vote of no confidence is reflected in its recent calls to create a new reserve currency.<br />
In coming years, the U.S. will be under increasing pressure to defend the dollar by preventing runaway inflation. This will require it to impose fiscal self-discipline through some combination of budget cuts, tax increases, and interest-rate hikes. Given that the last two options could choke off renewed growth, there is likely to be strong pressure to slash the federal budget.<br />
But it will be almost impossible to make meaningful cuts in federal spending without deep reductions in defense expenditures. Discretionary non-defense domestic spending accounts for only about 20 percent of annual federal outlays. So the United States will face obvious “guns or butter” choices. As Kirshner puts it, the absolute size of U.S. defense expenditures are “more likely to be decisive in the future when the U.S. is under pressure to make real choices about taxes and spending. When borrowing becomes more difficult, and adjustment more difficult to postpone, choices must be made between raising taxes, cutting non-defense spending, and cutting defense spending.” Faced with these hard decisions, Americans will find themselves afflicted with hegemony fatigue.<br />
The United States will be compelled to overhaul its strategy dramatically, and rather than having this adjustment forced upon it suddenly by a major crisis, the U.S. should get ahead of the curve by shifting its position in a gradual, orderly fashion. A new American global posture would involve strategic retrenchment, burden-shifting, and abandonment of the so-called “global counterinsurgency” being waged in Afghanistan and Iraq. <br />

<strong>Currency wars escalate</strong><br />
<strong>Harrison, 11/10</strong> [Todd, founder and CEO of Minyanville.com, MarketWatch, 2010, Global tensions are on the rise, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3098:http://www.marketwatch.com/story/an-unfortunate-needle-points-to-war-2010-11-10?pagenumber=1 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/an-unfortunate-needle-points-to-war-2010-11-10?pagenumber=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.marketwatch.com/story/an-unfortunate-needle-points-to-war-2010-11-10?pagenumber=1</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3098 -->]<br />
“In 2007, we previewed the deterioration of the middle class and the friction between the ‘haves’ and ‘have nots.’ In 2008, we forecast percolating societal acrimony and last year, we spoke of the migration towards social unrest and geopolitical conflict. As this dynamic evolves, real risk remains across the spectrum of social strife. While this assumes many shapes and forms — populist uprising, the rejection of wealth and an emerging class war — we should remember that many global conflicts have historically been triggered by financial hardship. An Israeli strike on Iran remains a top-line concern, as are uprisings in South America (Venezuela), protectionist policies in China (isolationism is the death knell of globalization), and saber rattling in Russia.” Fast-forward to present day. While some of those dynamics have proved true — societal acrimony, including a bulls-eye on the back of Goldman Sachs /quotes/comstock/13*!gs/quotes/nls/gs (GS 167.82, +0.11, +0.07%) , BP /quotes/comstock/13*!bp/quotes/nls/bp (BP 43.59, -0.09, -0.21%) , superstar athletes, policymakers, and politicians, as well as select cases of social unrest, stateside and abroad — others thankfully haven’t, at least not yet. Read Minyanville’s “The Short Sale of American Icons.” I’m reminded of these lyrics by Robert Hunter, as sung by the Grateful Dead: “We used to play for silver now we play for life, And one’s for sport, and one’s for blood at the point of a knife And now the die has shaken; now the die must fall There ain’t a winner in the game, he don’t go home with all, not with all.” The talented Mr. Hunter was right — there are no winners in war. As the computer Joshua said in the movie “War Games,” “The only winning move is not to play.” Dude, before you call me a barefoot tree-hugging pacifist, I realize the notion of perpetual world peace, while wonderful, is highly unrealistic. I ate dinner with Don Graham of the Washington Post a year or so ago and he asked what worried me most. Before I could self-edit, I said “World War III; global conflicts are usually born from economic hardship and that’s where the needle seems to be pointing.” Read Minyanville’s “Lloyd’s Wall of Worry.” I’m not talking nuclear Holocaust, mind you. That’s, well... game over. I’m talking about global friction reaching a tipping point, sovereign nations protecting themselves, lines being drawn in the sand — and those lines being defended. As referenced above, protectionism is the “other side” of globalization and that makes this topic fair game for a financial forum. We strive to see both sides in Minyanville, even when the other side isn’t particularly pleasant. Optimism and realism make for strange bedfellows but they beat the pants off ignorance and apathy. Why share these thoughts now? The signs are pointing towards an unfortunate destination. Earlier this year, we wrote about the percolating cross-border problems, from the Flotilla friction to Iran tensions to saber rattling on the Korean Peninsula to leaks of Afghan war logs, with European social strife on the rise and a global play for crude mixed in for good measure. Sovereign posturing is ever-present and on the rise. Can you feel it? Following the second iteration of quantitative easing last week, we received troubling feedback around the world. President Barack Obama defended the additional stimulus by saying, “The Fed’s mandate, my mandate, is to grow our economy. And that’s not just good for the United States, that’s good for the world as a whole.” Unfortunately, global leaders didn’t share his enthusiasm. Wolfgang Schäuble, German finance minister, called the Fed’s actions “clueless” and said, “It doesn’t add up when the Americans accuse the Chinese of currency manipulation and then artificially lower the value of the dollar…I have great doubts about whether it makes sense to pump unlimited amounts of money into the markets. There is no shortage of liquidity in the U.S. economy. I can’t see the economic argument for this move.” Dilma Rousseff, Brazil’s president-elect, warned, “The last time there was a competitive devaluation of currencies it ended up where it did, in the second World War.” Zhu Guangyao, the Chinese vice finance minister, offered, “The U.S. decision does not recognize, as a country that issues one of the world’s major reserve currencies, its obligation to stabilize capital markets.” Arkaday Dvorkovich, the Russian G-20 negotiator, opined, “Russia’s president will insist ‘such actions’ (as pumping cash into the U.S. economy) are taken with preliminary consultations with other members’ of the G-20.” Unintended consequences We’ve mapped the crossroads. On one side, there’s the bitter pill of debt destruction, asset class deflation, and a stronger dollar. On the other, there’s more of the same synthetic sweetener that got us into this mess in the first place. Read Minyanville’s “The Main Event: Inflation vs. Deflation.” But it’s not that clean. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction and when the actions are cumulative, the reaction will be equally severe. We saw it in 2008 and take me at my word, we’ll see it again. Read Minyanville’s “The Anatomy of a Recession.” The issue of course is how and when this amorphous dynamic manifests and that, my friends, is a question I’m not smart enough to answer. What I can say is the lurking danger may not be on our screens as much as behind the scenes. The ramifications of policy gone awry are ever-present in the social sphere and where you are in the aforementioned “tricky tri-fecta” is perhaps a function of what part of the world you’re reading this. To be sure, there’s a bull case in play. When the decision was made to give the drunk another drink with hopes he doesn’t sober up, corporate credit markets continued their amazing bull run, which points to higher equity levels still. One could argue that layer of debt is sandwiched on either side by a sticky sovereign situation and consumers extended over their skis but that won’t matter until it does, at which point it will matter a lot. Factor in the animal spirits of performance anxiety — pension fund managers have to buy a higher tape, also known as a “long squeeze” — and voila, we see the year-end tug of war currently taking shape. All the while, the collective psychology and perceived credibility surrounding the decision-makers in Washington are perhaps the single greatest determinants of our global financial fate. The other side of the trade Current policy is a Band-Aid on a broken bone and the logic is simple enough to follow. Printing more dollars increases the money supply, thus lowering the value, which makes alternative currencies more attractive (and handcuffs policymakers across the pond). That’s fine in a vacuum but not so much when the greenback is the world reserve currency and the measuring stick of multiple asset classes. ‘War’s going on across the sea, street soldiers killing the elderly. What ever happened to unity? It’s like that, and that’s the way it is.’ Look at it this way. You’re China and you own, say, gold. Since the beginning of September, gold is up 15% and the dollar is down 9%. You own gold (nice call!) but you’re losing almost two-thirds of your gains on the aggregate, which sucks... if you’re China. Now pull back the lens. The dollar index is down 36% since 2002. Thirty-six percent. And during that same stretch, the S&amp;P 500 /quotes/comstock/21z!i1:in\x (SPX 1,214, -5.17, -0.42%) is basically flat. All of a sudden, the notion of currency wars and economic espionage isn’t that farfetched. This has been going on for a long time and foreign holders of dollar denominated assets have every right to be pissed. We learned the hard way that it’s one thing to write about “a prolonged period of socioeconomic malaise entirely more depressing than a recession,” as Minyanville did in 2006 and 2007; and another thing to live through it. No matter how prepared we were — and our community was more prepared than most — reality’s bite was much worse than its loud, and at the time, very unpopular bark. Read Minyanville’s “The Upside of Anger.” As the world turns and tensions churn, calmer heads must prevail to avoid a similar sense of déjà vu. The current heading is in nobody’s best interest; this is not a story one wishes to foretell. Quite hopefully awareness, engagement and yes, humility will serve as the first steps towards preparedness or better yet, avoidance. If the rest of the world is forced to endure austerity measures and upward taxation, the U.S., widely viewed as the genesis of the global financial crisis, best get used to a tighter stateside belt. Ironically, our leaders are telling us to go out and spend while punishing the savers who have chosen not to. That might prolong the relative calm but we know what happens when you mess with Mother Nature — or free markets. There is a difference between loss and loss; let’s hope it won’t again take something bad to make us realize that as hard as it is, it could be worse. Let’s hope our politicians aren’t so myopic as to enact laws aimed at re-election while lowering the standard of living for our children. Let’s hope that higher food prices and unemployment are the worst headlines we’ll be forced to absorb. Let’s hope the up-and-coming Millennials enthusiastically embrace the task at hand and show this country what true will and an entrepreneurial spirit can achieve. Watch the dollar (any lift will quell the upside asset class swell), eyeball the banks (which encapsulate our finance-based economy), note the resistance zone of S&amp;P 1,200 to 1,220 and try to define your risk regardless of your current position. It’s entirely fine to dance while the music is playing; some would say that’s our mission in the rain. Just make certain you have a seat when it stops, and keep close tabs on those who don’t.<br />

<br />
For a few infuriating weeks, Obama danced around the decision to escalate in Afghanistan. Rarely has a single human being had a greater chance to change history. Obama could have stood up to the generals. He could have de-escalated. He could have begun the process of drawing down the military budget, the only way to save our economy. More than 50% of taxpayer money goes to weaponry. We have troops in more than 100 countries. We spend more on our military than all the rest of the world combined. Throughout history---Athens, Rome, Persia---empires have spent themselves to military oblivion. We have now been in Afghanistan longer than the USSR. With a simple speech, Obama could have begun the Great Reversal. It was a crystal clear moment. The public support was there. It was what he was elected to do. But like Lyndon Johnson’s catastrophic March 1965 decision to escalate the war in Vietnam, Obama went exactly the wrong way. He became the first man in history to accept the Nobel Peace Prize with a pro-war speech. With Bush's Secretary of War by his side, he ceded to the military our nation's most critical decision. He doomed our domestic economy and global ecology by burying us still deeper in the lethal quagmire of perpetual war. All else is sad detail. When Obama caved on Afghanistan, so did his presidency. As Orwell, Zinn, Swanson and Solomon make clear, perpetual war is the carefully engineered route to poverty, ignorance and dictatorship. Afghanistan is merely the latest installment in this seamless, unseemly tragedy. Its ever-changing justifications are meaningless smokescreens, forever poised to cloud the inevitable transition to the next conflict. The names, places and rhetoric may change, but the impact will not. Until we find a way to break through to a genuine state of peace---and we must, and soon---we have no future. <br />

Covert and proxy wars require local allies. After suffering the deaths of more than 5,000 soldiers over the past decade, U.S. officials like Brennan are understandably eager to use local forces for intelligence and military muscle. The hard part is finding local allies whose goals are even remotely similar to those of the United States. Local forces have the annoying tendency to prefer their own agendas, to arrange to get more than they give, and to manipulate the U.S. military to use their muscle on their local rivals. And these local allies frequently have unsavory human rights records which will inevitably embarrass their American sponsors.<br />

<br />
The indivisible human rights framework survived the Cold War despite U.S. machinations to truncate it in the international arena. The framework is there to shatter the myth of the superiority. Indeed, in the face of systemic inequality and crushing poverty, violence by official and private actors, globalization of the market economy, and military and environmental depredation, the human rights framework is gaining new force and new dimensions. It is being broadened today by the movements of people in different parts of the world, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere and significantly of women, who understand the protection of human rights as a matter of individual and collective human survival and betterment. Also emerging is a notion of third-generation rights, encompassing collective rights that cannot be solved on a state-by-state basis and that call for new mechanisms of accountability, particularly affecting Northern countries. The emerging rights include human-centered sustainable development, environmental protection, peace, and security. Given the poverty and inequality in the United States as well as our role in the world, it is imperative that we bring the human rights framework to bear on both domestic and foreign policy.<br />

While some countries are home to military bases, others require military disaster relief after a crisis, like a tsunami. Others have become battlefields, resulting in the deaths of U.S. soldiers and foreign civilians. Military presence is defined by any nation where the U.S. has a military base, where the U.S. is providing military aid, active duty military personnel, or where U.S. soldiers are engaged in combat theaters.

<strong>military presence, so defined, has expanded to include still more countries during the course of al-Qaeda's suicide campaign, then 1 include those new countries as well, since they could also serve as recruiting grounds for al-Qaeda's ongoing suicide campaign. &quot;American military presence&quot; includes cases where American combat forces are based in the country or where the United States provides an explicit or widely understood security guarantee that could be implemented using its forces in an adjacent country. It does not include cases where American military advisers arc present or where the country's military and the U.S. military conduct joint training exercises.</strong><br />

<strong>Barack Obama has apparently been waiting for a resolution of the Afghan election fiasco before announcing the result of his review of U.S. policy toward Afghanistan. In the next few days or weeks, he is likely to endorse the recommendations of his hand-picked Afghan commander, General Stanley McChrystal, who has called for a shift in NATO's strategy toward the kind of counterinsurgency approach that worked in Iraq – one that prioritizes the protection of the Afghan population over the killing of insurgents. Mr. Obama probably will also deploy more U.S. troops, although perhaps not the full 40,000 additional forces that Gen. McChrystal has reportedly requested. As</strong><br />
<strong>the White House studied its options, more Americans have called for the withdrawal of U.S. ground troops from Afghanistan. These calls have come not only from the Democrats' liberal base but also from conservative foreign-policy “realists” such as columnist George Will, Harvard's Stephen Walt and the University of Chicago's Robert Pape, who argue that al-Qaeda can be battled from a distance using U.S. commandos, cruise missiles and armed drones.</strong><br />

<strong>Congress, driven by President Obama's ambitious political agenda, is out to be a jack of all trades. Just look at its to-do list for this year -- health-care reform, clean energy legislation, overhaul of financial regulation, a rewrite of immigration law, stimulus spending to prod the economy toward recovery. With Democrats in total control of the House and close to it in the Senate, fierce partisanship, long-cherished liberal goals and the pent-up energy of the Democratic left are driving the transformational agenda. There's no argument many of the bills address problems needing a fix, but that's best achieved with at least a degree of bipartisan support. Yet we're being force-fed a liberal prescription. A crowded agenda controlled by Democrats and a White House push for quick action crowd out competing views.</strong><br />

<strong>Even those closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn’t begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things are in Afghanistan. “If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,” a senior adviser to McChrystal says. Well, mission accomplished, gentlemen. Your little frat party managed to get everyone’s attention and, combined with a never-ending stream of gruesome milestones, it caused the bottom to drop out of public support for the Afghanistan War. According to the newest polling from Newsweek: * Only 37 percent of those surveyed approve of the way President Obama is handling the war. 53 percent disapprove. That’s a major reversal from prior results that showed support/opposition solidly in the president’s favor by a 55/27 margin. * Only 26 percent of those surveyed believe we’re winning in Afghanistan. 46 percent believe we’re losing. * This crystallizing opposition isn’t due to disagreement with the way President Obama handled the McChrystal/Rolling Stone flap, either. Most Americans agreed with his decision to dismiss the general by a 50/35 margin. McChrystal’s statements in the Rolling Stone piece probably weren’t enough to cause his ouster on their own, but as the latest in a series of insults and missteps, they were the straw that broke the camel’s back. Similarly, the McChrystal flap probably wasn’t enough to turn Americans against the war, but as a tawdry new development at the end of a string of gruesome events transpiring on the periphery of the national consciousness, the episode was enough to cause the electorate to push their chair back from the kitchen table and stomp over to see just what the hell you kids are doing in here that’s making all that racket?! Mommy and Daddy obviously didn’t like what they saw: * The thousandth U.S. death of the war; * The trillionth dollar spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars; * That the war had surpassed Vietnam as the longest war in U.S. history, by some counts; * That the pivotal campaigns in the counterinsurgency strategy were ridiculously bogged down; and * That June 2010 had already become the deadliest month of the war. Pentagon officials are now running around trying on some of their most Orwellian rhetoric to date (No! Really! We’re not bogged down!) trying to sooth Congress and the extraordinarily cranky electorate, but it’s too late. The tanks are rolling into Baghdad, despite Bob’s insistence to the contrary. For their part, the hawks in Congress are dangerously misreading the tea leaves. Some are calling for scrapping the July 2011 withdrawal date and for staying in Afghanistan indefinitely. Others are insisting that protections for civilians in the war zone should be loosened. But these vicious</strong><br />
<strong>chest-thumpers are missing the point: Americans don’t want more and more brutal war. We want our troops home, yesterday. Prior polling had shown a strange dichotomy: Americans didn’t support the Afghanistan War, but they approved of President Obama’s handling of the war. The White House could wave away dismal polling numbers for support/opposition to the war by pointing to the high approval numbers for Obama’s handling of the war, and Congress could hide behind “supporting the president.” No more. Americans are fed up with this brutal, costly war. Memo to politicians: Love the Afghanistan War in public at your peril.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Widespread support should give the president leeway and weaken resistance to his policies. Thus, public support gives a president, at best, leverage, but not control. On the other hand, when the president lacks popular support, this strengthens the resolve of those inclined to oppose him and narrows the range in which he receives the benefit of the doubt. The president’s options are reduced, his opportunities diminished, and his room for maneuver checked; he loses crucial “leeway.”</strong><br />

<strong>If the Korean War, which began 60 years ago this past weekend, was America's forgotten war, Afghanistan has been America's ignored war. Since President Obama authorized a surge of troops in Afghanistan in December 2009, there has been a notable absence of public debate or interest about this conflict. Although the media has tracked conditions on the ground and more recently has examined the rapid deterioration of U.S. military strategy, Afghanistan has not elicited the same kind of civic dialogue that surrounded President George W. Bush's war in Iraq and certainly nothing like President Johnson's war in Vietnam. Indeed, when the controversy over Gen. Stanley McChrystal's comments in Rolling Stone magazine erupted in the past week, one of the most surprising aspects of the story was that, for a brief moment, Americans were actually talking about Afghanistan once again. Our nation is in the middle of a war that has gone on for over nine years, but many people have not been paying attention. Afghanistan cannot be ignored. The war, which started in the aftermath of 9/11, costs the federal government about $6.7 billion a month. That's more than the monthly cost of Iraq. June 2010 marked one of the deadliest months in this war. Since the war began, more than 1,000 American servicemen and women have died. The government of Afghanistan, our ally, remains mired in corruption and teeters on instability. Gen. David Petraeus' counterinsurgency strategy is apparently not working its magic. Many experts doubt that the president can abide by the July 2011 timetable that he set to begin withdrawal. The end is not in sight, and it is unclear whether policymakers even know what the end is. According to Newsweek, one expert working with the Pentagon commented, &quot;We could sink in billions more dollars for another 10 to 20 years, and if we're lucky, we'll get Haiti ...&quot; What accounts for the utter lack of attention to this war? The first factor has been the fragile state of the economy within the U.S. The severity of economic conditions since the financial crash in the fall of 2008 has naturally led citizens to focus on the health of their pocketbooks and the stability of their mortgage payments rather than on war and peace. The listless recovery that has left high rates of unemployment has means many families don't have the time or energy to pay attention to events overseas. The second factor has to do with the political incentives that inhibit liberals and conservatives from making too much of an issue of this war. Many liberal Democrats have been either angry or quietly uneasy with Obama's decision to escalate troop levels in Afghanistan. Yet they have generally remained silent since the surge began, fearing they could undercut Obama as he moved forward with health care, a high priority for Democrats. They were also in a bind since they had based much of their criticism of President Bush on the claim that he had diverted resources from the war in Afghanistan, where the terrorists who perpetrated 9/11 had been given shelter by the Taliban, and used them for the war in Iraq, which they said was not essential to the war on terrorism. At the same time, conservatives have not made much noise either. Although there are many conservatives who support President Obama's strategy, there are also political factors at work. Talking too much about Afghanistan cuts against a central argument that they want to make about this administration: that Democrats are weak on defense.</strong><br />

<strong>(CNN) -- Like shifting weight on a seesaw, the Pentagon moved the lion's share of U.S. war troops in Iraq to Afghanistan in 2010, to reflect the nation's changing war strategy. Just months after Obama promised to reduce U.S. forces in Iraq, he faced a much-debated decision last year on whether to increase troops in Afghanistan. Supporters of the buildup said the strategy would bring a swifter end to the war, by allowing the United States to more quickly hand over security responsibility to Afghan forces. Opponents complained that the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai was corrupt and had proven to be an unreliable partner. The nine-year U.S.-led war against the Taliban and al Qaeda has claimed the lives of more than 1,070 American troops in both hostile and non-hostile deaths. Following the fiery Capitol Hill debate, Obama ordered an additional 30,000 forces to deploy to Afghanistan. Leadership of the Afghan war became a political bombshell in June, when Rolling Stone reported that the war's U.S. commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, had made politically explosive remarks about key administration officials. Among the reported comments, McChrystal and his staff imagined ways of dismissing Vice President Joe Biden. Obama said McChrystal's conduct &quot;does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general&quot; and undermined both civilian authority and trust. Obama accepted McChrystal's resignation and asked Gen. David Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command, to take over McChrystal's role. Under Obama's plan for the Afghanistan war, the United States will begin reducing troops in Afghanistan beginning in July 2011. A bipartisan trio of lawmakers has called on the commander in chief to announce an exact timetable for complete withdrawal. &quot;United States military strategy in Afghanistan is not in our best national security interest and makes us dependent upon an unreliable partner in the Afghan government,&quot; said a letter to Obama signed by Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin, and Reps. Walter Jones, R-North Carolina, and James McGovern, D-Massachusetts. Reactions to Afghanistan strategy Video: More troops in Afghanistan?

Even in the worst case, non-Pashtun Afghans will prevent a Taliban takeover and regional actors will contain it<br />
Katz, 9 <strong>- professor of government and politics at George Mason University (Mark, “Assessing an Afghanistan Withdrawal,” 9/9, ISN Security Watch, <span style="color: #0000cc;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/Security-Watch/Detail/?lng=en&amp;id=105801" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/ Current-Affairs/Security- Watch/Detail/?lng=en&amp;id=105801</a></span> )</strong><br />

<strong>Those opposing a US/NATO withdrawal assume that this will lead to the Taliban returning to power in Afghanistan, the Taliban allowing al-Qaida renewed access to the country, and al-Qaida making use of Afghanistan to successfully attack the West again. All three of these assumptions, though, are questionable. First, it is not clear that a US/NATO withdrawal would lead to the Taliban returning to power in much more of Afghanistan than they control now. While the Taliban have a base of support among the Pashtuns in the south, they appear to have no support among non-Pashtuns elsewhere. Because of their experience under Taliban rule from 1996 through 2001, the non-Pashtuns have no illusions about what life will be like for them if the Taliban return to power. This could well motivate them to put aside differences among themselves (which helped the Taliban in 1996) and resist it - something with which the US and NATO could assist even after a complete or partial troop withdrawal.</strong><br />
<strong>Further, even if the Taliban were to return to power in Afghanistan, it is not clear that it would give al-Qaida carte blanche the way it</strong><br />
<strong>did before 9/11. This after all is what led to the US/NATO intervention in Afghanistan just afterward. The Taliban may well prefer to severely circumscribe or even sacrifice al-Qaida in order to avoid the possibility of a second costly interruption to its hold on power.</strong><br />
<strong>Finally, al-Qaida and its affiliates already have access to Pakistan’s Northwest Frontier Province, Somalia, Yemen and other badlands. It is not clear how al-Qaida’s getting more access to Afghanistan than it now has would materially increase its already considerable ability to</strong><br />
<strong>attack the West.</strong><br />
<strong>Far more than what it might add to al-Qaida’s capabilities, the most important geopolitical impact of a US/NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan</strong><br />
<strong>would be the perception of a western (read: American) defeat. Yet even in the worst case - the Taliban return to power and once again allow</strong><br />
<strong>carte blanche to al-Qaida - the most negative geopolitical effects are more likely to be felt not by the US and Europe (which al-Qaida can attack without a base in Afghanistan since it already has bases elsewhere), but the countries neighboring and near Afghanistan: the Central Asian republics, Russia, China, India - and perhaps even Pakistan and Iran.</strong><br />
<strong>The impact of a US/NATO withdrawal, then, could well be to make these neighboring and nearby governments feel more vulnerable, and thus more willing to increase or initiate cooperation with the US and NATO to contain al-Qaida and the Taliban within Afghanistan. This is not to say that the US and NATO will be better off after a complete withdrawal from Afghanistan or a partial one from the south. Withdrawal will surely have some negative consequences. But not withdrawing will also have negative consequences if the US/NATO intervention becomes even less popular in Afghanistan and the West than it is now.</strong><br />
<strong>Even if a withdrawal from Afghanistan results in the worst case scenario its opponents predict, this is highly likely to be mitigated by non-Pashtuns inside Afghanistan or the governments of neighboring and nearby countries acquiring the incentive to increase (or in some cases, initiate) security cooperation with the US and NATO against the common threat. Just as maintaining or increasing US/NATO military involvement in Afghanistan will not necessarily lead to victory, withdrawal will not necessarily lead to defeat there.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>At the risk of stating the obvious - while a ragtag army of 15,000 insurgents can make the life of 30 million people difficult, it cannot by itself overrun 200,000 Western and Afghan troops in the short- or even medium-term. The Taliban may have the momentum on their side but, with no planes and no tanks, they simply can’t “roadside bomb” their way to victory.</strong><br />

CP fails – resistance from Afghans and dependence would undermine legitimacy of government<br />
Rubin, 08 <strong>- director of studies and senior fellow at the Center on International Cooperation at New York University, chair of the Conflict Prevention and Peace Forum of the Social Science Research Council, special adviser to the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan (June 2008, Barnett, “Afghan Dilemmas: Defining Commitments,” The American Interest Online WX)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Lynch accurately identifies, too, the failure of U.S. policy to address two major sources of instability: Afghanistan’s inability to sustain national security forces adequate to the current threat environment; and a regional environment driven principally by a Pakistani military doctrine determined by its estimate of the threat from India, and that reads its strategic interests as precluding a full-scale offensive against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Lynch rightly proposes that international actors, particularly the United States, guarantee Afghanistan’s security, ensure that Afghanistan can finance its own security forces, and undertake diplomacy to address the broader sources of instability in the region. However, the primary means Lynch proposes to accomplish these objectives—a binding, long-term, bilateral defense treaty between the United States and Afghanistan—would be self-defeating. The reason is one that Lynch himself cites as afflicting current policy: the failure to take into account the political effects of military deployments. Lynch argues that instability in the region results from the lack of a credible</strong><br />
<strong>U.S. commitment to stay. But a public commitment (or a private determination) to maintain U.S. military bases in a Muslim country on the Asian land mass will also generate—indeed, has already generated—resistance from Afghans, their neighbors (mainly Iran and Pakistan), and Asian powers such as Russia, China and India. Such a commitment will also invariably affect their assessments of U.S. goals. Long-term unilateral dependence on the United States will also undermine the legitimacy of any Afghan government, and no amount of money or number of foreign troops will sustain an Afghan government’s security forces under such circumstances.The United States does need to make a long-term commitment to Afghanistan, but that commitment can succeed only if it is made to an independent national government embedded within a multilateral framework that gives its neighbors and other powers a stake in its stability. Absent those conditions, no clever tactical innovations, great speeches or defense treaties will make a difference.</strong><br />

CP fails – American troops decrease the quality of life causing anti-Americanism<br />
Rubin, 08 <strong>- director of studies and senior fellow at the Center on International Cooperation at New York University, chair of the Conflict Prevention and Peace Forum of the Social Science Research Council, special adviser to the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan (June 2008, Barnett, “Afghan Dilemmas: Defining Commitments,” The American Interest Online WX)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>With this background in mind, it is now possible to see why a U.S.-Afghanistan defense treaty will distort relations between the Afghan state and its own people, as well as harming relations between the Afghan state and its neighbors. It also suggests better ways to pursue U.S. goals. Only two kinds of Afghans appear in Lynch’s analysis: Taliban, “a bedrock partner” of al-Qaeda, and the Afghan government, which “covets a strategic partnership with America.” In truth, Afghans corresponding to either of these stereotypes are rare. Those who join the insurgency are a more diverse group than one might think, and those who want a partnership with America are increasingly coming to the conclusion that America as it actually exists is quite different from the one with which they would like to ally. The most common Afghan attitude toward foreign troops is like that of the restaurant customer who complains that not only is the food terrible, but the portions are too small. Lynch is right that Afghans think the portions are too small, but he forgets that they don’t much like the food, even if it is the only food they can get right now. Afghans don’t like their country being occupied by foreign soldiers any more than did their ancestors. However, after the experience of 1978–2001, many concluded that being occupied by the United States was the only alternative to being destroyed by their neighbors. At least the United States would improve their standard of living. But that has not happened. The deterioration of security and the failure of the foreigners to improve the living standard of the poor majority of Afghans, especially in areas affected by insurgency, have decreased support for the international presence. Surveys provide evidence of this, as do anecdotes. Young men, largely from the most anti-Taliban group in Afghanistan, rioted against the foreign presence in Kabul in May 2006 after a brake failure on a U.S. vehicle led to a fatal</strong><br />
<strong>traffic accident. Another incident also involved a brake failure. As the 16-year-old cousin of an Afghan who sometimes works with me in Kabul approached a U.S. checkpoint on his bicycle, the soldiers shouted for him to halt. This Afghan bicycle had no brakes, so the cousin started to drag his feet on the ground to slow the bike. This wasn’t slow enough for the U.S. soldiers, who shot and killed the boy. The Americans then took the body and kept it for three days (a grave offense in Islam), while the family camped outside the base. After the body was finally returned, the village elders met and decided to join the Taliban to fight the Americans. They also told my Afghan colleague that as long as he worked for the government in Kabul, he could not return to the village. So this entire village has joined the Taliban, though it would be a stretch to characterize it as a “bedrock partner” of al-Qaeda.</strong><br />
<strong>The U.S. soldiers may have feared that the bicycle rider was a suicide bomber and obeyed both their rules of engagement and the international laws of war. Nonetheless, their act generated hatred and resistance. There have been many such incidents, each of which is amplified by rumor and propaganda. American soldiers are usually as humane as heavily armed young soldiers can be when their lives are threatened in alien surroundings. There is no way to eliminate such incidents, and most measures to reduce them involve greater risk for U.S. soldiers. This suggests that a political approach to the “Taliban” insurgency may require decreasing the U.S. and other foreign military presence rather than increasing it.</strong><br />
<br />
The only way to solve is access through non-military means, only the plan solves<br />
Rubin, 08 <strong>- director of studies and senior fellow at the Center on International Cooperation at New York University, chair of the Conflict Prevention and Peace Forum of the Social Science Research Council, special adviser to the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan (June 2008, Barnett, “Afghan Dilemmas: Defining Commitments,” The American Interest Online WX)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>To answer that question we must decide not only what our goals are, but also what it will take to achieve them. We can never stabilize Afghanistan and then make a victorious exit without coming to some understanding with Afghanistan’s neighbors. So the first thing we must do is show that we understand regional realities by engaging the neighbors on their genuine interests; otherwise they will continue to wage asymmetrical warfare against us until we get the message.We should therefore launch regional consultations to develop a common</strong><br />
<strong>understanding of the future of Afghanistan in the region with all neighbors, including Iran, Russia, China, India and the Persian Gulf countries. Both the UN and regional organizations offer forums to pursue these objectives. Afghanistan can no longer be an isolated buffer state, but it can serve as a connector of a wider region through trade, transit, energy transmission and labor migration as long as it is not a source of threats. Integrating Afghanistan as a focal point for regional cooperation, however, is not compatible with making it a base for U.S. power projection in the region. The long-term U.S. presence in Europe is enabled by the substantial overlap in membership between the security alliance (NATO) and the framework for economic and political cooperation (the European Union). Without a similar overlapping of security and economic frameworks in South Asia, a U.S. presence will be destabilizing, not stabilizing.Second, we must crack the Pakistani nut. The absence of U.S.-Iranian cooperation in Afghanistan (which was essential to our initial military success in 2001) and growing tensions with Russia and China in Central Asia give Pakistan monopoly control of U.S. access to landlocked Afghanistan. It follows that as long as the Pakistani military is calling the shots, Afghanistan will remain roiled no matter how many battles NATO forces win. To change this dynamic, the United States must relinquish, not strengthen, the privileged relationship between the United States and the Pakistani military. It must instead support civilian control over the government and the military alike, even by parties that oppose U.S. objectives openly (rather than covertly, like the military). Third, the United States must also invest far more in Afghanistan’s economy and civilian institutions, especially those that are important for rule of law. This requires a far more effective set of policies than we have had so far. It also requires a reversal of much of the Bush Administration’s counter-narcotics policy. Strengthening the legitimacy of the Afghan government works best when pursued through a multilateral framework, not because multilateralism is always superior to unilateralism, but because regional realities in South Asia render unilateral efforts futile. The Afghan government formed at the UN Talks on Afghanistan in Bonn (where I was a member of the UN delegation) enjoyed far greater legitimacy than either the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq or its elected successors. Fourth, as a component of strengthening civilian institutions, we should fully support efforts by the Afghan government to negotiate and reconcile with insurgents, making it clear that we are concerned about threats to international security, not weakening Islamic political forces for its own sake. Most of those fighting the Karzai government are not “bedrock partners” of al-Qaeda, though the resources provided by and through al-Qaeda and its partners make the insurgency far more deadly.

GPR consultations fail<br />
Military Technology, 4 <strong>(December 2004, “The US Global Posture Review,” US army periodical, Vol. 28, Iss. 12; pg. 46, 4 pgs)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Although the objectives of the Review are laudable, it has its problems. The first is mainly political, threatening adverse implications for the future strength of US defence partnerships. Consultations with allies - not to mention Congress and the State Department - have been belated and insufficient, allowing misper-ceptions about the new basing plan to flourish. As Joint Chiefs Chairman General Richard Myers recently stated in testimony to Congress, &quot;During 2004 Congress voiced con¬cern over the Department's overseas basing plan. We are now in the process of detailed consultation with our allies and members of Congress.&quot; However, it is not clear that the Bush administration, having failed to consult widely at the formulation stage, now has the credibility to convince allies that their concerns will be taken into account at the point of the plan's execution. Secondly, if taken too far, some of the changes proposed for the US Army could worsen an &quot;overdeployment&quot; problem that is presently posing the greatest challenge to the all-volunteer force in its 30-year history. Given the ongoing strains of the Iraq and Afghanistan missions (which are unlikely to wind down soon), there are clear downsides to taking large numbers of army soldiers out of bases in Germany - where they can be stationed with their families - and deploying them on unes¬corted tours to Central/Eastern Europe. Soldiers may prefer staying in the US for long¬er periods, so that their spouses can obtain work and their families can develop ties to one community. Further, housing and other provi¬sion would need to be made for such returnees in the US, moves that are subject to the ongo¬ing Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) pro¬cess in the US. For the foreseeable future, it may be prudent to keep any new deployments to Eastern Europe on a modest level. Nor should the budgetary implications of establish¬ing new bases, likely to total $5-7 billion in initial investment costs before potentially saving $500 million to $1 billion annually thereafter, be overlooked.</strong><br />

<strong>shall</strong><br />
<strong>'shall' describes something that is mandatory. If a requirement uses 'shall', then that requirement _will_ be satisfied without fail. Noncompliance is not allowed. Failure to comply with one single 'shall' is sufficient reason to reject the entire product. Indeed, it must be rejected under these circumstances. Examples: # &quot;Requirements shall make use of the word 'shall' only where compliance is mandatory.&quot; This is a good example. # &quot;C++ code shall have comments every 5th line.&quot; This is a bad example. Using 'shall' here is too strong.</strong><br />
<strong>should</strong><br />
<strong>'should' is weaker. It describes something that might not be satisfied in the final product, but that is desirable enough that any noncompliance shall be explicitly justified. Any use of 'should' should be examined carefully, as it probably means that something is not being stated clearly. If a 'should' can be replaced by a 'shall', or can be discarded entirely, so much the better. Examples: # &quot;C++ code should be ANSI compliant.&quot; A good example. It may not be possible to be ANSI compliant on all platforms, but we should try. # &quot;Code should be tested thoroughly.&quot; Bad example. This 'should' shall be replaced with 'shall' if this requirement is to be stated anywhere (to say nothing of defining what 'thoroughly' means).</strong><br />

Global posture review will take a long time to be delivered<br />

<strong>Already, Congress has begun cutting military construction spending on overseas bases to accommodate earmarks for domestic bases (PL 108-132). (2003 CQ Weekly, p. 3104)</strong><br />
<strong>But unlike BRAC, the global posture decisions will not be delivered at once.

Civilian leaders will ignore the CP<br />

<br />
<strong>Not all officers were comfortable with such requests- &quot;Policy belongs to the Cabinet,&quot; Admiral George Dewey asserted in rejecting an early call for coordina¬tion. Similarly, the Army General Staff maintained in 1915 that statesmen shaped policy, whereas the armed forces executed it, and where the duty of the &quot;first leaves off the other takes hold&quot;—a judgment the army field manual of the 1930s reiterated in its assertion that politics and strategy &quot;are radically and fundamen¬tally things apart----Strategy begins where politics end.&quot;'</strong><br />
<strong>The State Department forcefully concurred, and throughout the early decades of the twentieth century it ignored or rejected most requests for guidance and coordination on the grounds that they challenged civilian prerogatives in the policymaking process and thus civilian supremacy over the armed forces.' That these prerogatives had traditionally belonged to the State Department was probably an additional reason for its refusal to respond positively. But beyond the issues of civilian supremacy and bureaucratic politics. State's position reflected a view of the nature of war and its relationship to diplomacy that differed sharply from the one held by the armed forces.</strong><br />
<strong>Although military planners consistently asserted that civil leadership should determine the &quot;what&quot; of national policy, whereas the armed forces should deter¬mine the &quot;how,'&quot;' they simultaneously viewed international relations through a realist framework in which such distinctions could not be so rigidly maintained. To the contrary, they perceived war to be a standard &quot;phase of international poli¬tics&quot; resulting from conflicting national policies, with force and diplomacy as interrelated tools to be used as appropriate for ihe defense and fulfillment of national policies. Along with such beliefs went the need to coordinate civil and military tasks and to view policy, diplomacy, and force in conjunction rather than separately.&quot;</strong><br />

Turn – COIN dictates a massive expansion in control, waging wars on rebel populations<br />
Hardt and Negri ‘4 <strong>– *prof. of lit. @ Duke Univ., PhD in comp. lit. @ Univ. of Wash. &amp; *former prof. in state theory @ Padua Univ. (Michael and Antonio, “Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire,” p. 57-9, RG)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>It is clear that the old counterinsurgency strategies will not work against a swarm. Consider, for example, the &quot;decapitation model&quot; of counterinsurgency, based conceptually on the organic notion that if the head is cut off the rebellion, then the body will wither and die. In practical terms &quot;decapitation&quot; means exiling, imprisoning, or assassinating the rebel leadership. This method was used extensively against national liberation armies and guerrilla movements, but it proves increasingly ineffective as rebel organizations adopt a more polycentric or distributed form. To the horror of the counterinsurgency strategists, each time they cut off the head another head springs up in its place like a monstrous Hydra. The guerrilla organization has many heads, and a swarm has no head at all. A second counterinsurgency strategy is based on the &quot;environment-deprivation&quot; model. This strategy recognizes that its enemy is not organized like a traditional army and thus cannot simply be decapitated. It even accepts that it can never know the enemy and its organizational form adequately. Such knowledge, however, is not necessary to implement this method: the sovereign power avoids being thwarted by what it cannot know and focuses on what it can know. Success does not require attacking the enemy directly but destroying the environment, physical and social, that supports it. Take away the water and the fish will die. This strategy of destroying the support environment led, for example, to indiscriminate bombings in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, to widespread killing, torture, and harassment of peasants in Central and South America, and to mass repression of activist groups in Europe and North America. Napalm could be considered metaphorically the paradigmatic weapon of the environment-deprivation strategy. This is consciously and necessarily a blunt and imprecise strategy. The many noncombatants who suffer cannot be called collateral damage because they are in fact the direct targets, even if their destruction is really a means to attack the primary enemy. The limited successes of this counterinsurgency strategy decrease as the rebellious groups develop more complex, distributed network structures. As the enemy becomes increasingly dispersed, unlocalizable, and unknowable, the support environment becomes increasingly large and indiscriminate. Faced with this tendency, the sovereign, traditional military power is tempted to throw up its hands and cry in exasperation, like Joseph Conrad's crazed antihero, &quot;Exterminate all the brutes!&quot; It is clear at this point that counterinsurgency strategies can no longer rely only on negative techniques, such as the assassination of rebel leaders and mass arrests, but must also create 'positive&quot; techniques. Counterinsurgency, in other words, must not destroy the environment of insurgency but rather create and control the environment. The full-spectrum dominance we spoke of earlier is one conception of such a positive strategy to control network enemies,</strong><br />
<strong>engaging the network not only militarily but also economically, politically, socially, psychologically, and ideologically. The question at this point is, what form of power can implement such a general, dispersed, and articulated counterinsurgency strategy? In fact, traditional, centralized, hierarchical military structures seem incapable of implementing such strategies and adequately combating network war machines. It takes a network to fight a network. Becoming a network, however, would imply a radical restructuring of the traditional military apparatuses and the forms of sovereign power they represent. This focus on form helps us clarify the significance (and also the limitations) of the RMA and the counterinsurgency strategies of asymmetrical conflicts. Certainly, especially at a technological level, the RMA dictates that the traditional military apparatuses use networks more and more effectively— information networks, communications networks, and so forth. Distributing and blocking information and disinformation may well be an important field of battle. The mandate for transformation is much more radical than that:the military must not simply use networks; it must itself become a full matrix, distributed network. There have long been efforts by traditional militaries to mimic the practices of guerrilla warfare—with small commando units, for example—but these remain at a limited scale and on a tactical level. Some of the changes described in the current conception of an RMA focusing, for example, on the greater flexibility and mobility of combat units, do point in this direction. The more significant changes, however, would need also to involve the command structure and ultimately the form of social power in which the military apparatus is embedded. How can a command</strong><br />
<strong>structure shift from a centralized model to a distributed network model? What transformations does it imply in the form of social and political power? This would be not merely a revolution in military affairs but a transformation of the form of power itself. In our terms, this process is part of the passage from imperialism, with its centralized and bounded form of power based in nation-states, to the network form of Empire, which would include not only the dominant state powers but also supranational administrations, business interests, and numerous other nongovernmental organizations. Now, finally, we can come back to the questions we posed at the beginning about the &quot;exceptional&quot; role of U.S. power in the current global order. Our analysis of counterinsurgency strategies tells us that the U.S. military (and also U.S. power more generally) must become a network, shed its national character, and become an imperial military machine. In this context, abandoning unilateral control and adopting a network structure is not an act of benevolence on the part of the superpower but rather is dictated by the needs of counterinsurgency strategy. This military necessity recalls the debates between unilateralism and multilateralism and the conflicts between the United States and the United Nations, but it really goes beyond both of these frameworks. The network form of power is the only one today able to create and maintain order.</strong><br />

No impact - liberal democratic protections prevent military action and the slide to totalitarianism<br />

<strong>According to this basic Principle of Distinction, modern humanitarian action is directed towards those who are caught up in violent conflicts without possessing any strategic value for the respective warring parties. Does this imply that classic humanitarianism and its legal expressions reduce the lives of noncombatants to the &quot;bare life&quot; of nameless individuals beyond the protection of any legal order? I would rather argue that humanitarianism is itself an order-making activity. Its goal is not the preservation of life reduced to a bare natural fact, but conversely the protection of civilians and thereby the protection of elementary standards of civilization which prevent the exclusion of individuals from any legal and moral order. The same holds true for human rights, of course. Agamben fails to appreciate the fact that human rights laws are not about some cadaveric &quot;bare life&quot;, but about the protection of moral agency.[33] His sweeping critique also lacks any sense for essential distinctions. It may be legitimate to see &quot;bare life&quot; as a juridical fiction nurtured by the modern state, which claims the right to derogate from otherwise binding norms in times of war and emergency, and to kill individuals, if necessary, outside the law in a mode of &quot;effective factuality.&quot;[34] Agamben asserts that sovereignty understood in this manner continues to function in the same way since the seventeenth century and regardless of the democratic or dictatorial structure of the state in question. This claim remains unilluminated by the wealth of evidence that shows how the humanitarian motive not only shapes the mandate of a host state and nonstate agencies, but also serves to restrict the operational freedom of military commanders in democracies, who cannot act with impunity and who do not wage war in a lawless state of nature.[35] Furthermore, Agamben ignores the crisis of humanitarianism that emerged as a result of the totalitarian degeneration of modern states in the twentieth century. States cannot always be assumed to follow a rational self-interest which informs them that there is no point in killing others indiscriminately. The Nazi episode in European history has shown that sometimes leaders do not spare the weak and the sick, but take extra care not to let them escape, even if they are handicapped, very old or very young. Classic humanitarianism depends on the existence of an international society whose members feel bound by a basic set of rules regarding the use of violence—rules which the ICRC itself helped to institutionalize. Conversely, classic humanitarianism becomes dysfunctional when states place no value at all on their international reputation and see harming the lives of defenseless individuals not as useless and cruel, but as part of their very mission.[36] The founders of the ICRC defined war as an anthropological constant that produced a continuous stream of new</strong><br />
<strong>victims with the predictable regularity and unavoidability of floods or volcanic eruptions. Newer organizations, by contrast, have framed conditions of massive social suffering as a consequence of largely avoidable political mistakes. The humanitarian movement becomes</strong><br />
<strong>political, to paraphrase Carl Schmitt,[37] in so far as it orients itself to humanitarian states of emergency, the causes of which are located no longer in nature, but in society and politics. Consequently, the founding generation of the new humanitarian organizations have freed themselves from the ideals of apolitical philanthropy and chosen as their new models historical figures like the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who saved thousands of Jews during the Second World War.[38] In a different fashion than Agamben imagines, the primary concern in the field of humanitarian intervention and human rights politics today is not the protection of bare life, but rather the rehabilitation of the lived life of citizens who suffer, for instance, from conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. At the same time, there is a field of activity emerging beneath the threshold of the bare life. In the United States, in particular, pathologists working in conjunction with human rights organizations have discovered the importance of corpses and corporal remains now that it is possible to identify reliable evidence for war crimes from exhumed bodies.[39]</strong><br />
<br />
State power is inevitable. Working within the system of American primacy and sovereignty is a viable way to reduce violence. Our plan creates a more just order by splitting the difference between violent realism and utopian nonsense.<br />
Elshtain ‘7 <strong>(Jean Bethke, Prof. Social and Politics Ethics – U. Chicago, and Chair in Foundations of American Freedom – Georgetown U., Studies in Christian Ethics, “Against the New Utopianism”, 20:1, Ebsco)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Neo-Kantianism, of whatever stripe, is rather a far cry from arguments some of us have mounted that aspires to a world of 'minimally decent states' and a commitment to the principle of 'equal moral regard' for human beings. This 'equal moral regard' sounds rather Kantian, to be sure, but it is not an absolute principle in practice — it is an aspiration. One appreciates the tragedy that on this earth even good and decent principles cannot be wholly realised. Surprisingly, even this rather more modest call for minimally decent states — and the assumption that such states will in one way or another likely be demcratic — is taxed with a disguised form of moral imperialism, with</strong><br />
<strong>ethnocentrism, and the encouragement of the use of force. I suspect this has happened because 'the new internationalists', myself included, point out that American constitutional principles constitute universal claims, not particular ones, and that these universal claims, e.g. 'all persons are created equal', really means all persons. As everyone knows, much of the domestic history of American political life involves contestation to achieve in practice the universalism embedded in the American experiment in principle. Further, I and others argue that there is no way around American power. The question is whether, on balance, it is used for good or ill. For the new Utopians, American power is often the problem and in the wilder forms of European anti-Americanism, America functions as the repository of all that is disgusting, crass, wicked, manipulative, etc. in the world. The mere existence of American power somehow stifles and strangles the rest of the world — on and on in this vein. For example, Anthony Burke claims that the new internationalism traffics in 'fear-soaked rhetoric', and labels the war against</strong><br />
<strong>Saddam's republic of fear an 'unimaginable break' with international norms; Abu Ghraib is construed as the norm rather than an aberration (which makes criminal prosecution of the perpetrators rather inexplicable — if indeed their disgusting display was the norm we would give them medals, not indict them); the idea of state sovereignty is blasted as 'violent and exclusivist ... lingering like a latent illness in the very depths of modern cosmopolitanism'.* The metaphor of disease is fascinating here. But who are the physicians to heal the international order? For Kant they are the moral philosophers. For Burke and so many others, it is a fantasy United Nations — quite unlike the one we actually have — and international law, universally accepted and endorsed and enforced -although their arguments are often rather thin concerning how just these laws are to be enforced and by whom. Given that the United Nations today is composed of delegates who lopsidedly represent undemocratic and corrupt regimes, this strikes me as a not terribly helpful argument. Moreover, why should an International Court of Justice dominated by Europeans be any more 'universal' than claims launched by a democratic state premised on universal propositions? In sum, the Kantian vision relies on a dualistic contrast between 'perpetual peace' and 'perpetual war' that is a chimera. The new Utopians ignore or downplay moral and political ambiguity and nuance, the smudginess of real human lives and history. Those of us who believe the universe is not heal-able' (if there is such a word) are often taxed with being imperialists if we express the hope that American power can help to stabilise and provide order in international affairs and, at the same time, defeatists precisely because we — or at least I — share St Augustine's conviction that on this earth it will remain impossible to perfectly reconcile human wills. Pace the critics, this is not a counsel of defeatism at all; rather, it represents hope by contrast to optimism. Hope that the world can be made less brutal and less unjust, nd this means more respect for human rights and more democratic forms insofar as democracy involves respect for persons qua persons. Saying this does not dictate any particular form of government save that no one is born to be a slave, to be tormented, or to be slaughtered because of who he or she is — whether American or Israeli or Palestinian, whether Jew or Christian or Muslim, whether male or</strong><br />
<strong>female. The new neo-Kantian universalism — or new utopianism — is a mixture of un-tethered idealism, hoping for the triumph of good will and a world in which international bodies supplant states, international law supersedes multiple civic laws, and there is at some point a definitive abandonment of the use of force in international affairs. For us 'new internationalists' — if we accept the designation and I am not wild about it — we find the real challenge to our position not so much from the new Utopians — I believe their arguments can be rather readily answered — but from serious classical realists who set the bar lower, insisting that the best we can do is to forestall the worst and not hope for some good. There is great wisdom in this posture — forestalling the worst is no small achievement — but, contrary to some interpreters of Augustine, I believe there is also warrant for a measure of hopefulness within his arguments concerning political life and order.</strong><br />

CP TEXT: The USFG should offer substantial financial incentives targeted at recruiting privileged youth. The USFG should deploy privileged youths to Afghanistan in counterterrorism roles.<br />
<br />
Recruiting more privileged youth to serve in the military would make the public willing to accept more casualties – it is empirically proven<br />
Mosko<strong>s – Professor of Sociology at Northwestern –</strong> 2002 <strong>(Charles, A former U.S. Army draftee in the combat engineers in Germany, his research has taken him to combat units in Vietnam, Panama, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq., Public Interest, “Reviving the citizen-soldier,” Spring, Issue 147, www.findarticles.com)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The price of citizenship</strong><br />
<strong>There is yet another reason why privileged young Americans should serve in the armed forces. Their participation would not only provide a fine example of leadership but might also increase the public’s willingness to accept wartime casualties. There has been much discussion about the greater reluctance of Americans to accept casualties than in times past. We need only consider the abrupt American evacuation from Beirut following the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks, or the turn-around in Somalia following the deaths of 18 American soldiers, or the unwillingness to use ground troops in the 1999 war against Serbia, to recognize the scope of the problem.</strong><br />
<strong>What has changed? Certainly the small number of combat losses in recent military operations contributes to the lower tolerance for casualties. The invasions of Grenada and Panama were over within a matter of days and incurred just 18 and 23 American deaths, respectively. Even with over a half-million troops in place during the Gulf War, we suffered only 183 combat deaths (one-quarter of which were incurred by “friendly fire”). In Haiti, only one American soldier was killed by hostile fire. And, remarkably, in the 1999 NATO bombing campaign against Serbia, not a single American was killed in combat. Likewise, the peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo have been, at the time of this writing, free of combat deaths.</strong><br />
<strong>But the increasing reluctance to accept wartime casualties also suggests a deeper change in society. One school of thought holds that a declining birth rate and smaller families makes the loss of children much more traumatic. This explanation has a certain surface plausibility, but what are we to make of the fact that the birth rate in the United States is higher than that of the former Yugoslavia, where willingness to suffer—as well as to inflict—casualties has become legendary?</strong><br />
<strong>The most frequently voiced explanation is that the American public will not accept combat deaths unless the national interest—sometimes the adjective “vital” is added—is clearly at stake. On this point analysts are almost unanimous. The civil war in Lebanon and clan warfare in Somalia did not meet the criterion of national interest, and hence our quick departure once the going got tough. From economic and political perspectives, the Gulf War more easily fit into the framework of America’s vital interests. But the Gulf War was not a true test of American willingness to suffer casualties, for we have little idea of how Americans would have reacted had the combat deaths been in the thousands, rather than in the low hundreds.</strong><br />
<strong>But all of this is wide of the mark. The answer to the question of what are considered our “national interests” depends not only on the cause itself but also on who is willing to die for that cause. Only when the upper classes perform military service has the public at large defined the cause to be worth young people’s lives. Only when privileged youth are on the firing line do war losses become more acceptable. Citizens accept hardships only when their leadership is viewed as self-sacrificing.</strong><br />
<strong>Historical experience supports the argument that Americans are more willing to accept casualties when privileged youth serve. In World War II, battle deaths approached 300,000. Yet Americans accepted these casualties because virtually every able-bodied male served in the military. Though never popular, the Korean War—a war fought mainly by draftees and incurring 33,000 deaths—lasted four years. Support for the Vietnam War, where 47,000 Americans died in battle, waned as more and more privileged youth evaded the draft. The Army of the Vietnam War had a narrower social base than at any time since before World War II.</strong><br />
<strong>The advent of the all-volunteer force in 1973 made it much less likely that privileged children would serve, especially in the enlisted ranks. This social reality, more than any other fact, has lowered our country’s willingness to accept wartime casualties, and it explains the apparent paradox of our lower acceptance of combat casualties with a volunteer military than with a draft.</strong><br />
<strong>There are only two ways to raise acceptance of combat casualties: Bring back a draft that starts conscription at the top of the social ladder or establish recruitment appeals that will garner some share of privileged youth. Otherwise the all-volunteer force will be an ineffective instrument in any mission, unless the mission is guaranteed to be almost casualty-free. Upon entering what may be a second Thirty Years War, President Bush has candidly stated that there “will be costs.” Will we be willing to bear them?</strong><br />

1. Scratch Morgan. Regional war wouldn’t be big or nuclear.<br />
FERGUSON ‘6 <strong>(Niall, Professor of History at Harvard University, Senior Research Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, and Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford, LA Times, July 24)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Could today's quarrel between Israelis and Hezbollah over Lebanon produce World War III? That's what Republican Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, called it last week, echoing earlier fighting talk by Dan Gillerman, Israel's ambassador to the United Natopitions. Such language can — for now, at least — safely be dismissed as hyperbole. This crisis is not going to trigger another world war. Indeed, I do not expect it to produce even another Middle East war worthy of comparison with those of June 1967 or October 1973. In 1967, Israel fought four of its Arab neighbors — Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq. In 1973, Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. Such combinations are very hard to imagine today. Nor does it seem likely that Syria and Iran will escalate their involvement in the crisis beyond continuing their support for Hezbollah. Neither is in a position to risk a full-scale military confrontation with Israel, given the risk that this might precipitate an American military reaction. Crucially, Washington's consistent support for Israel is not matched by any great power support for Israel's neighbors. During the Cold War, by contrast, the risk was that a Middle East war could spill over into a superpower conflict. Henry Kissinger, secretary of State in the twilight of the Nixon presidency, first heard the news of an Arab-Israeli war at 6:15 a.m. on Oct. 6, 1973. Half an hour later, he was on the phone to the Soviet ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Dobrynin. Two weeks later, Kissinger flew to Moscow to meet the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev. The stakes were high indeed. At one point during the 1973 crisis, as Brezhnev vainly tried to resist Kissinger's efforts to squeeze him out of the diplomatic loop, the White House issued DEFCON 3, putting American strategic nuclear forces on high alert. It is hard to imagine anything like that today. In any case, this war may soon be over. Most wars Israel has fought have been short, lasting a matter of days or weeks (six days in '67, three weeks in '73). Some Israeli sources say this one could be finished in a matter of days. That, at any rate, is clearly the assumption being made in Washington.</strong><br />

2. Turn – Central Asia:<br />
a. Stable in the squo.<br />
Gunaratna ’10 <strong>(Rohan, Prof. Sec. Studies – S. Rajaratnam School of Int’l. Studies – NTU, BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific – Political, Straits Times, “Singapore article notes growing threats as terror groups strengthen, expand”, 2010, L/N)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In the Asia-Pacific, the most stable sub-region is North-east Asia. Except in Xinjiang, where the Al-Qaeda-linked Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) is based, there are no threat groups in North-east Asia. After the Urumqi riots in July last year, the ETIM's support base increased and its capacity to operate in Xinjiang and elsewhere in China and Hong Kong has grown. By and large, the Central Asian region has remained stable and is likely to remain so. Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, however, face a higher level of terrorist threat than other countries in the region. Although the threat has been contained in Uzbekistan, the ideological penetration and the threat of Hizb-ut Tahrir and its violent splinter, Al Akramia, continue to grow. The lack of understanding in the West of the ideological dimension of these groups has created an opportunity for them to survive and revive. Some countries have proactively managed their threats and others are reacting to threats. Most governments have built their operational capabilities to respond to terrorism but not to prevent radicalisation. To fight terrorism effectively, governments must invest in a multi-pronged response, especially working with Muslim youth. Today, almost all Muslim countries face the threat from extremist or terrorist groups. On the operational spectrum, the counter-terrorism tactical forces and security and intelligence services in Asia continue to receive guidance and work with their more experienced counterparts from the US, Britain and Australia. On the ideological spectrum, some governments have developed strategic capabilities to reach out to their Muslim communities.</strong><br />

Rogozin then mentioned &quot;dogs of war&quot; as a second threat to Russia. &quot;That is not Taleban, but fighters drawn in by war from other countries, who are now bogged down in the war with the Americans and their allies, but if the war ends, they will look for a use for themselves. There are about three to four thousand well-trained militants who are such crazy citizens. Naturally, if the war ends, they will most probably go to somewhere in Central Asia.&quot;</strong><br />

<strong>THE WEAKNESS of the rationale for pressing the fight in Afghanistan has led many supporters of that war to say that the real concern is next door in Pakistan. Visions of mad mullahs getting their hands on Pakistani nuclear weapons are tossed about, but exactly how events in Afghanistan would influence the future of Pakistan does not get explained. The connection seems to be based on simple spatial thinking about instability spreading across borders, rather like the Cold War imagery of red paint oozing over the globe. A Taliban victory in Afghanistan would not bring any significant new resources to bear on conflict in Pakistan, which has a population five times as large and an economy ten times as big as its South Asian neighbor. Nor would it offer Pakistani militants a safe haven any more attractive or useful than the one they already have in Pakistan’s own Federally Administered Tribal Areas.</strong><br />

<strong>Pakistan's nuclear installations are so well guarded that Islamist militants behind a wave of violence in the country's heartland would find it very hard to storm them and steal material for a nuclear bomb, analysts say.</strong><br />
<strong>But the sophistication of recent attacks and their proximity to Pakistan's nuclear infrastructure suggest this risk, while low, remains a cause for worry.</strong><br />

<strong>Heavy conventional guarding, a blanket of secrecy, deliberate deception, the separation of warheads from missiles, and security practices adopted from the United States are all used to protect weapons and nuclear installations.</strong><br />

<strong>It is also time for the United States to institute a long-term mini-Marshall plan for Afghanistan. In early 2006 the Afghan government published the Afghanistan National Development Strategy, which estimated that $4 billion a year in aid for the next five years was needed to reconstruct the country. For this reason the U.S. should contribute at least half that sum every year for many years to come. Given the fact that the 9/11 attacks emerged from Afghanistan and cost the American economy at least $500 billion, aid for Afghanistan so that it does not to return to a failed state is a good investment. The U.S. should commit itself to long term reconstruction efforts in part to counter the Taliban—which is likely to be a threat for several years to come—but also because having overthrown the Taliban government, the U.S. has responsibilities to Afghanistan. And a functioning, democratic Afghanistan will have a powerful demonstration effect on countries that surround Afghanistan such as Iran, Pakistan, and the Central Asian republics, none of which are truly democratic states.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Many Uighurs view the Chinese as colonizers, and this is bound to lead to further armed insurgency. Central Asia is awash in infantry weapons including rocket-propelled grenades, explosives and mortars courtesy of the many wars that occurred in the region in the 1990s. Chinese constructed infrastructure designed to exploit Xinjiang’s mineral wealth offers soft targets for these groups and the ability to deal a major blow to China’s economy. As democracy expands in Central Asia, there will be calls for more Uighur representation and rights to the wealth from oil and natural gas exports from the region. A change in government by one of the eight nations that border Xinjiang could see a government sympathetic to the Uighurs’ plight. As any insurgent force requires secure base areas to train and regroup from, a sympathetic Central Asian government could provide these covertly. If this occurred, the Uighurs could adopt a more aggressive posture regarding the Chinese security forces. To counter an increased insurgency, the Chinese security forces have invested heavily in updating their command and control to ensure a rapid response to any outbreaks of violence. The volatile mix of ethnic and religious repression can only lead to a resumption of insurgency and instability in Xinjiang with consequences for the Chinese economy as well as the Uighur’s themselves.</strong><br />

<strong>But imagine a China disintegrating- on its own, without neo-conservative or Central Intelligence Agency prompting, much less outright military invasion because the economy (against all predictions) suddenly collapses. That would knock Asia into chaos. A massive flood of refugees would head for Indonesia and other places with poor border controls, which don’t’ want them and cant handle them; some in Japan might lick their lips at the prospect of World War II revisited and look to annex a slice of China. That would send Singapore and Malaysia- once occupied by Japan- into nervous breakdowns. Meanwhile, India might make a grab for Tibet, and Pakistan for Kashmir. Then you can say hello to World War III, Asia style. That’s why wise policy encourages Chinese stability, security and economic growth – the very direction the White House now seems to prefer.</strong><br />

5. Decentralizing Afghanistan leads to nuclear war drawing in Russia and China.<br />

<strong>As the fog of weariness over the war in Afghanistan is growing thicker, some political analysts have come up with the idea that the partition of Afghanistan might be the only alternative to the present counterinsurgency war. In theory, it may seem a panacea but in practice, it could be a frivolous adventure. This idea was put forward first in an article by Mr. Robert Blackwell, former US Ambassador to India and a presidential envoy to Iraq during the George Bush Administration, in Politico Online on July 7th and then backed up favorably by The Financial Times, Newsweek, The Washington Times and The Economist. Mr. Blackwell argues that since the present battle plan is not going to weaken the Taliban, and the Pushtun support for the US in the south is unwinnable, a &quot;partition of Afghanistan is the best policy option available to the United States and its allies&quot;. In the same way, as reported by The Economist on July 22, 2010, a former UN and EU envoy to Kabul, Francesc Vendrell, has also held out that the approaching September parliamentarian elections could play as a mechanism by which &quot;the south is handed over to the Taliban and the north to Uzbek, Hazara and Tajik warlords&quot;. Moreover, in an essay co-authored by three experts, Foreign Affairs (July/August) advises the division of Afghanistan on ethnic lines is the best option for the US to implement its core security interests. The authors conclude that a &quot;mixed sovereignty,&quot; not the present policy of centralized democracy will place the country on a path towards stability. Under this approach, the Taliban will take over the south, but if they try to welcome Al-Qaeda back or seek to attack the north, the United States will retaliate using air bombing, drones and surgical operations by its elite forces. Partition could have an adverse impact on Pakistani military in that it will likely break ranks with the Taliban. As a result, Pakistan would reverse its current policy largely for the fear that partition of Afghanistan could turn its own Pashtun Taliban into a Baluch-like separatist movement for forming a greater Pashtunistan. The reality is that these scholar-officials have a run-of-the-mill local knowledge. They perceive Afghanistan still in terms of Afghanistanism-- the American newsroom argot of the 1960s, which was used as a metaphor for a far-away, obscure and negligible place or situation. In real life, however, Afghanistan is as Richard Nixon put it in The Real War, &quot;has long been a cockpit of great-power intrigue for the same reason that it used to be called the turnstile of Asia's fate&quot;. Afghanistan has been an apologia for imperial miseries throughout its history. In his quest for empire, Alexander the Great was the first European emperor who rode across the Afghan mountains. After conquering Persia in six months, he found his army bogged down in an endless war in Afghanistan. &quot;I am involved in the land of a leonine (loin-like) and brave people, where every foot of the ground is like a wall of steel, confronting my soldiers. You have brought one son into the world, but everyone in this land can be called Alexander,&quot; in a famous letter, he wrote to his mother in 330 BC. However, for all that toughness, Afghanistan has a history of partition. The country suffered the pains of partition when the British Raj drew a border (known as Durand Line) between Afghanistan and the British India in 1893. The aim of the partition was to divide and weaken the unruly Afghan tribes. More than a century later, the Durand Line remains one of the most disputed borders in the world. Pashtun tribes in Pakistan and Afghanistan have never recognized this line. In the Afghan narrative, this border represents the greatest national disgrace. Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India ingeniously predicted this by calling the border &quot;the razor's edge on which hang suspended the modern issues of war and peace, of life and death to nations&quot;. Afghanistan's recent history offers ample evidence of resistance against the old colonial motto: divide and rule. During the past three decades, Afghanistan has had no functioning government, but it remained united against foreign invasions. In a final attempt, before leaving Afghanistan, the former Soviet Union nurtured the idea of Afghanistan's partition to win the war. In 1987 when I was working with The Kabul Times, the news leaked out that the Russians wanted to shift the Afghan capital from Kabul to Mazari-I-Sharif in the north and cede the south to the US-backed anti-communist guerrilla fighters. However, the Soviet leaders backed out from this strategy and accepted an unconditional withdrawal, even though by then they were in a stronger position for only Amu Darya divided the Soviet territory from Afghanistan. Afghanistan is indeed an ethnic mosaic. Except for two or three out of 33-provinces of the country, you can hardly find a place identified with one ethnic identity. Separatism has never been an issue of concern in Afghanistan. During Afghanistan's civil war in the early 1990s, when a fierce internal competition for control of Kabul was raging, no ethnic group and no warlord ever called for partition. The anti-Soviet resistance in the north remained always as strong as in the south. And let's not forget that there are millions of Pashtun in the north as well. Afghanistan's partition would be an invitation to a Russian roulette in the regional nuclear club. It will strengthen the Taliban beyond imagination and hearten Al-Qaeda for exploiting the crisis. Pakistan and India have nuclear weapons, and Iranian unpopular mullahs have their hearts set on. The ripple effects will reach China and Russia, who are already keen on play their parts in the great game.</strong><br />

CETRON AND DAVIES <strong>SEPTEMBER 1</strong> 2007 <strong>(Marvin, president of Forecasting International Ltd.; Owen, former senior editor at Omni magazine and freelance writer, The Futurist)</strong><br />
<strong>There are implications here for Israel as well. If Fatah, Hamas, and Hezbollah are invigorated by the chaos of regional war, they will also be divided by it. Some of their partisans may remain focused on Israel, but many will be drawn away by the larger conflict. There aredangers here for Israel, such as that Muslim radicals will gain still more influence in the region, but on balance the problems of a Middle Eastern war seem unlikely to be much greater than the ones Israel faces today.</strong><br />

<strong>Terrorists won’t use nukes- It’s counterproductive to their goals.</strong><br />
John <strong>Mueller</strong>, Professor of Political Science @ Ohio State University, 200<strong>6</strong>, Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct, p. lexis<br />
One reason al Qaeda and &quot;al Qaeda types&quot; seem not to be trying very hard to repeat 9/11 may be that that dramatic act of destruction itself proved counterproductive by massively heightening concerns about terrorism around the world. No matter how much they might disagree on other issues (most notably on the war in Iraq), there is a compelling incentive for states -- even ones such as Iran, Libya, Sudan, and Syria -- to cooperate in cracking down on al Qaeda, because they know that they could easily be among its victims. The FBI may not have uncovered much of anything within the United States since 9/11, but thousands of apparent terrorists have been rounded, or rolled, up overseas with U.S. aid and encouragement. Although some Arabs and Muslims took pleasure in the suffering inflicted on 9/11 -- Schadenfreude in German, shamateh in Arabic -- the most common response among jihadists and religious nationalists was a vehement rejection of al Qaeda's strategy and methods. <br />

Because terrorists tend to be stateless and well hidden, immediate retaliation in kind is almost impossible. But some nuclear explosions do leave an isotopic signature, a DNA-like fingerprint that allows forensic physicists such as Naval Postgraduate School weapons systems analyst Bob Harney to possibly determine the origin of the fissile material in the bomb. Nuclear forensics is not a precise science, Harney warns. Post-attack sites are almost certain to be contaminated with unrelated or naturally occurring radioactivity, and there are numerous, highly enriched uranium stashes in the world with unknown signatures. But there is no question, according to Peter Huessy, a member of the Committee on the Present Danger and consultant to the National Defense University in Washington, D.C., that Russian forensic experts could quickly detect Russian isotopes, and that highly enriched uranium (HEU) from, say, France could readily be differentiated from American HEU. But, Huessy warns, distinguishing post-blast residues of Pakistani uranium from North Korean uranium would be more challenging, probably impossible. Because neither country is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA inspectors have been unable to collect from their facilities reliable isotope samples that could be compared to post-attack residues. Even if the uranium were traced, the source nation could claim that the material had been stolen.<br />

<strong>Terrorism draws China and the U.S. together and resolves animosity – four reasons</strong><br />
<strong>Qingguo 03</strong> Professor and Associate Dean of the School of International Studies of Peking University, (Jia, “The impact of 9-11 on Sino-US relations: a preliminary assessment,” International Relations of the Asia-Pacific, Volume 3)<br />
When the US shifted its focus from China to the war against terrorism, China felt less of a threat to its domestic political stability from the US and therefore more room or flexibility to adopt a more cooperative posture toward the US. In addition, the terrorist attacks against the US constituted unacceptable human behavior, and like most other countries, China felt it necessary to take a principled stand against it. Furthermore, as a long-term victim of terrorism itself, China had a vested interest in supporting the war against terrorism (Chao, 2001). Finally, China genuinely hoped that its cooperation with the US against international terrorism would contribute to developing a sustainable partnership with the US. For these and other reasons, China did what it could to support the US at a time the latter most needed help from other countries.<br />

<strong>B. US-Sino relations solve multiple scenarios for nuclear war and environmental destruction.</strong><br />
<strong>Desperes 01</strong> (John Desperes, Fellow, RAND Corporation. “China, the United States, and the Global Economy.” p. 227-8)<br />
Indeed, U.S.-Chinese relations have been consistently driven by strong common interests in preventing mutually damaging wars in Asia that could involve nuclear weapons; in ensuring that Taiwan's relations with the mainland remain peaceful; in sustaining the growth of the U.S., China, and other Asian-Pacific economies; and, in preserving natural environments that sustain healthy and productive lives. What happens in China matters to Americans. It affects America's prosperity. China's growing economy is a valuable market to many workers, farmers, and businesses across America, not just to large multinational firms like Boeing, Microsoft, and Motorola, and it could become much more valuable by opening its markets further. China also affects America's security. It could either help to stabilize or destabilize currently peaceful but sometimes tense and dangerous situations in Korea, where U.S. troops are on the front line; in the Taiwan Straits, where U.S. democratic values and strategic credibility may be at stake; and in nuclear-armed South Asia, where renewed warfare could lead to terrible consequences. It also affects America's environment. Indeed, how China meets its rising energy needs and protects its dwindling habitats will affect the global atmosphere and currently endangered species.<br />

Will last week's terrorist attacks and the coming war effort finally plunge the U.S. economy into the recession it's been teetering on the brink of <br />
for months? Or will the opposite happen? Might wartime spending act as a fiscal stimulus package that would jump-start the country's flagging finances? Congress has already approved $40 billion in spending to rebuild and fight terrorism after last week's attacks, and there's a good chance that many more billions will be ladled for tasks such as rescuing the beleaguered airline industry and upgrading national security. Economists are hoping that the burst of wartime spending will counteract not only the financial fallout from last week's attacks, but also the long decline of the economy over the last year.&quot;The bottom line is that, in a sufficiently aggressive military posture, you could actually have a positive economic effect from this,&quot; says Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, in a briefing. Just look, for example, at the postwar prosperity resulting from the United States' involvement in World War II. Such government spending acts as a stimulus, because those funds would have otherwise been languishing in the so-called Social Security lock box. &quot;Otherwise that money would have been sitting in T-bills [Treasury bonds] with an IOU to the Social Security trust fund,&quot; said Ross DeVol, an economist at the Milken Institute. The terrorist attacks signaled an immediate change in the government's economic priorities. &quot;All the talk about balancing the budget and protecting social security -- that's gone now,&quot; said Steve Golub, an economics professor at Swarthmore College, adding, &quot;I'm fairly confident that they'll do what it takes to prevent a sustained recession.&quot; <br />

WASHINGTON: India’s democracy ''will prove far more resilient than the hateful ideology that led to these attacks'' in Mumbai, US President-elect Barack Obama said on Wednesday as the world reached out to India in sympathy and support over what American analysts described as “India’s 9/11.” Both the incumbent Bush administration and Obama and his transition team sent out strong messages of condemnation of the attacks and their backing for India even as they coordinated their response in the transition phase in the United States. President Bush phoned Prime Minister Manmohan Singh from Camp David early on Thursday morning to offer support and US help in investigation. Soon after, an FBI team from Los Angeles, consisting of bomb and forensic experts, left for Mumbai to help in the investigation. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice briefed Obama over the phone as the White House assembled its national security and intelligence chiefs for discussion and analysis and offered India any help it required. From Chicago, Obama also spoke to India’s ambassador Ronen Sen, to convey that his thoughts and prayers with those affected by “this tragic situation” and brief him about his conversations with Rice. ''These coordinated attacks on innocent civilians demonstrate the grave and urgent threat of terrorism. The US must continue to strengthen our partnerships with India and nations around the world to root out and destroy terrorist networks,'' Obama said in a statement issued through his national security spokesperson, Brooke Anderson. In comments that extolled India’s institutional strength and was directed against the fundamentalist mindset in the neighbourhood, Obama also predicted the triumph of democracy over the sickening ideology of extremism even as terrorists/mujahideen earned universal disgust over the attack of Indian civilians and foreign nationals.<br />

<strong>B. US/India relations avert South Asian nuclear war</strong><br />
Teresita <strong>Schaffer</strong>, Dir – South Asia Progam, CSIS, Washington Quarterly, Spring 200<strong>2</strong>, Lexis<br />
Washington's increased interest in India since the late 1990s reflects India's economic expansion and position as Asia's newest rising power. New Delhi, for its part, is adjusting to the end of the Cold War. As a result, both giant democracies see that they can benefit by closer cooperation. For Washington, the advantages include a wider network of friends in Asia at a time when the region is changing rapidly, as well as a stronger position from which to help calm possible future nuclear tensions in the region. Enhanced trade and investment benefit both countries and are a prerequisite for improved U.S. relations with India. For India, the country's ambition to assume a stronger leadership role in the world and to maintain an economy that lifts its people out of poverty depends critically on good relations with the United States.<br />

American and coalition success in Afghanistan is important for containing Iranian influence in the region, which has been surging not only across the Middle East, but into neighboring regions such as Central Asia. We could also see big power competitors of the United States, namely Russia and China, move significantly -- although not militarily -- into the region to influence outcomes since Afghanistan is on their periphery and both have concerns about Islamist movements among their populations. And, of course, failure in Afghanistan will affect America's stature in the world. As the Afghan situation unfolds in the months to come, both friends and foes will be watching closely for even subtle signs of American intentions, especially its commitment to continuing the fight. Not surprisingly, a lot of strategic hedging is going on among stakeholders in Afghanistan as America works out its strategy. Even a seeming lack of resolve will have consequences, as Afghanistan Commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal said recently in a speech in London: &quot;Uncertainty disheartens our allies, emboldens our foe.&quot; But it goes beyond that. Perceptions of who is winning and who is losing and who is staying and who is going affect the civilian population in Afghanistan -- one that is famous for bending with the prevailing political winds. Having the population on the right side is critical to any counterinsurgency campaign.It is also not outlandish to assume that defeat in Afghanistan to the Taliban would leave the United States looking soft and undependable with both allies and enemies, having a negative effect on American interests across the globe. For example, failure in Afghanistan will ripple into NATO, where America's leadership will be undermined, perhaps, convincing the Europeans of the soundness of their parallel effort to establish a European Union defense policy and force. Asian allies would certainly wonder about their American partner, too. Moreover, coming up short in Afghanistan certainly would not encourage the likes of the recalcitrant regimes in Iran or North Korea to come around to our way of thinking on negotiations over their nuclear and ballistic missile programs. And as the Pakistani foreign minister, Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi, plainly told the Wall Street Journal recently about a U.S. withdrawal before the Taliban is defeated: &quot;This will be disastrous ... you will lose credibility ... who is going to trust you again?&quot; Beyond big power politics, and although seemingly counterintuitive, Afghanistan has proven via the horrors of 9/11 that in some cases it is the weakest nations -- especially failed states -- that can be the source of some of the most significant national security threats.<br />

We can expect similar results if Obama’s Afghan strategy fails and he opts to cut and run. Most forget that throwing South Vietnam to the wolves made the world a far more dangerous place. The Soviets saw it as an unmistakable sign that America was in decline. They abetted military incursions in Africa, the Middle East, southern Asia and Latin America. They went on a conventional- and nuclear-arms spending spree. They stockpiled enough smallpox and anthrax to kill the world several times over. State-sponsorship of terrorism came into fashion. Osama bin Laden called America a “paper tiger.” If we live down to that moniker in Afghanistan, odds are the world will get a lot less safe. Al-Qaida would be back in the game. Regional terrorists would go after both Pakistan and India—potentially triggering a nuclear war between the two countries. Sensing a Washington in retreat, Iran and North Korea could shift their nuclear programs into overdrive, hoping to save their failing economies by selling their nuclear weapons and technologies to all comers. Their nervous neighbors would want nuclear arms of their own. The resulting nuclear arms race could be far more dangerous than the Cold War’s two-bloc standoff. With multiple, independent, nuclear powers cautiously eyeing one another, the world would look a lot more like Europe in 1914, when precarious shifting alliances snowballed into a very big, tragic war. The list goes on. There is no question that countries such as Russia, China and Venezuela would rethink their strategic calculus as well. That could produce all kinds of serious regional challenges for the United States. Our allies might rethink things as well. Australia has already hiked its defense spending because it can’t be sure the United States will remain a responsible security partner. NATO might well fall apart. Europe could be left with only a puny EU military force incapable of defending the interests of its nations.<br />

 <strong>CP TEXT: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase development assistance including reconstruction, infrastructure, health, welfare and education assistance to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan. This assistance should be delivered through western NGOs or provided directly by United States government aid agencies and could include accountability provisions that tie assistance to metrics of performance.</strong><br />

<strong>Iraq proves. Infrastructure assistance to Pakistan solves stability.</strong><br />
<strong>Biden ‘8</strong> (Sen. Joe, D – DE, CQ Transcriptions , “SEN. JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR. AND SEN. JOHN KERRY HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE ON THEIR RECENT TRIP TO AFGHANISTAN, PAKISTAN, TURKEY AND INDIA”, 2-26, L/N)<br />
Thirdly, what we saw and what we heard from all the parties on both sides of the borders is that one of the tools we need to engage in what they call the FATA, the Federally Administrated Tribal Areas, of Pakistan, where the bad guys live and this fellow, Mehsud, who is a local, but is a very bad guy, and is cooperating with Al Qaida, cooperating with Taliban when convenient, having trained some of his folks, we realized that, from what we saw, that there is a direct correlation between the economic assistance in those regions -- roads, water, sewers -- not sewers, roads, water, schools, clinics -- and the ability of the extremists to control those areas and wage jihad from those mountains. So there's a correlation, not just, though, in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, but throughout Pakistan. The same exists on the other side with regard to Afghanistan. The president promised a Marshall Plan for Afghanistan. It has been nothing remotely approaching that. And we saw firsthand, as John said, a young Navy commander, who John was particularly proud of, as a Navy man, but, all kidding aside, he was impressive. This is a kid -- a kid? This is a young man who's standing there before us explaining us the history of each of the tribes, takes out a chart, all the tribes in his area, how he goes out into their villages and talks to them, works out arrangements and caveats. I mean, these are really remarkable women and men we have out there in the field. And so what I came back with was what General Eikenberry had said earlier. He said the Taliban begins where the roads ends. So economic assistance, economic assistance, building schools in Pakistan to compete with the madrassas, building clinics and hospitals and roads on both sides of that border is relatively cheap in light of what we're spending in other areas now, particularly Iraq, and has a gigantic potential payoff.<br />

 <strong>Most US aid now is military oriented. Increasing aid through local NGOs to target the local population is critical to solve militancy. Outweighs the effects of military action.</strong><br />
<strong>Choksy ‘9</strong> (Jamsheed, Prof. Central Eurasian, Indian, Iranian, Islamic and In’tl Studies and former Dir. Middle Eastern Studies Program – Indian U., and member National Council on the Humanities, Diplomatic Courier, “Pakistan Needs a Civilian Aid Surge to Defeat Militantism”, 11-25, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3115:http://www.diplomaticourier.org/kmitan/articleback.php?newsid=448 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.diplomaticourier.org/kmitan/articleback.php?newsid=448" rel="nofollow">http://www.diplomaticourier.org/kmitan/articleback.php?newsid=448</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3115 -->)<br />
Pakistan will receive $7.5 billion in economic aid from the U.S. through 2014. But this desperately-needed, civilian-focused, assistance will trickle in while military resources have a fast track from Washington to Islamabad. Yet rapid, internationally-funded, responses to humanitarian problems would prove more effective against Muslim militantism. As Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. Special Representative to the region, noted, “Things are not sequential. They have to be parallel processes.” The Pakistani Taliban’s destruction of institutions in the 10,500 sq mile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) has been systematic. It is aimed at undercutting the nation’s authority, undermining citizens’ confidence in the state, intimidating local residents into accepting militant authority, and ensuring they have no recourse but to turn to terrorists for employment, law enforcement, administration, education, and health. All those civil institutions need to be rebuilt swiftly for the push back of terrorists to be efficacious. Re-establishing civil society will ensure that Pakistan’s government can function again in the FATA and look out for residents. A parallel lesson comes from Afghanistan where Brigadier General Steven Kwast commented: “We could kill the enemy from now for a hundred years, and we wouldn't be one step closer to winning…. But if the people...trust us more than they trust the Taliban, we will win overnight.” The Pakistani military has been highly successful in driving armed Islamic militants out of the towns and villages. But winter is descending on the FATA and large-scale martial actions will grind to a halt. Then, unless humanitarian assistance and societal reconstruction begin post-haste, the Taliban and their fundamentalist allies will regroup and eventually return to the FATA to retake not only territory but communal control. Consequently, Pakistan needs a civil society aid surge. Less than one-third of FATA’s nearly five million inhabitants live just above poverty-level. Inflation has sky-rocketed. Pakistani officials, such as Governor Owais Ghani of the adjacent North West Frontier Province (NWFP), observe that young Pashtuns enlist with the Taliban and other militias for financial reasons. Not surprisingly, comments like “we would rather build homes, hospitals, schools, and roads than fight” are frequent. Such sentiments demonstrate that economic stability is fundamental to social rejuvenation and, therefore, to counter-insurgency. So facilitating employment opportunities must take priority. Often government authorities detain individuals “for crimes allegedly committed by their fathers or other extended family members” until the true culprits surrender themselves. This means, legal and administrative institutions need to be uniformly rebuilt with Western advice. Revisions to the frontier criminal code have been approved by Pakistan’s president Asif Zardari. Without consistency of law and bureaucracy throughout the FATA, divergent local norms in governance and justice will restart the vicious cycle of inequity, militancy, and societal breakdown. Literacy has fallen to a lowly 17 percent among men and three percent among women because access to quality education became limited when the Taliban destroyed most public schools. Consequently, “fundamentalist madrasas lure hopeful people with promises of knowledge and wealth, and then turn them into lawless hate-filled thugs” lamented one local FATA leader. Education has to be wrested away from Islamic militants and used by the state to promote civil society. Since Islam is a basic aspect of life there, funding appropriately-chosen madrasas will ensure education is wrested away from militant control. “There is little access to safe drinking water or to even rudimentary health care,” observed John Negroponte, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last May. Health and welfare conditions in the FATA have worsened as the Taliban hindered Pakistani and foreign assistance to the region. Again, Pakistan has local resources but those need to be augmented rapidly to avert disease from spreading. If Pakistan and its allies fail to meet these needs then militants will fill the vacuum. Not just funds are needed. Appropriately-trained Western personnel who can augment, guide, and ensure maximum effectiveness among Pakistan’s government and private aid-workers are essential. The recent trend toward retrenchment of USAID, UN, and foreign Non-Governmental Organization employees in the FATA needs to be reversed. More local NGOs need to be utilized as well, for they know the region better while attracting less hostility. But transfer of foreign-funded civilian reconstruction projects to the Government of Pakistan and Pakistani NGOs should be a gradual one. A quick-fire transition would “seriously compromise” both reconstruction and counter-insurgency. A multiyear handover would ensure local organizations, which are highly qualified but lack experience and manpower, come to utilize funding effectively. Despite the region’s danger necessitating protection, foreign military personnel are viewed as threatening Pakistan’s sovereignty. Whenever feasible, Pakistani security must be used to provide support for aid workers. Non-Pakistani security personnel should be associated with civilian assistance and aid workers only if and when absolutely unavoidable. Ultimately, despite the risks involved, civil society projects in the FATA count among the most important the West is undertaking. Consequently, civilian aid needs to be directed strategically and quickly to enhance local capacity in a range of reconstruction activities. Only once sustainable communal and economic growth occurs will counter-insurgency efforts be successful. Military and paramilitary units, despite adequate training and good intentions, can only perform triage on civil institutions. Society, not war, holds the key to lasting success against terrorism. Rapid targeting U.S., EU, and UN aid to civil society restoration efforts will ensure words spoken by Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi in September continue to remain true: “The people of FATA are with us.” Vibrant, safe communities in Pakistan will be the best deterrent to militant fundamentalism.<br />

<strong>The CP solves Pakistan and creates an environment of stability.</strong><br />
<strong>Yaminis and Schirch, ‘9</strong> (Saira, Doc Student from Pakistan at GMU Institute for Conflict Analysis and Resolution, and Lisa, Prof. Peacebuilding – Eastern Mennonite U. center for Justice and Peacebuilding, Daily News Egypt, “Enemy-centric approach in Pakistan doesn't work”, 11-13, L/N)<br />
Likewise, a robust diplomatic process to address outstanding political issues between Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the movement of militant groups, small arms and narcotics across borders, and Afghanistan's accusation of Pakistani interference in its domestic matters, is also necessary to build trust. The United States should ensure a continuous and efficient supply of relief assistance and development aid for the rehabilitation of communities and reconstruction of infrastructure damaged by Pakistani and US military operations against the Taliban. It should also ensure transparency and assist in planning, implementing and monitoring humanitarian and development initiatives. Pakistani civil society groups and relief agencies could help carry out such initiatives, creating a further avenue for cooperation. Developing a comprehensive plan for reconstruction efforts should be the centerpiece of humanitarian confidence building between the United States and Pakistan. Such measures will positively impact perceptions on both sides, creating an environment more conducive to cooperation and long-term stability.<br />

<strong>Infrastructure assistance provides a massive job creation opportunity to reduce the insurgency.</strong><br />
<strong>Nawaz ‘9</strong> (Shuja, Dir. South Asia Center – Atlantic Council, Testimony, Congressional Documents and Publications, 7-7, L/N)<br />
<br />
Pakistan's military now appears to have recognized that the internal threats are more immediate than the looming presence of a powerful India to the east. But it does not have the full training or the equipment to fight an insurgency. When the US talks of Counterinsurgency training it sounds to the Pakistanis that they must abandon conventional defense. We must clarify that this is not the case. Till Pakistan's threat perceptions change, we must be prepared to support its military in creating a hybrid force ranging across a spectrum of capabilities. This will allow them to shift from COIN to conventional, as needed. Pakistan badly needs support that will allow it to move troops rapidly on either of its eastern or western borders and between them. It operates on the basis of the capability of India to the east to inflict damage, if it chooses. Yet, it cannot match India's military might in numbers. Pakistan's security demands the maintenance of a conventional force with a concurrent capability to fight an internal insurgency. But the latter needs to be accelerated to help it regain territory in the North Western part of the country. How can the US become more effective? 1. USAID is broken badly by years of neglect. It must be rebuilt, empowered; given the staff to strategize and manage its projects, develop relationships inside Pakistan, and effectively deliver aid where it is needed. USAID is aptly named: most of its aid money stays in the United States. This must stop. USAID needs to stop being a contract management agency and become again a powerful partner of US diplomacy, working directly with local counterparts to solve local problems. The model of the Office of Transition Initiatives, involving working with recipients of aid on the ground and crafting projects that meet urgent needs in a manner that empowers the locals seems to be working. USAID as a whole might want to move faster toward that model. In Pakistan OTI has had successful pilot projects as has the Narcotics Assistance Section of the US Embassy there. It is not a question of absence of information or experience. Congress should try to move USAID away from wholesale outsourcing of its work to a select few Washington-based organizations with political clout to aid recipients and local NGOs. 2. We must also find better ways to coordinate assistance, so DOD, State, Treasury, Commerce, USTR, DOE and other agencies work together rather than autonomously or at cross purposes. Congress needs to support the Special Envoy's work in this regard. 3. Trade can be a huge supplement to aid. Politically difficult moves such as a Free Trade Agreement and removal of quotas on textiles imports would allow Pakistan to help itself. A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics of Pakistan's textile trade with the United States supports this idea. But, we must encourage Pakistan to move up the value-added ladder toward manufactures, if it is to stay ahead of the population growth curve. 4. A related issue is the Reconstruction Opportunity Zones. These can be useful as a temporary though subsidized salve, not a permanent solution. China's experience indicates that ROZs need to be near major population centers and communications hubs. The Federally Administered Tribal Areas or FATA are too remote a location to give the ROZs long-term viability. There is also the danger of carpetbaggers from other provinces coming in to take advantage of tax holidays and leaving when those facilities disappear. 5. There is a better and faster way to create jobs immediately in FATA. A calculation by ex-World Bank economist Khalid Ikram, melds with my own thinking on this topic. We can employ the young males in the 17 per cent youth bulge in FATA's 3.5 million population by launching major infrastructure projects: major roads linking FATA to Pakistan, small dams and tube-wells to help irrigate cash crops, would help mop up the roughly 300,000 Pakhtun youth who are now the target of Taliban recruitment efforts. Detailed recommendations along these lines were recently made by us in the Atlantic Council's Task Force Report on Pakistan and in my paper for the CSIS on FATA. In my own meeting with 23 Maliks in North Waziristan last year, they were looking for help in building the irrigation infrastructure so they could produce cash crops and process them for export to the Gulf. Locals also appreciated greatly a boat bridge over the Tochi River that reduced travel times by hours. Such civil works would create immediate employment for youth in FATA. And roads linked to Pakistan proper would produce their own spin-off benefits, as tea houses, hotels, repair shops etc. would create an informal sector for more employment of locals.<br />

A. Credibility. Troops are the best guarantee that nuclear threats mean something.<br />
Nye ‘9 <strong>(Joseph, Prof. IR – Harvard U., Korea Times, “Will US-Japan Alliance Survive”, 7-14, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3116:http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2009/07/137_48423.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2009/07/137_48423.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2009/07/137_48423.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3116 -->)</strong><br />
<strong>Japan officially endorses the objective of a non-nuclear world, but it relies on America's extended nuclear deterrent, and wants to avoid being subject to nuclear blackmail from North Korea (or China). The Japanese fear that the credibility of American extended deterrence will be weakened if the U.S. decreases its nuclear forces to parity with China. It is a mistake, however, to believe that extended deterrence depends on parity in numbers of nuclear weapons. Rather, it depends on a combination of capability and credibility. During the Cold War, the U.S. was able to defend Berlin because our promise to do so was made credible by the NATO alliance and the presence of American troops, whose lives would be on the line in the event of a Soviet attack. Indeed, the best guarantee of American extended deterrence over Japan remains the presence of nearly 50,000 American troops (which Japan helps to maintain with generous host-nation support). Credibility is also enhanced by joint projects such as the development of regional ballistic missile defense.</strong><br />

B. Reducing reliance on nuclear weapons triggers Japanese prolif --- this triggers a regional arms race and collapses the NPT.<br />
<strong>Richard</strong> Halloran<strong>, 5/24/</strong>2009<strong>. Military correspondent for The New York Times for ten years. “The Dangers of a Nuclear Japan,” Real Clear Politics, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3117:http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/05/24/nuclear_japan_96638.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/05/24/nuclear_japan_96638.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/05/24/nuclear_japan_96638.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3117 -->.</strong><br />
<strong>That anxiety has reinvigorated a debate about whether Japan should acquire a nuclear deterrent of its own and reduce its reliance on the US. Japan has the technology, finances, industrial capacity, and skilled personnel to build a nuclear force, although it would be costly and take many years. The consequences of that decision would be earthshaking. It would likely cause opponents to riot in the streets and could bring down a government. South Korea, having sought at least once to acquire nuclear weapons, would almost certainly do so. Any hope of dissuading North Korea from building a nuclear force would disappear. China would redouble its nuclear programs. And for the only nation ever to experience atomic bombing to acquire nuclear arms would surely shatter the already fragile international nuclear non-proliferation regime. The main reason Japan has not acquired nuclear arms so far has been a lack of political will. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, the Japanese experienced a deep-seated nuclear allergy. That and the threat from the Soviet Union during the Cold War kept Japan huddled under the US nuclear umbrella. Today, Japanese fear North Korea, which is developing nuclear weapons and has test fired missiles over Japan. Longer run, Japan casts wary eyes on China's expanding nuclear arsenal and is again fearful of a revived nuclear threat from Russia. In addition, Japanese noted that President Obama campaigned for election on a pledge to reduce nuclear arms. Once in office, he has called for their elimination, particularly during a speech in Prague several weeks ago. That has led many Japanese to question whether President Obama can proceed on nuclear arms reduction at the same time he maintains the US commitment to Japan's nuclear defense.</strong><br />

C. Arms race in Asia causes global nuclear war<br />
<strong>Stephen</strong> Cimbala<strong>, March</strong> 2008<strong>. Professor of Political Science at Penn State University. “Anticipatory Attacks: Nuclear Crisis Stability in Future Asia,” Comparative Strategy 27.2, p 113-132.</strong><br />
<strong>The spread of nuclear weapons in Asia presents a complicated mosaic of possibilities in this regard. States with nuclear forces of variable force structure, operational experience, and command-control systems will be thrown into a matrix of complex political, social, and cultural crosscurrents contributory to the possibility of war. In addition to the existing nuclear powers in Asia, others may seek nuclear weapons if they feel threatened by regional rivals or hostile alliances. Containment of nuclear proliferation in Asia is a desirable political objective for all of the obvious reasons. Nevertheless, the present century is unlikely to see the nuclear hesitancy or risk aversion that marked the Cold War, in part, because the military and political discipline imposed by the Cold War superpowers no longer exists, but also because states in Asia have new aspirations for regional or global respect.12 The spread of ballistic missiles and other nuclear-capable delivery systems in Asia, or in the Middle East with reach into Asia, is especially dangerous because plausible adversaries live close together and are already engaged in ongoing disputes about territory or other issues.13 The Cold War Americans and Soviets required missiles and airborne delivery systems of intercontinental range to strike at one another's vitals. But short-range ballistic missiles or fighter-bombers suffice for India and Pakistan to launch attacks at one another with potentially “strategic” effects. China shares borders with Russia, North Korea, India, and Pakistan; Russia, with China and North Korea; India, with Pakistan and China; Pakistan, with India and China; and so on. The short flight times of ballistic missiles between the cities or military forces of contiguous states means that very little time will be available for warning and attack assessment by the defender. Conventionally armed missiles could easily be mistaken for a tactical nuclear first use. Fighter-bombers appearing over the horizon could just as easily be carrying nuclear weapons as conventional ordnance. In addition to the challenges posed by shorter flight times and uncertain weapons loads, potential victims of nuclear attack in Asia may also have first strike-vulnerable forces and command-control systems that increase decision pressures for rapid, and possibly mistaken, retaliation. This potpourri of possibilities challenges conventional wisdom about nuclear deterrence and proliferation on the part of policymakers and academic theorists. For policymakers in the United States and NATO, spreading nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in Asia could profoundly shift the geopolitics of mass destruction from a European center of gravity (in the twentieth century) to an Asian and/or Middle Eastern center of gravity (in the present century).14 This would profoundly shake up prognostications to the effect that wars of mass destruction are now passe, on account of the emergence of the “Revolution in Military Affairs” and its encouragement of information-based warfare.15 Together with this, there has emerged the argument that large-scale war between states or coalitions of states, as opposed to varieties of unconventional warfare and failed states, are exceptional and potentially obsolete.16 The spread of WMD and ballistic missiles in Asia could overturn these expectations for the obsolescence or marginalization of major interstate warfare.</strong><br />

Because these countries within the region have indicated their unwillingness and inability to host more U.S. forces on their lands, the U.S. military has shifted its focus to basing on U.S. sovereign soil.”Guam was “the only location for the realignment of forces” that met “all criteria”—freedom of action, response times to potential areas of conflict and U.S. security interests in the Asia-Pacific region.” It was also considered “ideally” located.

Another highly controversial proposal is the creation of a berth for a nuclear aircraft carrier, which will involve the detonation and removal of 70 acres of vibrant coral reef in Apra Harbor. Environmentalists and local communities oppose this on the grounds that coral provides habitat for a rich diversity of marine life and is endangered worldwide. Environmentalists also question how the disposal of huge quantities of dredged material would affect ocean life and warn that such invasive dredging may spread contaminants that have been left undisturbed in deep-water areas of the harbor. Opposition to this plan has been expressed by the Guam Fishermen's Cooperative and the US-based Center for Biological Diversity. On February 24, 2010, Guam Senator Judith Guthertz wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, reiterating her proposal that the existing fuel pier that has been used by the USS Kitty Hawk be used as the site for the additional berthing to avoid the proposed dredging of Apra Harbor. Such an alternative plan would avoid the destruction of acres of live coral. <br />

<strong>Relocation to Guam devastates the alliance</strong><br />
<strong>McCormack 2010</strong> Gavan, Japanese Bureaucrats Hide Decision to Move All US Marines out of Okinawa to Guam, Professor @ Australian National University, Coordinator of the Asia-Pacific Journal<br />
Hatoyama has stated that “concerning the removal from Futenma, agreement within the government has to be the first priority, and if necessary and the opportunity arises, he wishes to discuss the issue with the President of the United States.” But what is really important is not to re-negotiate the issue with the United States, but rather to coordinate the thinking of the Japanese government and to stop padding the number of Marines involved. If the Foreign Ministry and other bureaucratic organizations were to agree, the Japanese government could set a course of action so that “Okinawa-based Marines would completely relocate to Guam by the year 2014.” This would allow Japan to finally be in line with plans the American forces have already been advancing. (日米首脳会談、要請もできず…米側も消極的) If the complete relocation of Marines to Guam becomes official Japanese government policy, Japan’s subordination to the United States based on the fabricated number of 10,000 Marines remaining on Okinawa will evaporate; in turn this will cause the Foreign Ministry to lose power. Therefore, the Foreign Ministry and other organizations under its umbrella are resisting this with full force. What is in store is a major showdown that will determine the future of Japan. The LDP have taken this chance to criticize the Democrat administration. The LDP should adopt a new policy as a conservative party, ridding itself of the subordinate relationship with the United States and its dependence on the bureaucracy, but it is foolish for it to remain the servant of the bureaucrats. (自民が民主批判の大号令、問題指摘のメモ作成) Within the government, Defense Minister Kitazawa Toshimi has visited Guam. He may well have gone there to see if it is possible for all of the Marines to move from Okinawa to Guam, but it would seem that he was pushed around by the American military authorities there, for while in Guam, he reported that “a complete relocation to Guam is impossible. This would mean a departure from the US-Japan agreement.” In response to this, lower house representatives from the Social Democratic Party criticized Kitazawa saying “how could he stay so briefly, see so little, and conclude that it was impossible?” Fighting has broken out within the ruling coalition as well.

<strong>on the binding condition that Japan accepts the International Whaling Commission quota on commercial whaling.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Failure to stop Japanese scientific whaling will collapse the IWC – happens in the short term</strong><br />
Donald R. <strong>Rothwell</strong>, I. Law Prof @ ANU, 1-8-<strong>2010</strong>, “High seas clash inevitable,” The Age, ln<br />
The third response was to indicate that Australia would commence a campaign to significantly reform the IWC and, in particular, to abolish so-called &quot;scientific whaling&quot;. There has been little real evidence of progress at the IWC, despite the efforts of the Australian Government and other like-minded governments, such as New Zealand. This year may well prove to be pivotal for IWC reform and if there is no breakthrough at the June meeting in Morocco, then hard questions will need to be asked as to whether there is any real prospect of reform while Japan maintains its hard-line position on its right to continue scientific whaling.<br />
<br />
<strong>IWC collapse causes whale extinctions – no controls on commercial whaling</strong><br />
<strong>Whale Watch Westcork, 2009</strong>, “Commercial Whaling,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3122:http://www.whalewatchwestcork.com/commercial-whaling.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.whalewatchwestcork.com/commercial-whaling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.whalewatchwestcork.com/commercial-whaling.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3122 --><br />
Recent meetings between the member countries of the IWC have been dogged with tension and acrimonious exchanges between commissioners of pro whaling nations and those nations opposed to whaling. This has largely been caused by a small number of countries trying to justify their current or future aspirations to resume commercial whaling. Accusations of vote rigging have been made as Japan has purchased votes in favour of a return to commercial whaling from smaller member countries in exchange for preferential trade agreements. This all takes place against the background of a worldwide moratorium on the killing of whales put in place by the IWC in 1986 as many of the great whale species faced extinction following years of commercial exploitation. Some species like the Northern right whale have never recovered and are likely to become extinct within a generation. Over the last few years the number of governments that vote in favour of a resumption of commercial whaling has increased in relation to those anti whaling nations and each year during the IWC annual meetings the tension rises as the pro whaling nations adopt a number of strategies to attempt to get the two thirds majority vote in favour of suspending the moratorium and commencing commercial whaling activities again. As most conservationists believe this would spell disaster for many species of great whale as commercial whaling activities in the past has been dogged by over exploitation and lack of controls resulting in so many species being bought to the verge of extinction.<br />

<strong>IWC collapses causes extinction – global oxygen balance</strong><br />

My own rationale for asking the IWC to decide to adopt a management regime of permanent protection for whales from consumptive commercial exploitation on a global basis is both simple and complex. It is grounded i pragmatic practicalities of both fact and feeling regarding 'Whales in a Modern World'. I am not here arguing for the sanctity of all life on earth. I am not advocating equal rights for all animal species. I am seeking to set forth a rational and moral basis for a future determination by one, specialised, international, human agency that one order of marine mammals should be managed in this manner. Why whales? My rationale most simply is that whales are uniquely special! They really are in a class by themselves. Let me cite four major categories of uniqueness. First, whales are biologically special. Whales include by far the largest animals on earth, growing to be over 30 metres in length - the blue whale (Balenoptera musculus). Whales include the possessors of by far the largest brain of any creature ever to have lived on our planet, weighing four or five times as much as the human brain - the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Whales include the creators of the most complex, long - lasting, repetitive sound patterns of any non - human animal - the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). And whales include species (Tursiops truncatus and some other odontocetes) which exceed humans and all other groups as well in convolutedness or fissurisation of the cerebral cortex. Marine mammal veterinarian Sam Ridgway, of the U.S. Naval Ocean Systems Centre in San Diego, has reported findings that the bottlenose dolphin, in particular, by a variety of measurements (encephalisation quotient, volume of cortex, ratio of brain weight to spinal cord weight, etc.) ranks just below humans and considerably above other higher primates, including gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans. In all these ways whales are truly unique biologically! Second, whales are ecologically special. Whales have evolved as marine mammals over millions of years, with both baleen and toothed whales probably appearing up to 25 million years ago, long before the development of human beings and the latter's intrusion in the ocean ecosystem. Whales are at the top of the vast food chain of the sea. Baleen whales consume the largest amount of zooplankton, and the killer whale (Orcinus orca) is the world's greatest non- human predator. Whales affect the ocean ecosystem in a uniquely global manner, and any exploitation of other marine resources, whether krill or fish, must uniquely take into account cetaceans. Human life depends upon a proper balance in the amount of oxygen in earth's atmosphere produced from the plankton that is kept in check most critically by whale consumption.<br />

<strong>The permutation doesn’t solve the net benefit- we have to use the plan as leverage to get Japan to stop whaling, they have literally no incentive to do so in the status quo</strong><br />

Efforts to place more stringent regulations on current whaling practices at the International Whaling Commission’s annual meeting at the end of June led to a stalemate. As a result, Japan, Iceland, and Norway will continue scientific and unregulated whaling including within the borders of the Southern Ocean Sanctuary, a 19-million-square-mile area near Antarctica where most of the world’s whales feed. The three countries have killed an estimated 30,000 whales since the moratorium was placed on commercial whaling in 1986. According to the Associated Press, many Japanese people feel the vigilance of the anti-whaling movement is rooted in cultural prejudice against Japan. In 2008, Shigeko Misaki of the Japan Whaling Association gave a statement that anti-whaling “has almost become a religion. People who believe this religion think all Japanese people are evil, because we kill whales.”<br />

<strong>Supreme Court will rule against California now</strong><br />
Thomas <strong>Claburn, ‘10</strong>, April 26, 2010, (InformationWeek, Supreme Court To Review Video Game Law, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3125:http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/privacy/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=224600474 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/privacy/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=224600474" rel="nofollow">http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/privacy/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=224600474</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3125 -->)<br />
&quot;As the Court recognized last week in the U.S. v. Stevens case, the First Amendment protects all speech other than just a few 'historic and traditional categories' that are 'well-defined and narrowly limited,'&quot; he said. &quot;We are hopeful that the Court will reject California's invitation to break from these settled principles by treating depictions of violence, especially those in creative works, as unprotected by the First Amendment.&quot; In U.S. v. Stevens, the Supreme Court ruled that a ban on depicting animal cruelty violated the First Amendment -- a ruling that had no bearing on the illegality of acts of animal cruelty. Michael L. Lovitz, an attorney at law firm Buchalter Nemer in Los Angeles, said he believes the Supreme Court is likely to uphold the lower court's ruling. &quot;It seems to me that the 9th Circuit was pretty much dead-on in its decision,&quot; he said in a phone interview. &quot;The State's evidence really was insufficient to support the high burden that it had to meet, particularly given that the industry has set up a self-regulating, neutral board to rate games.&quot; Lovitz suggests that it is the nature of our political system that politicians back laws of dubious constitutionality to address issues that strike an emotional chord with voters. &quot;If they come across an issue they believe their constituents are concerned with, it behooves them to address it if they want to get reelected,&quot; he said. <br />

It's a hot button issue to be sure, and one mired in more than a few extenuating debates that will likely rage on -- such as the one we mentioned earlier that formed part of the basis for California Democrat Leland Yee's original bill that kick-started this whole debate. Up for judgment by the Supreme Court in the near future, however, is whether or not video games are protected by the First Amendment. The ECA, a non-profit that &quot;represents gamers,&quot; has tapped the very folks they're repping and created an official gamer petition that will be added into the court documents when the case begins in earnest. This is a debate likely to generate some rather heated opinions, but if you're curious about the actual details (and indeed you should be), you can check out the full filing with some much-needed breakdowns by the good folks over atGamePolitics, including the previous rulings and the original bill.<br />

<strong>Controversial rulings sap Court Capital – tradeoff with other controversial rulings</strong><br />
Jeffery <strong>Mondak, ’91</strong>, PhD Candidate @ Indiana University, April 1991, (American Politics Quarterly, Substantive and Procedural Aspects of Supreme Court decisions as Determinants of Institutional Approval, v19, n2, p. 185)<br />
The impact of the content of Supreme Court rulings has important ramifications for the future credibility of the Court. Because unpopular decisions exert negative influence on institutional approval, the Supreme Court would seem to be the master of its own institutional fate. As Choper (1980) explains: The Court’s prestige and authority is of a broad institutional nature, and when the Court expends its store of capital it tends to do so in a cumulative fashion…[I[f one or another of the Court’s rulings sparks a markedly hostile reaction, then the likelihood that subsequent judgments will be rejected is greatly increased. (P. 156) The substance of a majority of Court decisions does mirror the policy preferences of the American public (Marshall 1988, 1989), suggesting that the Court has been able to preserve its institutional credibility, whether deliberately or coincidentally, by minimizing rulings likely to prompt hostile public reaction.<br />

The U.S. Supreme Court waded into murky and, perhaps, treacherous waters Monday when it agreed to decide whether the Constitution permits California to prohibit the sale of violent video games to people younger than 18. Lower courts already have struck down the five-year-old statute as an impermissible infringement on free speech because it attempts to extend existing regulations on obscenity to depictions of violence. This is a well-intentioned but ill-conceived law that not only undermines several generations of legal progress toward making free speech a day-to-day reality in this country, but also threatens an emerging industry in which California and the U.S. play a leading role. <br />

Modern video and computer games offer a rich landscape of adventure and challenge that appeal to a growing number of Americans. Games capture and hold the attention of players for hours as they struggle to operate a successful football franchise, help Romans defeat the Gauls, or go through the strict regimen of Army basic training in virtual landscapes. People acquire new knowledge and complex skills from game play, suggesting gaming could help address one of the nation’s most pressing needs — strengthening our system of education and preparing workers for 21st century jobs. Numerous studies of American competitiveness completed in the past few years have emphasized that America’s position in the world depends increasingly on maintaining leadership in technology.1 And they emphasize that this can only be accomplished if American workers are prepared to move quickly in response to technical change, and be ready for new jobs and careers as they emerge. The success of complex video games demonstrates games can teach higher- order thinking skills such as strategic thinking, interpretative analysis, problem solving, plan formulation and execution, and adaptation to rapid change. These are the skills U.S. employers increasingly seek in workers and new workforce entrants. These are the skills more Americans must have to compete with lower cost knowledge workers in other nations. Games and simulations can also serve as powerful “hands-on” tools for teaching practical and technical skills, from automotive repair to heart surgery. In addition, today’s students who have grown- up with digital technology and video games are especially poised to take advantage of the features of educational games. <br />

<strong>Global nuclear war</strong><br />

<br />
On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because a world in which the United States exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with the world's major problems, such as nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts. Finally, U.S. leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling the United States and the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.<br />

Videogames may be facing their gravest challenge yet in the States at the Supreme Court, but at least one lawyer thinks that the EMA stands a good chance at victory. Back in April, the US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of &quot;Schwarzenegger vs. EMA&quot; - the proposed Californian law that would ban the sale of violent games to minors - a case that was dubbed the &quot;most important challenge&quot; to gaming by the Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA). The case just recently entered its first stages, and is set to be decided this fall. In a bit of good news, Jomo S.

<br />
The Supreme Court said today it will hear a challenge to a California law that makes it illegal to sell violent video games to minors. The law was blocked by a federal judge before it could take effect, but this is the first time the highest court has agreed to render a verdict on the issue: The California law now in question prohibits the sale of video games to minors under 18 &quot;where a reasonable person would find that the violent content appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors.&quot; As with laws governing obscenity, the state statute exempts games that have &quot;serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.&quot; At least nine other states and localities have enacted similar restrictions, including Washington, Minnesota and Illinois. In California, retailers are subject to $1,000 fines for each violation. In every other case, though, the legislation has been defeated in court as a violation of the First Amendment. The Supremes now have a chance to settle this question once and for all. In all likelihood, the California law will also be ruled unconstitutional and overturned (as the Entertainment Software Association predicts) and this will end the legal debate over whether states have the power to manage video game sales in the same way they do tobacco and alcohol sales. <br />

Slim chances Unfortunately for both Lee and Schwarzenegger, similar attempts to ban the sale of violent games to minors have been made in the past, and they have yet to be successful. In addition to California, these laws have been struck down in states like Michigan, Louisiana, and Washington. This does mark the first time that the issue will be put before the Supreme Court. If the law fails here, as seems likely by past rulings, the issue may finally be put to rest. <br />

<strong>Rulings enforcing Human Rights deplete Court Capital</strong><br />

Perry., p. Lexis)<br />
<br />
These observations lead to what I view as one of the most troubling implications of Perry's theory. As previously suggested, Perry makes noninterpretivism respectable by conceding that the Court, when undertaking noninterpretive review, engages in a nonconstitutional lawmaking function There can be no doubt that the Court's ability to facilitate effective and meaningful moral evaluation of public policy -- indeed, ultimately, its ability to perform its noninterpretive function at all -- depends crucially on its institutional prestige. Even when it engages in interpretive review, the Court often has been reminded of its limited political capital and cautioned that its forays into the political process must be tempered by discipline and moderation. 51 Professor Perry, however, would have the Court intervene in the political processes with a confident ferocity for the purpose of enforcing its &quot;own moral vision&quot; of human rights. The question arises whether the fierce activism Perry espouses will have the effect of seriously depleting the Court's political capital and undermining ultimately its ability to undertake effectively its functions of both noninterpretive and interpretive review.<br />

<br />
The critical question thus becomes how deep the Court's diffuse support among the general public is; for if theory holds, this is the leash on which the Court operates. Actually, a bungee cord might be a better analogy; for, in operation, the diffuse support hypothesis suggests that the judiciary can stray a certain distance from public opinion but that ultimately it will be snapped back into line. n393 Testing the length and flexibility of the cord is hard to do, however. It may be that there is greater tolerance for judicial deviation in some directions, such as with regard to the First Amendment. n394 Although the Court's degree of freedom of movement around public opinion may not be certain, positive scholars are fairly confident that one major determinant is information. The dynamics here are complex, but some generalities may be possible. Both negative and positive reactions to the Court influence public opinion, but negative reactions seem to be more intense and have a shorter half-life. n395 Perhaps it is for this reason that the [*328] less people hear about the Court, the better for it. n396 As time passes, people develop a store of good feelings about the Supreme Court, reflected in the Court's relatively strong performance in public mood indicators. n397 Commentators who have studied public opinion and the Court regularly advise it to keep a low profile. n398<br />

<strong>Controversial Decisions tradeoff</strong><br />
<strong>Grosskopf, et al, ’98</strong>, Anke Grosskopf, Professor Political Science @ University of Pittsburgh, Jeff Mondak, Professor of Political Science @ Florida State, September 1998, (Political Research Quarterly, v.51, number 3, p 635)<br />
<br />
The existence of a strong link between basic values and diffuse support does not necessarily preclude a role for specific decisions, particularly when we seek to understand how support comes to change over time (e.g. Caldeira and Gibson 1992: 658-61). We believe that any claim that the Supreme Court is fully immune to backlash against controversial decisions can be rejected on a prima facie level. First, consider the extreme case. Were the Supreme Court to make its occasional blockbusters – Brown v. Board of Education, Roe v. Wade, Texas v. Johnson, etc. – the norm by routinely ruling on the thorniest social questions, we see it as implausible that such actions would bring no cumulative impact on how people view the Court. Second, the Supreme Court’s typical mode of operation suggests that justices themselves view institutional support as an expendable political capital (Choper 1980). That is, the Court recognizes its own political limitations, and thus justices pick their spots carefully when approaching potentially controversial cases. From this perspective, the apparent dominance of democratic values as a determinant of institutional support (e.g., Caldeira and Gibson 1992) means not that the Court is insulated from backlash, but that strategic justices tread cautiously so as to keep backlash to a minimum. Consequently, how and where we examine whether public response to Supreme Court decisions affects institutional support may shape what answer we find.<br />

<strong>Capital is finite – plan trades off</strong><br />

Res. 937, SYMPOSIUM: JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY: SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT BALANCE: Judicial Accountability in a Time of Legal Realism, p.Lexis)<br />
<br />
Let me offer some other examples. Assume that a judge believes that ruling in a particular way, although correct on the law, might undermine the ability of the judicial system to effectively function as an institution. The federal judiciary, like other branches of government, possesses a limited repository of political capital from which its legitimacy is derived. Accordingly, a judge might be concerned, as Alexander Bickel warned, that judicial authority could be undermined if the courts too easily spend that capital by issuing opinions that are perceived (even if erroneously) as being illegitimate or if they reach decisions that are unlikely to be enforced by the other branches. 17 Imagine, then, a judge who is sensitive to this concern and who, on this basis, decides to ignore the governing rule of law and decide a case &quot;incorrectly.&quot; Should she be held accountable for her actions? I have often thought (without proof), for example, that the Court's decision in Marsh v. Chambers, 18 upholding legislative prayer, was an instance in which the Court ruled the way it did even though it did not seriously believe it was following the correct rule of law. 19 Rather, it [*941] upheld the practice because it feared that Congress would ignore its decision (and continue to open its sessions with legislative prayer) and thus expose the federal judiciary's vulnerability to disobedience by the other branches. But if I am correct in my assessment of the case and the Court majority willfully violated the law, should the majority Justices be sanctioned or should the preservation of the courts' legitimacy itself be considered a legitimate judicial function?<br />

The computer and video game industry last year generated jobs for 220,000 people and nearly $9 billion in wages and federal and state personal income tax revenues, according to a new study on the impact of the entertainment software industry on the U.S. economy released today. The study also found that the industry generated an additional $10.5 billion in economic activity from the sale of computer and video game software, and some related game hardware. &quot;This new study clearly dramatizes the growing importance of the video game industry in America's high-tech sector,&quot; said Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), which commissioned the study by Nathan Associates Inc. &quot;With the introduction of new advanced game machines, surging demand for video game software, and an expanding base of dedicated and casual game players, it's clear that the industry will be a major force in the American economy for years to come.&quot; The detailed study of U.S. Government census and other economic data shows that sales in the game software industry in the year 2000 grew at a rate of 14.9 percent per year, more than double the rate of growth of the U.S. economy as a whole and far outpacing sales growth in related industries. Moreover, growth in employment, and wages in the computer and video game industry between 1995 and 2000 far outpaced growth in other major U.S. industries. For example, wages generated by the computer and video game industry showed an annual growth rate of 17.4 percent, and employment generated by the industry grew at 10.1 percent per year. By comparison, motion picture production, distribution and allied services sectors, widely considered to be the king of America's entertainment industries, have recognized growth in annual wages of 9.2 percent and employment of 5.2 percent during the same period. Equally striking, the video game industry job and wage growth rates outstripped those of such high-tech stalwarts as the computer manufacturing industry, consumer electronics and computer storage industries. The study also revealed that the entertainment software industry is a leader in research and development. The report shows that the game software publishing industry devotes 14 percent of its receipts to research and development compared with other entertainment industries, which devote 9 to 12 percent of sales to R&amp;D.<br />

Modern video and computer games offer a rich landscape of adventure and challenge that appeal to a growing number of Americans. These games capture and hold the attention of players for hours as they struggle to operate a successful football franchise, help Romans defeat the Gauls, or go through the strict regimen of Army Basic training in virtual landscapes. People acquire new knowledge and complex skills from game play, suggesting that gaming could help address one of the nation’s most pressing needs — strengthening our system of education. In addition, today’s students who have grown-up with digital technology are especially poised to take advantage of educational games. Some organizations with significant education and training needs are experimenting with games for learning. For example, the U.S. military released America’s Army in July 2002, a game designed to attract and teach potential recruits about the Army. More than six million users have registered as America’s Army players, about three million have completed the game’s basic combat training, and some three million players have taken the three lecture Combat Medic Course embedded in the game and tested their skills by playing that role in America’s Army. In another example, the Tactical Language Trainer2 for teaching language skills and foreign culture includes a simulation in which learners interact with virtual characters using a speech recognition interface. All branches of the U.S. military have learning games under development. Some off-the-shelf commercial computer games are being used in high-school classrooms. For example, Civilization III 3 — a computer game about the development and growth of world civilizations — is used in classrooms around the world to teach history, geography, science, the arts, and other subjects, though the game designers did not intend for it to be used in this way.4 Other commercial video games that have been used in K-12 schools include: SimCity, a city planning game; and Roller Coaster Tycoon, a game used in classrooms to teach physics concepts such as gravity and velocity.5 Education and workplace skill acquisition are not objectives of games designed for entertainment. However, features associated with commercial games hold promise for developing games that are effective tools for education and training. Such games could break the “test and tell” instructional paradigm prevalent in education today, potentially: ¢ Increasing the speed at which expertise is acquired and depth of understanding achieved; ¢ Increasing learner ability to transfer expertise acquired to the solution of practical tasks; ¢ Decreasing the range of outcomes among learners; and ¢ Making learning more motivating, if only to get more time-on-task. Despite this potential, digital educational games have not had wide adoption in mainstream education and training. THE GAMES FOR LEARNING SUMMIT To explore how the United States can harness the powerful features of digital games and simulations for learning, the Federation of American Scientists, the Entertainment Software Association, and the National Science Foundation invited approximately 100 experts to craft a plan of action to realize the potential of educational games to address the nation’s education and training needs. Participants included: executives from the video gaming industry and educational software publishers, researchers and experts on technology and pedagogy, game developers, representatives of user communities such as teachers and the U.S. military, R&amp;D funders, and government policy-makers. They met in a National Summit on Educational Games, on October 25, 2005 in Washington, DC. The Summit focused on four questions: ¢ What features of video and computer games can be used to improve education and training, and what aspects of learning are most amenable to the new approaches offered by games? ¢ What kinds of research are needed to identify the features of gaming that can be effective in education and training? ¢ What makes education such a difficult market for innovative com- mercial developers? ¢ What kinds of changes in instructional practices and management of educational institutions are needed to take advantage of the power that games could bring to teaching and learning? Summit panelists (Appendix A) presented findings and views on these questions. Summit participants (Appendix B) offered their reactions, additional knowledge, and advice on the information and issues highlighted by panelists. This report captures the findings and recommendations participants made to foster the development, commercialization, and adoption of games for learning. Literature and other studies are used to amplify and reinforce the Summit findings. WHY SHOULD THE UNITED STATES FOCUS ON DIGITAL GAMES AND LEARNING? The United States confronts a world of rapid change, intense global competition, and rapidly advancing technology. These forces are affecting what people need to know and be able to do on the job. Rapid technological advancements — including revolutions in information technology, biotechnology and nanotechnology — will have profound, disruptive, and unpredictable effects. These technical advances drive, indeed demand, profound changes in the organization of work in the industries affected and redefine the skills required for successful employment. Numerous studies of American competitiveness completed in the past few years have emphasized that America’s position in the world depends increasingly on maintaining leadership in technology.6 And they emphasize that this can only be accomplished if American workers are prepared to move quickly in response to technical change, and be ready for new jobs and careers as they emerge. Workforce globalization is rapidly expanding, driven by economic reforms in developing nations, widespread deployment of high-speed telecommunications, and the global delivery models of multinational businesses. The United States cannot compete in this highly connected system of global commerce on the basis of low wages, commodity products, and standardized services. It must compete by taking the lead in the next generation of knowledge creation, technologies, products and services, business models, and dynamic management systems. Businesses must be able to translate innovations into new products, services, and processes quickly in response to rapidly changing markets. In short, the new competitive realities suggest the United States must move to what former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan calls a “conceptual economy”, in which the key resource is thinking, creative people and their good ideas. The nature of work in a leading-edge conceptual or innovation-based economy is already emerging, and characterized by: ¢ Fast pace, new situations, and changing priorities; ¢ Distributed development, production, and service delivery; ¢ Diverse, global customer base; Constant exploitation of technological advancements; ¢ Continuous improvement of products, services, and solutions; ¢ Multidisciplinary team environments in agile organizations; and ¢ Teams, companies, suppliers linked in virtual enterprises that span the globe. As this more demanding work environment emerges, many employers have signaled that the skill curve is moving upscale. The basic skills employers now frequently require include excellent oral and written communications, and the ability to work in teams. However, employers increasingly demand higher- order thinking and doing skills. Exhibit A lists some of the skills employers increasingly seek. Studies of how people can best master the kinds of expertise demanded by the new economy emphasize the importance of learning through experiences that can make the power of new ideas come alive. Students remember only 10 percent of what they read; 20 percent of what they hear; 30 percent, if they see visuals related to what they are hearing; 50 percent, if they watch someone do something while explaining it; but almost 90 percent, if they do the job themselves, even if only as a simulation.7 When individuals play modern video and computer games, they experience environments in which they often must master the kinds of higher-order thinking and decision-making skills employers seek today. In addition, educational games that incorporate simulations provide a way to bridge the gap between abstract concepts or theoretical knowledge and practical skills, an important way to translate what is learned in training to application in the workplace. <br />

<strong>CP Text is the plan minus &quot;international law&quot; and replaced with a relevant treaty</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>iLaw is horribly ineffective—the courts should instead base decisions on multilateral treaty law</strong><br />

J. Int'l L. 229]<br />
As globalization proceeds apace, we are confronted with questions of how we are to structure the new international order. The first question revolves around the appropriate level for lawmaking: What rules should be global in scope and what are still appropriately set at the level of the nation-state or through bilateral or regional compacts? In my view, stated elsewhere, the appropriate scope for global lawmaking is fairly circumscribed.n1 In the absence of global rules, it is true that nation-states sometimes create what economists would term externalities because they lack full incentives to take account of harms they cause outside their borders. The presence of such externalities, however, does not necessarily mean that an international regime to address them would have long-term net benefits. Any political regime also creates the potential for externalities, as leaders and factions use the apparatus of the regime for their own benefit, to the detriment of the general public. Such political externalities are likely to be particularly great in international lawmaking because citizens have even less control over international lawmaking than they do over domestic lawmaking, making it easier for the public interest to be abused by faction. Moreover, international solutions can create lock-in problems, displacing regulatory experimentation by disparate nation-states. National sovereignty has unsung virtues precisely because under appropriate conditions the regulatory autonomy of sovereign states may sustain a healthy competition among different policies and ideas. n2 Thus, global [*231] international regimes should be created only when their benefits outweigh the political externalities and loss of jurisdictional competition they engender. This essay addresses a complementary question from a similar public choice perspective: Assuming international rules of global scope are appropriate, what is the best process for generating such rules? In particular, are provisions in global multilateral agreements likely to be superior to customary international law? What should be the relation between international rules formed through global multilateral agreements, like the World Trade Organization (WTO), and customary international law if the two conflict? Scholars do not universally agree about the appropriate hierarchy between customary international law and international agreements. For instance, some scholars think customary international law should have priority in some circumstances.n3 This essay explains why the rule that multilateral agreements take priority over conflicting custom is a sound one. At least in the modern world, the multilateral treaty process is more likely than the customary international lawmaking process to generate rules that are both beneficent and legitimate. While a debate over the appropriate hierarchy of global multilateral agreements and customary international law may seem a technical one, it captures two very different views of the sources of political legitimacy and role of international law in the modern world. Always giving priority to multilateral agreements suggests that international order will be constituted by contracts among nation-states, focused on solving problems through express bargaining. Under this paradigm, solutions to international problems are particularistic and are ultimately rooted in the political legitimacy of the nation-state which gives assent to written terms by which it will be bound in a multilateral agreement.n4 [*232] In contrast, because modern customary international law depends on ambitious inferences about state behavior that jurists and publicists make, giving priority to customary law even in some circumstances moves the law away from the actual decisions of nation states. n5 Moreover, because inferences about customary international law are sometimes made from disparate subject matters and because the principles it generates are not embedded in the context of multi-provision agreements, customary international law has a tendency toward generating principles that become independent of context. In short, customary law is immanent law - principles drawn from the entire universe of state interactions - whereas the law of multilateral agreements is a conscious construct of a particular time and place. Custom for its generation also depends in some measure on the determinations of elites - those judges and publicists who discover its principles. In contrast, multilateral agreements depend directly on officials accountable to governments, which in an increasingly democratic world means officials more accountable to citizens of disparate nations. The choice, to use the roughest of domestic analogies, is between a process that is much like the democratic process of statute making where various frameworks are forged from compromise often without any pretense that they unfold from some common principlesn6 and one that is more like a common law judicial process in which judges &quot;work the law pure&quot; by a process of inference overtly or covertly influenced by normative considerations. n7 I will argue below that this analogy is in fact too generous to customary international law, because the customary international law process has substantial defects that do not afflict the common law. Thus, the process for global multilateralism has more substantial advantages over customary international law than any that the legislative process enjoys over common law. These substantial advantages should be reflected in absolute priority of multilateral agreements over conflicting customary international law. One caveat is important to note. My praise for multilateral agreements is purely comparative: their content is more likely to represent the consensus of citizens than customary international law. [*233] Multilateral agreements, and particularly the agencies they establish, may well have large agency costs and other defects, like the suppression of jurisdictional competition. Thus, I believe the appropriate scope of multilateralism is often limited. But within that scope, multilateral agreements are generally to be preferred to customary international law. One other larger implication of this essay is methodological. My comparison of multilateral agreements and customary international law proceeds from concepts familiar to domestic political science, such as agency costs. In my view, our understanding of international lawmaking will be much improved if we connect it to such concepts and analogies, because their relative clarity and greater reticulation help make better predictions about the conditions under which various kinds of international lawmaking may be most beneficial.n8 For too long, international law has been an island cut off from the usual methodologies now applied to both public and private law. This essay is divided into two parts. First, I compare and contrast the process for generating global multilateral treaties and for customary international law. I suggest that provisions of multilateral agreements should be followed even if they conflict with customary international law.n9 Multilateral agreements are likely to produce more legitimate and beneficent norms than customary international law. The process of discovering customary international law is fraught with difficulty and uncertainty and tends to result in principles with vague and uncertain contours. Both its process of derivation and its vagueness tend to undermine its legitimacy and claim to beneficence. In contrast, multilateral agreements are generated by a process not unlike a supermajoritarian legislative process. Like legislatures, multilateral bargaining sessions among nation-states can generate codes of conduct rather than vague principles.<br />

<strong>The CP offers a superior policy proposal to iLaw that the government can and should embrace</strong><br />

J. Int'l L. 229]<br />
Even if the current hierarchical relation between multilateral agreements and customary international law is other than I suggest that it should be, the considerations adduced here can be seen as a policy proposal to change that hierarchy. In this sense, this essay is similar to the proposals by contract scholars to cut back on the use of custom as a mode of contract interpretation mandated by the UCC. n93 But an interesting meta question lurks. How should decisions about the hierarchy be generated? From the discussion above, it is clear that the hierarchy would best be generated by a global multilateral agreement, rather than by customary international law. Thus, if a global multilateral agreement gives itself priority over customary law, the priority has been generated in the optimal manner.<br />

Fourth, there are a variety of other means of developing international norms that are more effective and more likely to promote a vital legal order. The ozone and trade regimes demonstrate that the world possesses a wealth of possible trade-offs, incentives, and other means of encouraging participation and compliance. Nations that perceive that it is in their interest to sign an environmental treaty or human rights convention will participate. Even nations that do not consider a treaty in their interest can be motivated to participate: China and India have reversed their positions and signed the treaty to protect the ozone layer. China, contrary to its earlier expressed will, is slowly entering into consensual human rights relationships in order to fully participate in and exercise a leadership role on the world stage. 363 Indeed, China cannot afford to not participate. Over time the powerful levers of World Bank and International Monetary Fund resources, as well as the inducement of foreign aid, have enticed nations to hold democratic elections, release political prisoners, and consider environmental protection measures. The pressure of world opinion and the changing attitudes of a country's citizens, impacted by satellite television and the Internet, will make participation in important treaties irresistible for most nations. Patience, as well as vision, is a virtue. [*542] Finally, the fundamental question for international society is: Through what processes will international law be made? The CIL process cannot generate norms perceived as legitimate when there is conflict about these norms or their formulation. Domestic legislatures find it difficult to resolve normative conflicts even in relatively homogenous societies. The CIL process encourages posturing and the hardening of positions, not the development of general law with majority support. In fact, this process, as it now stands, may engender bitterness and noncompliance. Wide participation, trade-offs, and negotiations are necessary to resolve differences in values and interests in a manner that engenders legitimacy, promotes commitment to agreed norms, and ultimately encourages compliance. CIL provides only &quot;paper&quot;, and not viable, norms, which vary from culture to culture. International legal scholarship should be more modest. There are adequate means of developing international norms consistent with democratic values and respectful of domestic processes. The failure to agree on a multilateral treaty is, in and of itself, a powerful international decision. That there is not yet agreement on the full range of legal principles found in domestic systems means only that much work remains to be done. Increased globalization, the increasing convergence of information, values, and perspectives, and the rising need for common principles to resolve international disputes portend a fertile period of international norm-creation and problem solving. If the function of CIL has been to create general law binding on all states, then there are other, more effective means of building a true international consensus. The world is moving to a new pre-federal stage in which global problems such as trade and the spillover effects of pollution, ethnic cleansing, and disease must be addressed in a systematic way. In an era of instantaneous communication and rapid global travel, there is no need for the use of the incomprehensible process of CIL. The manipulation of ambiguous incidents and the universalizing of political events are no longer necessary and undermine the integrity of the international order. The fiction of general acceptance or common consent is a poor substitute for other modes of lawmaking. The U.S. and many other nations will not accept norms that limit their sovereign prerogatives without specific agreement. Only a consensual process will permit nations with diverse values and interests to negotiate standards that reconcile differences and meet common needs. [*543] State practices will continue to play a role in law formation. The customary practices of a few states, however, should not be seen as a source of law, but rather as the tentative steps in the ongoing process of the development and articulation of norms. The definitive articulation of a norm requires a ritual, such as the decision of an authoritative court or the ratification of a treaty that specifies the existence and approximate content of a norm, when it becomes effective, and the states bound by it. If the goal is a world legal order, then the attempts to universalize standards, without the participation and consent of states, impede progress rather than promote it. CIL, as a source of international law, should therefore be discarded.<br />

<strong>Comparative analysis proves treaty law is superior to CIL—compliance, textual foundation, and specificity</strong><br />

J. Int'l L. 229]<br />
Global multilateral agreements like the WTO represent the considered view of a large majority of nations, if not all nations. Similarly, customary international law in its classical form, at least, is supposed to represent a rule that commands the tacit assent of all nations.n10 In its modern versions, the requirement that the rule represent the universal, if tacit, assent of nations has been transformed into the less stringent requirement that the rule represent a general practice of nations pursued as a matter of international legal obligation. For instance, the Restatement of Foreign Relations Law states that &quot;customary international law results from a general and consistent practice of states followed by them from a sense of legal obligation.&quot; n11 [*236] While the notes to the Restatement specifically refuse to define how widespread a practice must be to qualify as customary international law, they do say that the practice must have &quot;wide acceptance&quot; by the states involved in the relevant activity.n12 Although other conceptions of customary international law, which I address below, compete with the modern version of its classical form, the focus on wide acceptance as a key to customary law's generation is the definition most widely accepted. In other words, the rules that emerge from both global multilateral and customary international lawmaking aspire to represent the consensus of at least a very substantial supermajority of nations engaged in a particular activity. As both political science and economic theory suggest, supermajority rules have very substantial attractions.n13 Unlike majority rules, they make it hard for a bare majority of actors to choose rules that impose substantial net costs on other actors subject to the rules. n14 Supermajority consensus also provides evidence that the rules have a high degree of net benefits since such a large number of actors benefit from the rules. n15 Finally, it is very likely that the rule endorsed by a supermajority is a good one because of the common sense proposition formalized in some of the literature that the more widely agreed upon a rule, the more likely it is to reflect true facts and a consensus of values. n16 Supermajority rules also have their defects, such as holdout costs, n17 but for our purposes these are relatively unimportant since multilateralism and customary international law (at least in its classical form) both share similar problems in this respect. Rules of global governance generally are consensus rules and this essay focuses on which process will best assure that the benefits of the consensus rules are captured. I briefly discuss below nonstandard theories of custom that relax the stringent consensus requirement and suggest that in the [*237] absence of a global demos their very high agency costs outweigh whatever advantages they have in avoiding the constraints of supermajoritarian consensus. Of course, in both the case of global multilateralism and customary international law, the supermajority at issue is that of nation-states. If nation-states do not reflect the wishes of their citizens, the emerging rules may well not generate net benefits overall. The rule may provide benefits to the leaders and the narrow factions supporting them and yet impose larger losses on the population in general. Similarly, one cannot be as confident that the rule represents a consensus of values and true facts about the world. Happily, nations today are increasingly democratic and even most of those that are not democratic are not totalitarian and thus must take some account of their citizens' preferences.n18 Nevertheless, despite the benefits inherent in supermajoritarian consensus, citizens of even democratic nations face agency costs in controlling their leaders and preventing them from rewarding interest groups at the public's expense. These costs can be particularly high in the international arena for a variety of reasons. First, the international arena is opaque to most citizens, and this lack of transparency empowers leaders and the factions that support them.n19 Citizens lack understanding of the working of even domestic agencies, n20 and average citizens would find the workings of international lawmaking even more remote and opaque. Second, more may be at stake in formulating a rule that binds the world than a single nation. If an interest group succeeds in getting a rule that puts its competitors at a disadvantage it can obtain rents on a global scale.n21 Thus, the resources that an interest group would be willing to [*238] invest to gain an international rule that provides rents may be higher than in the domestic context. To be sure, a supermajoritarian consensus tempers some of these concerns as well. Global multilateral agreements like the WTO need the assent of a very substantial majority of nations. It is unlikely that the same interest groups will dominate all countries.n22 Indeed, it is likely that opposing interest groups will dominate different nations: companies that produce steel will be an important interest group in one nation and companies that use steel inputs for their products will be important in another nation. Some nations, like the United States, have companies that specialize in the creation of new intellectual materials. Others, like India, have specialized in cheap production of intellectual materials made elsewhere. n23 Nevertheless, the dynamic of countervailing interests cannot always be relied upon, and greater transparency in international law will always be advantageous. Accordingly, in assessing whether the process for global multilateral agreements or customary international law is likely to generate the better rule when the two conflict, it is important to consider two axes. First, which is actually more likely to reflect something approaching a very substantial consensus of the nation-states of the world? Second, which is more likely to reduce the agency costs of citizens who monitor their state's acceptance, thus ensuring that the rule better reflects net benefits for the people of the world (and the consensus of their values and factual judgments) rather than simply benefits a narrow faction? On both of these axes, global multilateral agreements seem much superior to customary international law. I emphasize that my purpose here is comparative. International lawmaking and certainly international administration have high agency costs, however carried out. These costs are among the reasons that international lawmaking should be quite circumscribed and should seek to preserve regulatory competition among nation-states except in those instances where there are substantial spillover effects from activities [*239] among nations and where regulation of those externalities will not cause more harm than good.n24 B. The Epistemic Superiority of Multilateralism over Customary International Law<br />
The first advantage of multilateral agreements over customary international law is that they provide a more precise definition of the agreed upon rule for the simple reason that the provisions to which states have agreed are written down in the text of the agreement. This clarity is important because it is the meaning understood by those who choose the rule that has a strong presumption of beneficence.n25 Of course, a residue of ambiguity infects all written texts, but at least the writing is a starting point. And treaties have a negotiating record to clarify the ambiguities. In contrast, customary international law is often not generated by an agreed-upon text, but by inferences from state practices that raise more substantial questions about the content and scope of its principles. n26 Second, multilateral treaties provide more assurance that states have actually agreed upon the principles as obligatory principles of international law, because the states signed and then ratified the text at issue in order that the treaty come into force. Our confidence that a rule is beneficent because of its supermajoritarian nature can be only as strong as our confidence that a consensus of states have actually accepted the principle. In contrast, multiple epistemic difficulties afflict the ascertainment of whether states have accepted a rule of customary international law. A customary law principle is created only when states both widely follow a practice and widely accept it as law. Both elements raise serious issues. First, substantial debate exists over what can constitute evidence of state practice.n27 Some scholars suggest that only acts of states can constitute state practice, while others suggest that statements can also be evidence of state practice. For instance, scholars debate over whether [*240] UN resolutions count as state practice.n28 Thus a level of uncertainty remains as to the materials from which state practice can be inferred. n29 Each category of evidence proffered for customary international law is itself surrounded by further uncertainty. First, translating states' actions into a description of a practice is parlous because actions can be described in various ways.n30 Second, some claims and statements on which jurists rely provide only scant evidence that a state has actually consented to a principle. For instance, UN General Assembly resolutions are nonbinding n31 and thus create a substantial accountability problem. When a nation makes a commitment to an international obligation that is enforceable, the future costs of compliance make its assent meaningful. In contrast, talk is cheap and a vote in favor of a General Assembly resolution may mean correspondingly little. n32<br />

<strong>Treaties are superior to CIL—more binding, textual, legitimate, and democratic</strong><br />
<strong>Kelly 2k</strong> [J. Patrick, Associate Professor of Law, Widener University School of Law; founder and Director, Nairobi International Law Institute, J.D. Harvard Law School; B.A. University of Delaware, The Twilight Of Customary International Law, Virginia Journal of International Law, 40 Va. J. Int'l L. 449]<br />
In this article, I argue that CIL should be eliminated as a source of international legal norms and replaced by consensual processes. My goal is not to undermine international law, but to encourage the use of more democratic, deliberative processes in formulating this law. My argument has three components. First, the substantive CIL norms of the literature lack the authority of customary law and therefore are not binding on states. CIL lacks authority as law, because such norms are not, in fact, based on the implied consent or general acceptance of the international community that a norm is obligatory. Both implied consent and general acceptance are fictions used at different historical periods to justify the universalization of preferred norms. In a world of many cultures and values, general acceptance is neither ascertainable nor verifiable. Second, CIL has evolved into a meaningless concept that furnishes neither a coherent nor objective means of determining the [*453] norms of international law, how and when they come into existence, and which nations are bound. As an undefined and indeterminate source, it is unable to perform its assigned function as a relatively objective source of international norms based on social fact. Third, the CIL process lacks procedural legitimacy. The process of norm formation, as actually practiced, violates the basic notion of democratic governance among states and is a particularly ineffective way to generate substantive norms that will command compliance. Few nations participate in the formation of norms said to be customary. The less powerful nations and voices are ignored. There is little consideration of alternatives and trade-offs in reconciling diverse values and interests. Consequently, CIL should be discarded as a source of law and replaced by consent-based processes that permit wide participation, the discussion of alternatives, and the commitment of nations to their norms.<br />

Moreover, multilateral agreements are generally ratified in a manner that provides better assurance that they represent the views of the citizens of the nations as a whole, providing more robust legitimacy and reducing agency costs. As totalitarian nations disappear, it is becoming clearer in the modern world that treaty ratification helps reflect the democratic consensus in disparate nations. In contrast, those who [*234] declare the content of customary international law principles - legal academics and international courts - can provide less assurance that their views represent the consensus of the states, let alone the peoples of the world. Thus, unless otherwise clearly stated in the text of the global multilateral agreement, provisions in that agreement should trump customary international law.<br />

In international law both torture and “other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” or “inhuman treatment” are forbidden. 3 The European Court of Human Rights stated that the “difference between torture and inhuman treatment ‘derives principally from a difference in the intensity of the suffering inflicted.’” 4 Torture is absolutely prohibited for all reasons. The International Convention Against Torture (CAT) states: “No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.” Signatories to CAT, like the United States must “undertake to prevent” inhuman treatment, but the “no exceptional circumstances” statement that applies to torture is omitted. 5 This does not condone cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Planning, authorizing or carrying out torture is a war crime. 6 The United States is a CAT signatory. The Senate ratification softened the international definition by providing that torture includes the intent to inflict severe physical or mental pain and by narrowing the definition of mental pain. Commenting on the news reports of treatment of Al Qaeda prisoners at Bagram air base, Prof. John Parry concludes that if true, they “reveal that the United States is involved or implicated in a range of interrogation practices that are illegal under domestic and international law.” 7<br />

<strong>iLaw serves bureaucracy not interests of the state—crushes any benefit</strong><br />

Perhaps the most pernicious effect of recent trends in international law is the proliferation of international and national bureaucracies. When the United States fashions a new international organization as a vehicle for advancing new rules and regulations, that institution persists. International organizations rarely die, even if and when they outlive their utility. This is particularly true for those organizations with secretariats and physical assets under their control. One observer notes, &quot;The [*335] UN Charter's slogan of 'we the people of the world' still only thinly disguises a reality of 'we the bureaucrats the world.'&quot; 44 The result is, at best, a lot of bureaucratic deadwood on the international stage, draining countries of resources, time, and patience. At worst, these organizations become well-connected advocacy groups with little to no accountability to anyone, expecting to be treated like states. The result is a situation where a significant share of an international organization's membership is made up of other international organizations. For example, 35 percent of the Financial Stability Forum's membership consists of other international institutions, groupings, and committees. Furthermore, regulatory coordination often leads to the creation of new bureaucracies at the national level in order to implement multilateral agreements. 45 A certain degree of regulation is necessary for any economy, but the recent wave of international law lets a thousand regulatory agencies bloom. The deleterious effects of such bureaucratic proliferation for a democratic society are legion, and have been discussed elsewhere. 46 And as difficult as it is to shut down international organizations, eliminating established national bureaucracies is next to impossible.<br />

<strong>US adherence to iLaw does not bind other nations to international norms</strong><br />

J. Int'l L. 5]<br />
For all of these reasons, mechanisms of interstate cooperation are needed. Often these can take the form of treaties, but treaties typically are long in coming, and there may be a need for interim rules to guide behavior until affected states find it to their mutual advantage to enter into actual pacts. The conventional, traditional account of CIL holds that these interim rules become law once a large enough number of states act in accordance with these rules so as to create binding custom. Such rules are said to be rooted in nearly universal practice by drawing an inference from the silence of dissenting states. Unless the dissenting state is a &quot;consistent objector,&quot; it is deemed to consent to the rule by its silence. This is, of course, a legal fiction. Consent drawn from silence is a dubious form of consent. The dissenting state may have received imperfect notice of the rule. This is especially true under new CIL conceptions holding that widespread practice in certain cases may not be necessary. But even under prior views, it would often be difficult for a state to know which practices were adopted by other states, and whether they were adopted for reasons of politics, expediency, or comity - rather than out of a sense of legal obligation. And even if the state had notice of the practice, there ordinarily is no readily available mechanism for lodging dissent. Would it even make sense to &quot;pick a fight&quot; with one's neighbors over a rule that might not then have real, on-the-ground consequences for the troubled state? What seems surprising, at least to the novitiate, is that this search for law-cum-implied-consent is not necessary even in situations where background understandings are needed to guide interstate relations. Consider, for example, a state's practice of not extending diplomatic immunity to accredited representatives of other states for purely civil wrongs having nothing to do with their state responsibilities. New York City's perpetual dispute with UN representatives who are parking violation scofflaws comes to mind. Even if we could determine that most states would accord a broader immunity to foreign diplomats in their territories, and even if this rule were informed by a judgment that this represented the best understanding of the scope of diplomatic [*9] immunity as a legal concept,n9 why would the United States be obligated to conform to the wider understanding? The United States, if it allowed New York to enforce these parking violation obligations, would be incurring some costs in terms of inviting reciprocal treatment of its ambassadors in other countries or other undesirable reactions. The United States would, of course, be wise to take these potential consequences into account in deciding whether to uphold New York's claim. In the largely predictive process of determining whether adverse reactions would likely ensue, the United States should act with knowledge of what other states do in like circumstances. But, from Westphalian premises, it is difficult to understand how the United States would be violating any legal obligations to the scofflaw state, absent a treaty, in disregarding these prudential concerns in favor of New York's interest in uniform enforcement of parking rules. In other words, widespread practices of other states inform expectations and should be consulted, for departures from custom may invite disputes, but they are not law binding on dissenting states. At least two objections might be raised at this point. One might be a claim sounding in efficiency: We are better off with a uniform interstate rule if we are interested in reducing the sources of interstate tension, and presumably the widespread practice that other states follow must be doing a fairly decent job of reconciling the trade-off between domestic law enforcement and tranquil diplomatic relations. A similar point is often made in discussion of default rules under U.S. contract law: If the default rules do a good job of capturing widespread assumptions of most parties to contracts, they maximize aggregate efficiency, because it is better to visit the transaction costs of changing the rule - in this context, by contracting around it - on the few who prefer a different arrangement. This kind of aggregate welfare analysis is difficult to apply to states in an international system. It would seem a Herculean task, even for a Rawlsian, to determine state preferences, compare utility across states, and arrive at net welfare calculations. What states actually do is often difficult to discern. States may voice fidelity to particular practices by enshrining them in their positive law, but due to the inaccessibility of their legal systems, such practices are largely honored in the breach. More fundamentally, if the states are the relevant actors in this Westphalian world, why are they not the best articulators and evaluators [*10] of their own preferences? In addition, the costs of contracting away from the CIL rule must be considered. In some cases, the costs may be modest because states by bilateral treaty can negotiate inter se departures from the customary rule. In other situations, the costs may be considerably greater because departures from the customary rule will have to be extended, as a practical matter, to all similarly affected states. In my parking example, this would seem to be the case, as the United States would have difficulty negotiating special arrangements for a particular state's scofflaws without extending the same to others. A second objection is grounded in distributional concerns. Strong states should not be able to compel weaker states into doing their bidding; it is far better to have uniform rules that &quot;level the playing field.&quot; An analogy might be drawn to the provisions in domestic contract law for vitiating unconscionable contracts. Of course, if we are in a Westphalian world, this kind of objection can be ruled inadmissible. Law in such a world does not redistribute power endowments; it promotes cooperation where states find it in their mutual interest to cooperate. Moreover, as a purely descriptive matter, it is doubtful that weak states benefit from CIL. Often, it is the stronger states like the United States that are first-movers in establishing the groundwork for later arguments heralding the emergence of binding custom. Does the analysis change when departures from customary understandings involve, unlike my New York City parking example, the imposition of significant costs on other states? Consider what might have ensued had the Supreme Court ruled in The Paquete Habanan10 that fishing vessels owned by nationals of a state with whom the United States was in an armed conflict could be seized as a prize of war. Such a ruling certainly would have offended Spain (and its Cuban allies) and might have resulted in similar seizures of vessels owned by U.S. nationals. Perhaps the United States would also have incurred reputational costs with other states that might then begin to view the United States as an unreliable partner for trade or other endeavors that call for international cooperation. But the question would be the prudential one of comity, to be addressed perhaps in the first instance by the courts, but subject to guidance from the President and his advisors: Is the contemplated departure from prevailing expectations of how warring states should behave &quot;worth the candle&quot; in terms of the [*11] benefits, if any, of such a departure as against the ensuing costs of disagreement? The putative &quot;obligation&quot; of the United States to honor the customary rule plays no real role in the analysis of what the United States should do in these circumstances. In sum, on purely functional grounds, the case for CIL in a Westphalian world is difficult to sustain. At most, there is a claim for comity - that one should adhere to widespread practices of other states in order to avoid costs of disagreement or promote interstate cooperation. A state ordinarily is well advised to extend comity, except where the benefits of departing from customary arrangements outweigh the costs of doing so. What about an emotive, value-oriented, ideational argument for CIL? For instance, suppose a state is concerned not only with the welfare of its citizens but also with the welfare of inhabitants of other states, whether out of a sense of ethnic group solidarity or a broader based regard for others. Would it not be desirable to speak in terms of binding customary law, if only as a prod to improve the behavior of other states? Of course, nothing stops any state from publicizing its disagreements with the practices of others, or even entering into multistate covenants to condemn on moral grounds certain practices, such as slavery, genocide, apartheid, or &quot;ethnic cleansing.&quot; The question here is what particular contribution to this sort of agenda is made by having an established CIL tradition, and whether any benefits outweigh the attendant costs. It might be argued that since at least traditional CIL formulations required a showing of widespread state practice, recognition of a CIL rule against, slavery, for example, conceivably might help brand as &quot;outlaws&quot; outlier states that persisted with their pernicious conduct. This might also provide some justification for taking coercive measures, such as imposing trade sanctions, on those states. But it is not clear what is added by laying a mantle of CIL over what is essentially a campaign against the morality of other states. States presumably should have good reasons before intervening in the internal affairs of other states, but saying that those reasons amount to &quot;law&quot; offers little information as to why those reasons are sufficient to privilege intervention. And even if there were some incremental branding benefit in calling &quot;illegal&quot; the &quot;immoral&quot; conduct of other states, one would have to ask whether this benefit is outweighed by the costs to state sovereignty generally of authorizing a system whereby a form of non-treaty &quot;law&quot; could be created without the consent of the [*12] affected states. In a Westphalian world, the likely costs would seem to predominate over the likely benefits.<br />

ALTHOUGH international law has always been a consideration for American foreign policymakers, it has rarely commanded the focus of their attentions. Under the next president, this will have to change. Since the Cold War's end, a number of international organizations, human rights activists and states have worked to transform the traditional law of nations governing the relationship between states into something akin to an international regulatory code. This &quot;new&quot; international law purports to govern the relationship of citizens to their governments, affecting such domestic issues as environmental protection and the rights of children. Among other things, it would: nearly eliminate the unilateral use of military force; and create the unattainable requirement of avoiding all civilian casualties in combat; promote the criminal prosecution of individual state officials by the courts of other states and international tribunals; and permit--or even require--international &quot;humanitarian&quot; intervention in a state's intern al affairs. Recast as such, international law constitutes a real and immediate threat to U.S. national interests. The impetus for extending the reach of international law stems from both our allies and our adversaries, who have chosen to use it as a means to check, or at least harness, American power. While each group has different strategic goals, from the perspective of both, the great &quot;problem&quot; of international affairs in the post-Cold War world is the unchallenged military, diplomatic, economic and even cultural predominance of the United States. [1] Our global antagonists, particularly China, would like to see the United States disengage from world affairs. For our allies, who continue to depend far too much on U.S. military might to wish for a new American isolationism, the great danger has become American &quot;unilateralism&quot;--an all-purpose term for U.S. action not sanctioned by the &quot;international community.&quot; They do not want to prevent U.S. global engagement; they want to influence and control it. Both our allies and our adversaries understand the value of international law in achieving their ends. Law and its rhetoric have always played a far more important role in the United States than in almost any other country. We are a nation bound together not by ties of blood or religion, but by paper and ink. The Declaration of Independence itself was, at its heart, an appeal to law--the laws of nature and of nature's God--to justify an act of rebellion against the British Crown. As Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in the early days of the American republic: [t]he influence of legal habits [in the United States] extends beyond the precise limits I have pointed out. Scarcely any political question arises in the United States that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a judicial question. Hence all parties are obliged to borrow, in their daily controversies, the ideas, and even the language, peculiar to judicial proceedings. [2] Tocqueville was clearly prescient. Today almost every key policy issue in the United States is framed as a legal question. Law is our genius and our Achilles' Heel. If the trends of international law in the 1990s are allowed to mature into binding rules, international law may prove to be one of the most potent weapons ever deployed against the United States. The good news is that international law, properly configured, should not be viewed as a burden for our foreign policy. Rather, it can function as a positive force, capable of promoting a more stable international environment and advancing our national interest. As the world's pre-eminent power, we have both the greatest opportunity and the most pressing need to shape international law. To do so successfully in the years ahead, though, will require a keen appreciation of how international law evolved over time and of what specific legal problems have confronted American foreign and defense policy over the last decade. Moreover, international law imperatives will have to be integrated into American statecraft. For just as war is too important to be left to the generals, international law cannot be left solely to the lawyers. The Assault on the Westphalian Order THE CURRENT international order, in which the most important actor is the independent nation-state, dates from the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, which ended Europe's religious wars. Traditional international law, better described as the &quot;law of nations&quot;, was built around this system. It was defined in 1758 by one of its early scholars, Emerich de Vattel, as &quot;the science of the law subsisting between nations or states, and of the obligations that flow from it.&quot; This law developed over time, primarily by the actual practice of states interacting with one another, and had little, if anything, to do with the relationship between citizens and their own governments. For this reason, the law of nations accommodated widely divergent domestic political systems, ranging from absolute monarchies to authoritarian and totalitarian regimes to democracies. It was not, moreover, enforceable through any regular legal or judicial process, but only by political means--up to and including war. In this manner, international law, which lacked the legitimacy enjoyed by law made by an elected and accountable legislative body, was fully compatible with the principles of self-government upon which the American republic was founded. Indeed, the Constitution itself recognizes the existence of the law of nations, and specifically gives Congress the authority to define offenses against that law. In the aftermath of World War II, however, attempts to impose limitations on states through international legal strictures gained a new currency. The murderous policies of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan prompted renewed international efforts to leash the dogs of war and, even more broadly, to impose a range of duties and obligations on sovereign governments. These endeavors involved not only limiting--through the UN Charter--the right of states to use force against other states, but also sought both to regulate the relationships between national governments and their citizens and to create tangible enforcement mechanisms, other than the use of raw political or military force. Thus, the conceptual foundation for the new international law was in place by the late 1940s. Because of Cold War imperatives, however, these efforts produced little effect in the way states actually behaved. With the end of the Cold War things have changed. Activists, scholars, international institutions like the United Nations, and even a number of governments (including, episodically at least, the Clinton administration) have redoubled their efforts, championing a new international legal order by which states are subject to the will of the elusive &quot;international community&quot; at large. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been the leading force in this process. They have been particularly active in promoting the adoption of international treaties and conventions, including the Rome treaty (which established the new permanent International Criminal Court, or ICC), the Land Mines Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. NGOs have also worked to steer and hasten the evolution of customary international law, an area where traditionally only state practice gave rise, at a rather glacial pace, to the emergence of legal norms. Now customs seem to be spawned overnight, through nothing more tangible than the convening of scholarly conferences or the publication of papers. Significantly, it is now alleged that states do not have any choice in deciding whether to comply with these newly minted international law norms. The NGOs have been arguing that they are able to represent public aspirations at both the national and global levels--that is, to speak for the (nonexistent) &quot;global civil society&quot;--better than any government. While these claims are quite obviously false--NGOs are not elected, not accountable to any body politic, and are not inherently better or worse than other special interests--such groups have had considerable success in shaping the new international law. These groups were omnipresent during the 1998 Rome Conference , which adopted the ICC treaty, and actually achieved mention as vessels of the &quot;public conscience&quot; in the Land Mines Convention. The substantive body of the new international law that these groups have sponsored has a number of specific manifestations, not all of them entirely consistent with each other. These include claims that heretofore purely domestic public policy issues--such as the death penalty, abortion, gay rights, environmental protection, and the relationship between parents and children--must be resolved in accordance with &quot;prevailing&quot; international standards; that, with the possible exception of repelling armed attack, only the United Nations Security Council can authorize the use of military force; that the &quot;international community&quot; is entitled to intervene under a variety of circumstances in the internal affairs of states; and that the actions of individual civilian and military officials of states fall under the purview of international criminal jurisdiction. At the core of these efforts is a frontal assault on sovereignty as the organizing principle of the international system. Proponents of the new order are not shy about saying so. Among the new international law's strongest supporters is Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who has plainly stated, Great nations who understand the importance of sovereignty at various times cede various portions of it in order to achieve some better good for their country. We are looking at how the nation-state functions in a totally different way than people did at the beginning of this century. [3] The Threat to the United States ALTHOUGH THE Clinton administration has been generally supportive of the new international law, its key tenets create problems of the highest order for the United States. First, as a philosophical matter, any attack upon the principle of sovereignty threatens the very foundation of American democracy. Sovereignty is the necessary predicate of self-government. As Vattel wrote, a &quot;sovereign State&quot; is one that &quot;governs itself, under what form so ever.&quot; Any limitation on sovereignty as an organizing principle, any &quot;cession&quot;, to paraphrase Secretary Albright, is an abdication of the right of the citizens of the United States to be governed solely in accordance with their Constitution, and by individuals whom they have elected and who are ultimately accountable to them. To the extent that international law allows supranational, or extra-national, institutions to determine whether the actions of the United States are lawful, ultimate authority will no longer be vested in the American people, but in these institutio ns. Thus, for all of its humanitarian and democracy-building rhetoric, the new international law is profoundly undemocratic at its core. Indeed, with its lack of accountability and disdain for democratic practice (as opposed to rhetoric), it arguably poses the greatest challenge to Francis Fukuyama's anticipated global triumph of liberal democracy. If the aspirations of today's international law proponents were ever to prevail, the resulting international system would not remotely resemble a community of democratic nations. Second, as a practical matter, the new international law has the potential to undermine American leadership in the post-Cold War global system. Even more fundamentally, international law may well make the world safe for aggression, by imposing undue constraints on those countries that are willing to use force to deter and punish it. Although, as noted above, the new international law has a number of manifestations, those elements dealing with the use of military force, and the potential consequences for individual American officials who order or implement its use, are the most advanced and pernicious. As the world's pre-eminent military power, with global interests and responsibilities, the United States should be very concerned about any effort to create international judicial institutions capable of prosecuting individual soldiers, officers and elected officials in the chain of command. <br />

Although the Clinton administration has been generally supportive of the new international law, its key tenets create problems of the highest order for the United States. First, as a philosophical matter, any attack upon the principle of sovereignty threatens the very foundation of American democracy. Sovereignty is the necessary predicate of self-government. As Vattel wrote, a &quot;sovereign State&quot; is one that &quot;governs itself, under what form so ever.&quot; Any limitation on sovereignty as an organizing principle, any &quot;cession&quot;, to paraphrase Secretary Albright, is an abdication of the right of the citizens of the United States to be governed solely in accordance with their Constitution, and by individuals whom they have elected and who are ultimately accountable to them. To the extent that international law allows supranational, or extra-national, institutions to determine whether the actions of the United States are lawful, ultimate authority will no longer be vested in the American people, but in these institutions. Thus, for all of its humanitarian and democracy-building rhetoric, the new international law is profoundly undemocratic at its core. Indeed, with its lack of accountability and disdain for democratic practice (as opposed to rhetoric), it arguably poses the greatest challenge to Francis Fukuyama's anticipated global triumph of liberal democracy. If the aspirations of today's international law proponents were ever to prevail, the resulting international system would not remotely resemble a community of democratic nations.<br />

In advocating homogenization, international law and institutions have produced a fertile environment for internecine strife in Africa, 97 furthering the intense socio-cultural cleavages that have characterized post-colonial African states, and facilitating coercive nation building in the newly decolonized states. 98 This section will address how international [*523] law and institutions facilitated attempts by African states to homogenize 99 their populations in the name of nation building. It will then explore the relationships among the attempts at homogenization, the incidence of internecine strife within African states, and the role of law in the process. The attempt by post-colonial African leaders to homogenize the diverse and differentiated polities/peoples that had been agglomerated to form states is often aptly described in the literature as nation building. 100 The need these states felt to construct a unitary nationhood out of the multifarious and diverse nations that composed the new states animated the nation-building enterprise. Nation building was fueled both by the ideological stance of international law and by the practical concerns of those in power, whose self interested pursuits were tolerated, if not encouraged by international legal attitudes. As Benyamin Neuberger has noted, the dominant streams of European thought consider the unitary, unfragmented nation as the ideal, the optimal state-form. 101 Diverse nationhood has been viewed historically as almost invariably negative due to its supposedly divisive, centrifugal nature. Under the influence of this ideology, most African states became somewhat obsessed with the repression of socio-cultural differences, 102 a move that has often been characterized as a turn away from tribalism. 103 The attempts by Africa's post-colonial leaders to sustain large, centralized states also has encouraged homogenization for practical reasons. [*524] From Zaire to Nigeria, Morocco to the Sudan, Uganda to Mali and Chad to Ethiopia, leaders have been quite wary of the negative effects of internal disunity. These leaders soon became obsessed with maintaining the states bequeathed to them by the departing colonialists. Little did it matter that, at least at that time, few of these new states possessed the actual capacity to control the full extent of their territory. 104 The post-colonial leader could not tolerate difference and division, which might weaken the state and leave it open to enemy infiltration. 105 In the hope of preventing secessionist agitation, most states' leaders eschewed the practice of federalism, local autonomy, minority rights, and any other device that might, in their view, decentralize power and reduce the level of control exercised by the central regime over the sub-groups. This, in turn, led to struggles by minority groups for local power and autonomy, which in some cases intensified into violent internal conflict. 106 The repression of socio-cultural differences was not, however, a simple maneuver in which leaders sought to eliminate differences in one straightforward push. It was a more complex undertaking, executed by maintaining the fiction of the mono-cultural state or by only &quot;paying lip service&quot; to respect for socio-cultural pluralism. 107 In many cases, such lip service included constitutional protections against discrimination on the grounds of racial, ethnic, or other kinds of socio-cultural difference. 108 In other cases, it included the adoption of federalism as the basis of nation building. Yet, in most states the rash of military and civilian coups against the constitution ensured that such federal arrangements were overridden by the unitary command structure of military and civilian dictatorial regimes. Traditional international law and institutions did not explicitly proscribe, or even discourage, such self-interested pursuit of homogenization by African leaders. Nor did the law traditionally mandate either consensual nation-building or the practice of state decentralization. Until recently, few commentators agreed that the right to self-determination applied in the non-colonial context of the internal politics of established states. In general, traditional international law did [*525] not overtly concern itself with the legitimacy of the internal structure or conditions of states. Although the legal and historical background against which these leaders sought to construct homogenous nations out of the fragmented, newly decolonized states may explain their actions, in the end, the nation-building projects embarked upon by most of these leaders were problematic. They idealized the coercive, even violent, homogenization of the fragmented populations of African states, which was both contrary to contemporary social norms and impractical for a number of reasons. Rarely in our time has coercive nation-building resulted in success, largely due to its conflict with contemporary prevailing norms. The coercive approach has not necessarily failed because of its intent; strength and unity of purpose can be achieved by forging a number of diverse cohesive groups into a single and stronger one. After all, as Thomas Franck observed, &quot;what is a nation, other than a synthesis of other, earlier, vanished or submerged 'nations?'&quot; 109 Rather, for the most part, the approach has failed because in our contemporary view of human rights, violent, coercive unification and repressive homogenization are morally and socially bankrupt. 110<br />

The Rabid Tiger Project believes that a nuclear war is most likely to start in Africa. Civil wars in the Congo (the country formerly known as Zaire), Rwanda, Somalia and Sierra Leone, and domestic instability in Zimbabwe, Sudan and other countries, as well as occasional brushfire and other wars (thanks in part to &quot;national&quot; borders that cut across tribal ones) turn into a really nasty stew. We've got all too many rabid tigers and potential rabid tigers, who are willing to push the button rather than risk being seen as wishy-washy in the face of a mortal threat and overthrown. Geopolitically speaking, Africa is open range. Very few countries in Africa are beholden to any particular power. South Africa is a major exception in this respect - not to mention in that she also probably already has the Bomb. Thus, outside powers can more easily find client states there than, say, in Europe where the political lines have long since been drawn, or Asia where many of the countries (China, India, Japan) are powers unto themselves and don't need any &quot;help,&quot; thank you. Thus, an African war can attract outside involvement very quickly. Of course, a proxy war alone may not induce the Great Powers to fight each other. But an African nuclear strike can ignite a much broader conflagration, if the other powers are interested in a fight. Certainly, such a strike would in the first place have been facilitated by outside help - financial, scientific, engineering, etc. Africa is an ocean of troubled waters, and some people love to go fishing.<br />

<strong>-- iLaw cannot solve the environment—not binding and vague</strong><br />
<strong>Kelly 2k</strong> [J. Patrick, Associate Professor of Law, Widener University School of Law; founder and Director, Nairobi International Law Institute, J.D. Harvard Law School; B.A. University of Delaware, The Twilight Of Customary International Law, Virginia Journal of International Law, 40 Va. J. Int'l L. 449] <br />
The repetition of non-binding instruments cannot create a conviction that simply is not present in any of the instruments. Consider, for example, the primary environmental and human rights [*487] declarations such as the Universal Declaration, the Stockholm Declaration, and the Rio Declaration. These are all aspirational; 168 they neither create nor promise legal obligation. 169 Aspirational or recommendary instruments, enacted while states remain unwilling to sign concrete treaties, provide compelling evidence that states lack the normative conviction necessary to create customary obligations, rather than evidence that states believe these norms are binding. In the environmental arena, the claims of &quot;new CIL&quot; theorists that these instruments provide persuasive evidence of opinio juris are particularly tenuous. 170 The aspirational language of environmental instruments is expressed at such a high degree of generality and accompanied by equally general countervailing goals, such as the sovereign right to exploit resources, that these instruments provide neither concrete norms nor guidance on how to balance its conflicting goals of a right to development and of sustainable development. 171 Both the Stockholm and Rio Declarations permit [*488] each nation to determine as a sovereign prerogative the appropriate balance of both promoting development and protecting the environment. 172 Neither instrument provides, as the Restatement asserts, that the harm prevention principle is a legal obligation. Approval of aspirational recommendatory resolutions provides little indication of a nation's actual policy position or normative conviction. The problems of environmental degradation and biodiversity are systemic issues of international public policy that must be addressed in concrete fashion. Vague, non-binding resolutions cannot resolve the conflicting positions of states and make the necessary trade-offs among competing goals. The proper allocation of costs, the choice among alternative liability regimes, and the balancing of developmental goals with environmental objectives raise difficult issues of efficiency, distributive justice, and intergenerational equity. 173<br />

<strong>Status quo solves liberal democracy</strong><br />
<strong>Deudney and Ikenberry ‘9</strong><br />
(Daniel, Prof. Pol. Sci. @ Johns Hopkins U., and John, Albert G. Milbank Prof. Politics and Int’l. Affairs @ Princeton U. and Global Eminence Scholar @ Kyung Hee U., Foreign Affairs, “The Myth of the Autocratic Revival: Why Liberal Democracy Will Prevail”, January/February, Ebsco)<br />
AFTER TWO decades of post-Cold War liberal triumph, U.S. foreign policy is being challenged by the return of an old antiliberal vision. According to this vision, the world is not marching toward universal liberal democracy and &quot;the end of history.&quot; Rather, it is polarizing into different camps and entering an era of rivalry between Western liberal states and dangerous autocracies, most notably China and Russia. Unlike the autocracies that failed so spectacularly in the twentieth century, today's autocracies are said to be not only compatible with capitalist success but also representative of a rival form of capitalism. And their presence in the international system supposedly foreshadows growing competition and conflict and is dangerously undermining the prospect of global cooperation. Several recent developments seem to support this emerging view. Democratic transitions have stalled and reversed. In China, the Communist Party dictatorship has weathered domestic challenges while presiding over decades of rapid economic growth and capitalist modernization. Rising oil prices have empowered autocratic regimes. In Russia, Vladimir Putin's government rolled back democratic gains and became increasingly autocratic. At the same time, relations between Russia and the West have deteriorated from the near amity of the early post-Cold War era, and China and the West remain divided over Taiwan, human rights, and oil access. Meanwhile, much less powerful autocratic states, such as Venezuela and Iran, are destabilizing their regions. There even appear to be signs that these autocratic states are making common cause against the liberal Western states, with nascent alliances such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The United Nations, and particularly the Security Council, has returned to the paralysis of the Cold War. In this view, the liberal West faces a bleak future. The new prophets of autocratic revival draw important foreign policy implications from their thesis. One of the most forceful exponents of this new view, Robert Kagan, insists that it is time for the United States and the other liberal democracies to abandon their expectations of global convergence and cooperation. Instead, they should strengthen ties among themselves, perhaps even through a formal &quot;league of democracies,&quot; and gird themselves for increasing rivalry and conflict with the resurgent autocracies. Containment rather than engagement, military rivalry rather than arms control, balance of power rather than concert of power — these should be, according to such theorists, the guideposts for U.S. foreign policy. Fortunately, this new conventional wisdom about autocratic revival is as much an exaggeration of a few years of headlines as was the proclamation of the end of history at the end of the Cold War. The proposition that autocracies have achieved a new lease on life and are emerging today as a viable alternative within the global capitalist system is wrong. Just as important, the policies promoted by the autocratic revivalists are unlikely to be successful and, if anything, would be counterproductive — driving autocracies away from the liberal system and thereby creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Although today's autocracies may be more competent and more adept at accommodating capitalism than their predecessors were, they are nonetheless fundamentally constrained by deep-seated incapacities that promise to limit their viability over the long run. Ultimately, autocracies will move toward liberalism. The success of regimes such as those in China and Russia is not a refutation of the liberal vision; the recent success of autocratic states has depended on their access to the international liberal order, and they remain dependent on its success. Furthermore, the relentless imperatives of rising global interdependence create powerful and growing incentives for states to engage in international cooperation regardless of regime type.<br />

<strong>Lots of alt causes to democracy decline</strong><br />
<strong>Virilio 07</strong> (Paul, a renowned urbanist, political theorist and critic of the art of technology. Pure War – Twenty-Five Years Later. Introduction, p. 9.)<br />
Today we need to think rather in terms of Impure War—I’m not sure it’s being called that, surely not—but really the whole question of deterrence has changed in nature. Deterrence is no longer aimed only at the military sector, but essentially at the civilian population; from which we get The Patriot Act, Guantanamo. We can cite similar phenomena in other countries; and, of course, the terrorist disequilibrium. The deterrence of Impure War aims at resisting this disequilibrium; however, reestablishing a balance has become impossible with the proliferation of asymmetrical enemies. There is, in my opinion, an enormous threat to democracy in every single country; not only in totalitarian countries of the East, South, North, or elsewhere, but also in democratic countries, in Europe as well as The United States. With this civilian deterrence—The Patriot Act is a sign, but there are others, for instance certain laws are being considered in Europe governing immigration, etc.—the situation is far more uncertain since we’re now resisting disequilibrium. This is called reestablishing order, and reestablishing order in civil society means opening the gates to chaos, an absolute threat to democracy of any kind, representative, direct, or participative, as it’s called now, and it’s clear what this delirium amounts to—a displacement of the anti-city strategy. <br />

What could be motivating voters in transition countries to vote for leaders who have proven themselves to be skilled at violating human rights, repressing civil liberties, and ruling without democratic institutions? We test hypotheses related to this question by using a least-similar-systems design in which we search for common predictors of vote choice in presidential elections from two countries that differ in their past and present political and economic situations: Bolivia and Russia. We find consistent patterns in these two very different countries, which leads to the conclusion that voters for ex-authoritarian candidates or parties are not merely motivated by considerations that typically shape vote choice in long-standing democracies, but are also distinguished by a preference for nondemocratic political systems.<br />

Georgia's court system has never been fully independent since the restoration of Georgian statehood in 1992. Moreover, it has always been a convenient tool for governing forces to suppress political opponents, and it appears that the Saakashvili-led National Movement succumbed to the temptation to make the courts docile. Meanwhile, Saakashvili's government seems to be fully aware that a passive judiciary could damage Georgia's prospects for economic revival, foreign investment, and integration into the Euro-Atlantic structures. International organizations and Georgia's Western allies are increasingly demanding that Saakashvili's government bring the judiciary in line with democratic standards in general and ensure judicial independence in particular. In May 2005 the European Union's Rule of Law mission presented the Georgian government with a comprehensive strategy for judicial reform (Civil Georgia, May 20, 2005). But judging by Saakashvili's remarks, it seems that little has been done to improve the situation. The imperfect judiciary appears to be impeding Georgia's integration into NATO. Even pro-government parliamentarian Nika Rurua, deputy chair of the parliamentary committee for defense and security, admitted that breaches in the Georgian judicial system were among the complaints raised when a Georgian delegation visited NATO headquarters on April 13 (24 Saati, April 18; Prime News, April 20; Interfax, April 22). <br />

As mad as this sounds, it has been explicit Pentagon policy through the last three Presidents from father Bush in 1990, to Clinton and most aggressively, George W. Bush. This is the issue where Russia has drawn a deep line in the sand, understandably so. The forceful US effort to push Georgia as well as Ukraine into NATO would present Russia with the spectre of NATO literally coming to its doorstep, a military threat that is aggressive in the extreme, and untenable for Russian national security. This is what gives the seemingly obscure fight over two provinces the size of Luxemburg the potential to become the 1914 Sarajevo trigger to a new nuclear war by miscalculation. The trigger for such a war is not Georgia’s right to annex South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Rather, it is US insistence on pushing NATO and its missile defense right up to Russia’s door. <br />

<strong>Autocratic model isn't sustainable ---- long term political liberalization is inevitable</strong><br />
<strong>Deudney and Ikenberry ‘9</strong><br />
(Daniel, Prof. Pol. Sci. @ Johns Hopkins U., and John, Albert G. Milbank Prof. Politics and Int’l. Affairs @ Princeton U. and Global Eminence Scholar @ Kyung Hee U., Foreign Affairs, “The Myth of the Autocratic Revival: Why Liberal Democracy Will Prevail”, January/February, Ebsco)<br />
Proponents of the autocratic viability argument set up something of a straw man in their insistence that the absence of political liberalization in China and Russia refutes the liberal vision. The spectacular end of the Cold War and the rush of political and economic change in its wake produced unrealistic expectations. And their inevitable disappointment has provided the opening for the larger claims of autocratic revival. On the U.S. political scene, the debate during the Clinton era about the pros and cons of Chinese ascension to the World Trade Organization (WTO) was accompanied by assertions that China's opening up to international capitalism would soon bear fruits of political liberalization. These expectations for rapid political opening, however, had little basis in the theories connecting capitalist modernization with political liberalization. (The theories did not claim that the political consequences would be immediate and acknowledged that there would be uneven and lagging transitions.) Also, there are compelling explanations for the short-term persistence of autocracy in China and Russia, related to their historical experience as multiethnic states subject to fragmentation and foreign great-power encroachment. These external and historical factors slowing liberalization were long in the making, but they can be ameliorated by the engagement and accommodation of the Western powers. Contrary to the autocratic revival thesis, there are in fact deep contradictions between authoritarian political systems and capitalist economic systems. These contradictions exist in today's capitalist autocracies, and the resolution of these contradictions is likely to lead to political liberalization. There are many ways in which capitalism connects to political democracy, but three are most important. First, rising levels of wealth and education create demands for political participation and accountability. The basic logic behind this link is that rising living standards made possible because of capitalism over time generate a socioeconomic strata — loosely, the middle class — whose interests come to challenge closed political decision-making. Second is the relationship between capitalist property systems and the rule of law. In a capitalist economic system, by definition, the means of production are held as private property and economic transactions occur through contracts. For capitalism to function, the enforcement of contracts and the adjudication of business disputes require court systems and the rule of law. The practice of independent rights in the economic sphere and the institutions they require are an intrinsic limitation on state power and, over time, create demands for wider political rights. Third, the economic development propelled by capitalism leads to a divergence of interests. Modern industrial societies are marked by an explosion of complexity and the emergence of specialized activities and occupations, thus producing a plural polity rather than a mass polity. The increasing diversity of socioeconomic interests leads to demands for competitive elections between multiple parties. Looking at the Chinese experience through this lens suggests two important flaws in the autocratic revival case. First, the foundations for sustainable political liberalization are just now beginning to reach a critical mass in China. Despite rapid rates of growth, China remains a very poor country overall, with a very large population that has only partially tasted the fruits of capitalist modernization. A Chinese middle class is emerging, and there are already ample indicators that it has a growing interest in accountable political institutions. As capitalist modernization deepens, the complexity of interdependence rises in society, creating new stakeholders whose interests, when infringed on, stimulate demands for accountability. For example, in the ongoing tainted-milk scandal, it has become clear that the modernization of China's food production and distribution system has outstripped traditional forms of accountability, a mismatch that is now creating pressures for political regulatory reform. Second, there is nothing in the liberal vision that specifies the exact timing of political opening as a part of the socioeconomic transformation. Capitalism creates the conditions for liberal democracy, but the trigger for actual political change is utterly unpredictable. If the experience of the emergence of liberal democracy in Western countries is any guide, the process of transformation can take decades and be interrupted by unpredictable stops and starts. In Germany, for example, capitalist modernization arrived early, but liberal democracy emerged only after the dislocations of two world wars. Even without war, the pathway to political change in China is not likely to be straightforward or quick. The autocratic revival thesis fails because the classic indictment of illiberal government is essentially correct. The liberal argument is that deeply rooted incapacities and dysfunctions are inherent in the structure of autocratic hierarchies. First is the problem of corruption. The abusive use of state authority for the aggrandizement of government officials is a tendency in every political system, but it is much harder to check in autocratic regimes. In earlier centuries, before the capitalist era, autocratic regimes were straightforwardly predatory, and taxation was essentially confiscatory. As a consequence, merchant wealth was chronically insecure. It is not by accident that capitalism first emerged in places such as England, Holland, and Venice, where government had come to be restrained in various ways by nascent constitutional checks. In the new hybrid of autocracy and capitalism, government officials are in continuous transactions with capitalist firms and face myriad opportunities to demand bribes for the fulfillment of their official duties. Despite periodic campaigns for the rectitude of officialdom and episodic prosecutions, curbing corruption is difficult without institutional checks on state power. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's recent denunciations of &quot;legal nihilism&quot; are likely to remain impotent so long as Russia remains a single-party autocracy. Second, autocratic capitalist regimes face deep contradictions related to inequality. In capitalist societies, inequality has been a significant force for political change. Inequality is historically endemic. Premodern autocratic states were highly stratified predatory systems in which the ruling class was essentially parasitic on the vast, politically repressed peasant base. But with the advent of capitalism, particularly industrial capitalism, class stratification and economic inequality became fundamental political challenges and the triggers for long political struggles. These conflicts were only resolved by the achievement of universal-franchise democracy, the rise of political parties responsive to working-class needs and interests, and the establishment of the welfare state. The presence of acute inequality in contemporary autocratic capitalist regimes suggests that the other shoe has not dropped in their political evolution. A major source of political democratization in China is likely to be the large numbers of dispossessed peasants, marginalized migrants, and underpaid workers. Third, autocratic hierarchies have to contend with limitations on their performance because of weak accountability and insufficient flows of information. Their top-down, closed structure chokes off information from outside sources and distorts it, due to the imperatives of political control. Closed political systems are prone to policy mistakes arising from bad information. The historical record of tyrannies, despotisms, and dictatorships bears this out. Contemporary autocratic capitalist regimes show much greater capacities than their precapitalist predecessors, but they are still intrinsically impeded by censorship and the absence of open debate on policy alternatives. The SARS outbreak in China in 2003 vividly illustrated both the presence of closed decision-making and its severe consequences for public welfare and political legitimacy. Even faced with something as apolitical as the emergence of a dangerous new disease, Chinese officialdom's routine penchant for secrecy and unquestioned decision-making turned what should have been a manageable problem into an international public health crisis. Looking at the overall situations in China and Russia, there is little evidence for the emergence of a stable equilibrium between capitalism and autocracy such that this combination could be dignified as a new model of modernity. Compared to where these countries were several decades ago, they have made remarkable progress in throwing off centuries of accumulated economic and political backwardness, and by the yardstick of world historical change, they have moved and are moving in directions consistent with the liberal modernization narrative. China and Russia are not liberal democracies, but they are much more liberal and democratic than they have ever been — and many of the crucial foundations for sustainable liberal democracy are emerging. To be sure, for Russia, the cushion of plentiful oil and gas has delayed political liberalization; high energy prices and exports help subsidize bad government. But China has no such luxury, as it faces an array of developmental restraints, most notably overpopulation, environmental decay, and energy dependence. Autocracy's deep intrinsic flaws remain an impediment to the realization of the full modern development sought by the people of these countries. The problems of corruption, inequality, and unaccountability will continue to drive political change in China, Russia, and the rest of the world's autocracies.<br />

<strong>Support for democracy is increasing ---- backsliding claims lack a foundation</strong><br />

Sci. @ National Taiwan U.), Larry Diamond, (Senior Fellow @ Hoover Institution and @ Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies), Andrew Nathan, (Class of 1919 Prof. Pol. Sci. @ Columbia U.), and Doh Chull Shin, (Prof. Pol. Sci. @ U. Missouri), Washington Quarter, “Asia’s Challenged Democracies”, January, L/N)<br />
East Asian democratic regimes face these challenges in a difficult global context. The world appears to have entered a period of democratic &quot;recession,&quot; in which setbacks to democracy are outnumbering advances. 12 Not only has democracy broken down in Pakistan and Thailand, but it has been slowly strangled in Russia and Venezuela, and is stalled and performing poorly in a number of African and Latin American countries. Now, East Asia may be on the cusp of having to confront a global economic recession as well, with diffuse challenges to policy performance. The rapid and seemingly confident rise of China suggests that authoritarian regimes remain serious competitors for legitimacy, at least so long as they can continue to deliver economic growth. Yet, our findings also provide reasons to be hopeful. When asked about the future, most respondents anticipated democratic improvement, and they should know the likely trajectories of their regimes better than we do. They expect democratic deepening, not backsliding, and presumably are prepared to reward parties and politicians who deliver it. The responses of Hong Kong residents show that people who do not live under a democratic regime would like to have one, for all its flaws. The Chinese responses show that residents there share a concept of democracy that overlaps considerably with those of the other countries surveyed and that they value democracy highly. Democracy in South Korea and Taiwan has shown resilience. In the face of scandals and political deadlock under each of South Korea's four presidents of the democratic era, spanning a 20-year period from Roh Tae-woo to Roh Moohyun, South Korea's democratic system has endured and in many respects become more democratic. Taiwan has gone through an even deeper political trauma, involving debilitating conflict between president and legislature, intense polarization over identity issues, a bitterly disputed presidential election in 2004, and grave charges of corruption in the family of former president Chen Shuibian. Yet, here too, the standing of democracy as the system of government does not appear to be in serious doubt, and popular support for democracy as an ideal has increased.<br />

<strong>No relationship between US capabilities and peace</strong><br />
<strong>Fettweis 10</strong> – Professor of national security affairs @ U.S. Naval War College. [Christopher J. Fettweis, “Threat and Anxiety in US Foreign Policy,” Survival, Volume 52,<br />
Issue 2 April 2010 , pages 59 – 82//informaworld]<br />
<br />
One potential explanation for the growth of global peace can be dismissed fairly quickly: US actions do not seem to have contributed much. The limited evidence suggests that there is little reason to believe in the stabilising power of the US hegemon, and that there is no relation between the relative level of American activism and international stability. During the 1990s, the United States cut back on its defence spending fairly substantially. By 1998, the United States was spending $100 billion less on defence in real terms than it had in 1990, a 25% reduction.29 To internationalists, defence hawks and other believers in hegemonic stability, this irresponsible 'peace dividend' endangered both national and global security. 'No serious analyst of American military capabilities', argued neo-conservatives William Kristol and Robert Kagan in 1996, 'doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to meet America's responsibilities to itself and to world peace'.30 And yet the verdict from the 1990s is fairly plain: the world grew more peaceful while the United States cut its forces. No state seemed to believe that its security was endangered by a less-capable US military, or at least none took any action that would suggest such a belief. No militaries were enhanced to address power vacuums; no security dilemmas drove insecurity or arms races; no regional balancing occurred once the stabilis-ing presence of the US military was diminished. The rest of the world acted as if the threat of international war was not a pressing concern, despite the reduction in US military capabilities. Most of all, the United States was no less safe. The incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the United States cut its military spending under President Bill Clinton, and kept declining as the George W. Bush administration ramped the spending back up. Complex statistical analysis is unnecessary to reach the conclusion that world peace and US military expenditure are unrelated.<br />

<strong>No impact to the transition – international order accommodates rising powers</strong><br />
<strong>Ikenberry 08</strong> professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University<br />
(John, The Rise of China and the Future of the West Can the Liberal System Survive?, Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb)<br />
Some observers believe that the American era is coming to an end, as the Western-oriented world order is replaced by one increasingly dominated by the East. The historian Niall Ferguson has written that the bloody twentieth century witnessed &quot;the descent of the West&quot; and &quot;a reorientation of the world&quot; toward the East. Realists go on to note that as China gets more powerful and the United States' position erodes, two things are likely to happen: China will try to use its growing influence to reshape the rules and institutions of the international system to better serve its interests, and other states in the system -- especially the declining hegemon -- will start to see China as a growing security threat. The result of these developments, they predict, will be tension, distrust, and conflict, the typical features of a power transition. In this view, the drama of China's rise will feature an increasingly powerful China and a declining United States locked in an epic battle over the rules and leadership of the international system. And as the world's largest country emerges not from within but outside the established post-World War II international order, it is a drama that will end with the grand ascendance of China and the onset of an Asian-centered world order. That course, however, is not inevitable. The rise of China does not have to trigger a wrenching hegemonic transition. The U.S.-Chinese power transition can be very different from those of the past because China faces an international order that is fundamentally different from those that past rising states confronted. China does not just face the United States; it faces a Western-centered system that is open, integrated, and rule-based, with wide and deep political foundations. The nuclear revolution, meanwhile, has made war among great powers unlikely -- eliminating the major tool that rising powers have used to overturn international systems defended by declining hegemonic states. Today's Western order, in short, is hard to overturn and easy to join. This unusually durable and expansive order is itself the product of farsighted U.S. leadership. After World War II, the United States did not simply establish itself as the leading world power. It led in the creation of universal institutions that not only invited global membership but also brought democracies and market societies closer together. It built an order that facilitated the participation and integration of both established great powers and newly independent states. (It is often forgotten that this postwar order was designed in large part to reintegrate the defeated Axis states and the beleaguered Allied states into a unified international system.) Today, China can gain full access to and thrive within this system. And if it does, China will rise, but the Western order -- if managed properly -- will live on.<br />

“Nothing has ever existed like this disparity of power; nothing,” historian Paul Kennedy observes: “I have returned to all of the comparative defense spending and military personnel statistics over the past 500 years that I compiled in The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, and no other nation comes close.” Though assessments of U.S. power have changed since those words were written in 2002, they remain true. Even when capabilities are understood broadly to include economic, technological, and other wellsprings of national power, they are concentrated in the United States to a degree never before experienced in the history of the modern system of states and thus never contemplated by balance-of-power theorists. The United States spends more on defense than all the other major military powers combined, and most of those powers are its allies. Its massive investments in the human, institutional, and technological requisites of military power, cumulated over many decades, make any effort to match U.S. capabilities even more daunting that the gross spending numbers imply. Military research and development (R&amp;D) may best capture the scale of the long-term investment that give the United States a dramatic qualitative edge in military capabilities. As table 2.1 shows, in 2004 U.S. military R&amp;D expenditures were more than six times greater than those of Germany, Japan, France, and Britain combined. By some estimates over half the military R&amp;D expenditures in the world are American. And this disparity has been sustained for decades: over the past 30 years, for example, the United States has invested over three times more than the entire European Union on military R&amp;D. These vast commitments have created a preeminence in military capabilities vis-à-vis all the other major powers that is unique after the seventeenth century. While other powers could contest U.S. forces near their homelands, especially over issues on which nuclear deterrence is credible, the United States is and will long remain the only state capable of projecting major military power globally. This capacity arises from “command of the commons” – that is, unassailable military dominance over the sea, air, and space. As Barry Posen puts it, Command of the commons is the key military enabler of the U.S global power position. It allows the United States to exploit more fully other sources of power, including its own economic and military might as well as the economic and military might of its allies. Command of the commons also helps the United States to weaken its adversaries, by restricting their access to economic, military, and political assistance….Command of the commons provides the United States with more useful military potential for a hegemonic foreign policy than any other offshore power has ever had. Posen’s study of American military primacy ratifies Kennedy’s emphasis on the historical importance of the economic foundations of national power. It is the combination of military and economic potential that sets the United States apart from its predecessors at the top of the international system. Previous leading states were either great commercial and naval powers or great military powers on land, never both. The British Empire in its heyday and the United States during the Cold War, for example, shared the world with other powers that matched or exceeded them in some areas. Even at the height of the Pax Britannica, the United Kingdom was outspent, outmanned, and outgunned by both France and Russia. Similarly, at the dawn of the Cold War the United States was dominant economically as well as in air and naval capabilities. But the Soviet Union retained overall military parity, and thanks to geography and investment in land power it had a superior ability to seize territory in Eurasia. The United States’ share of world GDP in 2006, 27.5 percent, surpassed that of any leading state in modern history, with the sole exception of its own position after 1945 (when World War II had temporarily depressed every other major economy). The size of the U.S economy means that its massive military capabilities required roughly 4 percent of its GDP in 2005, far less than the nearly 10 percent it averaged over the peak years of the Cold War, 1950-70, and the burden borne by most of the major powers of the past. As Kennedy sums up, “Being Number One at great cost is one thing; being the world’s single superpower on the cheap is astonishing.”<br />

<strong>A. Decline doesn’t cause war</strong><br />
<strong>Geller and Singer, 99</strong> – *Chair of the Department of Political Science @ Wayne State University (Daniel S and Joel David, Nations at war: a scientific study of international conflict, p. 116-117)<br />
<br />
Hopf (1991) and Levy (1984) examine the frequency, magnitude and severity of wars using polarity (Hopf) and “system size” (Levy) as predictors. Hopf’s database includes warfare in the European subsystems for the restricted temporal period of 1495–1559. The system is classified as multipolar for the years 1495–1520 and as bipolar for the years 1521–1559. Hopf reports that the amount of warfare during those two periods was essentially equivalent. He concludes that polarity has little relationship to patterns of war for the historical period under examination. Levy (1984) explores a possible linear association between the number of great powers (system size) and war for the extended temporal span of 1495 – 1974. His findings coincide with those of Hopf; he reports that the frequency, magnitude and severity of war in the international system is unrelated to the number of major powers in the system.<br />

<strong>B. Heg doesn’t solve war</strong><br />
<strong>Mastanduno, 9</strong> – Professor of Government at Dartmouth (Michael, World Politics 61, No. 1, Ebsco)<br />
<br />
During the cold war the United States dictated the terms of adjustment. It derived the necessary leverage because it provided for the security of its economic partners and because there were no viable alter natives to an economic order centered on the United States. After the cold war the outcome of adjustment struggles is less certain because the United States is no longer in a position to dictate the terms. The United States, notwithstanding its preponderant power, no longer enjoys the same type of security leverage it once possessed, and the very success of the U.S.-centered world economy has afforded America’s supporters a greater range of international and domestic economic options. The claim that the United States is unipolar is a statement about its cumulative economic, military, and other capabilities.1 But preponderant capabilities across the board do not guarantee effective influence in any given arena. U.S. dominance in the international security arena no longer translates into effective leverage in the international economic arena. And although the United States remains a dominant international economic player in absolute terms, after the cold war it has found itself more vulnerable and constrained than it was during the golden economic era after World War II. It faces rising economic challengers with their own agendas and with greater discretion in international economic policy than America’s cold war allies had enjoyed. The United States may continue to act its own way, but it can no longer count on getting its own way.<br />

2. Patriarchy cannot be explained through a single causality.<br />
<strong>Steven</strong> Goldberg <strong>(Chairman of the Department of Sociology, City College, City University of New York), “The Logic of Patriarchy,” Gender Issues. Summer</strong> 1999<strong>.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>“Patriarchy is a result of the requirement of a hunting culture, or Christianity, or capitalism, etc.” If it is to be at all persuasive, an explanation of universality must be parsimonious; the explanation must invoke a causal factor common to the varying societies that exhibit the universal institution. Just as the explanation in terms of capitalism fails to explain patriarchy in the many non-capitalist societies, so do explanations in terms of any single factor other than the physiological fail to explain the host of societies for which that factor does not apply. Non-hunting, non-Christian, non-capitalist, etc. societies are all patriarchal. A single-cause theory of the limits constraining every society need not, of course, be the neuroendocrinological one I suggest. But the few alternative parsimonious explanations fail on empirical grounds.</strong><br />
<br />
3. Patriarchy is inevitable – feminists concede<br />

<br />
<strong>Patriarchy is inevitable, as 1he more gloomy of the feminist theorists have admitted. Sylvia Walby summarizes: “Women are no longer restricted to the domestic hearth, but have the whole society in which to roam and be exploited.” [36] She errors only in failing to recognize the real source of patriarchy and to appreciate her real choice. Paleoanthropologists now know that even before the first hominids on the African savanna had gone bi-pedal, these promising creatures were conjugal; that is, they were pairing off in long term bonds, where the females traded sexual exclusivity for the provisioning and protection provided by individual males. According to C. Owen Lovejoy, these social inventions of marriage and fatherhood—not expansion of the brain case—were the decisive steps in human evolution, and they occurred well over three million years ago. [37] Nothing important has changed since. Women cannot successfully raise children on their own. When they try to do so in large numbers, the results are poverty, violence, and misery (for proof, simply visit the average American urban ghetto). Women need some entity that will help them gain food, clothing, and shelter and that will control the boys. There are only two practical options: either the private patriarch (who is, in the end, simply the conventional husband), a figure who is adept at breadwinning and taming the lads; or the public patriarch (i.e., the welfare state), which provides food stamps, public housing, and day care subsidies and eventually jails a large share of the boys. The first choice is compatible with health, happiness, wealth creation, and political liberty. The second choice is a sure path to the servile state.</strong><br />

4. Military discrimination reinforces patriarchy<br />

<br />
<strong>Military elites also strongly oppose participation of women and gays, especially in key roles such as officers or combat soldiers. This opposition stems from the links between masculinity and violence and, more deeply, between patriarchy and the military.</strong><br />
<br />
5. Patriarchy has been around for 4,000 years, no reason it would just magically disappear now.<br />
<strong>Glenn</strong> Collins <strong>– NYT,</strong> 1986 <strong>“Patriarchy: Is it invention or inevitable” Lexis</strong> Gerda Lerner, P.h.d, founders of the field of women's history<br />
<br />
<strong>Gerda Lerner, the historian, was talking about patriarchy, the form of social organization. ''As a system, patriarchy is as outdated as feudalism,'' she said on a recent morning after a meeting of historians at a Manhattan hotel. ''But it is a 4,000-year-old system of ideas that won't just go away overnight.''</strong><br />
<br />
6. Patriarchy isn’t the cause of every single impact<br />
<strong>Cat</strong> Maguire <strong>of EVE Online, an online feminist news source June 9</strong> 2005 <strong><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3143:http://eve.enviroweb.org/what_is/main.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://eve.enviroweb.org/what_is/main.html" rel="nofollow">http://eve.enviroweb.org/what_is/main.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3143 --></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>It assumes patriarchy is the root cause of all our problems. While the patriarchal mindset is certainly accountable for much of humankind's dysfunctionality, patriarchy is only 5,000 years old. Emerging theories from thinkers like Chellis Glendinning contend that our dislocation from nature (and hence from ourselves) goes back at least 20,000 years ago when humans moved from the gatherer/hunter stage to that of domesticating plants and animals. As such, we have come to believe that anthropocentrism and speciesism—the impulse to conquer and control nature—are conceivably a more accurate source of today’s problems than is patriarchy per se.</strong><br />
<br />
7. Patriarchy merely serves to give war its form, rather than the origin, it is the result.<br />
Hillman ’04 <strong>(James, Internationally renowned psychologist, has taught at Yale, Syracuse, and the University of Chicago, A Terrible Love of War, p.24-25)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>These tales must be recalled so as to obviate the testosterone hypothesis, that is, everything to do with bellicosity and militarism is the expression of male physiology, both the cruelty and the courage--it's all reducible to glands of gender. The myths and legends tell it differently: the spirit of war and the rage of battle are archetypal, forced upon all animal life, all gender, all societies. No gland can contain it. It is irreducible, a Ding an sich. It breaks out in matriarchal and matrilineal societies. No one is exempt. Women cannot hide from it, as its victims know, nor can they hide it. Not only legendary Amazons but modern women in power have been war leaders; women have clamored for admission to military academies and they serve the military with • distinction, pride, and killmg weaponry.</strong><br />
<strong>To imagine war to be a &quot;man's thing,&quot; one more example of the abusive, self-inflating activity of &quot;the patriarchy,&quot; traps one in the genderist division of the cosmos: all things are either male or female, tertium non datur. The genderist division takes on the absolutism of a logical opposition, an either/or which allows no space for the &quot;both&quot; of compromise and ambivalence, and androgyny.</strong><br />
<strong>This division then influences our fantasies of primordial societies, reducing war to an activity of violent hunter-gatherers versus gentle cultivator-weavers. If, however, we think about war as an emanation of a god, war as an archetypal impulse, then patriarchy does not originate war but serves war to give it form and bring it to order by means of hierarchical control, ritual ceremony, art, and law.</strong><br />
<strong>Remember Foucault's idea that law is a continuation of war in another form. Patriarchy makes the forms. Rather than the origin of war, patriarchy is its necessary result, preventing Ares from blowing up the world and leaving a few poor remnants a life that is &quot;nasty, brutish, and short.&quot; That this hierarchy, these forms can become tyrannical is evident enough, since cruelties of discipline are often secondary consequents of form. Nonetheless, patriarchal tyranny is not the primary cause of war; that cause is the god.</strong><br />
<br />
8. Their epistemology links cause major violence<br />
Jarvis, 2K <strong>– Prof Philosophy @ U South Carolina (Darryl, Studies in International Relations, “International Relations and the Challenge of Postmodernism”, pg. 196-198)</strong><br />
<strong>Like many others, Hoffman seems to accept without reservation the idea that textuality, ambiguity, uncertainty, decentering, relativism, irregularity, and coundess other instruments that detract from the Enlightenment enterprise are reasons for celebration, that they somehow represent intellectual breakthroughs and a form of theoretical progress, and that theory in International Relations needs to be restructured along lines proscribed by the humanities. Hoffman represents one of a growing number of</strong><br />
<strong>scholars who is fervent in his desire to import and apply deconstructive postmodern theory to the sphere of international politics, both to unearth &quot;hidden meanings&quot; encrusted in the disciplines texts and to arrive at new meanings inferred from the discovery of &quot;hidden practices.&quot; There is an almost blind faith that these new creeds hold answers which, under neopositivism, rationality, modernity, and the Enlightenment project have remained hidden from us. Like a great archeological excavation, treasures in the form of new wisdom, new prophecies, and a new politics await discovery for those willing to make the jump and convert to the postmodern cause. The 1990s have thus become a decade of rereadings and textual reinterpretations where the encrusted texts of realists have been reread and their &quot;true&quot; meaning exposed. Ashley reread Waltz and discovered his positivism, economism, and structuralism; Jim George reread realism and discovered its &quot;silences&quot; and &quot;omissions&quot;; Ann Tickner reread Hans Morgenthau and discovered his gender blindness; and Christine Sylvester reread the reinterpretations of rereadings undertaken by male dissidents and discovered their own misogyny and sexism. For students of international politics who aspire to know, the answer(s) thus reside in textuality, in a life of rereading rereadings in order that hidden practices, silences, omissions, and new meaning can be discovered. The world, as such, can be safely ignored; writings about the world are what must occupy research, for in these writings are the constitutive essences that make up the &quot;real&quot; world. Nothing is given, there is &quot;no there there,&quot; nothing is real until named. Women do not exist, Sylvester reminds us, much as for Ashley nation-states do not really exist until inscribed in writings and with names that give them ontological meaning. Meaning is thus in the text, the language, the word, not the thing or the object or the fact. Let us for a moment, however, reflect on this &quot;research program,&quot; on the importations of textual analysis and deconstructive theory, and what they might do to theoretical endeavor and the discipline of International Relations. Let us, for example, pose a few rudimentary questions that, despite their simplicity, go to the very essence of subversive postmodernism's relevance and utility to the study of international politics. What, for example, is &quot;ambiguous&quot; about war or &quot;ironic&quot; about peace? How does the admission of uncertainty change the face of theory, or how does textuality alter our experiences of the realities of international politics, of death squads, civil war, or autocratic rule? Why, suddenly, are irony, uncertainty, ambiguity, and textuality the prized attributes of theoretical endeavor? Are these to be our new epistemological motifs by which we judge the quality and usefulness of theory and research programs in International Relations? Are the problems of international politics and the answers to them hidden amid literary devices like paradox or the textual chicanery of double entendre? Will the practices of regional aggression displayed by Saddam Hussein, for example, be thwarted through textual rereadings of security texts, or the acrimonious diplomatic exchanges between the United States and Iraq? Can we change the course of political outcomes, avert the use of force, or persuade others to disavow aggression though textual reinterpretation? If we believe Ashley, Hoffman, Walker, Sylvester, or James Der Derian, for example, then the answer is yes, in which case international theory must transpose itself into a form of literary criticism and employ the tools of textual deconstruction, parody, and the style of discontinuous narratives as a means of pondering the depths of interpretation. In doing so, however, we would approach the writings of Richard Ashley, who, utilizing such methods, can apprise students of international politics only of the fact that &quot;there are neither right interpretations nor wrong,&quot; there are just &quot;interpretations imposed upon interpretations.&quot;36 In what sense, however, can this approach be at all adequate for the subject of International Relations. What, for example, do the literary devices of irony and textuality say to Somalian refugees who flee from famine and warlords or to Ethiopian rebels who fight in the desert plains against a government in Addis Abbaba? How does the notion of textual deconstruction speak to Serbs, Croats, and Muslims who fight one another among the ruins of the former Yugoslavia? How do totalitarian narratives or logocentric binary logic feature in the deliberations of policy bureaucrats or in the negotiations over international trade or the formulations of international law? Should those concerned with human rights or those who take it upon themselves to study relationships between nation-states begin by contemplating epistemological fiats and ontological disputes? How does the reification of interpretivism and relativism assist such people in their understandings, problems, judgments, negotiations, and disputes? Is Ashley, for example, suggesting that we simply announce to those in the fray of international politics that there are neither right interpretations nor wrong, there are just interpretations imposed upon interpretations. Is this to be the epiphany of subversive postmodern international theory, its penultimate contribution to those who suffer on the margins for whom they professes great concern? I am, of course, being flippant. Yet we do have a right to ask such questions of subversive postmodernists if only because they portend to a moral highground, to insights otherwise denied realists, modernists, positivists, and mainstream international relations scholars. We have every right to ask, for example, how subversive postmodern theory speaks to the practical problems endemic to international relations, to the actors and players who constitute the practices of world politics, or how literary devices and deconstructive readings help us better picture world society. My point, of course, is much the same as Robin Brown's, that textual analysis and deconstruction does not, and cannot, speak to such problems other than to detect the limits of a particular &quot;text by identifying origins, assumptions and silences.&quot; What it cannot do, however, &quot;is deal with the practical problem of international relations.&quot;37 Similarly, Hoffman too gives no answers to these questions save this justification for the turn to interpretivism. &quot;This move,&quot; he writes, &quot;connects international relations, both as a practice and a discipline, with similar developments within social and political theory and within the humanities.&quot;38 But what justification or rationale is this? So we are now doing what literary theorists do: ruminating over international theory as if such were the verses of lyricists written for the pleasures of reading and consumed only for their wit and romance. But there is a difference between the concerns and interests of, say, English departments and those of departments of Political Science or International Relations. Where literary criticism delights in the ethereal play of words and has as its epistemic basis the belief that &quot;one reads for pleasure,&quot; politics dabbles in the material, distributive, punitive play of power whose consequences effect much more than a sensibility committed to reading fiction.39 Why should we assume that tools developed in English departments are useful to theorists of international relations? Why should we take heed of the writings of Jacques Derrida who never once addressed issues of international relations, but from whom postmodernists now claim a wisdom which they insist is reason enough to dispense with past theory and begin anew our theoretical and disciplinary enterprise?</strong><br />

Obama’s approach to military decision-making solidifies good civil-military relations<br />
CNAS 10 <strong>– Center for a New American Security, May 17, 2010, “Civil-Military Relations in the Obama Era,” online: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3144:http://www.cnas.org/blogs/abumuqawama/2010/05/civil-military-relations-obama-era.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cnas.org/blogs/abumuqawama/2010/05/civil-military-relations-obama-era.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnas.org/blogs/abumuqawama/2010/05/civil-military-relations-obama-era.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3144 --></strong><br />
<strong>This article by Jonathan Alter in Newsweek on how Obama tamed his generals is great and worth reading -- although not necessarily for the reasons the author intended. I'm going to offer up my bottom line conclusion up front and then use the article as a starting point to consider some other issues. BLUF: President Obama has brought civil-military relations back into line in a way that would have made Samuel Huntington proud. There are problems with this, as I will note later on in this post, but overall, this is a really good thing. Alter: Deputy national-security adviser Tom Donilon had commissioned research that backed up an astonishing historical truth: neither the Vietnam War nor the Iraq War featured any key meetings where all the issues and assumptions were discussed by policymakers. In both cases the United States was sucked into war inch by inch. I have spent a little time recently with Paul Pillar, a man whose intellect and record of service I really respect. Paul has made a point similar to Tom Donilon's regarding the Iraq war -- that there never really was a coherent governmental decision-making process. Obama's decision-making process on Afghanistan, by contrast, is to be applauded for the way in which it differed from the &quot;decision-making process&quot; (if you can even call it that) of 2002 and 2003. Why? First, do what Dick Betts does when writing about Huntington's so-called &quot;normal theory&quot; for civil-military relations and draw a big triangle on a sheet of paper. Now draw three horizontal lines on the triangle, dividing it into four levels -- political, strategic, operational and tactical. In the normal model, civilians have responsibility for the top section. They decide the policy aims. Then civilians and the military decide on strategic goals and resources. (Betts adds a fifth layer, actually, for ROE.) The military has responsibility for everything else under Huntington's model. If you look at the decision-making process in 2009 on the war in Afghanistan, things more or less proceeded according to the normal theory. The president commissioned a review of policy and strategic goals in the winter of 2009, which resulted in this white paper. Gen. McChrystal then thought about how to operationalize the president's policy and strategic goals and submitted his own assessment along with a request for more resources. That assessment, combined with a corrupt Afghan presidential election, caused the administration to re-think its assumptions and prompted another strategic review. This was, on balance, a good thing that made me feel good about the president. The president then re-affirmed his policy aims, articulated new strategic goals, and committed more resources to the war in Afghanistan. (I write more about this process here.) The good news in all of this is that whether or not you agree with the decisions made by the president and his team in 2009, the national security decision-making process more or less worked, and the civilians were in charge every step of the way. This is as both Sam Huntington and the U.S. Constitution intended.</strong><br />

<strong>THE INFLUENCE OF THE MILITARY ON CIVILIAN SOCIETY</strong><br />
<strong>The institutional armed forces and the ideal of military service have exerted a great deal of influence on American society since the founding of the nation. Of course, war itself will affect any society in devastating ways; an extended conflict on national soil can almost destroy a nation, as was the case for Germany after World War I, and Great Britain never regained its world power status after its tribulations during World War II. Thankfully, the United States has not yet experienced such a massive trauma, but even in peacetime, the military leaves its mark on civilian society in ways not always understood by the public. Of particular signifi¬cance is the influence of military leadership on civilian policymaking and politics.</strong><br />
<strong>Civil-military relations, or the interchange between civilian govern¬ment and military leadership, is, like the principle of church-state separation, an topic that emerges in public debate with some frequency. According to American tradition, the military should keep away from politics; it is supposed to remain under strict civilian control and is prohibited from meddling in government affairs. In reality, however, military leaders cannot ignore politics altogether because their organiza¬tions are directly affected by the decisions of civilian political leaders. Furthermore, the president and Congress must have a clear understand¬ing of military capabilities if they are to deploy troops in combat. Civilian authorities depend on the military for advice and guidance.</strong><br />
<strong>But how much input is too much? Can top officers step over the line from legitimate communication to advocacy, pressure, even coercion of civilian leaders? As scholar and career officer Richard D. Hooker writes, &quot;how to keep the military strong enough to defend the states and subser¬vient enough not to threaten it is the central question in civil-militarv relations.&quot;4</strong>*<br />
<strong>This debate has gone on throughout American history. There have been times when military leaders have overstepped their bounds, such as Gen. Douglas MacArthur's defiance of President Truman over military strategy in Korea. Since the Vietnam War, however, the question has assumed greater importance. One of the major debates about the Vietnam debacle has been over the role of the military in determining strategy in that conflict. Did President Johnson and his cabinet tie the hands of the military for domestic political reasons, or was the JCS too supine to speak up and give strong warnings about the direction of the war?</strong><br />
<strong>Even today scholars differ on the answer to this question, but many agree that the Johnson administration's policymaking hierarchy did not allow the JCS a great deal of input into policy even if it had wanted to offer a strong critique. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara had his own civilian advisors on whom he relied, and the JCS stood outside his</strong><br />
<strong>close circle. To correct this imbalance, the 1986 Defense Reorganization Act strengthened the role of the JCS in policymaking, establishing the Chairman of the JCS the &quot;primary military adviser to the president.&quot; When Gen. Colin Powell became Chairman of the JCS (1989-1993) he began to use his access to the president to give much sterner advice— advice that he and others of his generation wished that the Vietnam-era JCS had been able to provide. &quot;I had been appalled at the docility of the Joint Chiefs of Staff/' Powell wrote in his autobiography, &quot;fighting the war in Vietnam without ever pressing their political leaders to lay out clear objectives for them.&quot;44</strong><br />
<strong>Unlike his predecessors, Powell insisted that four conditions be met before American military power could be used by civilian authorities. First, national interests must be at stake; second, objectives must be clearly laid out; third, overwhelming force must be used; and fourth, the American public must be solidly behind the effort. These conditions clearly show the impact of Vietnam on Powell's thinking; none of them were met in the Vietnam conflict.</strong><br />
<strong>As commonsensical as it appeared to be, however, the Powell Doctrine also implied that the military would not carry out the president's orders if a proposed military action did not meet the four conditions. This could be interpreted as an act of insubordination,45 but in the wake of the success¬ful 1991 Gulf War, few objected to what was widely seen as a necessary and welcome exorcism of the ghosts of Vietnam.</strong><br />
<strong>A few years later, civil-military relations were again challenged. When newly elected president Bill Clinton tried to change the military's policy toward gays in the service, military leaders, including Powell, defied him. It was not a matter of vital national security policy, but the issue poisoned Clinton's already troubled relationship with the military and, many commentators have argued, weakened Clinton's freedom to use the military as he saw fit.46</strong><br />
<strong>Not only do the attitudes of military leaders toward civilian authorities influence civil-military relations, but those of civilian leaders toward the military can have a similar effect. The troubled relationship between Bill Clinton and the armed forces was not a result of Clinton being antimili-tary per se, but, egged on by conservative media pundits, many in the military community viewed his personal history and policy decisions as insulting toward military society. Clinton was already unpopular with many in and around the military because of his open avoidance of the draft during the Vietnam War. Early missteps, like the gays in the military fiasco and the popular image of Hillary Clinton as an elite feminist policy wonk out of touch with regular Americans, made Clinton one of the most unpopular presidents with the military in the nation's history. He bears a great deal of responsibility for this, but the Republican Party used his missteps to bolster its own pro-military image. During the 1990s, the Republican Party was perceived by many Americans to be the party of the armed forces; it had taken control of the southern states, original home to about 40 percent of the military personnel,47 and it generally was more supportive of military issues, such as military pay raises and increased appropriations, than the Democratic Party.48</strong><br />
<strong>This maneuvering was well within the bounds of normal political partisanship, but some incidents crossed an important line. When North Carolina senator Jesse Helms said in 1994 that if Clinton visited military bases in North Carolina, he had &quot;better have a bodyguard,&quot; many felt that the pandering had gone too far.49</strong><br />
<strong>Likewise, when Zell Miller, a conservative Democrat, said in a speech at the 2004 Republican National Convention that any president should be pro-military and that soldiers are more important to American freedom than the press, some saw a worrying move toward militarism on the part of civilian leaders.50</strong><br />
<strong>By the end of the 1990s, some commentators worried that the armed forces and the Republican Party were too close, and the military was losing its neutrality. As the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts drag on, that view seems to be becoming less prevalent, especially after high-ranking military officers have criticized the Bush administration's policy in Iraq. In April 2006, for example, a half-dozen retired generals publicly demanded the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld for his mistakes. While many welcomed the &quot;generals' revolt&quot; for its attention to the problems of the Iraq war, others warned that it set a dangerous precedent of military opposition to civilian leadership. In January 2007, a group enlisted soldiers presented Congress with a petition asking that Congress &quot;support the prompt withdrawal of all American military forces and bases from Iraq.&quot; This &quot;Appeal for Redress from the War in Iraq&quot; may be largely symbolic, but it too raises the same issues of military involve¬ment in political affairs.51</strong><br />
<strong>One lesson of these examples of military participation in political debates is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Many of those who supported the military's resistance to allowing gays to serve in the military, and who applauded Helms' comments, were appalled by the generals' criticism of Rumsfeld and Bush. Others who labeled the military an undemocratic and homophobic institution because of the gay issue applauded the generals when they spoke out. In fact many noted that the generals should have spoken out earlier, while they were still on active duty. The soldiers who signed the &quot;Appeal for Redress&quot; have received almost universal sympathy and support, and almost no one has pointed out the potential conflict for abuse when soldiers participate in policymaking.</strong><br />
<strong>Another lesson is that the line between the military having too much or too little say in civilian affairs is blurry and shifts according to circum¬stance. Not only do historical events like the Vietnam War influence the public's notion of how much criticism is appropriate, but also civilian authorities may request more or less input from military leaders at differ¬ent times. Over the course of the twentieth century, and especially during and after World War II, presidents expected military leaders to advise them not just on military capabilities, but on broader national and international matters in which the military might have a role. President John F. Kennedy requested that military officers &quot;prepare themselves to take active roles in the policy-making process.'02 As it happened, he himself did not use the military in this way, nor did his successor, but the growing complexity of military affairs meant that military leaders would possess knowledge and expertise that no civilian could match.</strong><br />
<strong>In recent years, the military has embraced its expanded role in policy¬making with programs at the War Colleges and the National Defense University in relevant areas like information technology, resources management, and international diplomacy. Civilian leaders may or may not heed the advice of military leaders, but officers at the highest levels of the military are better prepared than ever before to consider the diplomatic, economic, sociocultural, and political impact of military actions, and integrate those perspectives into their knowledge of tactics, strategy, and other military considerations.</strong><br />

Civil military relations are vital to Gates succeeding in his military transformation agenda<br />

<strong>The new secretary of defense therefore has a lot on his plate. In the short term, Gates must play out the endgame of a war in Iraq that he admits the United States is &quot;not winning&quot; but that he and the president do not want to &quot;lose&quot; either. He must continue the efforts to transform the U.S. military while repairing a ground force that has been nearly &quot;broken&quot; by almost four years of continuous combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. But Gates can hope to succeed at those tasks only if he manages to rebuild a cooperative relationship between civilian leaders and the U.S. military. He must both rethink how civilian officials oversee the military and clarify the boundaries of legitimate military dissent from civilian authority. The key is that Gates needs to recognize that Rumsfeld's meddling approach contributed in significant measure to the problems in Iraq and elsewhere. The best solution is to return to an old division of labor: civilians give due deference to military professional advice in the tactical and operational realms in return for complete military subordination in the grand strategic and political realms. The success of Gates' tenure in the Pentagon will hinge on his reestablishing that proper civil-military balance.</strong><br />

Gates’ acquisition reform strategy will transform the military for irregular warfighting<br />

<strong>The preliminary Defense Department budget announced by Defense Secretary Robert Gates on April 6 represents the most dramatic shift in US military thinking since the end of the Vietnam War. Gates merely hinted at the magnitude of the proposed changes, claiming only that he seeks to &quot;rebalance&quot; the department's priorities between conventional and irregular warfare. But the message is clear: from now on, counterinsurgency and low-intensity conflict will be the military's principal combat missions, while other tasks, such as preparing for an all-out war with a well-equipped adversary, will take a decidedly secondary role. The budget message does not lay out this shift in broad strategic language. Rather, it is articulated in terms of the weapons systems Gates has chosen to terminate or cancel and those he has chosen to retain or augment. Most media attention has focused on the former--the big-ticket items he rightly says are no longer needed or too costly and &quot;exquisite&quot; to meet the Pentagon's requirements. These include the F-22 Raptor, a $143 million supersonic jet fighter originally designed to shoot down Soviet aircraft; the DDG-1000 Zumwalt-class destroyer, a $3.3 billion stealth combat vessel; and the Army's Future Combat System, an ensemble of futuristic tanks and armored vehicles. The proposed cancellation or termination of these and other multibillion-dollar programs has provoked a firestorm of criticism from lobbyists, promilitary organizations, Congressional hawks and members of Congress whose districts will suffer manufacturing losses if the systems are cut. Major media outlets have fed the flames by portraying Gates's overhaul as a set of massive spending cuts, even though spending would increase by 4 percent. As the debate proceeds, the cancellations will no doubt generate most of the Congressional skirmishes and headlines. But far more important from a strategic perspective are the programs Gates wants to add or augment. These include Predator drones, sensor-equipped turboprop planes, conventional helicopters, the littoral combat ship (LCS) and expanded Special Operations capabilities--mostly low-tech systems intended for use in counterinsurgency or low-intensity environments. These programs are far less costly than the super-sophisticated weapons Gates seeks to eliminate but far more useful, he argues, in the irregular, small-scale operations that US troops are conducting in Iraq and Afghanistan and are likely to encounter in future conflicts. &quot;We must rebalance this department's programs in order to institutionalize and enhance our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead,&quot; he declared. The similarities between Gates's proposals and the strategy adopted by the Kennedy administration are too great to ignore. Kennedy assumed office at a time when all-out war with the Soviet Union was the military's primary concern, and he rapidly ordered a shift in focus toward unconventional conflict in the Third World. Subversive insurgency poses a new and growing threat, Kennedy declared at West Point in 1962. &quot;It requires...a whole new kind of strategy, a wholly different kind of force and therefore a new and wholly different kind of military training.&quot; After the tragedy of Vietnam, officers purged military thinking of its counterinsurgency leanings and refocused on conventional war strategy--a posture seen most conspicuously in the 1991 Gulf War and in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. More recently, under the prodding of Gen. David Petraeus, counterinsurgency has made a comeback. Gates aims to institutionalize that shift and make it, once again, the centerpiece of US strategy. &quot;I want to get that capability&quot;--to fight irregular conflicts--&quot;into the base budgets so that it will continue and we don't forget, as we did after Vietnam, how to do what we're doing right now so successfully in both Iraq and Afghanistan,&quot; he said. The ghosts of Vietnam are everywhere in Gates's budget request and in his accompanying statements. He wants more helicopters, as Kennedy and Johnson sought during Vietnam. He wants an additional 2,800 Special Operations troops and &quot;more special-forces-optimized lift mobility and refueling aircraft.&quot; The LCS, intended for anti-piracy and counterinsurgency operations in coastal areas, brings to mind the Swift boat operations in the Mekong Delta. Again recalling Vietnam, high priority is to be placed on training and equipping foreign soldiers to engage in counterterror and counterinsurgency operations. The most immediate requirement for these initiatives, Gates says, is to be found in Afghanistan, where the Obama administration plans to deploy up to 30,000 additional troops. The first increment, 17,000 soldiers, was announced February 17, and thousands more will likely be sent following a review of the war effort this summer. It is clear, though, that Gates is looking beyond Iraq and Afghanistan to a future in which low-intensity wars are the principal arenas in which US forces will be engaged. Gates has not said where, exactly, he sees troops fighting what could be termed the &quot;next Afghanistans.&quot; A careful review of the strategic literature suggests, however, that officials are worried about the spread of Al Qaeda-linked formations to other countries in Central Asia and to &quot;ungoverned&quot; spaces in Africa. The recent establishment of the US Africa Command (Africom) and the growing presence of Special Operations forces in places like Mali, Chad and Somalia hint at what might be in store. Gates is too careful to speak in public of such scenarios. But by optimizing capabilities for combat in these settings, he risks inculcating a predisposition to engage in more wars of this type. It is essential, then, that Congress and the public devote as much attention to the strategic implications of Gates's focus on counterinsurgency as to the economic and jobs implications of eliminating certain big-ticket weapons systems.</strong><br />

Irregular warfighting is key to preventing escaltion from inevitable global conflicts – this accesses every impact<br />

<strong>The study predicts future U.S. forces' missions will range &quot;from regular and irregular wars in remote lands, to relief and reconstruction in crisis zones, to sustained engagement in the global commons.&quot; Some of these missions will be spawned by &quot;rational political calculation,&quot; others by &quot;uncontrolled passion.&quot; And future foes will attack U.S. forces in a number of ways. &quot;Our enemy's capabilities will range from explosive vests worn by suicide bombers to long-range precision-guided cyber, space, and missile attacks,&quot; the study said. &quot;The threat of mass destruction - from nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons - will likely expand from stable nation-states to less stable states and even non-state networks.&quot; The document also echoes Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other U.S. military leaders who say America is likely in &quot;an era of persistent conflict.&quot; During the next 25 years, it says, &quot;There will continue to be those who will hijack and exploit Islam and other beliefs for their own extremist ends. There will continue to be opponents who will try to disrupt the political stability and deny the free access to the global commons that is crucial to the world's economy.&quot; The study gives substantial ink to what could happen in places of strategic import to Washington, like Russia, China, Africa, Europe, Asia and the Indian Ocean region. Extremists and Militias But it calls the Middle East and Central Asia &quot;the center of instability&quot; where U.S. troops will be engaged for some time against radical Islamic groups. The study does not rule out a fight against a peer nation's military, but stresses preparation for irregular foes like those that complicated the Iraq war for years. Its release comes three days after Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England signed a new Pentagon directive that elevates irregular warfare to equal footing - for budgeting and planning - as traditional warfare. The directive defines irregular warfare as encompassing counterterrorism operations, guerrilla warfare, foreign internal defense, counterinsurgency and stability operations. Leaders must avoid &quot;the failure to recognize and fully confront the irregular fight that we are in. The requirement to prepare to meet a wide range of threats is going to prove particularly difficult for American forces in the period between now and the 2030s,&quot; the study said. &quot;The difficulties involved in training to meet regular and nuclear threats must not push preparations to fight irregular war into the background, as occurred in the decades after the Vietnam War.&quot; Irregular wars are likely to be carried out by terrorist groups, &quot;modern-day militias,&quot; and other non-state actors, the study said. It noted the 2006 tussle between Israel and Hezbollah, a militia that &quot;combines state-like technological and war-fighting capabilities with a 'sub-state' political and social structure inside the formal state of Lebanon.&quot; One retired Army colonel called the study &quot;the latest in a serious of glaring examples of massive overreaction to a truly modest threat&quot; - Islamist terrorism. &quot;It is causing the United States to essentially undermine itself without terrorists or anyone else for that matter having to do much more than exploit the weaknesses in American military power the overreaction creates,&quot; said Douglas Macgregor, who writes about Defense Department reform at the Washington-based Center for Defense Information. &quot;Unfortunately, the document echoes the neocons, who insist the United States will face the greatest threats from insurgents and extremist groups operating in weak or failing states in the Middle East and Africa.&quot; Macgregor called that &quot;delusional thinking,&quot; adding that he hopes &quot;Georgia's quick and decisive defeat at the hands of Russian combat forces earlier this year [is] a very stark reminder why terrorism and fighting a war against it using large numbers of military forces should never have been made an organizing principle of U.S. defense policy.&quot; Failing States The study also warns about weak and failing states, including Mexico and Pakistan. &quot;Some forms of collapse in Pakistan would carry with it the likelihood of a sustained violent and bloody civil and sectarian war, an even bigger haven for violent extremists, and the question of what would happen to its nuclear weapons,&quot; said the study. &quot;That 'perfect storm' of uncertainty alone might require the engagement of U.S. and coalition forces into a situation of immense complexity and danger with no guarantee they could gain control of the weapons and with the real possibility that a nuclear weapon might be used.&quot; On Mexico, JFCOM warns that how the nation's politicians and courts react to a &quot;sustained assault&quot; by criminal gangs and drug cartels will decide whether chaos becomes the norm on America's southern border. &quot;Any descent by Mexico into chaos would demand an American response based on the serious implications for homeland security alone,&quot; said the report.</strong><br />

<strong>To meet these challenges, the military strategy again built directly on defense objectives, as it defined three key supporting military objectives. These three military objectives were organized around three simple words of: protect, prevent and prevail. They were simply defined as: “protect the United States against external attacks and aggression; prevent conflict and surprise attack; and prevail against adversaries.”33 To achieve these objectives, this strategy made no reference to specific force structure as had previous military strategies. Instead, it emphasized the desired attributes, functions, and capabilities for a joint force. However, it also supported what came to be called a 1-4-2-1 force sizing construct that appeared in the defense strategy. The 1-4-2-1 construct postulated that the U.S. military needed to accomplish the following: defend the homeland (1), deter forward in and from four regions (4); conduct two overlapping defeat campaigns (2); and win decisively in one campaign (1).34 Overall, this force structure approach provided great flexibility for future force structure changes in concert with a capability- vice threat-based approach, and it clearly had the greatest joint focus to date of any military strategy. The process to produce this strategy was very different from the other three strategies in many ways. A draft of the strategy was produced in 2002 to integrate the advice of the post 9/11 2001 Defense Quadrennial Review and the 2002 National Security Strategy. However there was some question whether an unclassified National Military Strategy was needed. For example, a defense strategy was published as part of the QDR, the Chairman provided military specific advice by the 2002 classified National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, and he provided unclassified operational military advice in 2003 through the Joint Operations Concepts. However, Congress cleared up any ambiguity that existed when it passed the 2004 National Defense Authorization Act. This Act required the Chairman to produce a detailed report that is a biennial review of the National Military Strategy in eight specific areas to include the strategic and military risks inherent in the strategy.35 This amendment to existing U.S. Code involving the Chairman’s responsibilities is an example of Congress performing its oversight role. If Congress is not satisfied with the information it receives, it will pass legislation that is then more specific on “what” the Chairman needs to provide. The actual writing of the 2004 military strategy followed a very integrated and parallel path as the Vice Director of Strategy, Plans and Policy on the Joint Staff stated: “So we’ve worked hand in glove with the Secretary of Defense’s staff in developing both of these documents.”36 The Defense Staff focused on writing a national defense strategy, the first time this was done as a separate unclassified document, and the Joint Staff focused on writing a national military strategy. As such, one sees the military strategy directly referencing a national defense strategy in many of its sections, which reflects this close collaboration to ensure synchronization and alignment. While the military strategy was completed in 2004 and copies could be located on the internet, it was officially released at a March 18, 2005, press conference when the Under Secretary Defense for Policy and Joint Staff Vice Director of Strategy, Plans and Policy discussed the National Defense Strategy and National Military Strategy together.37 CONCLUSION The National Military Strategy is the keystone document of an overarching strategic planning system that enabled the Chairman as the nation’s senior military advisor to execute his formal leadership responsibilities specified by Congress in Title 10 U.S. Code. Since 1990, each of these four strategies identified the broad military ends, ways, and means that were needed to meet the nation’s security challenges identified by the President in his National Security Strategy and integrated advice by the Secretary of Defense from other documents, which now include a National Defense Strategy. The unclassified nature of the military strategy and its completion by the Chairman to integrate this civilian advice was a leadership legacy started by Chairman Powell that continues today. Most importantly, this strategy directly communicates to Congress and the American people the need for a military, what that military will do, and how it will do it to provide for our nation’s security. It essentially creates a compact between the military and the American people that is so important in today’s volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous global security environment.</strong><br />

NMS can effectively cause military withdrawal --- it shapes operational planning, resource allocation, and future defense planning<br />

<strong>Should not the National Military Strategy provide this &quot;strategic pull'? Is the Joint Staff planning system sufficient to develop long range planning and programming guidance? The purpose of this study is to examine the process used to develop the National Military Strategy (NMS) and evaluate the effectiveness of this process for long range planning. The paper reviews the strategy formulation process in a democratic society and then considers the regulations and policies developed since 1986 that govern the process. With that background, the most recently published military strategy which resulted in the Base Force, and the defense strategy in the Bottom Up Review are used to evaluate the system. Finally, a look at the status of the present NMS development serves to analyze progress made within the system. This review does not assess the strategies themselves. It discusses substantive content minimally and only for the purpose of analyzing the formulation process. The study focuses on how effective the Joint Strategic Planning System (JSPS) is in producing a long range military strategy. The study concludes with recommendations to improve the process to meet better the intent of those who directed the development of an NMS. The national military strategy serves two major purposes. First, it provides general guidance for operational planning. The combatant commanders, or Unified Commanders in Chief (CINCs) then carry out the detailed planning. Second, the national military strategy guides force planning and programming. The Services translate this guidance into programs to support the needs of the CINCs. In this way the national military strategy also serves to articulate to Congress a basis for the resource allocation decisions the legislative branch must make. In today's international climate, a coherent military strategy assumes even greater importance. The complexity of the strategic environment has increased substantially since the end of the Cold War. Threats to national security are now more diffuse and difficult to define. No longer can the military develop a strategy based on a specific threat, for the strategy could become quickly obsolete in ever-changing conditions of regional power balances. Compounding this situation is the priority that domestic issues have assumed in national policy making with less emphasis on foreign policy and development of a comprehensive national security strategy. These factors result in an ill-defined strategic environment for the military. But even though the conditions facing the military strategist are uncertain, there are no serious near term direct threats to the security of the United States. These conditions present the military not only with a dilemma, but an opportunity as well. The dilemma is how does the Department of Defense (DoD) bring down the size of the force in this time of reduced threat while still achieving national military objectives? The opportunity is for the military to influence its long term future perhaps more than ever before. The military is now in a period in which it can secure the nation with present forces available while building a force and strategy capable of achieving the long term interests of the nation. This could be a military substantially different from today's. Technology development is progressing rapidly, necessitating a significant leap forward in strategic planning. It now takes ten to twenty years to develop, field, and to become proficient with new doctrine and equipment. Therefore, the process of thinking, forecasting, debating, planning, and programming for the military 20 years from now begins today.</strong><br />

Both are particularly true for military reductions<br />
Gargan ‘99 <strong>(John J., Professor of Political Science – Kent State University, “To Defend A Nation: An Overview of Downsizing and the U.S. Military”, M@n@gement, 2(3), p. 229-230)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>CHANGING THE STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK</strong><br />
<strong>Decisions on military downsizing relate to, or can be related to, a broader strategic planning process. That process is based in starting point assumptions that structure approaches to the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data on environments scanned. To facilitate the adjustment to new global realities, military strategic planers have been counseled to adopt new assumptions and approaches in their work. Two fundamentally different approaches have been available to military strategic planners. (Troxell, 1997). The first is threat based planning which prevailed for most of the Cold War when real threats, such as Soviet military capability and expansion initiatives, were clearly identifiable. Planners developed scenarios, as in the Bottom-Up-Review, to determine possible alternative threat developments. On the basis of the scenarios the force sizes needed to deal with threats were calculated. National command authorities decided how the forces were to be apportioned among regional and functional commands and under what circumstances they would engage the enemy. This approach has the advantage of being precise and explainable to Congress and other key policy makers. The second approach, objective or capabilities based strategic planning, is more general and intricate and of greater use when threats are more ambiguous. Since a lack of clarity and multiple aspects of the threats make scenarios less useful, planners rely more on judgment and calculate force sizes on the basis of resources available or consider general missions and objectives. Instead of constructing scenarios for a particular threat, a portfolio of approaches is to be established and drawn on for dealing with problems under uncertain conditions (Davis, 1994). These somewhat abstract points take on real meaning in the current policy debates. The turbulent strategic planning environments of the post-Cold War years led strategists within the military and at institutions like RAND to argue on behalf of objective based planning to allow the national command authority deal with several goals with differing time frames. Strategic planning results from aspects of objective based planning which may have profound consequences for force structure, and therefore downsizing, can be seen in the National Military Strategy. It includes elements–shaping, responding, preparing–«which synchronize all elements of national power to achieve our security objectives» (Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1997, p. 12). The elements are directed to three major goals and several objectives. The first goal is to Shaping the International Environment; the second is to Responding to the Full Spectrum of Crises; and the third is to Preparing Now For an Uncertain Future. Associated with each goal are a number of more specific charges–promoting regional stability, conducting smaller scale contingency operations, exploiting the revolution in military affairs. Faced with uncertain strategic environments and recognizing the need to plan creatively for an array of possible futures, defense planners, by their approach to planning, have set in play strategies which may make heavy claims on personnel and other resources during downsizing years.</strong><br />

The impact is huge. Even though it isn’t legally binding, the NMS shapes policy and causes enactment of the plan.<br />

<strong>However, as an exercise in considering the degree to which a current strategy document addresses current problems adequately, I have accepted the sponsors’ implied invitation to focus on the “National Military Strategy” approved in May 2004 by General Myers as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS). That focus is appropriate, not only because the 2004 NMS is the most recent of the strategic triad of National Security Strategy issued by the President, National Defense Strategy (NDS) issued by the Secretary of Defense, and NMS issued by CJCS, but because it is, in principle, the most categorical and specific – applying to the armed forces the general strategic guidance laid down in the other two documents. The NMS of course – properly and necessarily – reflects the priority set in the other two documents on the fight against global terrorism, the protection of the homeland and the transformation of the military forces to meet the new threats and challenges. It contains (as do the NSS and NDS) all the right buzz words about the importance of alliances and coalitions and of marshaling all the instruments of American power, not just the military ones. But it also incorporates some innovative and significant themes that go beyond the NSS and NDS or, more precisely, applies them specifically to the tasks facing the American military: • Transformation is, of course, a key theme of the NMS as a strategy for adapting the capabilities of the US armed forces to meet new threats. The NMS is quite explicit in explaining that, in a world in which no “Ten Year Rule” can assume that there will be a relatively prolonged breathing space in crisis operations that would allow transformation to take effect in a period of relative calm, the strategy must be one of “in-stride transformation,” i.e., fundamentally re-shaping doctrine, weapons, training and structures for the future while maintaining capabilities for current operations that will be both intensive and extensive and whose successful execution must necessarily rely on current doctrine, weapons, training and structures. • The NMS goes beyond simply proclaiming the importance of cooperation with allies and friends that are willing to assist us in our military efforts. It lays out some significant priorities for winning that cooperation – including finding new ways to enhance their capabilities, build interoperability, and insure that a technologically advanced US military can work meaningfully with other nations who will not be at the same level. • The NMS follows the NDS in being highly specific on one critical point – the issue of simultaneity of conflict. It notes, “The 2004 NDS directs a force sized to defend the homeland, deter forward in from four regions [evidently, North East Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and “the Western Hemisphere” – the inclusion of Africa is surprising], and conduct two, overlapping ‘swift defeat’ campaigns. Even when committed to a limited number of lesser contingencies, the force must be able to ‘win decisively’ in one of the two campaigns.” (NMS, p. 18) Moreover, the NMS warns, accurately, that there may well be situations in which the military must engage in a new major conflict where it is “unlikely to disengage entirely” from other, lesser engagements in which it is already involved. This guideline – nicknamed the “1-4-2-1 force-sizing construct” – eludes a good many difficult questions – like the difference between ‘swift defeat’ and ‘win decisively’ – but it certainly does not lack for specifics, nor for the potential to be used as a standard against which to measure plans for procurement, budgets, manning tables, lift requirements and the like. • Consistent with the strategy of very ambitious world-wide simultaneous engagement, the NMS emphasizes the need not only for improved intelligence, including ‘persistent surveillance,’ but maintaining world-wide access and robust lift and communications capabilities. In a world in which neither we nor our allies are fully comfortable with the deployment patterns of the Cold War, this will be a major challenge – but it is to the credit of the NMS that it acknowledges the problem. Reviewing the NMS does however reveal some quite considerable – and mildly surprising – omissions and limitations on what would seem critical points – when measured against the standard of either the world situation, the NSS’ definition of US security concepts, or – what I would argue is the real test of the degree to which a strategic document is “real” or “rhetoric” – what we actually do with our military programs and operations. These lacunae include: • Echoing the current jargon of the Pentagon, there is a great deal about basing our military policy on “capabilities” of deliberately unidentified generic adversaries, rather than on specific contingencies. As a planning strategy this concept is hard to accept as the doctrinal innovation it is claimed to be, or even as a very useful construct for planning. Of course, it is as true now as it was during the Cold War – or for that matter the Peloponnesian War – that a strategic planner must take account of the enemy’s capabilities, which are objective facts, and not put excessive weight on assessments of his intent. But the measure of capabilities, no less than intent, is case-specific – as the NMS implicitly acknowledges in pointing to the importance of “the security environment” in assessing risks. • Apart from a few glances back to the Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union as an example of the degree to which the international security environment has changed, there is no mention at all in the NMS of either Russia or China – and indeed no explicit attention to the general long term problem of what used to be called hedging against the re-emergence of a “near-peer competitor.” It may be that the NMS’s passing references to “traditional challenges” from nation-states – or even the concept of “capabilities-based” planning – are meant to encompass the “near-peer” problem without the embarrassing need to say openly whom we are talking about – or the awkward acknowledgement that we cannot concentrate entirely on the problems of terrorism, failed states, or proliferators because we also have to prepare for the more familiar – but in some respects even more grave – challenges from large nation-states possessing not only asymmetric capabilities, but powerful conventional and nuclear ones as well. It may also be that it is thought impolitic (or even unwise in a more profound sense) to mention publicly the possibility of conflict with China, much less Russia – in a public strategic policy statement. Nonetheless, it is a hard fact that Russia remains the second military power on the globe – particularly when nuclear capability is taken into account – and that the future course of Russia remains uncertain. Moreover, in other contexts, the Defense Department is far from bashful about pointing to the potential challenge presented by a China that combines growing economic power, increasing political influence in the region, an unresolved and potentially explosive conflict with Taiwan, and an ambitious military modernization program. Unfortunately, the possibility of conflict with China over Taiwan is all too real and that such a conflict is (aside from a spectacular relapse in our relations with Russia) the one case in which the US could plausibly find itself at war with a powerful nation-state with conventional, asymmetric, and nuclear capabilities. However we may hope to avoid it by prudent diplomacy and deterrence, and however important it is to avoid letting concern about the possibility of conflict with China produce a self-fulfilling prophecy, it is hardly a case we can ignore. In any event, even laying that potential aside, it seems pretty clear that much of our military’s effort – particularly in the maintenance of a very large nuclear capability and commitment to extremely ambitious advanced weapons like F-22 and SSNs and at least some of our alliance relationships – has little to do with terrorism or potential wars with the North Koreas or even the Irans of this world, but is (quite rightly) directed at maintaining America’s long-term capacity to deter and, if need be, defeat any emerging challenge from any would-be rival super-power. Realistically, there are only two candidates for that role. A strategic document that is wholly silent on that significant part of the security environment – or limits itself to references so subtle as to be all but undecipherable – is necessarily less useful as a guide to action than it should be. • Perhaps even more surprising – given the NMS’s candid recognition of the need to balance current effectiveness with long term transformation – the NMS barely mentions Iraq, much less Afghanistan, either as current commitments that dominate immediate needs or as a source of lessons for the future. One would not know from reading this document that the US has committed a huge fraction of its ground forces – virtually all of them, when rotation requirements are taken into account – to these two conflicts, and, perhaps more important, is fundamentally committed to success in both – and has, unfortunately, found that ‘swift defeat’ of the enemy’s organized conventional forces in both wars has not yet meant ‘decisive victory’ in either. For the next several years, it seems likely that maintaining these two commitments – each of which has a central place in our overall effort against terrorism, proliferation, and regional instability -- will have a profound impact on our ability to execute many of the strategic lines of action laid out in the NMS. Doing so will also impact heavily on such priorities as force sizing. Maintaining access, and balancing between current operations and long term transformation. No doubt these issues are a major focus of practical planning in DOD, and there are good reasons not to attempt to manage immediate problems in a strategy document. Nonetheless, the all but complete omission to address the need to commit very large parts of the military to Iraq and to a lesser extent Afghanistan, limits the degree to which the NMS will in fact serve its purpose of defining America’s military priorities for the near and medium term, and serve as guide for force sizing, procurement priorities, basic personnel policies, and the balance between current operations and long term transformation. Nevertheless, these strategic documents do have an impact. At a minimum they will set the terms of the debate over resource allocation and the shaping of concrete military plans. For example, the current priority to the global war on terror provides a context for both advocates and critics in evaluating the relative urgency of other tasks, including the war in Iraq. The commitment to technological superiority – and to dealing with asymmetric threats – sets priorities not only for procurement but for the specific content of transformation. The ambitious “1-4-2-1” standard sets a bar – and a high one – for force sizing, for lift, and for maintenance of alliances and coalitions. They – and the strategy they embody – certainly “matter.”</strong><br />
<br />
None of their indicts of the current NMS apply. The CP reforms the process, issuing a strategic concept to guide implementation. This massively boosts efficiency and ensures enforcement of the plan.<br />

<strong>Over the past decade, jointness has become a paean in the quest to improve the effectiveness of the U.S. armed forces, and justifiably so. Recent military operations have demonstrated a high correlation between joint operations and success on the battlefield. Consequently, the trend toward increased jointness is not likely to abate. The congressional perception of the importance of joint operations by the U.S. armed forces was underscored by the passage of the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act (?Goldwater-Nichols Act?), the most significant reorganization and redistribution of authority and responsibilities within the Department of Defense since 1958.1 In an effort to assure more effective joint operations, Congress increased the powers of the combatant Commanders-in-Chief (CINCs), made the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) the principal military advisor to the National Command Authorities (NCA), and assigned the CJCS specific responsibilities in the areas of strategic planning, joint training and joint doctrine. Additionally, the Joint Chiefs of Staff lost their baronial influence and the Joint Staff was reoriented to serve the CJCS, vice the corporate Joint Chiefs of Staff.2 This does not suggest that this seminal legislation has overcome all the institutional impediments to raising, training and employing joint forces. Problems remain; one of which is the focus of this essay. Difficulties in the development and implementation of sound joint doctrine have been caused, in large measure, by the systemic gap in the existing strategic planning process. The absence of a direct link between the strategic direction of the U.S. armed forces and the operational planning for their employment has hindered the development of coherent and integrated joint doctrine. Also, this situation has not provided effective incentives for the services to embrace joint doctrine, in total. These limitations point to a common solution. They illuminate a missing link in strategic planning for the U.S. armed forces that would connect the National Military Strategy (NMS)3 to key joint planning documents. Filling this strategic planning void would enhance the development and implementation of sound and comprehensive joint doctrine. In short, there is a need for a coherent, traceable, and accountable connection between the NMS and the body of joint doctrine developed to support it. Specifically and proximately, there are no national-level strategic concepts set forth in strategic plans to guide the development and implementation of joint doctrine.4Consequently, the current body of joint doctrine can, at best, be only loosely connected to the NMS. The development of strategic plans would permit strategic guidance, as first expressed in the form of the National Security Strategy (NSS)5and then by the NMS, to be better conveyed to the service chiefs and the CINCs. As strategic guidance and direction work their way through the system, they are further refined and defined. This elucidating process should provide specific guidance for the development of a body of more useful and accepted joint doctrine to guide the conduct of operations for U.S. forces, as well as to rationalize the required types, number, and balance of service forces. A process that integrates strategic planning with joint doctrine development would better actualize the intent of the Goldwater-Nichols Act. And, in this era of penury, such reforms would assist the NCA in validating to the Congress that a more effective and efficient national defense capability is being pursued. While this essay may seem fairly critical of joint doctrine, the process by which it is developed, and the effectiveness of its implementation; one must recognize that the U.S. armed forces have made great progress in developing and promulgating joint doctrine since passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act. As demonstrated during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the availability and application of joint doctrine have significantly improved the warfighting capabilities of U.S. forces. The purpose of this essay, therefore, is to show how joint doctrine can be further enhanced by eliminating some imperfections in the process by which it is developed, and how more complete implementation can be encouraged. Both can be accomplished by more directly linking joint doctrine to the NMS.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>So how does the DoD meet the requirements of the NMS of Shape, Respond, and Prepare, and structure itself for two MTWs? Joint Vision (JV) 2010 and 2020 are guides to meeting these requirements. JV 2010 is:</strong><br />
<strong>[F]ocused on achieving dominance across the range of military operations through the application of new operational concept . . . [it] provides a common direction for our services in developing their unique capabilities within a joint framework of doctrine and programs as they prepare to meet an uncertain and challenging future (CJCS, 1996:1).</strong><br />
<strong>To that end, JV 2010 prescribes how the military will fight in the early 21st Century by focusing on four operational concepts: dominant maneuver, precision engagement, full dimension protection, and focused logistics (CJCS, 1996:1).</strong><br />
<strong>Dominant maneuver is the multidimensional application of information, engagement, and mobility capabilities to position and employ widely dispersed joint air, land, sea, and space forces to accomplish the assigned operational task. Precision engagement consists of a system of systems that enables forces to locate the objective or target, provide responsive command and control, generate the desired effect, assess levels of success, and retain the flexibility to reengage with precision when required. Full dimension protection is the control of the battle-space to ensure forces can maintain freedom of action during deployment, maneuver and engagement, while providing multi-layered defenses for forces and facilities at all levels. Finally, focused logistics is the fusion of information, logistics, and transportation technologies to provide rapid crisis response, to track and shift assets even while enroute, and to deliver tailored logistics packages and sustainment directly to all levels of operation (CJCS, 1996:20-24).</strong><br />
<strong>JV 2010 states, “These four new concepts will enable us to dominate the full range of military operations from humanitarian assistance, through peace operations, up to and into the highest intensity conflict (CJCS, 1996:25).” Just as with our NSS, the major enabler of these military tasks will be the overseas presence of the military, and the ability of the military to accomplish power projection throughout the world. JV 2010 expresses this importance by saying:</strong><br />
<strong>Power projection from the [U.S.], achieved through rapid strategic mobility, will enable the timely response critical to our deterrent and war-fighting capabilities. Our overseas presence and highly mobile forces will both remain essential to future operations (CJCS, 1996:4-5).</strong><br />
<strong>Joint Vision 2020 builds upon the guidance outlined in JV 2010. JV 2020 looks at dominant maneuver, precision engagement, full dimension protection, and focused logistics with an emphasis on joint operability from peace operations to full-scale war. JV 2020 also emphasizes innovation and the building of new military capabilities to meet the objectives of JV 2010 with a force that can carry America’s military into 2020.</strong><br />
<strong>JV 2010 and 2020 incorporate a total vision of full spectrum dominance which implies:</strong><br />
<strong>U.S. forces are able to conduct prompt, sustained, and synchronized operations . . . given the global nature of our interest and obligation, the [U.S.] must maintain its overseas presence forces and the ability to rapidly project power worldwide in order to achieve full spectrum dominance (CJCS, 2000:6).</strong><br />
<strong>The key words above are sustained, global, and rapid projection. Based on NSS, NMS, and JV2010 and 2020, global mobility is the key element in attaining nearly all military or national goals.</strong><br />
<strong>This need for mobility, tied in with global engagement, is what now dictates the focus of the U.S.’s military restructuring. The environment the military faces now is high operations tempo, over the entire expanse of the globe, in every type of scenario. As</strong><br />
<strong>hinted by JV 2020 and described by the USAF Scientific Advisory Board’s New World Vistas Study:</strong><br />
<strong>The operational demands generated by new missions, and the geographical constraints produced by a decreasing number of worldwide bases will require weapon system performance beyond that of existing systems. New technologies will permit improvement of existing systems, but new systems and new concepts will be needed to cope with the world of the 21st century (SAB, 1995a:n.p.).</strong><br />
<strong>The military’s current systems and force structure may not satisfy the requirements of the NSS of global engagement and enlargement, the NMS of shape, respond, and prepare, and the two MTW requirements. Ultimately, the military, and its future systems, should be shaped in accordance with its own JV 2010 and JV 2020 requirements, all of which revolve around global projection and sustainment of power.</strong><br />
<strong>Although JV 2020 starts to look at innovation as a means to meeting NMS needs, a real insight into the direction the military will take comes from its current Commander-In-Chief. President Bush provides the following:</strong><br />
<strong>We will modernize some existing weapons and equipment . . . our goal is to move beyond marginal improvements to harness new technology that will support new strategy . . . we must put strategy first, then spending . . . our defense vision will drive our defense budget, not the other way around…on land, our heavy forces will be lighter, our light forces will be more lethal. In the air we will be able to strike across the world . . . (Allen, 2001:8).</strong><br />
<strong>All of this spells changes in the military’s structure, and in particular its mobility forces. Although the NSS and NMS may not change, the new administration plans to match military capability with the nation’s security strategy.</strong><br />
<strong>The new SecDef, Donald Rumsfeld, will be pushing a change in the military that he says, “is long overdue.” He is looking for a leaner, nimbler military that is suited to fighting missions that include regional wars and supporting peacekeeping missions, to surviving highly capable missile systems, to striking against terrorist bases deep inside hostile territory, and to operating over vast distances of the Asia-Pacific region (Moran, 2001a:n.p.) Again, as with the NSS, NMS, and JV’s, mobility will be a key, if not the key, enabler of national and military interest.</strong><br />
<strong>President Bush adds, “We do not know the shape of our future military, but . . . all will be easier to deploy and to sustain (Sanger, 2001:1).” Again mobility is critical when considering any new force structure and NMS. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs-of-Staff (CJCS), General Shelton, expresses the importance of mobility on NMS by saying:</strong><br />
<strong>Indeed, our ability to move large forces rapidly anywhere in the world . . . is the foundation of our military strength. I saw it vividly demonstrated during our deployment on Desert Shield/Desert Storm. And the foundation has shaped the American way of war for over a century (Shelton, 2000:n.p.).</strong><br />
<strong>The President, SecDef, and CJCS, all have stated the importance of global mobility in meeting the needs of the NSS and NMS</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The Chairman’s strategic planning system integrates the processes and documents of the people and organizations above him (President, Secretary of Defense, and National Security Council) and the people and organizations with which he directly coordinates (Services, Agencies, and Combatant Commanders). The Chairman has no control over any significant defense resources (Secretary of Defense, Services, and Agencies control resources) or direct control of operational military forces (Combatant Commanders control operational forces); however, orders to those forces flow through the Chairman. The Chairman formally influences his civilian leaders and those with whom he coordinates through the processes and documents developed from this strategic planning system. In addition to influencing leaders, this planning system provides insights and specific direction for the many staffs that support these leaders. As such, the Chairman’s Joint Strategic Planning System formally evolved four times during this 16-year period in 1990, 1993, 1997, and 1999. It is the Chairman’s key system that integrates the Nation’s strategy, plans, and resources that consist by FY 2007 of approximately 2.2 million active, guard, and reserve forces and total defense outlays of $572B.4</strong><br />

<strong>The list of defense programs facing do-or-die decisions in the next administration seems to grow monthly. But some decisions—the F-22 Raptor and the next Air Force combat search-and-rescue aircraft—could come due before President-elect Barack Obama and a raft of newly empowered Democrats in Congress have moved into their new offices. Obama ran on a platform that promised to revamp defense programs in favor of personnel needs, rebuilding the military and advancing new technologies. Still, one national security adviser to Obama’s camp says that what is needed first and foremost is a new national military strategy answering the fundamental question: How do you balance demands of counter-insurgency against possible future wars with opponents like China, North Korea and Iran? This, according to the source, has been absent and makes it impossible to decide a direction for such programs as the Raptor and the Army’s Future Combat Systems.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Third, it is unclear who is to ensure that implementation occurs and there is accountability for results. The national strategies are not legal documents with mandates and sanctions. Their goals and actions cut across levels of government and sectors, and involve a large number of organizations and entities, including international and nongovernmental, each with their own priorities – planned or mandated. The authority and capacity of public and private organizations to direct, implement, and be held accountable for the strategies varies: Who is in charge? Who should be? Who should pay? Under what authority? With what partners? In the United States’ system of government and arrangement of public and private spheres, no one central entity or process has “control” of implementation, accountability, oversight, and coordination. Cornish (2008) might argue, however, that a national strategy should not be a policy blueprint to replace senior leadership experience and judgment. Moreover, a national strategy clearly means cross-governmental action that could run counter to departmental independence.</strong><br />

“Reduce” must be a permanent mandate<br />

<br />
<strong>Section 83's counterpart with regard to nondisability pensioners, section 84, prescribes a reduction only if the pensioner should again take a public job. The disability pensioner is penalized if he takes any type of employment. The reason for the difference, of course, is that in one case the only reason pension benefits are available is because the pensioner is considered incapable of gainful employment, while in the other he has fully completed his &quot;tour&quot; and is considered as having earned his reward with almost no strings attached. It would be manifestly unfair to the ordinary retiree to accord the disability retiree the benefits of the System to which they both belong when the latter is otherwise capable of earning a living and had not fulfilled his service obligation. If it were to be held that withholdings under section 83 were payable whenever the pensioner died or stopped his other employment the whole purpose of the provision would be defeated, i.e., the System might just as well have continued payments during the other employment since it must later pay it anyway. [ *13] The section says &quot;reduced&quot;, does not say that monthly payments shall be temporarily suspended; it says that the pension itself shall be reduced. The plain dictionary meaning of the word is to diminish, lower or degrade. The word &quot;reduce&quot; seems adequately to indicate permanency</strong>.<br />

<strong>¶4 The legal question to be resolved by the court is whether the word &quot;should&quot;13 in the May 18 order connotes futurity or may be deemed a ruling in praesenti.14 The answer to this query is not to be divined from rules of grammar;15 it must be governed by the age-old practice culture of legal professionals and its immemorial language usage. To determine if the omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, &quot;and the same hereby is&quot;, (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2) constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the trial judge's intent must be garnered from the four corners of the entire record.16</strong><br />
<strong>13 &quot;Should&quot; not only is used as a &quot;present indicative&quot; synonymous with ought but also is the past tense of &quot;shall&quot; with various shades of meaning not always easy to analyze. See 57 C.J. Shall § 9, Judgments § 121 (1932). O. JESPERSEN, GROWTH AND STRUCTURE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE (1984); St. Louis &amp; S.F.R. Co. v. Brown, 45 Okl. 143, 144 P. 1075, 1080-81 (1914). For a more detailed explanation, see the Partridge quotation infra note 15. Certain contexts mandate a construction of the term &quot;should&quot; as more than merely indicating preference or desirability. Brown, supra at 1080-81 (jury instructions stating that jurors &quot;should&quot; reduce the amount of damages in proportion to the amount of contributory negligence of the plaintiff was held to imply an obligation and to be more than advisory); Carrigan v. California Horse Racing Board, 60 Wash. App. 79, 802 P.2d 813 (1990) (one of the Rules of Appellate Procedure requiring that a party &quot;should devote a section of the brief to the request for the fee or expenses&quot; was interpreted to mean that a party is under an obligation to include the requested segment); State v.

<strong><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The Process in a Democratic Society: The Reality </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">In the democratic government of the United States, control of the military is purposely diffused. The Constitution specifies the President as the Commander in Chief, but reserves to Congress the power to *raise and support Armies.&quot;8 Efficiency in function was sacrificed for control by the people. In broad terms, the military strategist works within this tripartite environment of the administration (the policy makers who define the ends), the legislature (which allocates the resources, or the means), and the military itself which must develop the strategy (or the ways). This can result in the military finding itself caught in the conflict between the executive and the legislative, between the directors and the providers. This conflict often manifests itself in contradictory guidance, exacerbating the difficulty of developing a cohesive military strategy integrated within a national grand strategy. More often than not, the result is a lack of policy. As Samuel Huntington observed in his classic study The Soldier and the State when commenting on policy conditions shortly after World War I (in a foreign policy and domestic environment similar in some ways to today), &quot;Frequently the military men found themselves forced to work in a vacuum and to guess the nature of national policy. 9 In conjunction with this Constitutional complication, national security concerns in peacetime are frequently in conflict with economic priorities. The dilemma is how, with limited resources, to provide for the welfare of the people without taking too much from them to provide for their security? For if the nation is not economically strong, this also is a security risk. The grand strategist has a multiple balancing act of his own. He must employ the political, economic, and military elements of power to achieve not only his international policy aims, but also to achieve the most favorable domestic results. This challenge pressures congressmen to balance the immediate needs of their constituents with the long term security needs of the nation, frequently resulting in detailed Congressional scrutiny of the military budget. This close examination of the budget as well as budget constraints affect strategy formulation. &quot;To a large extent,&quot; Gordon Adams concluded in his monograph The New Politics of the Defense Budget &quot;the defense budget from FY 86 through FY 93 could be said to have been driven as much, if not more, by fiscal limitations than by a clearly defined threat and strategy.'10 These factors manifest themselves in a focus by military force planners on the near term budget rather than on long range planning. The rules In the past eight years Congress has implemented significant changes to the law intended to improve the process of military strategy formulation. The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 strengthened the role of the CJCS and specified his role in strategy development. Foremost among its provisions was the designation of the CJCS &quot;as the principal military adviser to the president, the NSC, and the Secretary of Defense (SecDef).&quot;11 It also made the CJCS responsible for assisting the SecDef and the President in providing for the strategic direction of the Armed Forces. Additionally, the Act made the CJCS responsible, and gave him concomitant authority, for developing strategic plans and budget proposals. Previously, the services generally wrote plans and budgets; but this was only accomplished after some manner of consensus was reached within an environment where the battle to protect service programs was keen. The results, naturally, were strategies and budgets that all could agree on and frequently represented the lowest common denominator. Goldwater- Nichols therefore created an environment in which the CJCS could direct the development of a military strategy in consonance with national military objectives. </span></strong><br />

1. Recent Russian legislation ushered in an assault on NGOs and democracy.<br />
Lowenkron 6<br />
<strong>Barry F. Lowenkron, Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, 2-8-2006. [Testimony at a Hearing of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, p. ln]</strong><br />
<strong>I welcome this opportunity to share with you some of my impressions about the Russian Federation's new NGO legislation, the trajectory of democracy and civil society there, and the way forward.</strong><br />
<strong>Russia is a pivotal player on the world stage and the United States values its strong relationship with Russia. Together, we have already achieved much, and there are many more opportunities for us to work in partnership for peace and prosperity and against common threats. As President Bush said at the Bratislava summit last year, it is in our interest &quot;that Russia be a strong and viable partner with the United States ...but that we understand that in the 21st century, strong countries are built by developing strong democracies.&quot; We want Russian democracy to succeed and we will do all we can to support the work of those who are committed to making democracy's promise a reality for all the citizens of Russia.</strong><br />
<strong>The experience of nations worldwide has shown that a flourishing civil society-especially the activism of NGOs-is essential to reaching democratic goals. The Bush Administration shares the concerns of this Commission that civil society in Russia is under increasing pressure. Recent months have seen raids on NGO offices, registration problems, visa problems for foreign NGOs, and intimidation of NGO leaders and staff. These measures have disrupted the work of key NGOs and have had a chilling effect on Russian civil society.</strong><br />

2. Continued assault on Russian NGOs will result in Russian nationalism, militarism, and revolution.<br />

<strong>The future of NGOs and possible revolution</strong><br />
<strong>In Nikitin’s assessment, weaker NGOs will simply cease to exist under the new system, with its onerous registration system, its exacting bookkeeping requirements, its aversion to foreign funds, its proclivity to patriotic causes and the constant demand that NGOs justify their activities.</strong><br />
<strong>On these or any other grounds, said Nikitin, the Ministry of Justice can shut down an NGO instantaneously. He predicted, as the number of NGOs shrinks, there will be a rise of nationalism, renewed militarisation, and a rash of energy import blackmail against former Soviet block countries, like Ukraine and Georgia, that have western leaning tendencies.</strong><br />
<strong>Ukraine's orange revoltuton, which erupted when pro-western candidate Yushchenko lost in a rigged vote to the Kremlin-backed incumbent. A re-election put Yushchenko in office, intimidating Moscow because of the power of organised civil society.</strong><br />
<strong>Meanwhile, business contribution to the NGO sector is taboo. The political conditions, said Nikitin, are simply impossible, as a donation may reveal a business’ political leanings. In fact, said Nikitin, one business that donated to Bellona St. Petersburg begged that its donation be listed as anonymous.</strong><br />
<strong>At present, Russian power is dependent on high oil prices, said Nikitin. But if those prices bottom out, it could lead to a revolution. Ukraine’s orange revolution passed without bloodshed, said Nikitin [a former Russian nuclear safety inspector] but he was not optimistic that the same would be the case for Russia.</strong><br />
<strong>“They say Russia is stable, but it is not. Even France was considered stabile before its revolution” he said. “But how can Russia survive a third revolution?”</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
3. Russian revolution guarantees nuclear war with the US.<br />
<strong>Steven R.</strong> David<strong>, Ph.D., Professor of Political Science at Johns Hopkins University, Feb.</strong> 1999<strong>. [Foreign Affairs 78(1), Saving America from the Coming Civil Wars, p. Academic Search Premier]</strong><br />
<strong>Should Russia succumb to internal war, the consequences for the United States and Europe will be severe. A major power like Russia -- even though in decline -- does not suffer civil war quietly or alone. An embattled Russian Federation might provoke opportunistic attacks from enemies such as China. Massive flows of refugees would pour into central and western Europe. Armed struggles in Russia could easily spill into its neighbors. Damage from the fighting, particularly attacks on nuclear plants, would poison the environment of much of Europe and Asia. Within Russia, the consequences would be even worse. Just as the sheer brutality of the last Russian civil war laid the basis for the privations of Soviet communism, a second civil war might produce another horrific regime.</strong><br />
<strong>Most alarming is the real possibility that the violent disintegration of Russia could lead to loss of control over its nuclear arsenal. No nuclear state has ever fallen victim to civil war, but even without a clear precedent the grim consequences can be foreseen. Russia retains some 20,000 nuclear weapons and the raw material for tens of thousands more, in scores of sites scattered throughout the country. So far, the government has managed to prevent the loss of any weapons or much materiel. If war erupts, however, Moscow's already weak grip on nuclear sites will slacken, making weapons and supplies available to a wide range of anti-American groups and states. Such dispersal of nuclear weapons represents the greatest physical threat America now faces. And it is hard to think of anything that would increase this threat more than the chaos that would follow a Russian civil war.</strong><br />

<strong>At a time when Russia is intermittently ratcheting up the Cold War rhetoric, offering little on foreign policy issues of most concern, and heading in an increasingly authoritarian direction at home, what is most needed in Washington is a new version of the dual-track strategy Ronald Reagan pursued after 1982: offering serious cooperation on strategic matters while at the same time standing up for America’s democratic principles — principles President Bush has eloquently elaborated in discussing other parts of the world — and engaging directly with Russian society to help foster democratic development.8 The president needs to send strong signals that the United States seeks to promote both economic and political reform in Ukraine and the Caucasus and their eventual integration into Western institutions — not to isolate or humiliate Russia, but because that is the only long-term strategy for achieving stability in the region. Pursuing arms control while simultaneously pressing our democratic values is not easy, but it was successful in the 1980s, and it can be successful again.</strong><br />

<strong>The battle for democracy within Russia will be won or lost largely by internal forces. At the margins, however, the United States can help to tilt the balance in favor of those who support freedom. In seeking to influence economic and political developments inside Russia, the United States has few coercive tools available. Comprehensive, sustained, and meaningful engagement of all elements of Russian society, therefore, must be the strategy. A new policy of aiding Russian democracy begins by speaking the truth about democratic erosion under Putin. Just weeks before assuming her responsibilities as national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice wrote about the deleterious consequences of not speaking honestly about Russia’s internal problems: “The United States should not be faulted for trying to help. But, as the Russian reformer Grigori Yavlinsky has said, the United States should have ‘told the truth’ about what was happening [inside his country].”9 She then attacked “the ‘happy talk’ in which the Clinton administration engaged.” Rice’s message is even truer today. Words matter. Yavlinsky and other defenders of democracy inside Russia still want U.S. officials to tell the truth. Direct personal engagement with Russian democratic activists also matters. When Ronald Reagan traveled to the Soviet Union in May 1988, he discussed arms control and regional conflicts with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. But Reagan did not let his friendship and cooperation with Gorbachev overshadow his other chief concern while in town — human rights. Speaking in Helsinki the day before entering the Soviet Union for the first time, Reagan proclaimed that “There is no true international security without respect for human rights. . . . The greatest creative and moral force in this world, the greatest hope for survival and success, for peace and happiness, is human freedom.” During his stay in the Soviet capital, Reagan echoed this theme in action and words many times, whether in his speech to students at Moscow State University or at a luncheon with nearly 100 human rights activists at the American ambassador’s residence. Reagan did not simply show up for a photo-op with these enemies of the Soviet dictatorship. He accorded these human rights activists the same respect that he showed for his Soviet counterpart. President Bush, Secretary Rice, and other high-profile American officials must adopt a similar strategy of using meetings with Russian democratic and human-rights activists to elevate attention to their cause and help protect these brave people from further harassment by the Russian government. Material support also can make a difference. At a time when Russian democracy is eroding, some Bush administration officials have begun to discuss the timetable for Russia’s “graduation” from American-funded democracy programs. In every budget request since coming to power, the Bush administration has cut funding to the freedom Support Act (fsa) for the region as a whole and Russia in particular. Between 2002 and 2004, funding for fsa fell from $958 million to $548 million, while funding for Russia’s portion of this support fell from $162 million in 2002 to $96 million in 2004 (which, as the result of wisdom on Capitol Hill, was significantly more than the $73 million originally requested by the Bush administration) and dropped still further in 2005. The Bush Administration’s fy 2006 freedom Support Act request for Russia is a mere $48 million.</strong><br />

 Russia will say no- Putin values power too highly<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Maria</strong> Lipman <strong>is the editor of the Pro et Contra journal, published by Carnegie Moscow Center, July 15,</strong> 2006<strong>, “Putin's &quot;Sovereign Democracy&quot;”, Washington Post, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3158:http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/?fa=view&amp;id=18540 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/?fa=view&amp;id=18540" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/?fa=view&amp;id=18540</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3158 --></strong><br />
<strong>But the performance wasn't entirely convincing. The day after their meeting with the president, representatives of many leading Russian and foreign human rights organizations issued a statement in which they expressed &quot;deep concern about the situation with human rights in Russia&quot; and cited a &quot;systemic crisis in the field of human rights and democratic institutions.&quot; &quot;Concealment of these issues,&quot; the statement says, &quot;will promote further degradation of the situation with human rights and the erosion of democracy in Russia.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>These concerns are fully justified by the government's consistent effort to clog up every channel for public participation in politics and to block every opening for the emergence of an autonomous force on the Russian political scene. In the course of Putin's presidency, such fundamental elements of democracy as separation of powers, an independent judiciary, the rule of law and press freedom have been gravely undermined. Over the past year and a half the Kremlin has conducted an ongoing electoral reform aimed at consolidating the dominance of the pro-Kremlin party United Russia. The most recent legislative initiatives further broaden the administrative and legal authority to exclude candidates from party slates and to bar or remove parties from the race altogether. According to a Communist deputy in the Duma, the Russian legislation provides more than 60 pretexts for eliminating the unwanted.</strong><br />
<strong>In one of the most notorious recent innovations, the practice of early voting has been reintroduced after being removed from Russian law just a few years ago. The practice, in which ballot boxes are brought to voters prior to the election so they can vote outside regular polling stations, where no public observer can watch them, provides an easy way to rig the election results. During the Belarusan presidential elections in March, the &quot;early vote&quot; accounted for at least 20 percent of the turnout, with President Alexander Lukashenko winning over 80 percent of it.</strong><br />
<strong>A new alarming development is the use of police-state practices. Much as they did when President Richard Nixon visited Moscow in 1974, authorities are arresting and detaining public activists, with no legal basis for doing so. Three decades ago Communist authorities prevented dissidents and refuseniks from contacting the members of Nixon's delegation. This month, in the days before the G-8 summit, more than 100 people were intimidated, harassed or beaten by the police in various Russian cities. In some cases their passports were taken away from them for no legal reason. Some were young radicals headed for St. Petersburg to rally against the summit; others were on their way to Moscow to attend &quot;The Other Russia,&quot; a meeting of Kremlin political opponents and human rights NGOs held Tuesday and Wednesday.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;The Other Russia&quot; was attended by a few prominent foreign diplomats as well as U.S. administration officials who had been warned by the Russian authorities that they should stay away from the event: A high-ranking Kremlin official said that attendance would be treated as an &quot;unfriendly gesture.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>Foreign officials ignored the Kremlin message and attended the event, at which four young activists were arbitrarily arrested and a German journalist beaten when he tried to photograph the arrests. Thus it's likely that Putin's PR effort was lost on the foreign dignitaries who attended &quot;The Other Russia&quot; -- just as it is lost on anyone who has been paying heed to actual developments in Russia rather than to the official pre-summit rhetoric. Increasingly, the work of improving Russia's image seems a ritual gesture rather than a serious objective of the government.</strong><br />
<strong>The country's abundant energy assets have freed it to practice &quot;sovereign democracy&quot; and act with little or no regard for the judgments of outsiders. By no means does Russia or its wealthy elite want to be isolated. Putin wants recognition of Russia's leading position on the world scene and respect for its economic and geopolitical interests. But he demands that it be recognized as is, not at the cost of softening his increasingly authoritarian policies.</strong><br />

<strong>With this reality in mind, the second proverb makes for a more accurate conclusion. It signals that the seeds for undermining or completely destroying any authentic, independent, and pluralistic civil society in Russia already have been planted and - if not removed in time - promise to deliver bitter fruit. n441 This pending harvest is made only more inevitable based on the prior season's seeds, sowed to control the political process, regional autonomy, media, and business, and whose plants already have developed thick stalks and continue to grow unabated.</strong><br />
<strong>As this analysis has demonstrated, there are many shortcomings with respect to Russia's amended NGO law. Not only is the law drafted in a vague manner that significantly expands administrative discretion, but it also forces NGOs to operate in a legal space that breeds uncertainty concerning compliance. This environment ensures a chilling effect on the diversity and direction of NGO activities and again raises the specter of the Soviet analogy. U.S. Representative Tom Lantos has observed that Putin's Russia &quot;bears an unsettling resemblance to the former Soviet Union, albeit with consumer goods and a wealthy business class. Voices of criticism, opposition, and alternative opinion are jailed, curtailed, or come to practice self-censorship.&quot; n442 What is so startling about this parallel of authoritarianism is that it does not end with Putin's approach to controlling Russian society. Similarities with the Soviet era occur in Russia's reaction to international scrutiny and its response to international law norms. For example, in objecting to the release of a U.S. human rights report on Russia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asserted: &quot;we are convinced in the inadmissibility of the use of the ideas of democracy and human rights as a cover for interference in internal affairs.&quot; n443 On a prior occasion, Putin had [*85] expressed his astonishment that &quot;[Russia's] internal law-making is of such great interest to foreign governments.&quot; n444</strong><br />
<strong>A growing pattern of acceptance by Western states and international organizations of Russian noncompliance with international norms has fueled the assertion of this positivist stance. For example, Nikolay Spassky, deputy secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council, talked down the original draft of the NGO law as a &quot;trial balloon,&quot; floated to test the reaction from Europe and the United States. n445 Even in light of the protests raised in the West, the Russian government undertook only minor changes to the final version of the law. This pattern sends a message to Russian policy-makers that there are few, if any, costs involved with violating international norms or treaties to which their country is a party. n446</strong><br />

<strong>Whatever US officials might concede privately, the White House, State Department and Pentagon have thus far not acknowledged publicly the possibility that greater American intrusiveness in Afghanistan might mean less Pakistani cooperation. That, however, appears to be the case. To be sure, Pakistan has pragmatically responded to US pressure to thwart the Taliban in its tribal areas. But it is more significant in the broader strategic context that Pakistan has objected to expanded US military operations in Afghanistan on two grounds. Firstly, they would cause a cross-border spillover of militants into Pakistan and increase the counter-insurgency burden on the Pakistani military. Secondly, they would foment political instability in Pakistan by intensifying popular perceptions of American military occupation of the region and the Pakistani government's complicity with the Americans in suppressing a group that was not even considered an enemy of Pakistan. Indeed, in a July 2009 briefing, Pakistani officials made it clear that, however concerned the United States was about the Taliban, they still regard India as their top strategic priority and the Taliban militants as little more than a containable nuisance and, in the long term, potential allies.5</strong><br />

<strong>WASHINGTON, September 15—Unable to sustain solid growth, Pakistan’s economy is teetering on the brink of collapse, with one-third of the population living below the poverty line. S. Akbar Zaidi writes in a new brief that Pakistan’s economic instability stems in large part from low government revenue due to the elite’s use of tax evasions, loopholes, and exemptions. Without tax reform, Pakistan will continue to run an unsustainable debt and be forced to rely on Western donors for bailouts.</strong><br />
<strong>Policy Recommendations:</strong><br />
<strong>Eliminate exemptions. Fewer than three million of Pakistan’s 175 million citizens pay any income tax, and the country’s tax-to-GDP ratio is just 9 percent. By eliminating tax exemptions for the rich, politicians can fund essential social services.</strong><br />
<strong>Increase tax revenue. Pakistani legislators must build a consensus to tax the rich and elite if they want to match growth rates in nearby developing countries.</strong><br />
<strong>Spend more on development. Pakistan has spent twice as much on defense during peacetime as it has on education and health combined—this needs to change.</strong><br />
<strong>Stop the bailouts. Donor countries must put conditions on funding and should emphasize tax and economic reform to help Pakistan develop long-term economic plans for sustainable growth.</strong><br />
<strong>“Pakistan’s lack of a proper tax and revenue regime has resulted in high rates of tax evasion, burdening the country with unsustainable debt and undermining its development priorities,” writes Zaidi. “The key to the country’s economic prosperity—even its survival—is a far-reaching program of tax reform.”</strong><br />

<strong>Pakistan populated by more than 170 million people could turn into a black hole that could swallow many more trillions of dollars in an escalating but ultimately unwinnable war on terror that would disrupt not only the economies of the west with hundreds of thousands more boots on the ground, but also the economies of the neighbouring states, especially India, Iran and China much as the war in Afghanistan had increasingly impacted on the Pakistani state and economy over the past few years. Not only is Pakistan's vast military industrial complex and arms stock piles at risk, but far more deadly than the IED's or klashnikovs are Pakistan's nuclear and chemical weapons that could greatly increase the risks of a series of dirty bombs emerging from within a failed state even if the nuclear weapons themselves remained secure.Therefore the Pakistan crisis has the potential for becoming a very significant factor when determining the direction of the global economy over the coming years due to boEngage NK</strong><br />

<br />
The United States should adopt a long-term strategy of economic engagement with North Korea . North Korea’s attitude toward the world is closely related to the underlying structure of its domestic political-economy: a closed, command economy that favors the military and heavy industry and is isolated from the sweeping economic and political changes that have transformed the Asian landscape in recent decades . Encouraging a more open and market-friendly economic growth strategy would benefit the North Korean people as a whole and would generate vested interests in continued reform and opening, and a less confrontational foreign policy . In other words, economic engagement could change North Korea’s perception of its own self-interest . China’s economic transformation stands as an important precedent, showing how a greater emphasis on reform and opening can have positive effects on foreign policy as well . Economic change has the potential to induce and reinforce the D .P .R .K .’s peaceful transition into a country that can better provide for its people’s welfare and engage with other countries in a non-hostile manner . Economic engagement should be a central part of U .S . strategy in dealing with Pyongyang, and is complementary to the current focus on solving the nuclear issue . Sanctions have a role in defending the U .S . against risks of proliferation, but they have not and cannot provide a long-run solution to the North Korean problem . Combining targeted sanctions with robust engagement, as the Obama administration is attempting to do with Iran and Burma, offers the best hope of changing the motivations and the actions of states that presently take a hostile stance toward the U .S . and the international community . The first section of the report, “Case for Engagement,” identifies a number of potential benefits to the U .S . and its allies of economic engagement with the D .P .R .K . The most fundamental is that it would encourage the gradual transformation of the D .P .R .K .’s political economy and foreign policy, with direct benefits to international peace . Economic engagement opens space for the Korean people to have greater contact with outsiders, and vice versa; it also reinforces changes that are already taking place from the ground up . An active economic engagement policy would bring the long-term strategic approach of the U .S . into alignment with those of its allies and partners, who maintain much more extensive economic ties to North Korea than does the U .S . Our report is focused on the economic side of engagement, and particularly on forms of economic engagement that can and should proceed now as first steps in a process of phased engagement . While some engagement should continue to be conditioned on progress on the nuclear and other fronts, many forms of engagement should proceed with no conditions attached . We do not claim that economic engagement will resolve the nuclear issue, particularly in the near term . But, in the long run, the mechanisms of engagement we recommend would have a positive influence on the environment in which Pyongyang makes its nuclear security calculations—including its weighing of the costs and benefits of its nuclear weapons and missile programs .<br />
Since the end of the Cold War have been dominated by the effort to dissuade North Korea from gaining the capability to produce, deliver, and spread nuclear weapons . After fifteen years of on-again, off-again bilateral and multilateral negotiations, preventing the D .P .R .K . from producing and proliferating nuclear weapons remains today the all-consuming focus of U .S . policy toward Pyongyang . Our task force recommends taking a broader and more ambitious approach to U .S .- D .P .R .K . relations than the United States has pursued to date . The United States, working with its allies and friends in the region, should aim its policies toward the goal of influencing North Korea’s long-term intentions and behavior, as well as its capabilities . We recommend a sustained and determined process of economic engagement with the D .P .R .K . by means of activities that do not jeopardize U .S . security concerns, and could catalyze a positive long-term effects <br />

<br />
The Obama administration has determined that sanctions are appropriate in the near term to demonstrate the will of the international community to stem the spread of nuclear weapons and to bring the D .P .R .K . back to the negotiating table . But sanctions will not over the long run bring about a positive change in North Korea’s behavior toward other countries or its own citizens . Furthermore, while the current sanctions may impede North Korea’s transfers of nuclear and missile technology to other countries or groups, they are unlikely to block them entirely . Sanctions alone cannot provide protection from the threat posed now or in the future by North Korea . Combining sanctions with robust engagement, as the Obama administration is attempting to do with Iran and Burma, offers the best hope of changing the motivations and the actions of states that presently take a hostile stance toward the U .S . and the international community .1 This report makes the case for economic engagement with North Korea, describes North Korea’s unfulfilled potential to support such efforts, and offers concrete proposals for how to undertake economic engagement through academic exchange, NGO cooperation, and participation in the IFIs . Unlike foreign aid, on which the D .P .R .K . has become dependent, these types of economic engagement will enable the D .P .R .K . to provide for its own people . And unlike foreign aid, which can be diverted to the North Korean military or internal security apparatus, these actions will not strengthen the coercive power of the North Korean regime . Instead, economic engagement starts a process that may lead to significant benefits without enhancing the D .P .R .K .’s military capabilities or making the U .S . or its allies more vulnerable . <br />

Economic cooperation and interaction between the D .P .R .K ., countries would encourage the gradual transformation of the D .P .R .K .’s political economy and foreign policy, with direct benefits to international peace . Integrating North Korea into the dynamic Asia-Pacific region would improve the welfare of the long-isolated North Korean people and create conditions conducive to a lasting peace in Northeast Asia . By bringing economic engagement to the forefront, this report suggests a different lens through which to view U .S . policy toward the D .P .R .K . Domestic economic circumstances and the political interests linked to them shape the possibilities for and constraints on decision makers in Pyongyang . Thus, North Korea’s attitude toward international relations is closely related to the underlying structure, long-term trends, and current conditions of its domestic political economy . By encouraging North Korea in the process of economic growth in a way that substantially benefits its people as a whole, engagement would generate vested interests in continued reform and opening, and in less hostile foreign relations . U .S . support for economic development in North Korea also would help advance the process of gradual economic integration of North and South Korea, with the potential for significant long-term economic benefits to Koreans on both sides of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) .2 More interactions between the U .S . and D .P whatever path the two Koreas find for reconciliation In other words, cooperation on economic development should not be viewed simply as a “carrot” to reward North Korea for denuclearization . Rather, it is a powerful mechanism to change North Korea’s internal and external behavior . Economic change has the to induce and reinforce the D .P .R .K .’s peaceful transition into a provide for its people’s welfare and engage with other countries in a non-hostile manner <br />

<br />
Economic engagement opens space for the Korean people to have greater contact with outsiders, and vice versa. As the past experiences of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and China suggest, standoff policies of sanctions and isolation freeze domestic policies in place; international engagement expands the opening for gradual change. The international financial institutions (IFIs), for example, played a catalytic role in China’s economic transition since the early 1980s. Countries like China, Vietnam, and Mongolia that embraced international assistance in the transition process are prospering and contributing to regional peace. Countries that have been isolated remain mired in economic stagnation and are sources of regional instability. We strongly advocate that the U.S. encourage efforts by the IFIs to engage the D.P.R.K. in a long-term process of institutional participation. <br />
Post-1978 China provides the most dramatic example of how domestic economic reform can reshape the foreign policy of a Communist country. The 11 Chinese experience proved that economic reform need not be political suicide for Communist leaders. Reforms were designed as ad hoc arrangements to be negotiated for each unit or set of units, a form of patronage that the leaders could disburse to build support from key groups such as provincial officials. Access to the market, foreign trade, and foreign investment translated into larger gains than were possible within the planned economy. As the reform bandwagon gathered momentum, growth accelerated, and living standards improved, China’s leaders came to believe that their political survival depended on preventing any international clashes that could derail the country’s economic growth. <br />
To reassure other countries that it was not a threat and maintain a peaceful international environment for its development, China remade itself from a revolutionary anti-Western power to a responsible power that embraces international norms. There are profound differences between North Korea today and China three decades ago, and the vested interests opposed to change in the D.P.R.K. are formidable. Nonetheless, China’s transformation in domestic motivations and foreign policy stands as a precedent for the kind of shift that may eventually occur in the D.P.R.K. <br />

<br />
<strong>WHAT IS OVERSEAS MILITARY PRESENCE?</strong><br />
<strong>Our working definition of US overseas military presence is that it consists of all the US military assets in overseas areas that are engaged in relatively routine, regular, non-combat activities or functions.</strong><br />
<strong>By this definition, forces that are located overseas may or may not be engaging in presence activities. If they are engaging in combat (such as Operation Enduring Freedom), or are involved in a one-time non-combat action (such as an unscheduled carrier battle group deployment from the United States aimed at calming or stabilizing an emerging crisis situation), then they are not engaging in presence activities. Thus, an asset that is located (or present) overseas may or may not be “engaged in presence activities,” may or may not be “doing presence.”</strong><br />
<strong>We have thus far defined presence activities chiefly in “negative” terms—what they are not. In more positive terms, what exactly are presence activities, i.e., what do presence activities actually entail doing?</strong><br />
<strong>Overseas military presence activities are generally viewed as a subset of the overall class of activities that the US government uses in its efforts to promote important military/security objectives [Dismukes, 1994]. A variety of recurrent, overseas military activities are normally placed under the “umbrella” concept of military presence. These include but are not limited to US military efforts overseas to train foreign militaries; to improve inter-operability of US and friendly forces; to peacefully and visibly demonstrate US commitment and/or ability to defend US interests; to gain intelligence and familiarity with a locale; to conduct peacekeeping activities; and to position relevant, capable US military assets such that they are likely to be available sooner rather than later in case an evolving security operation or contingency should call for them.</strong><br />

In the recent elections, the voters expressed their intense opposition to the Iraq war. But we can discern how those hopes are being betrayed. From the Pentagon, we're hearing about a &quot;surge&quot; in troop numbers before reductions can occur, and critics who style themselves as &quot;realists&quot; speak of a &quot;phased withdrawal.&quot; But, as happened in Vietnam, this can translate into a prolonged military presence in which a futile battle continues. During three years of occupation, the situation in Iraq has continued to roll downhill. If 140,000 U.S. troops have failed to defeat the insurgents, halt sectarian violence or create an Iraqi military able to restore security, what reason is there to suppose some smaller number will achieve these ends?<br />

It is unlikely, however, that the key spending decisions identified here will be pending in the Congress simultaneously. Because of the phased nature of the withdrawal, the Defense Department may be able to postpone final decisions in some areas without seriously disrupting withdrawal plans. Other decisions may require prompt attention. And some may depend on prior actions. Indeed, the Defense Department and the Congress may wish to preserve the maximum degree of flexibility during the withdrawal in order to monitor and assess its military and political consequences.<br />

Let's start with &quot;phased withdrawal.&quot; Withdrawal (&quot;the act or process of withdrawing, a retreat or retirement&quot;) usually means sayonara, arrivederci, so long. And a &quot;phase,&quot; of course, is a &quot;stage.&quot; But put them together and, at least in the present collective Washingtonian imagination, we're still somehow embedded in Iraq the year after next with no actual plan for leaving in sight and none of our basic structures -- 5 or 6 bases the size of American towns and a goliath of an embassy -- in that country touched. Perhaps it's time to relabel this &quot;option,&quot; something like &quot;phased staying&quot; or &quot;phased permanency.&quot;<br />
In turn, the Iraq Study Group's findings, which, as James Fallows recently noted, have been layered into our world these last weeks via &quot;obviously authoritative leaks,&quot; might be relabeled &quot;phased recommendations.&quot; They may not, however, faze George W. Bush, who has already responded (or perhaps presponded) by ordering two other sets of reviews to be conducted, ensuring that Washington will be flooded with recommendations. We face a veritable war of the recommendations. All of this is a classic case of Washington fiddling while Baghdad burns.<br />

<strong>“Reduce” means diminish in aggregate</strong><br />
<strong>Words and Phrases 7</strong> (36B W&amp;P, p. 80)<br />
<br />
Mass. 1905. Rev.Laws, c. 203 §9, provides that, if two or more cases are tried together in the superior court, the presiding judge may “reduce” the witness fees and other costs, but “not less than the ordinary witness fees, and other costs recoverable in one of the cases” which are so tried together shall be allowed. Held that, in reducing the costs, the amount in all the cases together must be left in the aggregate an amount not less than the largest sum recoverable in any of the cases. The word “reduce,” in its ordinary signification, does not mean to cancel, destroy, or bring to naught, but to diminish, lower, or bring to an inferior state.—Green v. Sklar, 74 N.E. 595, 188 Mass. 363. <br />
<br />
<strong>Phased withdrawal and reduce are distinct</strong><br />
<strong>Rothschild '5</strong> – Asia Times IR journalist (Mark, 11/29/05, &quot;The illusion of phased withdrawal,&quot; <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3172:http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GK29Ak01.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GK29Ak01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GK29Ak01.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3172 -->, RG)<br />
<br />
From the foregoing, it is hard not to conclude that phased withdrawal is being utilized as a slogan under which military operations will continue - and that thousands of American combat troops may still be in Iraq for many years to come. <br />
Those Democratic members of Congress who think well of themselves for now advocating phased withdrawal are either deluding themselves, or they are continuing to play the same double game many of them began playing when they originally voted to authorize the use of force - and then sniped at the Bush administration over the subsequent conduct of the war. <br />
Phased withdrawal is an empty slogan that can only result in prolonging the war. It is knowingly advocated by those who wish to prolong the war, and naively advocated by some who earnestly oppose the war.<br />

¶4 The legal question to be resolved by the court is whether the word &quot;should&quot;13 in the May 18 order connotes futurity or may be deemed a ruling in praesenti.14 The answer to this query is not to be divined from rules of grammar;15 it must be governed by the age-old practice culture of legal professionals and its immemorial language usage. To determine if the omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, &quot;and the same hereby is&quot;, (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2) constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the trial judge's intent must be garnered from the four corners of the entire record.16 <br />
13 &quot;Should&quot; not only is used as a &quot;present indicative&quot; synonymous with ought but also is the past tense of &quot;shall&quot; with various shades of meaning not always easy to analyze. See 57 C.J. Shall § 9, Judgments § 121 (1932). O. JESPERSEN, GROWTH AND STRUCTURE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE (1984); St. Louis &amp; S.F.R. Co. v. Brown, 45 Okl. 143, 144 P. 1075, 1080-81 (1914). For a more detailed explanation, see the Partridge quotation infra note 15. Certain contexts mandate a construction of the term &quot;should&quot; as more than merely indicating preference or desirability. Brown, supra at 1080-81 (jury instructions stating that jurors &quot;should&quot; reduce the amount of damages in proportion to the amount of contributory negligence of the plaintiff was held to imply an obligation and to be more than advisory); Carrigan v. California Horse Racing Board, 60 Wash. App. 79, 802 P.2d 813 (1990) (one of the Rules of Appellate Procedure requiring that a party &quot;should devote a section of the brief to the request for the fee or expenses&quot; was interpreted to mean that a party is under an obligation to include the requested segment); State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211, 215 (Mo. 1958) (&quot;should&quot; would mean the same as &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;must&quot; when used in an instruction to the jury which tells the triers they &quot;should disregard false testimony&quot;). 14 In praesenti means literally &quot;at the present time.&quot; BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 792 (6th Ed. 1990). In legal parlance the phrase denotes that which in law is presently or immediately effective, as opposed to something that will or would become effective in the future [in futurol]. See Van Wyck v. Knevals, 106 U.S. 360, 365, 1 S.Ct. 336, 337, 27 L.Ed. 201 (1882).<br />

<br />
WASHINGTON — Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) called Thursday for a phased U.S. military withdrawal from Iraq, becoming the most prominent member of Congress to advocate a troop pullout since American forces invaded the strife-torn Middle Eastern nation 22 months ago.<br />
Speaking three days before the Iraqi parliamentary elections, Kennedy detailed a plan that called for the immediate pullout of about 10% of American military forces &quot;to send a signal about our intention,&quot; followed by a clearly outlined exit strategy.<br />
