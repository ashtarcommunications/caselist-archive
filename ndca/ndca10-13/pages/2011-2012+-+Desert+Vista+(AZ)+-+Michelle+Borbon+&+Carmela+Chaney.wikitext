**Currently, there are no plans to launch the Deep Space Climate Observatory**
Bill **Donahue 11** (April 6, Reporter Popular Science, “Who Killed the Deep Space Climate Observatory”, http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-03/lost-satellite?page=1)
But <span class="underline">in 2001</span>, just a ... advised me write to NASA.

**Plan Text: The United States federal government should increase its exploration and development of space by launching the Deep Space Climate Observatory.**

==**Advantage 1: Solar Storms**== 
**Currently there is only a 14 year old satellite detecting solar weather, this guarantees failure**
**Homeland Security Newswire 11** (“Scientists warn solar storms could be ‘global Hurricane Katrina’”, March 7, 2011, http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/scientists-warn-solar-storms-could-be-global-hurricane-katrina?page=0,1) 
Professor Beddington said, “The potential vulnerability ... morning when I get up,” he said.

**Severe solar storms will collapse the power grid for decades.**

A severe solar storm could cause...a period of years and possibly decades.

**Two Impact Scenarios-**
**First, if the power grid collapses hundreds of millions will die.**
**Emanuelson 11** (July 18. Jerry, Electrical Engineer, Science Reporter FutureScience LLC, “Getting Prepared for an Electromagnetic Pulse Attack or Severe Solar Storm”, July 18, 2011, <span style="color: #000000;">[[http://www.futurescience.com/emp/emp-protection.html]]</span>) 
Because of the inevitability of a ... situation is beginning to change.

**Second, this will lead to nuclear meltdowns which cause extinction**
**International Business Times 11** (“Solar Flare Could Unleash Nuclear Holocaust Across Planet Earth, Forcing Hundreds of Nuclear Power Plants Into Total Meltdowns”, September 14, 2011, http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/213249/20110914/solar-flare-could-unleash-nuclear-holocaust-across-planet-earth-forcing-hundreds-of-nuclear-power-pl.htm)
And yet the real crisis here ... small fraction of the total population.

**DSCOVR is key to effective solar storm prediction- this solves blackouts**

Jr., Administrator of the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (NOAA), 1/28/2010, Natural Disasters and Solar Storms: Why Space Weather Matters, <span style="color: #000000;">[[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/conrad-c-lautenbacher-phd/natural-disasters-and-sol_b_440128.html]]</span>]
In addition to events such as... DSCOVR's launch funding be eliminated.

==**Advantage Two: Warming**== 
**A scientific consensus has been reached that warming is happening and caused by humans**
**Bill McKibben 09** (January/February, a scholar in residence at Middlebury College, won the Lannan Prize for nonfiction writing in 2000, Former President of the Harvard Crimson Newspaper, “Think Again: Climate Change”, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story _id=4585&page=0)
No, they’re not. In the early years ... we’re now seeing in the Arctic.

**We Have Two Impact Scenarios-**
**1. Warming decimates coral reefs which leads to extinction- even if they win warming is good for some species we win the best internal link to biodiversity**
**Shah 11** (Anup, January 16, Creator and Editor Global Issues, "Coral Reefs", <span style="color: #000000;">[[@http://www.globalissues.org/article/173/coral-reefs]]</span>)
The above-mentioned Status of Coral Reefs ... especially tropical marine life, goes extinct.

**2. Warming will cause extinction**
**The Guardian 08** (August 11, “On a Planet 4C Hotter, A; We Can Prepare For Is Extinction”, http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/ climatechange)
We need to get prepared for ...<span class="underline"> towards a similar hothouse Earth</span>.

**The magnitude of warming outweighs all other impacts**

<span class="underline">Climate change is widely acknowledged...They continue in this vein</span>.

After being criticized by lawmakers ... that may be, officials said.

==**Observation 4: No war impacts.**== 
**Great power war will not happen- current trends prove**

Never say never. <span class="underline">In 2005, researchers</span> ...<span class="underline">becomes downright thinkable</span>.

**Specifically, Hegemonic wars and a war with China won't happen**
