<table class="wiki_table">
    <tr>
        <td>The 11 January 2007<span class="BoldUnderline"> test of a Chinese</span> ground-based, direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) kinetic-kill interceptor against one of their own defunct weather satellites generated considerable angst across the United States space community. The 2007test demonstrated that the importance of space capabilities is also their Achilles heel, that is, their deadly weakness in spite of overall strength; it is far too easy to neutralize space systems and their power. In the broad strategic context, <span class="BoldUnderline">space capabilities have their own set of unique, inherent </span>vulnerabilities, which are largely the result of orbital mechanics. <span class="BoldUnderline">This </span>invites destruction, <span class="BoldUnderline">damage, and even just mischief delivered by even the least significant adversary</span>. However, <span class="BoldUnderline">other nations may seek to deny U.S. advantages in space through a variety of negation and prevention actions. Negation Threats Satellite systems consist not only of spacecraft, each with their own payload and bus, but also a supporting infrastructure—ground control stations, tracking and control links, commonly referred to as the tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&amp;C) links, data links, launch facilities, and an industrial base</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Each of these components is at risk to threats of physical and cyber attack, and sabotage, and can be negated, simultaneously or each in detail. The satellite payload, bus, links, and infrastructure can be negated by using a variety of permanent or reversible means to achieve one of the five possible effects, known as the ‘‘five Ds’’—deception, disruption, denial, degradation, and destruction.5 Space-based threats proliferate as a result of the ever-growing global availability of technology and access to the space domain. </span>There are huge incentives for states to invest in and use space , and the spread of space technologies has occurred. States with sufficient resources can now reach out to space and ‘‘touch’’ satellites through a variety of means, and achieve one and even more of the five Ds. Spacecraft are vulnerable to direct ascent weapons as demonstrated by the Chinese ASAT test, and to a variety of other groundbased, airborne, and space-based ASAT technologie<span class="BoldUnderline">s</span>. Direct-ascent launched, or orbit-based nuclear devices, can be detonated, generating radiation and other lethal effects to destroy unshielded electronics over a wide lethal range. Co-orbital ASATs could be employed, comparable to the old Soviet system that was tested extensively in the 1970s and early 80s. In a less likely scenario, space-borne mines can also be deployed in close proximity to spacecraft, or exploded to generate debris clouds that destructively engage whole classes of satellites in the same orbital plane or in crossing orbits. Ground, space-based, or airborne lasers could be used by adversaries to wreak havoc. Blinding operations could be executed and inflict effects ranging from temporary ‘‘dazzling’’ to permanent burnout of optical or other sensors with intense energy bursts. Ground systems, supporting communications, and their nodes, are vulnerable to diverse land, sea, or air kinetic attacks, including sabotage. Unprotected systems are also susceptible to electronic attack through jamming and electromagnetic deception techniques. Jammers emit signals that mask or prevent reception of desired signals; these methods can disrupt uplinks, downlinks, and even cross-links. <span class="BoldUnderline">By disabling the means of command and control, and data communications, jammers render satellites inoperable or unavailable. </span>Electromagnetic deception techniques can be employed to confuse systems; this could include sending false, but deceptively plausible, commands that cause spacecraft to perform damaging or wasteful maneuvers, modify databases or execute configuration changes, or otherwise destroy it. Similarly, supporting terrestrial ground stations, computer networks, and links are vulnerable to information operation and cyber attacks. These attacks could involve directing global denial of service tasks, injecting fake commands, malicious software and viruses into the space system, performing unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of sensitive information (data interception), and causing unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of network information, services, and databases. In sum, there is a wide span of kinetic and other types of attacks an adversary could consider and employ. There is potential that even non-state actors can access some of these technologies and space systems, and achieve several of the five Ds; however, it is unlikely they can obtain and then employ a full-spectrum of these means and achieve all of these effects. Conducting an attack within the space domain involves a rather substantial investment to develop, acquire, operate, and sustain needed shooter, sensor, and command and control systems. Given the scope and commitment needed to affect such a move, an on-orbit attack would probably be made only in the context of a larger strategic struggle, perhaps as a prelude to or part of early combat operations. On the other hand, <span class="BoldUnderline">inexpensive jamming technology is available to even the poorest potential adversaries. As such, jamming poses the most used and growing threat to space systems.</span> Some argue that jamming also carries with it implicit political and legal sanctions since no major space power has moved to ban or make even temporary and reversible jamming illegal. This may change now that a number of nations have banned together to object to recent Iranian satellite jamming.6 Cyber adversaries and criminals are also beginning to hone their craft. They present an evolving threat to space systems; and like jamming, cyber threats can be developed and deployed for only modest investments. Prevention Threats Prevention actions generally involve economic, political, informational, and diplomatic instruments of national power. For example, an extremely large creditor nation could employ its considerable economic clout and leverage in an attempt to compel or blackmail the United States to not license or permit imaging of its territory, preventing its use, and reducing its exposure to such observation. The creditor nation could seek to accomplish its objective by destabilizing the world market place. It could refuse to purchase treasury offerings that underpin the burgeoning U.S. fiscal and trade deficits, perhaps arguing that remote sensing, especially commercial remote sensing, of its territory infringes on its territorial and sovereign rights, or that it constitutes ‘‘unlawful’’ industrial espionage, and is thus, an unfair trade practice.7 Commercial remote sensing systems are nowan important resource for the United States Government and its national security needs. U.S. Government orders help sustain and stabilize the remote sensing industry,8 and any limitations on activities, whether for U.S. Government customers or commercial ones, imposed in response to external economic threats could evolve to cause problems. In an alternative scenario, a state, acting through political allies and proxies, could exert considerable influence and dominance to affect a change in U.S. law. This change could restrict licensing of commercial remote sensing imagery, restricting the market place and impacting business models for producers.9 As a diplomatic prevention example, adversaries could attempt to use international forums and treaties to deny frequency rights needed by U.S. military or intelligence satellites by making spurious ‘‘paper satellite’’ filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). ‘‘Paper satellites’’ involve ITU applications for satellite orbital slots, many for ‘‘speculative’’ systems that will never leave Earth. These filings can block access to scarce spectrum and orbital resources.10 The ability to place communications and other satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) positions could be held at risk. Some characterize some of these types of actions as a form of ‘‘lawfare.’’ ‘‘The term lawfare describes the growing use of international law claims, usually factually or legally meritless, as a tool of war. The goal is to gain a moral advantage over your enemy in the court of world opinion, and potentially a legal advantage in national and international tribunals.’’11 Prevention actions taken to hobble U.S. space systems are not armed attacks. As is discussed later, the use of force is only authorized under the United Nations (UN) Charter in response to an armed attack, or upon authorization of the UN Security Council. As such, using armed force to deter and defeat prevention actions involving political or diplomatic subterfuge or intrigue may be unlawful under international law. Creative alternative solutions must therefore be found to assure access to space when facing these types of threats. Implications for U.S. Space Strategy <span class="BoldUnderline">The wide span of threats poses profound implications for U.S. space strategy and its execution</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">First</span>, <span class="BoldUnderline">unlike the Cold War era, t</span>he U<span class="BoldUnderline">nited </span>S<span class="BoldUnderline">tates </span>now confronts a wide array of global actors, all operating with different motivations and incentives, some of which could become potential adversaries who can attack or threaten space capabilities. <span class="BoldUnderline">These state and non-state adversaries exhibit a wide array of political, economic, technical, and social differences</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Having many potential adversaries makes each of them harder to understand</span>. This complicates efforts to understand motivations and to influence perceptions for deterrence purposes. These differences<span class="BoldUnderline">, in turn, </span>increase the likelihood of misperceptio<span class="BoldUnderline">n, undercutting strategies to protect access to space capabilities</span>. When one’s attention is divided, deterrent measures that are appropriate for one target may not be useful, or even counterproductive, for another. This requires tailored intelligence efforts, information operations, and transparency efforts in order to avoid or minimize disputes and prevent problems. Second, the broad array of adversaries exhibit widely varying risk-taking behaviors. Risk-taking behavior can strongly influence an adversary’s perception of a situation. Understanding this phenomenon can lead to better ways of influencing those perceptions. Unfortunately, potentialadversaries may not care that space systems offer tremendous value and capabilities to all nations,or care whether conflict in space could create space debris that could cost all nations access to the domain. A strategy to assure continuing access to space assets must therefore be sufficiently flexible to address both risk-averse and risk-taking adversaries. Indeed, potential adversaries may shift from risk-taking to risk-adverse over a relatively short period of time. China<span class="BoldUnderline"> may </span>fit in this category. Within a decade or two, it will have its own extensive space-based communications, navigation, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellite constellations, all of which will be integrated into its military operations. No doubt, China will embrace that evolution and become very reliant on space capabilities; this will shift it from an asymmetric competitor to one similar to the United States or Russia. Third, with the demise of the Soviet Union, some political commentators and critics described the United States as a ‘‘hyperpower’’ not just a ‘‘superpower.’’ 12 <span class="BoldUnderline">Though buffeted by recent events involving Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and the 2008 global financial meltdown, </span>U.S. military supremacy<span class="BoldUnderline"> continues.</span> But, <span class="BoldUnderline">that supremacy does </span>not make or guarantee a successful space strategy. Adversaries may believe they have a higher stake than the United S<span class="BoldUnderline">tates </span>in the outcome of a particular crisis or conflict. <span class="BoldUnderline">Alternatively, the United States stake in the crisis may not be commensurate with the possible cost of involvement by the United States military and the rest of its national security apparatus. The first alternative may encourage mischief by adversaries; the second discourages U.S. action. As a result, </span>adversaries may find threats of U.S. action in response to hostile acts affecting U.S. access to space systems to be non-credible. Fourth, <span class="BoldUnderline">while </span>the U<span class="BoldUnderline">nited </span>S<span class="BoldUnderline">tates </span>has<span class="BoldUnderline"> produced superlative space capabilities, it has </span>not produced enough systems ready to survive the new kinetic, exotic, jamming, and cyber threat environment<span class="BoldUnderline">.</span> The vulnerability exists because the spacecraft developed and deployed today are in many ways the same as those originally fielded during the Cold War. During that epic struggle, there was a tacit and then explicit understanding that each superpower would not attack and overwhelm the other’s space systems, except in the dire st of circumstances, perhaps during the throes of a nuclear conflagration. Indeed, a number of agreements between the superpowers adopted the understanding and ruled out interference with national technical means, including space assets. <span class="BoldUnderline">This </span>belief in the superiority of space systems and power blinds the U<span class="BoldUnderline">nited </span>S<span class="BoldUnderline">tates </span>to the inherent strategic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in these systems. <span class="BoldUnderline">This,</span> predictably, <span class="BoldUnderline">can </span>now be exploited by potential adversaries, such as China, who<span class="BoldUnderline">, with their recent ASAT test, appear more </span>willing to fully explore the technologies needed to expand the limits of conventional war to include the space domain. Consequently, by historically and diplomatically reducing the threat, engineering of some satellite threat detection, attack avoidance, and other defense subsystems have not matured enough so that they are sophisticated, nimble, and robust enough to counter new 21st Century adversary attack capabilities.<br />

The strategy to deter nuclear attack worked throughout the Cold War; the Soviet Union was powerful, but it was also a rational adversary. For this reason, the United States worked hard to understand the culture, goals, incentives, and ideals of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was also open to, and reciprocated, U.S. diplomatic engagement overtures. The United States has gained great advantage through development and integration of space capabilities. This has forced <span class="BoldUnderline">potential adversaries to evolve techniques to neutralize this superiority</span>. Attacks on U.S. space systems can be performed through terrorist proxies, third parties, or covert acts<span class="BoldUnderline"> that offer perpetrators plausible deniability for damage inflicted.</span> The U<span style="text-decoration: none;">nited</span>S<span style="text-decoration: none;">tates</span><span class="BoldUnderline"> now </span>confronts<span class="BoldUnderline"> a diverse set </span>of adversaries, and their rogue leaders are arguably much more risk prone, <span class="BoldUnderline">or perhaps, just oxymoronic, acting deliberately </span>reckle<span class="BoldUnderline">ss. These adversaries know full well the importance of space capabilities to U.S. diplomatic, military, and economic success. They see that </span>attacking and disrupting space capabilities presents a significant opportunity to deny U.S. national objectives, to retain or expand their own relative power<span class="BoldUnderline">, and to compensate for their own lack of conventional strength</span>. Deterrence has failedthroughout history ‘‘because the object of deterring measures fails to notice them, does not find the measures credible, or is pursuing an agenda <span class="BoldUnderline">sufficiently </span>important enough to its interests that it is prepared to ignore the deterrence attempt.’’30 Given this, <span class="BoldUnderline">the United States cannot depend solely on deterrence to secure itself.

<br />
Given the great extent to which the United States depends on space systems for its national security and economic prosperity, U.S. policymakers and military leaders are becoming increasingly concerned that future adversaries might attack those systems. U.S. military forces operate in distant theaters and employ ever more sophisticated equipment and doctrines that rely on advanced surveillance, reconnaissance, communication, navigation, and timing data, most of which is produced or relayed by satellites. The ground infrastructure that supports these assets has long been vulnerable to attack, and a growing number of states now possess or are developing means of attacking satellites and the communication links that connect them to users and control stations. <span class="BoldUnderline">Due </span>to the dramatic warfighting advantage that space support provides to U.S. forces<span class="BoldUnderline">, security analysts are nearly unanimous in their judgment that </span>future enemies will likely attempt to “level the playing field” by attacking U.S. space systems<span class="BoldUnderline"> in efforts to degrade or eliminate that support. All of this suggests that </span>first-strike stability in space may be eroding<span class="BoldUnderline">.</span> First-strike stability is a concept that Glenn Kent and David Thaler developed in 1989 to examine the structural dynamics of mutual deterrence between two or more nuclear states.1 It is similar to crisis stability, which Charles Glaser described as “a measure of the countries’ incentives not to preempt in a crisis, that is, not to attack first in order to beat the attack of the enemy,” 2 except that it does not delve into the psychological factors present in specific crises. Rather, firststrike stability focuses on each side’s force posture and the balance of capabilities and vulnerabilities that could make a crisis unstable should a confrontation occur.3 Space stability issues differ from the Kent-Thaler conception of first-strike stability in that nuclear forces are not directly involved, so the risk of prompt catastrophic damage in the event of a deterrence failure is not nearly as great. However, several other strong parallels exist between first-strike stability in space and in the nuclear realm. First, <span class="BoldUnderline">space support substantially enhances operational warfighting capabilities in the terrestrial domain that are threatening to potential enemies.</span> At the same time, satellites are difficult to defend against adversaries with capabilities to attack them. As a result<span class="BoldUnderline">, </span>space, like the nuclear realm, is an <span class="BoldUnderline">offense-dominant</span> environment with substantial incentives for striking first <span class="BoldUnderline">should war appear probable</span>. Second, deterrence failures in space, though not as immediately catastrophic as nuclear deterrence failures, could, nonetheless, be very costly given the resources invested in orbital infrastructure and the many security and economic functions that benefit from space support. And, like nuclear deterrence failures, the costs of warfare in space would likely be shared by third parties due to global economic interdependence and multinational ownership of many space systems—all the more so if kinetic attacks on satellites litter important orbits with debris. Finally, there is a parallel between nuclear and space deterrence <span class="BoldUnderline">in that significant thresholds are perceived </span>in both realms, <span class="BoldUnderline">the crossing of which </span>couldlead to reprisals, follow-on attacks,and rapid escalation.4<br />

<strong>Chinese doctrine, spending, and actions all portend an attack on US space assets - it will likely escalate</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Wortzel, 8</span></strong> – [Colonel, United States Army (Retired) (Larry, Astropolitics, 6:112–137, “THE CHINESE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY AND SPACE WARFARE,” Ebsco Political Science]<br />
<br />
The PLA is exploring<span class="BoldUnderline"> in theoretical research, basic </span>research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons<span class="BoldUnderline">.77 </span>These include:<br />
. satellite jamming <span class="BoldUnderline">technology;</span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">. collisions between space bodies;</span><br />
. kinetic energy weapons;<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">. space-to-ground attack weapons;</span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">. space planes</span> that can transit and fight ‘‘up or down’’ in the upper atmosphere or space;<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">. high-power </span>laser <span class="BoldUnderline">weapons;</span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">. high-power </span>microwave<span class="BoldUnderline"> weapon systems</span>;<br />
. particle-beam<span class="BoldUnderline"> weapons; and</span><br />
. electromagnetic pulse<span class="BoldUnderline">.78</span><br />
PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. <span class="BoldUnderline">The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies.</span> The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not<span class="BoldUnderline">, it </span>is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare<span class="BoldUnderline">. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the </span>blinding of a U.S. satellite mean<span class="BoldUnderline"> they are </span>achieving<span class="BoldUnderline"> some </span>success.PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 The Chinese<span class="BoldUnderline"> see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they </span>would<span class="BoldUnderline"> probably </span>use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, <span class="BoldUnderline">and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.</span>S.81 One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. As the PLA modernizes its own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4SIR) systems, <span class="BoldUnderline">it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, </span>the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict. The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons<span class="BoldUnderline"> or a deeper crisis. </span>For example, <span class="BoldUnderline">four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College,</span> in Wuhan, <span class="BoldUnderline">have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S</span>.82 In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85 In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88 <span class="BoldUnderline">The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems. One possible reaction by </span>the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike <span class="BoldUnderline">against China’s strategic missile forces</span>. Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research. Space Deterrence Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual</span> AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems. In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability. Conclusions There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First, in the event of conflict<span class="BoldUnderline"> with the PLA, </span>military operations carried out across all the domains of wa<span class="BoldUnderline">r, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, </span>are likely. <span class="BoldUnderline">Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems</span>. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA. U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions<span class="BoldUnderline">. There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims;97 the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space</span> outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory. The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance<span class="BoldUnderline">. No</span> such <span class="BoldUnderline">dialogue has taken place with China</span>. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue<span class="BoldUnderline">. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality</span>.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures. Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like <span class="BoldUnderline">the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability</span>. PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature. By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature<span class="BoldUnderline">, </span>it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.<span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>. To this end, <span class="BoldUnderline">the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. As a result, </span>there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space,<span class="BoldUnderline"> to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict.</span><br />

<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">One characteristic of too many wars </span>in the last century is <span class="BoldUnderline">that they </span>arethe result of miscalculation<span class="BoldUnderline"> that ignites the tinder of fundamental geopolitical tensions. Averting major power conflict requires skillful management of tensions by senior leaders of the major powers</span>. China has become much more internationally sophisticated, though with important exceptions, in its dealings with the rest of the world than has been true in the past, and this is reflected in its civilian leadership. Unfortunately, <span class="BoldUnderline">the PLA's senior officer corps </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">trails its civilian counterparts in this respect. They </span><span class="BoldUnderline">have much less interaction with foreign official and travel abroad much less frequently than their U.S. counterparts. </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">This means that </span><span class="BoldUnderline">the PLA overall views world events from a less knowledgeable and sophisticated perspective, a danger in this increasingly complex world, and could explain</span>, for example, the political &quot;tonedeafness&quot; of the PLA in the manner they conducted <span class="BoldUnderline">their 2007 ASAT test.This PLA problem becomes more serious when one realizes that </span>the PLA is organizationally separate from the rest of the Chinese government<span class="BoldUnderline">, and reports only to the Central Military Commission,</span> currently chaired by President Hu Jintao. President Hu, and his likely successors, have no significant military background, and <span class="BoldUnderline">the majority of the CMC's members are top PLA officers, suggesting that </span>civilian oversight of major military decisions and consideration of their larger implications are not as carefully reviewed as in the U.S. governmen<span class="BoldUnderline">t</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">. Normally this would not be too great a concern,</span> but in a crisis this could be dangerous<span class="BoldUnderline">. Add to this the fact that </span>China has no equivalent of our N<span class="BoldUnderline">ationa</span>l S<span class="BoldUnderline">ecurity</span> Council,<span class="BoldUnderline"> a critically important body for coordinating our security decisionmaking, and one comes away concerned about the relative insularity of the PLA in the Chinese power structure</span>. In a crisis, the PLA<span class="BoldUnderline"> probably </span>cannot be counted on to show<span class="BoldUnderline"> as </span>sophisticated<span class="BoldUnderline"> a sense of </span>judgment<span class="BoldUnderline"> as one would hope any country's military leaders, even an enemy's, to show. All these</span> problems<span class="BoldUnderline"> and many more </span>pose <span class="BoldUnderline">potential </span>threats to internal political stability<span class="BoldUnderline"> andCommunist Party control, providing ample opportunity for crisis and conflict in the years ahead</span>. Overview of The Strategic Landscape of Space Space assets, and the communications and cyber links that enable them to function, are the means by which<span class="BoldUnderline"> essential national</span> security information is<span class="BoldUnderline"> either </span>generated<span class="BoldUnderline">, transmitted, or both. </span>This<span class="BoldUnderline"> information </span>is the lifeblood of<span class="BoldUnderline"> U.S. conventional </span>military superiority<span class="BoldUnderline"> and plays a key role in U.S. strategic nuclear posture as well</span>. As such, <span class="BoldUnderline">these space related assets represent extraordinarily appealing targets in any future conflict, and </span>their<span class="BoldUnderline"> relative </span>vulnerability can provide<span class="BoldUnderline"> dangerously attractive </span>incentives<span class="BoldUnderline"> in a crisis </span>to preempt, escalating to war. Resisting this temptation to attack may be morally virtuous but could be strategically unwise:going first<span class="BoldUnderline"> in a space conflict with a nearpeer space adversary </span>appears to offer <span class="BoldUnderline">many </span>advantages<span class="BoldUnderline">, while absorbing such a strike, with all its attendant destruction of military capabilities, and then responding to the attack against an opponent fully expecting such a response, appears to be militarily and strategically quite undesirable.</span>As technology advances, the ways of interfering with, disrupting, or destroying information streams in space or supporting space systems will likely increase<span class="BoldUnderline">, as will U.S. and others' dependence upon such systems.</span> Providing defensive options for U.S. space assets should be pursued where appropriate, but most space observers believe that offense has the advantage in space over defense, as General Cartwright observed last May. Cartwright also noted that the challenging issues that space poses has made the Space Posture Review &quot;the most difficult of all the defense reviews&quot; the Obama Administration has undertaken. The overall U.S. goal in space should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States and its allies, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. and allied security. The United States has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that <span class="BoldUnderline">the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies</span>. This need not mean that China and others must perforce be disadvantaged by such an arrangement - there should be ample opportunity for many countries to benefit and prosper from a properly crafted system of space management. There is an inherent risk of strategic instability when relatively modest defense efforts create disproportionate danger to an adversary, as with space offense. And there is a serious risk of crisis instability in space <span class="BoldUnderline">when &quot;going first&quot; pays off - destroying an adversary's satellites before he destroys yours. We don't know what would happen in a crisis, but </span>the potential for space instability seems high and likely to grow.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, facilities or services; </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><strong>.</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on the US homeland or an attack </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.44Although a major attack on the US is not likely, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculationthat the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence</span><span class="BoldUnderline">. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, </span>the Chinese<span class="BoldUnderline"> might seek to disrupt or </span>destroy<span class="BoldUnderline"> regional </span>space capabilities<span class="BoldUnderline"> as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a fait accompli</span>.45 A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49 The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “<span class="BoldUnderline">Space capabilities</span> are no longer nice to have, but <span class="BoldUnderline">are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars</span>.”51 <span class="BoldUnderline">The</span> failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets.The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52 Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives. The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, <span class="BoldUnderline">successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets</span> in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. <span class="BoldUnderline">A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces</span>. Satellite communication<span class="BoldUnderline"> links to worldwide deployed forces</span> are critical <span class="BoldUnderline">capabilities</span> in protecting <span class="BoldUnderline">US </span>security,<span class="BoldUnderline"> sovereignty, and military combat capability. </span>The inability to detect <span class="BoldUnderline">and assess </span>space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems<span class="BoldUnderline"> or conduct probing attacks on US space systems</span> without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55Today, <span class="BoldUnderline">other </span>nations are working to <span class="BoldUnderline">developnew weapons to </span>counter<span class="BoldUnderline"> US </span>dominance and <span class="BoldUnderline">to </span>take the lead<span class="BoldUnderline"> in</span> what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—<span class="BoldUnderline">informationwar</span>. The current <span class="BoldUnderline">coverage gaps in our space surveillance network</span>, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset <span class="BoldUnderline">makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons </span>without our knowledge. Finally, <span class="BoldUnderline">without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy</span> to counter an attack against US space assets. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is <span class="BoldUnderline">to deter an attack on US space assets</span>. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. <span class="BoldUnderline">A senior officer in US Strat</span>egic <span class="BoldUnderline">Com</span>mand recently <span class="BoldUnderline">stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution</span>.57<br />

Currently, the configuration of global space technologies and assets is highly desirable from a US perspective.67<span class="BoldUnderline"> The US has begun to rely heavily on space assets for a myriad of capabilities in recent years. Some have voiced worries that the United States will lose its lead as the global innovator in technology or that an enemy could make technological leaps that would give it significant advantages.68 </span>That is possible, but by no means a foregone conclusion.69 However one thing is clear, “technology will proliferate<span class="BoldUnderline">.</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">”70 </span>Space technology has become increasingly available to any countr<span class="BoldUnderline">y</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> or multinational corporation with the ability to fund the research or acquire the technology and place it in orbit</span>.71 <span class="BoldUnderline">The increasing proliferation of launch and satellite capabilities, as well as the development of anti-satellite capabilities has begun to level the playing field.72 Adversary technological advances in kinetic-energy weapons causing structural damage by impacting the target with one or more high-speed masses, directed-energy weapons that are either ground- or air-based systems never getting close to their target, and nuclear weapons that detonate at an empty point in space could put our space assets at risk in the near future.</span>73 <span class="BoldUnderline">Kinetic-energy weapons such as China‘s 11 January 2007 successful test of a direct-ascent,</span> kinetic-kill anti-satellite (<span class="BoldUnderline">ASAT) vehicle destroying an</span> inactive Chinese weather satellite generating thousands of pieces of space debris that threatened many operational <span class="BoldUnderline">spacecraft is of growing concern</span>.74 <span class="BoldUnderline">Another kinetic energy weapon that is of concern is microsatellites (microsats). Currently, </span>at least 40 countries have demonstrated some ability to design, build, launch, and operate microsats<span class="BoldUnderline">.</span>75 Microsats can maneuver<span class="BoldUnderline"> in such a way </span>to<span class="BoldUnderline"> observe and </span>disrupt operations<span class="BoldUnderline"> of orbiting assets. These microsats may soon be capable of harassing or destroying larger satellites at virtually any altitude.7</span>6 <span class="BoldUnderline">Because these satellites are so small, </span>they may not be easily detectable<span class="BoldUnderline"> as part of a payload or when maneuvering in space. Directed-energy weapons are laser, radio frequency, and particle beam weapon</span>s. Lasers operate by delivering energy onto the surface of the target and gradual or rapid absorption of this energy leads to several forms of thermal damage.77 Radio frequency (RF) weapons such as the high-power microwave (HPM) have either ground-and space-based RF emitters that fire an intense burst of radio energy at a satellite, disabling electronic components.78 <span class="BoldUnderline">Nuclear weapons are perhaps the technology of most concern to US space assets. </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">Some argue though that adversaries would desist from using nuclear weapons in space out of fear of retaliation</span>.79 While others say “<span class="BoldUnderline">what better way to use nuclear weapons than to destroy a key military capability of an enemy country without killing any of its population</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">.”80 Regardless of the arguments,</span><span class="BoldUnderline"> one thing is clear; a nuclear detonation would have three huge environmental effects in space: electromagnetic pulse (EMP), transient nuclear radiation, and thermal radiation</span>.81 EMP from a nuclear detonation will induce potentially damaging voltages and currents in unprotected electronic circuits and components virtually rendering space assets inoperative.82 Increased radiation from such <span class="BoldUnderline">a detonation</span> would also have profound effects on the space environment. This <span class="BoldUnderline">would severely damage nearby orbiting satellites reducing the lifetime of satellites in LEO from years to months or less and make satellite operations futile for many months</span>.83 <span class="BoldUnderline">The risk of this potential threat is significant</span>. To execute this mission, <span class="BoldUnderline">all that is needed is a rocket and a simple nuclear devic</span>e.84 <span class="BoldUnderline">Countries such as Iran, North Korea, Iraq, and Pakistan possess such missiles that could carry warheads to the necessary altitudes to perform such missions</span>.85 Technological advances in adversary weaponry are certainly hard to predict even in the near term. However, if this weaponry matures enough and is successfully used it will create additional space debris from the orbiting satellites being rendered inoperative (space junk) and becoming potential hazards to other satellites.<br />

The dominant military powers in the world, some of whom are potential adversaries, also tend to be the dominant spacefaring states. <span class="BoldUnderline">Because of the economic benefits and exponential enhancements that spacepower delivers to terrestrial warfighting, those </span>states are under increasing pressure to defend their space systems and to counter those of their p<span class="BoldUnderline">otential </span>adversaries. This may lead to a space weapons race and an immediate escalation of hostilities to &quot;wipe the skies&quot; of enemy satellites <span class="BoldUnderline">should war break out between two or more dominant military space powers</span>.29 When assessing the interplay between the spectrum of conflict and the spectrum of belligerents, it may be the case that war between two weak actors will not likely extend into space. However, if the power is perceived to be disparate, a weak actor is far more likely to use space weapons against a powerful state as an asymmetric defensive mov<span class="BoldUnderline">e</span>.30 A powerful state may counter the space systems in use by a weaker adversary, but it is likely to do so by placing diplomatic pressure on commercial vendors, or executing attacks on their ground stations, or launching highly selective covert attacks on the satellites they use by employing temporary and reversible means. Should two<span class="BoldUnderline"> dominant </span>spacefaring powers go directly to war<span class="BoldUnderline"> with each other with intense motives, </span>both will find it critical to preserve their space system<span class="BoldUnderline">s and will consider it a dangerous liability to allow their enemy to exploit theirs. Given the ability of spacepower to cut the fog and friction of war while connecting military forces at the tactical, operational, and strategic level, it is likely that </span>space systems will be primary targets<span class="BoldUnderline"> that will be negated in the opening moves of war.</span> The fight for space is likely to be intense and brief. Temporary means of negation will likely switch to permanent methods of destruction to remove doubt in the minds of commanders.<br />

<strong>Loss of space assets will annihilate US hegemony</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Marshall 8</span></strong> –[ NASA Ames Research Center (Will, Astropolitics, 6:154–199, “REDUCING THE VULNERABILITY OF SPACE ASSETS: A<br />
MULTITIERED MICROSATELLITE CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE,” Ebsco Political Science]<br />
<br />
Space assets are one of the most critical ‘‘Achilles’ heels’’ of the current military capability of the United States (U.S.). This is for two reasons: (<span class="BoldUnderline">1) the </span>U.S. military space systems<span class="BoldUnderline">—in particular reconnaissance, navigation, </span>signals intelligence, early warning, and communications systems—are critical to modern military warfare and intelligen<span class="BoldUnderline">ce; and (2) </span>space systems are inherently vulnerable to attack<span class="BoldUnderline">. This combination is understood at the highest levels and was espoused in the ‘‘Rumsfeld Space Commission’’ with talk of a ‘‘Space Pearl Harbor.’</span>’1 Whether one agrees with the tone<span class="BoldUnderline">, this is a genuine security problem for the U.S. in need of a near-term solution</span>. While there have been numerous papers, and much media and academic attention, in the space security discussion focused on promoting or criticizing space-based weapons,2 there have been far fewer papers and studies offering constructive ways forward that deal with these genuine security concerns in a broader sense.3 The central motivation for this paper is to put forward one key element—the satellite architecture—in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. space assets. It is hoped that this idea, together with others like it, should stimulate and contribute to a debate on more constructive ways forward for how to achieve space security in the post-Cold war world. Importance of Space Assets For better or worse, <span class="BoldUnderline">it is clear that the </span>U.S.<span class="BoldUnderline"> military is to some significant extent dependent on its key satellites, </span>which number about 86–105 operational satellites at present. <span class="BoldUnderline">These </span>satellites constitute a significant part of the eyes, ears, and central nervous system of the modern military<span class="BoldUnderline">.4 A practical example that helps to illustrate this is </span>the case of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq<span class="BoldUnderline"> in 2003. First, </span>the decision to go was based in part on satellite imagery and<span class="BoldUnderline"> signals </span>intelligence<span class="BoldUnderline"> from satellites; whether or not it was interpreted or used correctly is a separate issue. Second, the planning and operation were facilitated by satellite imagery. Third, </span>many planes, ships, tanks, and units’ positions were known through<span class="BoldUnderline"> Global Positioning System (</span>GPS) satellites<span class="BoldUnderline">, and even most munitions were guided by GPS. Fourth, the operation was commanded from the U.S. in large part through the use of communications satellites</span>. Perhaps more importantly than any of the functions in the Iraq example, early warning (EW) satellites are the U.S.’s and Russia’s first warning of nuclear missile attack<span class="BoldUnderline">.</span> As Gray classified, <span class="BoldUnderline">space assets have moved from being ‘‘useful and </span>important’’ to an ‘‘indispensable adjunct’’ in the military <span class="BoldUnderline">over the last decade</span>.5 Space assets are definitely used a great deal by the U.S. military, but that does not mean necessarily as strong a dependence as Gray implies. The loss of U.S. space assets could range in its effect anywhere from a loss to the U.S. military in practical operations, to be<span class="BoldUnderline">ing </span>catastrophic to U.S. security<span class="BoldUnderline">. The former would entail a reduction in operational effectiveness or speed, but fundamentally supposes that back-up systems and/or redundancy allow a near continuation of military capability. </span>The<span class="BoldUnderline"> latter </span>scenario would entail an effective disablement of the U.S. military capability<span class="BoldUnderline"> from normal operations. </span>In reality, the significance lies between these boundaries, but this is a topic that could benefit from further research.<br />

Paul Kennedy was probably right: the US will go the way of all great powers — down. The individual dramas of the past decade — the September 2001 terrorist attacks, prolonged wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis — have delivered the world a message: US primacy is in decline. This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline, but it encompasses a trend that appears to be negative and perhaps alarming. Although the US still possesses incomparable military prowess and its economy remains the world’s largest, the once seemingly indomitable chasm that separated America from anyone else is narrowing. Thus, the global distribution of power is shifting, and the inevitable result will be a world that is less peaceful, liberal and prosperous, burdened by a dearth of effective conflict regulation. <span class="BoldUnderline">Over the past two decades, </span>no other state has had the ability to<span class="BoldUnderline"> seriously </span>challenge the US<span class="BoldUnderline"> military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, </span>many actors<span class="BoldUnderline"> have </span>bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role<span class="BoldUnderline">. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a </span>status quo<span class="BoldUnderline"> that </span>has tended to mute great power conflicts.<span class="BoldUnderline"> However, </span>as the hegemony<span class="BoldUnderline"> that drew these powers together </span>withers<span class="BoldUnderline">, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. </span>The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse<span class="BoldUnderline">, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and </span>conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid<span class="BoldUnderline">. As history attests, </span>power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation<span class="BoldUnderline">. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves</span>.’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law. <span class="BoldUnderline">Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that </span>America’s authority<span class="BoldUnderline">, although sullied at times, has </span>benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe<span class="BoldUnderline">, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that </span>a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of<span class="BoldUnderline"> the 1930s: </span>regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry<span class="BoldUnderline">. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For example</span>, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have hist<span style="color: black;">orically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive</span><span class="BoldUnderline">. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973). A world </span>without American<span class="BoldUnderline"> hegemony is one where </span>great power wars re-emerge, the liberal<span class="BoldUnderline"> international </span>system is supplanted by an authoritarian one<span class="BoldUnderline">, and </span>trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers<span class="BoldUnderline">. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy. </span><br />

<strong>Commitment to ORS is vital to deterrence by denial – it will prevent attacks against US space assets</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sejba 10</span></strong> – [USAF Congressional Budget Liaison Officer Budget and Appropriations Liaison Directorate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget Secretary of the Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC (Timothy, “ Deterrence for Space: Is Operationally Responsive Space Part of the Solution?”, High Frontier, May, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:5383:http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:5383 -->]<br />
<br />
The space domain, often referred to as “The High Frontier,” no longer is a sanctuary outside the reach of foreign intervention. <span class="BoldUnderline">The threat to space systems and their capabilities is broad, ranging from reversible effects such as jamming or blinding, to more destructive means such as anti-satellite weapons.It is now time to take actions for the sake of space, and assure its continued contributions across the full spectrum of military operations. Given the criticality of space to not only our military power, but also our economic power, it is time we develop policies and field capabilities to deter future adversaries from attempting to degrade, deny, or destroy space capabilities and services.</span> The asymmetric advantages enabled by space can no longer be assumed and as a result, <span class="BoldUnderline">a new National Security Strategy for space must be forged, one that combines deterrence with basic protection capabilities never before afforded our space systems. Yet, space deterrence is not an “all in” strategy, nor can it reduce the risk of attack to zero.1 Should aspects of deterrence fail, </span>we must take steps to defend and protect our space systems<span class="BoldUnderline"> and the critical global services they provide</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Operationally responsive space (</span>ORS<span class="BoldUnderline">) by definition is “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of joint force commanders’ needs.</span>”2 Dissected further, one key word stands out: assured … being sufficiently robust, timely, agile, adaptive, and resilient, to achieve desired outcomes with a high degree of certainty.3 So while <span style="text-decoration: none;">ORS</span> intends to provide operational and tactical support to the joint warfighter<span class="BoldUnderline">, its true value will be the assurance it </span>provides as a credible strategic deterrent against space attacks. <span class="BoldUnderline">As a deterrent, </span>ORS provides<span class="BoldUnderline"> access to existing capabilities, or </span>rapid deployment and employment of new capabilities,denying the benefits our adversaries may seek by attacking our space capabilities<span class="BoldUnderline">. Through timely and accurate intelligence, </span>we can work to understand our adversaries’ intent<span class="BoldUnderline"> and armed with this knowledge, we gain the opportunity to influence their decision-making calculus. Understanding intent, coupled with credible and timely </span>ORS capabilities, can effectively deny or greatly reduce the benefits they seek by attacking the asymmetric advantages enabled by space. ORS provides a responsiveness that will allow the commander,<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> US Strategic Command (CDR USSTRATCOM), to respond and support our combatant commands real-time and near-term requirements. To support these requirements, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">In fact, a deterrence strategy that includes </span>the threat of punishment<span class="BoldUnderline"> (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 </span><span class="BoldUnderline">While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy is</span> notdirectly applicable to space.<span class="BoldUnderline">6 Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 </span>These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain<span class="BoldUnderline">. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space. Instead, </span>deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits <span class="BoldUnderline">they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (against their most prized assets);9 </span><span class="BoldUnderline">and encourage their restraint.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> A New Focus of Deterrence What does deterrence look like in the 21st century? The US has not yet figured that out, said Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear. ~ Sandra I. Erwin, Future of War—How the Game is Changing … Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.… ~ US National Security Strategy, 2006 In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command. The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making.”10 </span><span class="BoldUnderline">In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. </span>Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations<span class="BoldUnderline"> even in a contested environment. Deny the Benefits—ORS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Examples People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) view of space:</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> Space shifting from enabler to key battleground. Space characterized as important because it contributes to information dominance; space now described as important in its own right….many in the PLA see space as a likely future arena for conflict. ~ Space and PRC National Security,’ Dean Cheng, China specialist, The Heritage Foundation, 8 October 2008.12 The purpose to benefit denial is to convince an adversary that their intent will not be achieved, or have little to no value. </span>Today, our ability to field ORS<span class="BoldUnderline"> capabilities </span>is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent. <span class="BoldUnderline">Instead</span>, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities<span style="font-size: 11pt;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why </span>we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency.<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack.”14 The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by </span><span class="BoldUnderline">General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> Moving forward, to be a true deterrent, </span>ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them.<span class="BoldUnderline"> Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). </span>Tier 1 and Two<span class="BoldUnderline"> ORS capabilities </span>can be deployed<span class="BoldUnderline"> and employed </span>rapidly, within hours <span class="BoldUnderline">to days. The cost for Tier 1 includes implementing new concept of operations for deployed on-orbit systems, or the rapid, low cost launch and deployment of systems intended to augment existing systems for Tier 2.</span><br />

<strong>Small satellites and reconstitution gives the US the ability to prevail in a space conflict</strong><br />

<br />
RESPONSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE <span class="BoldUnderline">A robust and </span>responsive space<span class="BoldUnderline"> infrastructure enables a spacefaring nation to present agile responses to man-made threats, debris, and changes in the space environment.</span> A responsive space infrastructure <span class="BoldUnderline">augments the other pillars of space assurance and provides a needed back-up in event of their failure</span>. According to Lawrence Cooper: Responsive <span class="BoldUnderline">space </span>is the ability to put a satellite<span class="BoldUnderline"> payload </span>into orbit<span class="BoldUnderline"> shortly </span>after making the decision to launch. It includes the ability to replace failed satellites quickly<span class="BoldUnderline">, to re-attempt a launch after an aborted try, and </span>to respond to operational requirements<span class="BoldUnderline"> to satisfy national security interests</span>. Responsive space <span class="BoldUnderline">provides the means for assured access to spac</span>e. An objective goal for responsive space could be operating the satellite in hours to days from the decision to launch vice the current paradigm of months to years. Responsive space <span class="BoldUnderline">creates the possibility of adding an additional dimension to the United States’ space power by increasing the robustness of military and commercial satellite systems</span>. By pursuing a strategy of responsive space, space systems become less vulnerable<span class="BoldUnderline">, not from harder systems or active countermeasures, but through ubiquity.</span> Such a strategy pushes satellites to become less expensive and lighter; launch services more versatile and responsive; and satellite operations become faster and more flexible. If industry makes it simpler and quicker to place satellites in orbit<span class="BoldUnderline">, the satellites also become less vulnerable because any damage or shortfalls can be replaced on short notice; and operations become more flexible because supplementary capability is always available</span>.77 Much of the early emphasis for responsive space was on implementing transformational process changes in the way space systems are acquired and operated. While the term ‘‘transformational’’ no longer holds the e´lan it once held in the early 2000s, when the then Office of Force Transformation championed funding and concept development for responsive space, proponents place great value on how these proposed systems have the potential to provide tremendous flexibility and options to decision makers and commanders. This responsiveness theme has understandably been picked up in the DOD Plan for Operationally Responsive Space (ORS). Its formulation focuses on assuring availability of timely and needed space capabilities for joint force commanders, delivering these warfighting needs through a three-tier construct—from hours-to-days, weeks-to-months, and then to no more than one year. <span class="BoldUnderline">The DOD approach also acknowledges needs to reconstitute, augment, or surge space capabilities in event of conflict. However, as structured, </span>the current ORS program stops short of pushing credible long-term acquisition approaches needed for a space strategy. As stated in Joint Publication 3–14, Space Operations, ‘‘Strategic or long-term needs are not a primary focus of ORS.’’78 The rationale also suffers because its construct is based, in part, on false premises. First, the descriptive term ‘‘responsive space’’ implies that the space community has not been responsive to warfighter needs. This has not been the case, and senior U.S. military space leaders have argued indignantly against this conclusion in various conferences and forums. They contend that the space community has been responsive in satisfying warfighter needs, as the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and elsewhere have borne out. Second, the rationale implies warfighters need the space community to develop and sustain the capability to deliver new, just-in-time technologies, or solutions to satisfy battlefield and battlespace needs. The practical business and budgeting realities of indulging the second purported need have not been comprehensively explored. No doubt, military and national space systems are needed to survive a space ‘‘Pearl Harbor,’’ to reconstitute those systems to ensure they are available to support the warfighter. ‘‘<span class="BoldUnderline">Reconstitution refers to plans and operations for replenishing lost or diminished space capabilities. This includes repositioning, reconfiguring unaffected and surviving assets, augmenting capabilities with civil and commercial capabilities, and replacing lost assets.</span>’’79 <span class="BoldUnderline">If </span>such capabilities<span class="BoldUnderline"> can be developed, they </span>would allow the U<span class="BoldUnderline">nited </span>S<span class="BoldUnderline">tates </span>to<span class="BoldUnderline"> respond to an adversary attack by </span>rapidly replacing or reconfiguring systems destroyed or degraded<span class="BoldUnderline"> by enemy action. This would also ensure that during periods of increased tension or conflict, the United States would be able to launch and deploy new or replacement space assets and capabilities, and also augment the systems already on orb</span>it. Instead of using a pure reconstitution approach, <span class="BoldUnderline">the United States could choose instead to change its satellite designs to small single-purpose vehicles deployed in large distributed constellations to obtain continuous Earth coverage. This would effect a profound acquisition strategy change for the DOD and its civil counterparts</span>, as heretofore they have focused on acquiring much larger flagship-class satellites, each dubbed a ‘‘Battlestar Galactica.’’ The DOD has experimented with small satellites, but usually only to demonstrate new technologies. As noted in this paper’s discussion of space protection and defenses, large constellation architectures can offer a good measure of redundancy<span class="BoldUnderline">. This, in turn, </span>could deny an adversary an opportunity to target only a few critical on-orbit satellites.<span class="BoldUnderline"> Creating and sustaining large constellations will require responsive and more affordable launch capabilities, technology, infrastructure, and organizatio</span>ns. The operations must be fully integrated to ensure system survivability. <span class="BoldUnderline">Responsive spacelift must include launch capabilities with improved mobility attributes, and must also be able to provide the proliferation needed to reduce adversary opportunities to target systems, while they are in a launch preparation phase</span>. Finally, to assure continued access, satellite operations must be conducted to sustain on-orbit capabilities, and, as needed, activate on-orbit spares.<br />

<span class="BoldUnderline">The U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities</span>. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. <span class="BoldUnderline">The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities</span>. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that <span class="BoldUnderline">efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities.</span> ,,39 Further, the<span class="BoldUnderline"> DoD's </span>Plan for O<span class="BoldUnderline">perationally </span>R<span class="BoldUnderline">esponsive </span>S<span class="BoldUnderline">pace </span>highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness<span class="BoldUnderline"> and adaptability to the threat</span>, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42 The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43 The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44 While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , <span class="BoldUnderline">ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements</span>. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. Field-ready systems would provide a credible<span class="BoldUnderline"> defensive </span>deterrent against<span class="BoldUnderline"> existing and likely </span>Chinese offensive<span class="BoldUnderline"> anti-satellite </span>actions. PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement. Space Situational Awareness Improving SSA is essential to<span class="BoldUnderline"> the </span>success o<span class="BoldUnderline">f this strategy. The U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Although the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network</span> (SSN) network, <span class="BoldUnderline">it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space</span>;<span class="BoldUnderline"> the</span> February 10, 2009 <span class="BoldUnderline">collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise</span>.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. <span class="BoldUnderline">Improved SSA also allows the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites</span>. Intelligence Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States. Preplanned Satellite Actions Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting<span class="BoldUnderline"> to an anti-satellite attack. </span>While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These <span class="BoldUnderline">orbital </span>maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the<span class="BoldUnderline"> anti-satellite </span>weapon. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target. Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. If a conflict looks<span class="BoldUnderline"> to be </span>inevitable, they could<span class="BoldUnderline"> decide to rapidly </span>execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations. <span class="BoldUnderline">While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. </span>If<span class="BoldUnderline"> the </span>conflict escalates<span class="BoldUnderline"> into a conventional war, </span>the<span class="BoldUnderline"> single </span>maneuver may buy<span class="BoldUnderline"> the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates enough time to execute a kinetic strike<span class="BoldUnderline"> that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program.</span> The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets. Variable and Rapid Launch Capability The current<span class="BoldUnderline"> United States Department of Defense </span>launch complex does not have the capability to<span class="BoldUnderline"> rapidly </span>replenish satellites<span class="BoldUnderline"> in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies</span>. Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48 Small Satellites TheU<span class="BoldUnderline">nited </span>S<span class="BoldUnderline">tates </span>must<span class="BoldUnderline"> also </span>make a move towards smaller satellites<span class="BoldUnderline"> that use a common bus and architecture</span>. A single launch vehicle could<span class="BoldUnderline"> then </span>deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the<span class="BoldUnderline"> rapid </span>establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict<span class="BoldUnderline"> or replenishment of an old one</span>. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 Having numerous small satellites<span class="BoldUnderline"> ready to launch </span>can<span class="BoldUnderline"> also </span>lesson<span class="BoldUnderline"> the need to perform defensive orbital </span>maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished. Finally, small satellites are<span class="BoldUnderline"> inherently </span>harder to track<span class="BoldUnderline"> whether by radar or optical telescopes</span>. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites. Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe. Decreased Dependence on Space Systems The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission. Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, defense<span class="BoldUnderline"> against the long term radiation effects </span>must focus on hardening<span class="BoldUnderline"> all future </span>satellites<span class="BoldUnderline"> against nuclear explosions. </span>Without hardening<span class="BoldUnderline">, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite </span>replenishment could take months<span class="BoldUnderline"> and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost</span>.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites. Institutional Changes Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user. Transparency The<span class="BoldUnderline"> above </span>actions may deter China from<span class="BoldUnderline"> further </span>pursuing<span class="BoldUnderline"> its </span>anti-satellite programs<span class="BoldUnderline">, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. </span>China must be made fully aware of US capabilities<span class="BoldUnderline"> to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities</span>. Engagement Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic· missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO. Additionally, <span class="BoldUnderline">the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, </span>Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program.53 <span class="BoldUnderline">Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals</span>. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, <span class="BoldUnderline">proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities</span>. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, <span class="BoldUnderline">these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that </span>can <span class="BoldUnderline">damage satellite systems</span>. “<span class="BoldUnderline">A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action</span>.”56 Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply. CONCLUSION The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57 Council on Foreign Relations <span class="BoldUnderline">The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons</span>. Failing to protect<span class="BoldUnderline"> these key </span>satellites would<span class="BoldUnderline"> severely </span>degradeUS military capabilities<span class="BoldUnderline"> in a conflict with China</span>. The U<span class="BoldUnderline">nited </span>S<span class="BoldUnderline">tates </span>should rely on a defensive<span class="BoldUnderline"> space </span>strategy to deter<span class="BoldUnderline"> Chinese anti-satellite actions. </span>The strategy must include<span class="BoldUnderline"> robust </span>s<span class="BoldUnderline">pace </span>s<span class="BoldUnderline">ituational </span>a<span class="BoldUnderline">wareness, </span>preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. <span class="BoldUnderline">The DoD's </span>ORS effort<span class="BoldUnderline"> can be used as springboard, but </span>must be accelerated<span class="BoldUnderline"> to meet the rapidly emerging threat</span>. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58<br />

<span style="color: black;">Responses</span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">Satellites can be defended against some kinds of direct kinetic attacks</span><span style="color: #231f20;">. They can be moved out of range of the attacker’s terminal engagement sensors, if there is enough warning and accurate track of the interceptor and enough understanding of the kill mechanism, and if the satellite has been designed to withstand the loads created by the movement. There may be ways to confuse or defeat the sensors used to detect and track the target satellite, either in initial acquisition or in terminal engagement. The target might also be protected by active defenses, although with intercept occurring only about ten minutes after launch, the defenses will probably need to be directed energy rather than kinetic weapons. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Either case would require precise situational awareness—exact information about the technology and operation of the attack—together with major advances in command and control for the defenses</span><span style="color: #231f20;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Even without enemy action, satellites in orbit might provide less space support than needed.

Some of this supplemental capability might be found already in orbit: the communications and intelligence satellites of commercial entities and allied governments.

At the same time, these systems might themselves suffer on-orbit misadventures, might potentially be targeted, and might prove useless in the face of unforeseen needs.

<br />
Space Deterrence and General Deterrence Although this assessment focuses specifically on deterrence and firststrike stability in space, it is important to appreciate the interdependencies between these factors and general deterrence and stability writ large. Given the extent to which space support enhances U.S. conventional military capabilities, an adversary weighing the risks and potential benefits of war with the United States might be encouraged toward aggression by the belief that attacking space systems would degrade U.S. warfighting capabilities enough to enable the attainment of objectives at acceptable costs. As a result, weaknesses in space deterrence can undermine general deterrence. Conversely, if a prospective adversary concludes that the probable cost-benefit outcome of attacking U.S. space systems is unacceptable, it is forced to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive designs in the terrestrial domain against the prospects of facing fully capable, space-enhanced U.S. military forces. In sum, effective space deterrence fortifies general deterrence and stability.<br />

<br />
The 11 January 2007<span class="BoldUnderline"> test of a Chinese</span> ground-based, direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) kinetic-kill interceptor against one of their own defunct weather satellites generated considerable angst across the United States space community. The 2007test demonstrated that the importance of space capabilities is also their Achilles heel, that is, their deadly weakness in spite of overall strength; it is far too easy to neutralize space systems and their power. In the broad strategic context, <span class="BoldUnderline">space capabilities have their own set of unique, inherent </span>vulnerabilities, which are largely the result of orbital mechanics. <span class="BoldUnderline">This </span>invites destruction, <span class="BoldUnderline">damage, and even just mischief delivered by even the least significant adversary</span>. However, <span class="BoldUnderline">other nations may seek to deny U.S. advantages in space through a variety of negation and prevention actions. Negation Threats Satellite systems consist not only of spacecraft, each with their own payload and bus, but also a supporting infrastructure—ground control stations, tracking and control links, commonly referred to as the tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&amp;C) links, data links, launch facilities, and an industrial base</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Each of these components is at risk to threats of physical and cyber attack, and sabotage, and can be negated, simultaneously or each in detail. The satellite payload, bus, links, and infrastructure can be negated by using a variety of permanent or reversible means to achieve one of the five possible effects, known as the ‘‘five Ds’’—deception, disruption, denial, degradation, and destruction.5 Space-based threats proliferate as a result of the ever-growing global availability of technology and access to the space domain. </span>There are huge incentives for states to invest in and use space , and the spread of space technologies has occurred. States with sufficient resources can now reach out to space and ‘‘touch’’ satellites through a variety of means, and achieve one and even more of the five Ds. <span class="BoldUnderline">Spacecraft are vulnerable to direct ascent weapons as demonstrated by the Chinese ASAT test, and to a variety of other groundbased, airborne, and </span>space-based ASAT technologie<span class="BoldUnderline">s</span>. Direct-ascent launched, or orbit-based nuclear devices, can be detonated, generating radiation and other lethal effects to destroy unshielded electronics over a wide lethal range. Co-orbital ASATs could be employed, comparable to the old Soviet system that was tested extensively in the 1970s and early 80s. In a less likely scenario, space-borne mines can also be deployed in close proximity to spacecraft, or exploded to generate debris clouds that destructively engage whole classes of satellites in the same orbital plane or in crossing orbits. Ground, space-based, or airborne lasers could be used by adversaries to wreak havoc. Blinding operations could be executed and inflict effects ranging from temporary ‘‘dazzling’’ to permanent burnout of optical or other sensors with intense energy bursts. Ground systems, supporting communications, and their nodes, are vulnerable to diverse land, sea, or air kinetic attacks, including sabotage. Unprotected systems are also susceptible to electronic attack through jamming and electromagnetic deception techniques. Jammers emit signals that mask or prevent reception of desired signals; these methods can disrupt uplinks, downlinks, and even cross-links. <span class="BoldUnderline">By disabling the means of command and control, and data communications, jammers render satellites inoperable or unavailable. </span>Electromagnetic deception techniques can be employed to confuse systems; this could include sending false, but deceptively plausible, commands that cause spacecraft to perform damaging or wasteful maneuvers, modify databases or execute configuration changes, or otherwise destroy it. Similarly, supporting terrestrial ground stations, computer networks, and links are vulnerable to information operation and cyber attacks. These attacks could involve directing global denial of service tasks, injecting fake commands, malicious software and viruses into the space system, performing unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of sensitive information (data interception), and causing unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of network information, services, and databases. In sum, there is a wide span of kinetic and other types of attacks an adversary could consider and employ. There is potential that even non-state actors can access some of these technologies and space systems, and achieve several of the five Ds; however, it is unlikely they can obtain and then employ a full-spectrum of these means and achieve all of these effects. Conducting an attack within the space domain involves a rather substantial investment to develop, acquire, operate, and sustain needed shooter, sensor, and command and control systems. Given the scope and commitment needed to affect such a move, an on-orbit attack would probably be made only in the context of a larger strategic struggle, perhaps as a prelude to or part of early combat operations. On the other hand, <span class="BoldUnderline">inexpensive jamming technology is available to even the poorest potential adversaries. As such, jamming poses the most used and growing threat to space systems.</span> Some argue that jamming also carries with it implicit political and legal sanctions since no major space power has moved to ban or make even temporary and reversible jamming illegal. This may change now that a number of nations have banned together to object to recent Iranian satellite jamming.6 Cyber adversaries and criminals are also beginning to hone their craft. They present an evolving threat to space systems; and like jamming, cyber threats can be developed and deployed for only modest investments. Prevention Threats Prevention actions generally involve economic, political, informational, and diplomatic instruments of national power. For example, an extremely large creditor nation could employ its considerable economic clout and leverage in an attempt to compel or blackmail the United States to not license or permit imaging of its territory, preventing its use, and reducing its exposure to such observation. The creditor nation could seek to accomplish its objective by destabilizing the world market place. It could refuse to purchase treasury offerings that underpin the burgeoning U.S. fiscal and trade deficits, perhaps arguing that remote sensing, especially commercial remote sensing, of its territory infringes on its territorial and sovereign rights, or that it constitutes ‘‘unlawful’’ industrial espionage, and is thus, an unfair trade practice.7 Commercial remote sensing systems are nowan important resource for the United States Government and its national security needs. U.S. Government orders help sustain and stabilize the remote sensing industry,8 and any limitations on activities, whether for U.S. Government customers or commercial ones, imposed in response to external economic threats could evolve to cause problems. In an alternative scenario, a state, acting through political allies and proxies, could exert considerable influence and dominance to affect a change in U.S. law. This change could restrict licensing of commercial remote sensing imagery, restricting the market place and impacting business models for producers.9 As a diplomatic prevention example, adversaries could attempt to use international forums and treaties to deny frequency rights needed by U.S. military or intelligence satellites by making spurious ‘‘paper satellite’’ filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). ‘‘Paper satellites’’ involve ITU applications for satellite orbital slots, many for ‘‘speculative’’ systems that will never leave Earth. These filings can block access to scarce spectrum and orbital resources.10 The ability to place communications and other satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) positions could be held at risk. Some characterize some of these types of actions as a form of ‘‘lawfare.’’ ‘‘The term lawfare describes the growing use of international law claims, usually factually or legally meritless, as a tool of war. The goal is to gain a moral advantage over your enemy in the court of world opinion, and potentially a legal advantage in national and international tribunals.’’11 Prevention actions taken to hobble U.S. space systems are not armed attacks. As is discussed later, the use of force is only authorized under the United Nations (UN) Charter in response to an armed attack, or upon authorization of the UN Security Council. As such, using armed force to deter and defeat prevention actions involving political or diplomatic subterfuge or intrigue may be unlawful under international law. Creative alternative solutions must therefore be found to assure access to space when facing these types of threats. Implications for U.S. Space Strategy <span class="BoldUnderline">The wide span of threats poses profound implications for U.S. space strategy and its execution</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">First</span>, <span class="BoldUnderline">unlike the Cold War era, t</span>he U<span class="BoldUnderline">nited </span>S<span class="BoldUnderline">tates now </span>confronts <span class="BoldUnderline">a wide array of </span>global actors, <span class="BoldUnderline">all </span>operating with different motivations and incentives, some of which could become potential adversaries who can attack or threaten space capabilities. <span class="BoldUnderline">These state and non-state adversaries exhibit a wide array of political, economic, technical, and social differences</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Having many potential adversaries makes each of them harder to understand</span>. This complicates efforts to understand motivations <span class="BoldUnderline">and to influence perceptions for deterrence purposes.</span> These differences<span class="BoldUnderline">, in turn, </span>increase the likelihood of misperceptio<span class="BoldUnderline">n, undercutting strategies to protect access to space capabilities</span>. When one’s attention is divided, deterrent measures that are appropriate for one target may not be useful, or even counterproductive, for another. This requires tailored intelligence efforts, information operations, and transparency efforts in order to avoid or minimize disputes and prevent problems. Second, the broad array of adversaries exhibit widely varying risk-taking behaviors. Risk-taking behavior can strongly influence an adversary’s perception of a situation. Understanding this phenomenon can lead to better ways of influencing those perceptions. Unfortunately, potentialadversaries may not care that space systems offer tremendous value and capabilities to all nations,or care whether conflict in space could create space debris that could cost all nations access to the domain. A strategy to assure continuing access to space assets must therefore be sufficiently flexible to address both risk-averse and risk-taking adversaries. Indeed, potential adversaries may shift from risk-taking to risk-adverse over a relatively short period of time. China<span class="BoldUnderline"> may </span>fit in this category. Within a decade or two, it will have its own extensive space-based communications, navigation, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellite constellations, all of which will be integrated into its military operations. No doubt, China will embrace that evolution and become very reliant on space capabilities; this will shift it from an asymmetric competitor to one similar to the United States or Russia. Third, with the demise of the Soviet Union, some political commentators and critics described the United States as a ‘‘hyperpower’’ not just a ‘‘superpower.’’ 12 <span class="BoldUnderline">Though buffeted by recent events involving Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and the 2008 global financial meltdown, </span>U.S. military supremacy<span class="BoldUnderline"> continues.</span> But, <span class="BoldUnderline">that supremacy does </span>not make or guarantee a successful space strategy. <span class="BoldUnderline">Adversaries may believe they have a higher stake than the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">States in the outcome of a particular crisis or conflict</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Alternatively, the United States stake in the crisis may not be commensurate with the possible cost of involvement by the United States military and the rest of its national security apparatus. The first alternative may encourage mischief by adversaries; the second discourages U.S. action. As a result, </span>adversaries may find threats of U.S. action in response to hostile acts affecting U.S. access to space systems to be non-credible. Fourth, <span class="BoldUnderline">while </span>the U<span class="BoldUnderline">nited </span>S<span class="BoldUnderline">tates </span>has<span class="BoldUnderline"> produced superlative space capabilities, it has </span>not produced enough systems ready to survive the new kinetic, exotic, jamming, and cyber threat environment<span class="BoldUnderline">.</span> The vulnerability exists because the spacecraft developed and deployed today are in many ways the same as those originally fielded during the Cold War. During that epic struggle, there was a tacit and then explicit understanding that each superpower would not attack and overwhelm the other’s space systems, except in the dire st of circumstances, perhaps during the throes of a nuclear conflagration. Indeed, a number of agreements between the superpowers adopted the understanding and ruled out interference with national technical means, including space assets. <span class="BoldUnderline">This belief in the superiority of space systems and power blinds the United States to the inherent strategic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in these systems</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">This,</span> predictably, <span class="BoldUnderline">can now be exploited by potential adversaries, such as China, who, with their recent ASAT test, appear more willing to fully explore the technologies needed to expand the limits of conventional war to include the space domain</span>. Consequently, by historically and diplomatically reducing the threat, engineering of some satellite threat detection, attack avoidance, and other defense subsystems have not matured enough so that they are sophisticated, nimble, and robust enough to counter new 21st Century adversary attack capabilities.<br />

<strong>Chinese doctrine, spending, and actions all portend an attack on US space assets - it will likely escalate</strong><br />

<br />
The PLA is exploring<span class="BoldUnderline"> in theoretical research, basic </span>research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons<span class="BoldUnderline">.77 </span>These include:<br />
. satellite jamming <span class="BoldUnderline">technology;</span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">. collisions between space bodies;</span><br />
. kinetic energy weapons;<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">. space-to-ground attack weapons;</span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">. space planes</span> that can transit and fight ‘‘up or down’’ in the upper atmosphere or space;<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">. high-power </span>laser <span class="BoldUnderline">weapons;</span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">. high-power </span>microwave<span class="BoldUnderline"> weapon systems</span>;<br />
. particle-beam<span class="BoldUnderline"> weapons; and</span><br />
. electromagnetic pulse<span class="BoldUnderline">.78</span><br />
PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. <span class="BoldUnderline">The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies.</span> The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not<span class="BoldUnderline">, it </span>is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare<span class="BoldUnderline">. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the </span>blinding of a U.S. satellite mean<span class="BoldUnderline"> they are </span>achieving<span class="BoldUnderline"> some </span>success.PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 The Chinese<span class="BoldUnderline"> see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they </span>would<span class="BoldUnderline"> probably </span>use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, <span class="BoldUnderline">and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.</span>S.81 One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. As the PLA modernizes its own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4SIR) systems, <span class="BoldUnderline">it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, </span>the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict. The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons<span class="BoldUnderline"> or a deeper crisis. </span>For example, <span class="BoldUnderline">four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College,</span> in Wuhan, <span class="BoldUnderline">have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S</span>.82 <span style="font-size: 5pt;">In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85 In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88</span> <span class="BoldUnderline">The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems. One possible reaction by </span>the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike <span class="BoldUnderline">against China’s strategic missile forces</span>. <span style="font-size: 5pt;">Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research. Space Deterrence Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. </span><span style="font-size: 5pt; text-decoration: none;">Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems. In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability. Conclusions There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First,</span> in the event of conflict<span class="BoldUnderline"> with the PLA, </span>military operations carried out across all the domains of wa<span class="BoldUnderline">r, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, </span>are likely. <span class="BoldUnderline">Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems</span>. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA. U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions<span class="BoldUnderline">. There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims;97 the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space</span> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory. The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;" class="BoldUnderline">.</span><span class="BoldUnderline"> No</span> such <span class="BoldUnderline">dialogue has taken place with China</span>. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue<span class="BoldUnderline">. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality</span>.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures. Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like <span class="BoldUnderline">the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability</span>. PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature. By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature<span class="BoldUnderline">, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S</span>. To this end, <span class="BoldUnderline">the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict.</span><br />

<strong>The risk of crisis instability and miscalc is high – the PLA is isolated from the Chinese government</strong><br />
<strong><span class="AuthorDate">MacDonald 11</span></strong> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">–[ Senior Director, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program, U.S. Institute of Peace (Bruce, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA”, 5/11, lexis]</span><br />
<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">One characteristic of too many wars </span>in the last century is <span class="BoldUnderline">that they </span>arethe result of miscalculation<span class="BoldUnderline"> that ignites the tinder of fundamental geopolitical tensions. Averting major power conflict requires skillful management of tensions by senior leaders of the major powers</span>. China has become much more internationally sophisticated, though with important exceptions, in its dealings with the rest of the world than has been true in the past, and this is reflected in its civilian leadership. Unfortunately, <span class="BoldUnderline">the PLA's senior officer corps </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">trails its civilian counterparts in this respect. They </span><span class="BoldUnderline">have much less interaction with foreign official and travel abroad much less frequently than their U.S. counterparts. </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">This means that </span><span class="BoldUnderline">the PLA overall views world events from a less knowledgeable and sophisticated perspective, a danger in this increasingly complex world, and could explain</span>, for example, the political &quot;tonedeafness&quot; of the PLA in the manner they conducted <span class="BoldUnderline">their 2007 ASAT test.This PLA problem becomes more serious when one realizes that </span>the PLA is organizationally separate from the rest of the Chinese government<span class="BoldUnderline">, and reports only to the Central Military Commission,</span> currently chaired by President Hu Jintao. President Hu, and his likely successors, have no significant military background, and <span class="BoldUnderline">the majority of the CMC's members are top PLA officers, suggesting that </span>civilian oversight of major military decisions and consideration of their larger implications are not as carefully reviewed as in the U.S. governmen<span class="BoldUnderline">t</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">. Normally this would not be too great a concern,</span> but in a crisis this could be dangerous<span class="BoldUnderline">. Add to this the fact that </span>China has no equivalent of our N<span class="BoldUnderline">ationa</span>l S<span class="BoldUnderline">ecurity</span> Council,<span class="BoldUnderline"> a critically important body for coordinating our security decisionmaking, and one comes away concerned about the relative insularity of the PLA in the Chinese power structure</span>. In a crisis, the PLA<span class="BoldUnderline"> probably </span>cannot be counted on to show<span class="BoldUnderline"> as </span>sophisticated<span class="BoldUnderline"> a sense of </span>judgment<span class="BoldUnderline"> as one would hope any country's military leaders, even an enemy's, to show. All these problems and many more pose potential threats to internal political stability andCommunist Party control, providing ample opportunity for crisis and conflict in the years ahead</span>. Overview of The Strategic Landscape of Space Space asset<span class="BoldUnderline">s</span>, and the communications and cyber links that enable them to function, <span class="BoldUnderline">are the means by which essential national security information is either generated, transmitted, or both. This information is the lifeblood of U.S. conventional military superiority and plays a key role in U.S. strategic nuclear posture as well</span>. As such, <span class="BoldUnderline">these space related assets represent extraordinarily appealing targets in any future conflict, and </span>their<span class="BoldUnderline"> relative </span>vulnerability can provide<span class="BoldUnderline"> dangerously attractive </span>incentives<span class="BoldUnderline"> in a crisis </span>to preempt, escalating to war. Resisting this temptation to attack may be morally virtuous but could be strategically unwise:going first<span class="BoldUnderline"> in a space conflict with a nearpeer space adversary </span>appears to offer <span class="BoldUnderline">many </span>advantages<span class="BoldUnderline">, while absorbing such a strike, with all its attendant destruction of military capabilities, and then responding to the attack against an opponent fully expecting such a response, appears to be militarily and strategically quite undesirable.</span>As technology advances, the ways of interfering with, disrupting, or destroying information streams in space or supporting space systems will likely increase<span class="BoldUnderline">, as will U.S. and others' dependence upon such systems.</span> Providing defensive options for U.S. space assets should be pursued where appropriate, but most space observers believe that offense has the advantage in space over defense, as General Cartwright observed last May. Cartwright also noted that the challenging issues that space poses has made the Space Posture Review &quot;the most difficult of all the defense reviews&quot; the Obama Administration has undertaken. The overall U.S. goal in space should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States and its allies, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. and allied security. The United States has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that <span class="BoldUnderline">the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies</span>. This need not mean that China and others must perforce be disadvantaged by such an arrangement - there should be ample opportunity for many countries to benefit and prosper from a properly crafted system of space management. There is an inherent risk of strategic instability when relatively modest defense efforts create disproportionate danger to an adversary, as with space offense. And there is a serious risk of crisis instability in space <span class="BoldUnderline">when &quot;going first&quot; pays off - destroying an adversary's satellites before he destroys yours. We don't know what would happen in a crisis, but </span>the potential for space instability seems high and likely to grow.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, facilities or services; </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><strong>.</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on the US homeland or an attack </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.44Although a major attack on the US is not likely, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculationthat the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence</span><span class="BoldUnderline">. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, </span>the Chinese<span class="BoldUnderline"> might seek to disrupt or </span>destroy<span class="BoldUnderline"> regional </span>space capabilities<span class="BoldUnderline"> as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a fait accompli</span>.45 A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49 The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “<span class="BoldUnderline">Space capabilities</span> are no longer nice to have, but <span class="BoldUnderline">are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars</span>.”51 <span class="BoldUnderline">The</span> failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets.The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52 Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives. The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, <span class="BoldUnderline">successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets</span> in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. <span class="BoldUnderline">A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces</span>. Satellite communication<span class="BoldUnderline"> links to worldwide deployed forces</span> are critical <span class="BoldUnderline">capabilities</span> in protecting <span class="BoldUnderline">US </span>security,<span class="BoldUnderline"> sovereignty, and military combat capability. </span>The inability to detect <span class="BoldUnderline">and assess </span>space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems<span class="BoldUnderline"> or conduct probing attacks on US space systems</span> without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55Today, <span class="BoldUnderline">other </span>nations are working to <span class="BoldUnderline">developnew weapons to </span>counter<span class="BoldUnderline"> US </span>dominance and <span class="BoldUnderline">to </span>take the lead<span class="BoldUnderline"> in</span> what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—<span class="BoldUnderline">informationwar</span>. The current <span class="BoldUnderline">coverage gaps in our space surveillance network</span>, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset <span class="BoldUnderline">makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons </span>without our knowledge. Finally, <span class="BoldUnderline">without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy</span> to counter an attack against US space assets. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is <span class="BoldUnderline">to deter an attack on US space assets</span>. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. <span class="BoldUnderline">A senior officer in US Strat</span>egic <span class="BoldUnderline">Com</span>mand recently <span class="BoldUnderline">stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution</span>.57<br />

Spacefaring prowess is a common attribute of the dominant powers in the world today<span class="BoldUnderline">. Special attention must be paid to so-called </span>rogue states<span class="BoldUnderline"> that </span>have access to space-related technology<span class="BoldUnderline"> and may even be spacefaring but do not have the conventional forces to achieve their policy aims.</span> Those aims tend to be very intense, and <span class="BoldUnderline">these players </span>may seek space weapons as an asymmetric hedge against spacefaring adversaries who may try to coerce them. The dominant military powers in the world, some of whom are potential adversaries, also tend to be the dominant spacefaring states. <span class="BoldUnderline">Because of the economic benefits and exponential enhancements that spacepower delivers to terrestrial warfighting, those </span>states <span class="BoldUnderline">are under increasing pressure to defend their space systems and to counter those of their potential adversaries. </span>This may lead to a space weapons race and an immediate escalation of hostilities to &quot;wipe the skies&quot; of enemy satellites <span class="BoldUnderline">should war break out between two or more dominant military space powers</span>.29 When assessing the interplay between the spectrum of conflict and the spectrum of belligerents, it may be the case that war between two weak actors will not likely extend into space. However, if the power is perceived to be disparate, a weak actor is far more likely to use space weapons against a powerful state as an asymmetric defensive mov<span class="BoldUnderline">e</span>.30 A powerful state may counter the space systems in use by a weaker adversary, but it is likely to do so by placing diplomatic pressure on commercial vendors, or executing attacks on their ground stations, or launching highly selective covert attacks on the satellites they use by employing temporary and reversible means. Should two<span class="BoldUnderline"> dominant </span>spacefaring powers go directly to war<span class="BoldUnderline"> with each other with intense motives, </span>both will find it critical to preserve their space system<span class="BoldUnderline">s and will consider it a dangerous liability to allow their enemy to exploit theirs. Given the ability of spacepower to cut the fog and friction of war while connecting military forces at the tactical, operational, and strategic level, it is likely that </span>space systems will be primary targets<span class="BoldUnderline"> that will be negated in the opening moves of war.</span> The fight for space is likely to be intense and brief. Temporary means of negation will likely switch to permanent methods of destruction to remove doubt in the minds of commanders.<br />

<br />
Space assets are one of the most critical ‘‘Achilles’ heels’’ of the current military capability of the United States (U.S.). This is for two reasons: (<span class="BoldUnderline">1) the </span>U.S. military space systems<span class="BoldUnderline">—in particular reconnaissance, navigation, </span>signals intelligence, early warning, and communications systems—are critical to modern military warfare and intelligen<span class="BoldUnderline">ce; and (2) </span>space systems are inherently vulnerable to attack<span class="BoldUnderline">. This combination is understood at the highest levels and was espoused in the ‘‘Rumsfeld Space Commission’’ with talk of a ‘‘Space Pearl Harbor.’</span>’1 Whether one agrees with the tone<span class="BoldUnderline">, this is a genuine security problem for the U.S. in need of a near-term solution</span>. While there have been numerous papers, and much media and academic attention, in the space security discussion focused on promoting or criticizing space-based weapons,2 there have been far fewer papers and studies offering constructive ways forward that deal with these genuine security concerns in a broader sense.3 The central motivation for this paper is to put forward one key element—the satellite architecture—in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. space assets. It is hoped that this idea, together with others like it, should stimulate and contribute to a debate on more constructive ways forward for how to achieve space security in the post-Cold war world. Importance of Space Assets For better or worse, <span class="BoldUnderline">it is clear that the </span>U.S.<span class="BoldUnderline"> military is to some significant extent dependent on its key satellites, </span>which number about 86–105 operational satellites at present. <span class="BoldUnderline">These </span>satellites constitute a significant part of the eyes, ears, and central nervous system of the modern military<span class="BoldUnderline">.4 A practical example that helps to illustrate this is </span>the case of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq<span class="BoldUnderline"> in 2003. First, </span>the decision to go was based in part on satellite imagery and<span class="BoldUnderline"> signals </span>intelligence<span class="BoldUnderline"> from satellites; whether or not it was interpreted or used correctly is a separate issue. Second, the planning and operation were facilitated by satellite imagery. Third, </span>many planes, ships, tanks, and units’ positions were known through<span class="BoldUnderline"> Global Positioning System (</span>GPS) satellites<span class="BoldUnderline">, and even most munitions were guided by GPS. Fourth, the operation was commanded from the U.S. in large part through the use of communications satellites</span>. Perhaps more importantly than any of the functions in the Iraq example, early warning (EW) satellites are the U.S.’s and Russia’s first warning of nuclear missile attack<span class="BoldUnderline">.</span> As Gray classified, <span class="BoldUnderline">space assets have moved from being ‘‘useful and </span>important’’ to an ‘‘indispensable adjunct’’ in the military <span class="BoldUnderline">over the last decade</span>.5 Space assets are definitely used a great deal by the U.S. military, but that does not mean necessarily as strong a dependence as Gray implies. The loss of U.S. space assets could range in its effect anywhere from a loss to the U.S. military in practical operations, to be<span class="BoldUnderline">ing </span>catastrophic to U.S. security<span class="BoldUnderline">. The former would entail a reduction in operational effectiveness or speed, but fundamentally supposes that back-up systems and/or redundancy allow a near continuation of military capability. </span>The<span class="BoldUnderline"> latter </span>scenario would entail an effective disablement of the U.S. military capability<span class="BoldUnderline"> from normal operations. </span>In reality, the significance lies between these boundaries, but this is a topic that could benefit from further research.<br />

Paul Kennedy was probably right: the US will go the way of all great powers — down. The individual dramas of the past decade — the September 2001 terrorist attacks, prolonged wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis — have delivered the world a message: US primacy is in decline. This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline, but it encompasses a trend that appears to be negative and perhaps alarming. Although the US still possesses incomparable military prowess and its economy remains the world’s largest, the once seemingly indomitable chasm that separated America from anyone else is narrowing. Thus, the global distribution of power is shifting, and the inevitable result will be a world that is less peaceful, liberal and prosperous, burdened by a dearth of effective conflict regulation. <span class="BoldUnderline">Over the past two decades, </span>no other state has had the ability to<span class="BoldUnderline"> seriously </span>challenge the US<span class="BoldUnderline"> military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, </span>many actors<span class="BoldUnderline"> have </span>bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role<span class="BoldUnderline">. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a </span>status quo<span class="BoldUnderline"> that </span>has tended to mute great power conflicts.<span class="BoldUnderline"> However, </span>as the hegemony<span class="BoldUnderline"> that drew these powers together </span>withers<span class="BoldUnderline">, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. </span>The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse<span class="BoldUnderline">, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and </span>conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid<span class="BoldUnderline">. As history attests, </span>power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation<span class="BoldUnderline">. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves</span>.’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law. <span class="BoldUnderline">Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that </span>America’s authority<span class="BoldUnderline">, although sullied at times, has </span>benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe<span class="BoldUnderline">, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that </span>a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of<span class="BoldUnderline"> the 1930s: </span>regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry<span class="BoldUnderline">. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For example</span>, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have hist<span style="color: black;">orically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973)</span><span class="BoldUnderline">. A world </span>without American<span class="BoldUnderline"> hegemony is one where </span>great power wars re-emerge, the liberal<span class="BoldUnderline"> international </span>system is supplanted by an authoritarian one<span class="BoldUnderline">, and </span>trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers<span class="BoldUnderline">. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy. </span><br />

<strong>Commitment to ORS is vital to deterrence by denial – it will prevent attacks against US space assets</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sejba 10</span></strong> – [USAF Congressional Budget Liaison Officer Budget and Appropriations Liaison Directorate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget Secretary of the Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC (Timothy, “ Deterrence for Space: Is Operationally Responsive Space Part of the Solution?”, High Frontier, May, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:5389:http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:5389 -->]<br />
<br />
The space domain, often referred to as “The High Frontier,” no longer is a sanctuary outside the reach of foreign intervention. <span class="BoldUnderline">The threat to space systems and their capabilities is broad, ranging from reversible effects such as jamming or blinding, to more destructive means such as anti-satellite weapons.It is now time to take actions for the sake of space, and assure its continued contributions across the full spectrum of military operations. Given the criticality of space to not only our military power, but also our economic power, it is time we develop policies and field capabilities to deter future adversaries from attempting to degrade, deny, or destroy space capabilities and services.</span> The asymmetric advantages enabled by space can no longer be assumed and as a result, <span class="BoldUnderline">a new National Security Strategy for space must be forged, one that combines deterrence with basic protection capabilities never before afforded our space systems. Yet, space deterrence is not an “all in” strategy, nor can it reduce the risk of attack to zero.1 Should aspects of deterrence fail, we must take steps to defend and protect our space systems and the critical global services they provide</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Operationally responsive space (</span>ORS<span class="BoldUnderline">) by definition is “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of joint force commanders’ needs.</span>”2 Dissected further, one key word stands out: assured … being sufficiently robust, timely, agile, adaptive, and resilient, to achieve desired outcomes with a high degree of certainty.3 So while <span style="text-decoration: none;">ORS</span> intends to provide operational and tactical support to the joint warfighter<span class="BoldUnderline">, its true value will be the assurance it </span>provides as a credible strategic deterrent against space attacks. <span class="BoldUnderline">As a deterrent, </span>ORS provides<span class="BoldUnderline"> access to existing capabilities, or </span>rapid deployment and employment of new capabilities,denying the benefits our adversaries may seek by attacking our space capabilities<span class="BoldUnderline">. Through timely and accurate intelligence, </span>we can work to understand our adversaries’ intent<span class="BoldUnderline"> and armed with this knowledge, we gain the opportunity to influence their decision-making calculus. Understanding intent, coupled with credible and timely </span>ORS capabilities, can <span class="BoldUnderline">effectively</span> deny <span class="BoldUnderline">or greatly reduce </span>the benefits they seek <span class="BoldUnderline">by attacking the asymmetric advantages enabled by space</span>.<span class="BoldUnderline"> ORS </span>provides a responsiveness<span class="BoldUnderline"> that will allow the commander</span>, US Strategic Command (CDR USSTRATCOM), to respond and support our combatant commands real-time and near-term requirements. To support these requirements, <span class="BoldUnderline">ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year.</span> The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations. <span class="BoldUnderline">Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">In fact, a deterrence strategy that includes </span>the threat of punishment<span class="BoldUnderline"> (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space.</span> For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form, <span class="BoldUnderline">mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy;</span> a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 <span class="BoldUnderline">While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy is</span> notdirectly applicable to space.<span class="BoldUnderline">6 Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain</span>. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain<span class="BoldUnderline">. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space. Instead, </span>deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits <span class="BoldUnderline">they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries</span> (against their most prized assets);9 <span class="BoldUnderline">and encourage their restraint.</span> A New Focus of Deterrence What does deterrence look like in the 21st century? The US has not yet figured that out, said <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear. ~ Sandra I. Erwin, Future of War—How the Game is Changing … Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.… ~ US National Security Strategy, 2006 In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command. The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making</span>.”10 <span class="BoldUnderline">In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint</span> (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, <span class="BoldUnderline">denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. </span>Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations<span class="BoldUnderline"> even in a contested environment. Deny the Benefits—ORS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Examples People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) view of space:</span> Space shifting from enabler to key battleground. Space characterized as important because it contributes to information dominance; space now described as important in its own right….many in the PLA see space as a likely future arena for conflict. ~ Space and PRC National Security,’ Dean Cheng, China specialist, The Heritage Foundation, 8 October 2008.12 The purpose to benefit denial is to convince an adversary that their intent will not be achieved, or have little to no value. Today, our ability to field ORS<span class="BoldUnderline"> capabilities </span>is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent. <span class="BoldUnderline">Instead</span>, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities. <span class="BoldUnderline">These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why </span>we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency. However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack.”14 The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, <span class="BoldUnderline">the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”</span>15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by <span class="BoldUnderline">General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices.</span> Moving forward, to be a true deterrent, ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them.<span class="BoldUnderline"> Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). </span>Tier 1 and Two<span class="BoldUnderline"> ORS capabilities </span>can be deployed<span class="BoldUnderline"> and employed </span>rapidly, within hours <span class="BoldUnderline">to days. The cost for Tier 1 includes implementing new concept of operations for deployed on-orbit systems, or the rapid, low cost launch and deployment of systems intended to augment existing systems for Tier 2.</span><br />

<span class="BoldUnderline">The U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities</span>. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. <span class="BoldUnderline">The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities</span>. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that <span class="BoldUnderline">efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities.</span> ,,39 Further, the<span class="BoldUnderline"> DoD's </span>Plan for O<span class="BoldUnderline">perationally </span>R<span class="BoldUnderline">esponsive </span>S<span class="BoldUnderline">pace </span>highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness<span class="BoldUnderline"> and adaptability to the threat</span>, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of <span style="font-size: 5pt;">United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42 The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43 The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44 While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;" class="BoldUnderline">ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within</span><span class="BoldUnderline"> this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements</span>. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. Field-ready systems would provide a credible<span class="BoldUnderline"> defensive </span>deterrent against<span class="BoldUnderline"> existing and likely </span>Chinese offensive<span class="BoldUnderline"> anti-satellite </span>actions. PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement. Space Situational Awareness <span class="BoldUnderline">Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy. The U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Although the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network</span> (SSN) network, <span class="BoldUnderline">it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space</span>;<span class="BoldUnderline"> the</span> February 10, 2009 <span class="BoldUnderline">collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise</span>.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. <span class="BoldUnderline">Improved SSA also allows the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites</span>. Intelligence Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States. Preplanned Satellite Actions Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting<span class="BoldUnderline"> to an anti-satellite attack. </span>While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These <span class="BoldUnderline">orbital </span>maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the<span class="BoldUnderline"> anti-satellite </span>weapon. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target. Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. If a conflict looks<span class="BoldUnderline"> to be </span>inevitable, they could<span class="BoldUnderline"> decide to rapidly </span>execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations. <span class="BoldUnderline">While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. </span>If<span class="BoldUnderline"> the </span>conflict escalates<span class="BoldUnderline"> into a conventional war, </span>the<span class="BoldUnderline"> single </span>maneuver may buy<span class="BoldUnderline"> the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates enough time to execute a kinetic strike<span class="BoldUnderline"> that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program.</span> The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets. Variable and Rapid Launch Capability The current<span class="BoldUnderline"> United States Department of Defense </span>launch complex does not have the capability to<span class="BoldUnderline"> rapidly </span>replenish satellites<span class="BoldUnderline"> in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies</span>. Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48 Small Satellites TheU<span class="BoldUnderline">nited </span>S<span class="BoldUnderline">tates </span>must<span class="BoldUnderline"> also </span>make a move towards smaller satellites<span class="BoldUnderline"> that use a common bus and architecture</span>. A single launch vehicle could<span class="BoldUnderline"> then </span>deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the<span class="BoldUnderline"> rapid </span>establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict<span class="BoldUnderline"> or replenishment of an old one</span>. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 Having numerous small satellites<span class="BoldUnderline"> ready to launch </span>can<span class="BoldUnderline"> also </span>lesson<span class="BoldUnderline"> the need to perform defensive orbital </span>maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished. Finally, small satellites are<span class="BoldUnderline"> inherently </span>harder to track<span class="BoldUnderline"> whether by radar or optical telescopes</span>. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites. Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe. Decreased Dependence on Space Systems The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission. Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, defense<span class="BoldUnderline"> against the long term radiation effects </span>must focus on hardening<span class="BoldUnderline"> all future </span>satellites<span class="BoldUnderline"> against nuclear explosions. </span>Without hardening<span class="BoldUnderline">, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite </span>replenishment could take months<span class="BoldUnderline"> and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost</span>.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites. Institutional Changes Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user. Transparency The<span class="BoldUnderline"> above </span>actions may deter China from<span class="BoldUnderline"> further </span>pursuing<span class="BoldUnderline"> its </span>anti-satellite programs<span class="BoldUnderline">, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities</span>. <strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Engagement </span></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic· missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO. Additionally</span>, <span class="BoldUnderline">the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, </span>Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program.53 <span class="BoldUnderline">Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals</span>. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, <span class="BoldUnderline">proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities</span>. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, <span class="BoldUnderline">these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that </span>can <span class="BoldUnderline">damage satellite systems</span>. “<span class="BoldUnderline">A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action</span>.”<span style="font-size: 5pt;">56 Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply. CONCLUSION The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57 Council on Foreign Relations </span><span class="BoldUnderline">The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degrade US military capabilities in a conflict with China</span>. The U<span class="BoldUnderline">nited </span>S<span class="BoldUnderline">tates </span>should rely on a defensive<span class="BoldUnderline"> space </span>strategy to deter<span class="BoldUnderline"> Chinese anti-satellite actions. </span>The strategy must include<span class="BoldUnderline"> robust </span>s<span class="BoldUnderline">pace </span>s<span class="BoldUnderline">ituational </span>a<span class="BoldUnderline">wareness, </span>preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, <span class="BoldUnderline">decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes</span>. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. <span class="BoldUnderline">The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat</span>. <span style="font-size: 5pt;">Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">An active region of the sun that blasted out powerful solar storms four days in a row last week likely isn't done yet, scientists say</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 5pt;">Officially, the flare-spouting region is called sunspot 1283. But space weather experts have dubbed it &quot;Old Faithful,&quot; after the famous geyser in the United States' Yellowstone National Park that goes off like clockwork. And the solar Old Faithful should erupt again before it dissipates, researchers said. &quot;It still has a fair amount of complexity,&quot; said solar physicist C. Alex Young of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. &quot;So we still have a pretty good chance of seeing some more stuff from this one.&quot; An active sunspot Sunspots are temporary dark patches on the solar surface caused by intense magnetic activity. Some last for hours before disappearing; others linger for days, weeks or even months</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Powerful solar storms often erupt from sunspots. These include radiation-flinging solar flares and phenomena known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) — massive clouds of solar plasma that can streak through space at up to 3 million mph</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;"> (5 million kph). </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">From Sept. 5-8, sunspot 1283 produced four big flares and three CMEs</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">. Two of the flares were X-class events and two were M-class flares. (</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Strong solar flares are classified accordingto a three-tiered system: X-class are the most powerful</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">, M-class are of medium strength and C-class are the weakest.) While the rapid motion previously observed in sunspot 1283 seems to have died down a bit, Young said, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the sunspot looks poised to erupt again sometime soon</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&quot;There's a good probability that we're still going to seeat least another M-class flare, possibly another X-class flare,</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">&quot; Young told SPACE.com. It's not uncommon for sunspots to pop off a number of powerful flares in quick succession the way 1283 has done, he added. That seems to be the natural order of things. &quot;When you see one big flare, your chances of seeing another one are pretty good,&quot; Young said.

That's not to say scientists aren't making progress. Indeed, they've learned a lot about solar eruptions lately, Young said. And the knowledge base will continue to grow, he added, as a fleet of sun-watching spacecraft beam home more and more observations of Earth's star. &quot;We're really in a great time right now in terms of the data that we have,&quot; Young said, citing the contributions of spacecraft such as NASA's STEREO and Solar Dynamics Observatory, as well as SOHO, a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency. &quot;It's going to be pretty exciting, from a solar physics and a space weather point of view.&quot; All of these eyes on the sun should be treated to quite a show over the next several years</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Solar activity has been ramping up over the last few months as the sun works toward a maximum in its 11-year activitycycle.

<span style="text-align: justify;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Last October, around Halloween, the Sun produced a solar storm that was one of the largest ever recorded, and was strong enough to raise some concerns about the safety of Earth’s satellites.</span><span style="color: black;"> According to a recent paper published in Space Weather, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">such concern may well be justified</span><span style="color: black;">. If its conclusions are correct, then a </span><span class="BoldUnderline">solar storm the size of one that was observed in 1859 could potentially kill several weather, telecommunications, and military satellites in less than a year</span><span style="color: black;">. Here’s where the danger lies: </span><span class="BoldUnderline">most </span>s<span class="BoldUnderline">atellites, at least at some point in their orbits, fly through the inner radiation belt surrounding the Earth</span><span style="color: black;"> (aka the Van Allen Belt). The inner radiation belt, like it says on the tin, comprises quite a bit of intense radiation. However, satellites are shielded from that radiation, and the intensity of the radiation in the inner belt is relatively stable. That’s because it’s in large part shielded from high-energy particles by the plasmasphere, which is a cloud of plasma that is part of the Earth’s magnetosphere. Usually, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">when a solar storm hits, most of the radiation either hits the outer radiation belt or the plasmaphere. When the plasmasphere gets hit, some of the plasma dissipates, making it smaller, but that dissipation prevents too much intense radiation from hitting the inner belt.</span><span style="color: black;"> During the Halloween storms, observations showed that there was significant erosion of the plasmasphere. Not enough to let significant radiation into the inner belt, but enough that the study authors wanted to take a closer look at the data. Based on observational data of solar storms, the radiation belts, and the plasmasphere during past years, the authors were able to successfully model the Halloween solar storm. They then modeled a solar storm with the intensity of the Carrington Solar Storm, which took place in 1859 and is estimated to have been about four times stronger than the Halloween storms. When the Carrington storm was modeled, the results showed that the plasmasphere was eroded to the point that much more radiation reached the inner belt than is normally the case.

That strikes me as a good idea. </span></span><br />

<strong>Redundancy and Reconstitution is key to protect satellite systems</strong><br />
<span style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">CBS 9-28</span></strong><span style="color: black;">-11-[September 28, 2011 1:06 PM PRINT TEXT -“Satellites threatened by sun &quot;superstorms&quot; By Charles Q.

<span style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">(Space.com) </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Magnetic storms set off by the sun could pose a bigger threat than thought to weather, communication, military and other satellites close to Earth, with a potentially devastating economic impact, scientists suggest</span><span style="color: black;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">In the new study, researchers found that solar radiation can energize a belt of high-energy particles that surrounds Earth more dramatically than previously believed</span><span style="color: black;">. The study focused on the possible effects of a particularly strong magnetic storm on the Van Allen radiation belts, the dangerous rings of high-energy particles that girdle the Earth. The belts are split into two distinct zones. The outer belt, which is made up of electrons, reaches from about 15,800 to 31,600 miles (25,500 to 51,000 kilometers) above the surface, while the inner belt, which consists of a mix of electrons and protons, reaches from about 4,000 to 8,000 miles (6,400 to 12,800 km) above. Scientists had known the outer belt could become far more intense during geomagnetic storms caused by high-energy particles spewed by the sun, such as the storm that supercharged Earth's northern lights display Monday night (Sept. 26). However, they have long thought such storms do not affect the inner belt. Now computer simulations suggest </span><span class="BoldUnderline">that during a &quot;superstorm&quot; -- which has occurred in the past and is likely to recur in the future</span><span style="color: black;"> ? </span><span class="BoldUnderline">the electrons in the inner belt, too, could become energized</span><span style="color: black;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Near-Earth radiation could then remain dramatically more intense for several years afterward. &quot;The increase in radiation in the inner zone may last for up to a decade and continue damaging satellites for years after a very strong storm</span><span style="color: black;">,&quot; study lead author Yuri Shprits, a space physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told SPACE.com. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">This radiation would damage satellites in that zone and potentially cut their lifetimes by five-sixths or more</span><span style="color: black;">. [Related: Space Radiation to Rise for Astronauts, Airline Passengers] &quot;It would not destroy all satellites at once,&quot; Shprits said. &quot;However, at least according to our calculations, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">a very strong storm can increase the radiation dose in the inner zone by a factor of 10, and within a few years we may lose a significant portion of the satellites that traverse the inner zone.</span><span style="color: black;">&quot; </span><span class="BoldUnderline">In terms of new strategies that might be needed to protect satellite systems</span><span style="color: black;">, &quot;it's hard to say,&quot; Shprits said. &quot;First of all, we need to estimate risks and estimate cost. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">If cost is too high, we may want to accept the risks and start getting ready to replenish the fleet in the case of such event</span><span style="color: black;">.&quot; &quot;There are a number of rather expensive strategies that can be used to mitigate the risk, including redundancy in electronics and increased shielding,&quot; he added. &quot;Zero risk means infinite cost.&quot; Two missions to study the radiation belts are planned for 2012, Shprits noted: NASA's Radiation Belt Storm Probe will observe radiation belts in the equatorial plane, while Moscow State University's LOMONOSOV mission, with UCLA-built instruments on board, will observe radiation belts at low altitudes. The scientists detailed their findings online in the Aug. 25 issue of the journal Space Weather. </span></span><br />

<strong>National Weather Service, 11</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (“Layers of the Atmosphere”, 2/11, </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:5394:http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream" rel="nofollow">http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:5394 -->//atmos/layers.htm</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">)</span><br />
<br />
Layers of the Atmosphere <span style="font-size: 7pt;">The envelope of gas surrounding the Earth changes from the ground up. Five distinct layers have been identified using... thermal characteristics (temperature changes), chemical composition, movement, and density. Each of the layers are bounded by &quot;pauses&quot; where the greatest changes in thermal characteristics, chemical composition, movement, and density occur. </span>Troposphere <span style="font-size: 7pt;">The troposphere begins at the Earth's surface and extends from 4 to 12 miles (6 to 20 km) high. This is the layer of the atmosphere in which we live. The height of the troposphere varies from the equator to the poles. At the equator it is around 11-12 miles (18-20 km) high, at 50°N and 50°S, 5½ miles and at the poles just under four miles high. As the density of the gases in this layer decrease with height, the air becomes thinner. Therefore, the temperature in the troposphere also decreases with height in response. As one climbs higher, the temperature drops from an average around 62°F (17°C) to -60°F (-51°C) at the top of the troposphere. Almost all weather occurs in this region. The transition boundary between the troposphere and the layer above is called the tropopause. Together the tropopause and the troposphere are known as the lower atmosphere. </span>Stratosphere The Stratosphere extends from the top of the troposphere up to around 31 miles <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(50 km) above the Earth's surface. This layer holds 19 percent of the atmosphere's gases but very little water vapor. In this region the temperature increases with height. Heat is produced in the process of the formation of Ozone and this heat is responsible for temperature increases from an average -60°F (-51°C) at tropopause to a maximum of about 5°F (-15°C) at the top of the stratosphere. This increase in temperature with height means warmer air is located above cooler air. This prevents &quot;convection&quot; since there is no upward vertical movement of the gases and is the reason for the 'anvil-shaped' tops of cumulonimbus clouds. These anvils occur at the tropopause. The transition boundary which separates the stratosphere from the mesosphere is called the stratopause. </span>Mesosphere <span style="font-size: 7pt;">T</span>he mesosphere extends from the top of the stratosphere to about 56 miles<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (90 km) </span>above the earth<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The gases, including the oxygen molecules, continue to become thinner and thinner with height. As such, the effect of the warming by ultraviolet radiation also becomes less and less leading to a decrease in temperature with height. On average, temperature decreases from about 5°F (-15°C) to as low as -184°F (-120°C) at the mesopause. However, the gases in the mesosphere are still thick enough to slow down meteors hurtling into the atmosphere, where they burn up, leaving fiery trails in the night sky. Both the stratosphere to the mesosphere is considered the middle atmosphere. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The transition boundary which separates the mesosphere from the thermosphere is called the mesopause. </span>Thermosphere<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Above the mesosphere the thermosphere extends up to near 375 miles (600 km) above the earth. This layer is known as the upper atmosphere. The gases of the thermosphere are increasingly thinner than in the mesosphere. As such, incoming high energy ultraviolet and x-ray radiation from the sun, absorbed by the molecules in this layer, causes a large temperature increase. Because of this absorption, the temperature increases with height and can reach as high as 3,600°F (2,000°C) near the top of this layer; however, despite the high temperature, this layer of the atmosphere would still feel very cold to our skin because of the extremely thin air. The total amount of energy from the very few molecules in this layer is not enough to heat our skin. </span>Exosphere <span style="font-size: 7pt;">The Exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere. It extends from the top of the thermosphere to 6,200 miles (10,000 km) above the earth. In this layer, atoms and molecules escape into space and satellites orbit the earth. </span><br />

The reformers of the Cambodian revolution claimed to be building a better world. They forced people into reeducation programs to make them better citizens. Then they used force to regulate every aspect ofcommercial life. Then they forced office workers and intellectuals to give up their jobs and harvest rice, to round out their education. When people resisted having their lives turned upside down, the reformers had to use more and more force. By the time they were done, they had killed a third of the country’s population, destroyed the lives of almost everyone still alive, and devastated a nation. It all began with using force for the best of intentions—to create a better world. The Soviet leaders used coercion to provide economic security and to build a “New Man”—a human being who would put his fellow man ahead of himself. At least 10 million people died to help build the New Man and the Workers’ Paradise. But human nature never changed—and the workers’ lives were always Hell, not Paradise. In the 1930s many Germans gladly traded civil liberties for the economic revival and national pride Adolf Hitler promised them. But like every other grand dream to improve society by force, it ended in a nightmare of devastation and death. Professor R.J. Rummel has calculated that 119 million people have been killed by their own governments in this century. Were these people criminals? No, they were people who simply didn’t fit into the New Order—people who preferred their own dreams to those of the reformers. Every time you allow government to use force to make society better, you move another step closer to the nightmares of Cambodia, the Soviet Union, and Nazi Germany. We’ve already moved so far that our own government can perform with impunity the outrages described in the preceding chapters. These examples aren’t cases of government gone wrong; they are examples of government—period. They are what governments do—just as chasing cats is what dogs do. They are the natural consequence of letting government use force to bring about a drug-free nation, to tax someone else to better your life, to guarantee your economic security, to assure that no one can mistreat you or hurt your feelings, and to cover up the damage of all the failed government programs that came before.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">Trade Developments. Toward the end of Thursday night’s speech, President </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Obama told Congress, “Now it’s time to clear the way for a series of trade agreements that would make it easier for American companies to sell their products in</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Panama, Colombia, and </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">South Korea</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> – while also helping the workers whose jobs have been affected by global competition.” The President’s choice of words was telling in several ways. First and most generally, mentioning his support for the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with Panama, Colombia and South Korea relatively late in the speech, and not at all in the accompanying White House fact sheet on the American Jobs Act, reflects the delicate balance he must strike between advocating for bipartisan support for the FTAs and not abandoning the largely anti-trade elements of the Democratic base. </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">The President continued to walk that tightrope by stressing the benefits of the FTAs for “American companies</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">” </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">and</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">simultaneously</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">the continuing need to assist “the workers whose jobs have been affected by global competition</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">.” President </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Obama</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> also </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">signaled a key near-term method for helping those workers: for Congress “to clear the way” for the FTAs by passing the</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">bipartisan Trade Adjustment Assistance (</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">TAA) renewal</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> package. Despite the resounding applause from Congressional Republicans upon mention of the FTAs, and the nod to labor-oriented Democrats by discussing aid to workers displaced by trade, </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">the President’s speech only willgenerate bipartisan trust and momentum on the FTAs if his</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> public </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">advocacyefforts increase and high-level talks between the White House and the Republican Congressional Leadership accelerate</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. President Obama and Congressional Democrats need further assurances that the Republican-led House will pass TAA, as Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Ways and Means Committee Chair Dave Camp (R-MI) have indicated. In turn, </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Congressional Republicans need further assurances that the White House officially will submit the FTAs to Congress and that</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Senate Majority Leader Harry </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Reid</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (D-NV) </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">will smooth their consideration</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, despite his anti-FTA voting record. In that regard, the House took a key step toward TAA renewal (and, ultimately, FTA consideration) on Wednesday, passing renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) trade preference program for less-developed countries. The Senate is tentatively scheduled to attach TAA to the House GSP bill over the next several weeks and, after passing the combined package, return the legislation to the House. The question remains whether the Administration next would insist the House vote on TAA/GSP first or whether the White House instead would accept Speaker Boehner’s assurances and submit the FTAs to Congress first. Official submission would start accelerated Congressional consideration of the FTAs under the Trade Promotion Authority “fast-track” process and, likely, a series of House votes on the trade agreements and TAA/GSP, in some order yet to be negotiated. </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Clearly, additional Congressional-Executive trust-building, and corresponding procedural fine-tuning, lie ahead.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">Now that the two sides have reached a deal on the debt ceiling, </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">it’s critical that</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> the agreement hold and </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Congress move quickly to pass </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">the three agreements, and the Korea-US (</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">KORUS</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">) Free Trade Agreement in particular, as they are </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">directly linked to US strategic interests and future prosperity. </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">Because broader trade initiatives have been at a standstill over the last four years, </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">the KORUS FTA</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> has grown in significance. An agreement that originally would have provided the United States with an advantage in a key Asian market </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">is now essential for US producers just to maintain a level playing field with their competitors as Korea pursues </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">one of the most </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">aggressive trade liberalization </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">agendas of any country. As recently as 2003, the United States was Korea’s largest trading partner, but it has fallen to fourth in the Korean market. In less than a decade, the European Union, China, and Japan have all passed the United States in importance with South Korea. The EU’s lead on the US is likely to grow with the EU-Korea FTA now in effect, giving European producers a competitive edge over the United States in most of America’s top exports to Korea. Early results showed EU exports to Korea up by 45 percent over the first three weeks of July, and the United States losing ground in terms of its overall share of the Korean market. Perhaps more important, </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">the ability of the United States to pass the KORUS FTA has become a litmus test for US leadership on trade in the entire Asia-Pacific region</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. As Asia has grown in economic importance over the last decade, t</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">he US has found itself in a competition of ideas with China over how Asia should be ordered </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">in the 21st century. </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">If the US is unable to pass an FTA with a close ally such as</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> the Republic of </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Korea</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> – </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">one that most of the U</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">S</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">tates’ </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">competitors and partners consider to be in its interests – it will undermine US credibility on trade in the part of the world expected to lead global economic growth. The loss of US credibility would be detrimental to the</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Trans-Pacific Partnership (</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">TPP) talks.A U</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">S</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">that can’t resolve its own differences to pass </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">the </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">KORUS </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">FTA </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">would be seen by prospective partners as unable to follow through on its commitments, likely leaving the TPP talks stillborn </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">or with the United States on the outside looking in. </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">This would have a direct impact on US interests in Asia. The TPP is envisioned as a stepping stone to a</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> 21st-century </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">free trade area of the Asia-Pacific, and perhaps the US best tool in a contest with China</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> over the standards, rules, and norms of trade and investment in the region. </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">The consequence would likely be a trading system in Asia that excludes the United States to the detriment of America’s economic interests.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">While all eyes have been trained on North Korea's belligerent and aggressive actions in recent weeks, it is important to note that </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">the U.S.-South Korea alliance has emerged as a linchpin in the Obama administration's efforts to successfully manage an overcrowded global agenda, and a pivotal tool for safeguarding U.S. long-terminterests in Asia. </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;">When South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak meets with President Barack Obama at the White House Tuesday, the two leaders must effectively address three main areas: policy coordination to address North Korea's nuclear threat, the development of a global security agenda that extends beyond the peninsula, and collaboration to address the global financial crisis as South Korea takes a lead on the G-20 process. By conducting a second nuclear test in May, followed by a number of missile launches, North Korea has forced its way onto the Obama administration's agenda. First and foremost, </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">effective U.S.-South Korea alliance coordination is critical to managing both the global effects of North Korea's nuclear threat on the nonproliferation regime and the regional security challenges posed by potential regime actions that lead to further crisis in the region.</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> North Korea's internal focus on its leadership succession, and the apparent naming of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il's little-known and inexperienced youngest son as his successor, make the task of responding to North Korea's aggressive and destabilizing actions all the more challenging. </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Both deterrence and negotiation must be pursued on the basis of close consultations.</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Presidents Obama and Lee must also develop coordinated contingency plans in the event of internal instability in North Korea. </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Through effective U.S.-South Korea alliance coordination, it should be possible to forge a combined strategy capable of managing the nuclear, proliferation, and regional security dimensions of North Korea's threat.</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> A coordinated position would also strengthen the administration's hand in its efforts to persuade China to put pressure on North Korea. Both countries also face hostage crises involving citizens detained in North Korea. The recent conviction of two U.S. journalists heightens the stakes for the United States, although the administration has tried to decouple their plight from Pyongyang's missile tests. Second, Presidents Obama and Lee should set the stage for a reinvigorated vision of a broader role for the U.S.-South Korea alliance as an important component of a broader U.S. strategy toward East Asia. A critical aspect of this vision is a mutual commitment to jointly address sources of global and functional instability beyond the peninsula. Lee Myung-bak has offered a vision of a global Korea that features an expanded commitment to peacekeeping and development assistance that is in greater proportion to South Korea's economic clout as the world's 13th largest economy. As the third-largest contributor of troops to Iraq, South Korea has also demonstrated its capacity to make valuable contributions to post-conflict stabilization. </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">The U.S.-South Korea alliance can serve as a platform by which South Korea can make such contributions in many other areas, including Afghanistan.</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> South Korea has already made commitments to send engineers and medical personnel to Afghanistan. It is poised now to expand its contributions, in line with its broadening scope of interest in contributing to global stability and its economic prowess. Third, </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">South Korea is anessential partner in addressing the global financial crisis.</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Its emphasis on fighting protectionism and promotion of stimuli at the April G-20 leaders meeting in London illustrate how closely its priorities are aligned with those of the United States. A U.S. Federal Reserve Bank line of credit to South Korea last fall played a critical role in stabilizing the South Korean's currency and forestalled a possible repeat of South Korea's difficulties in the Asian financial crisis of a decade ago. The Obama and Lee administrations have the opportunity to send a powerful signal opposing protectionism by winning legislative support in both countries for the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement negotiated by their predecessors. With the necessary revisions to meet new political conditions, Mr. Lee and Mr. Obama should urge their respective legislatures to consider early ratification of the trade pact. This would both support more effective coordination on the global financial crisis and underscore its value as a precedent that sets high standards for trade agreements in Asia, in contrast to the proliferation of Asian trade agreements that do little to promote a more open Asian trade and investment environment. </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 12pt;">U.S.-South Korean coordination to manage North Korea's challenge to nonproliferation norms, the global financial crisis, and the transition in Afghanistan will underscore the practical value of alliance contributions to meet mutual interests in global security and prosperity.</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> For this reason, Presidents Obama and Lee have a compelling interest in establishing a firm foundation for unlocking the potential of alliance cooperation in the service of our shared interests. </span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The United States-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) is a critical step forward for American job creation and ensuring U.S. economic competitiveness in Asia. This trade agreement is also an important investment in the overall U.S.-South Korea alliance at a time when heightened tension on the Korean peninsula requires our solidarity with our allies in the south and it will be a strong manifestation of the U.S. commitment to remain a major presence in Asia. I urge Congress to work toward passage of KORUS as soon as possible. Sixty years ago, the United States stood with the Republic of Korea in countering aggression from the communist North. That bloody conflict, which cost the lives of more than 35,000 Americans, has yet to result in a permanent peace. North Korea continues to challenge the world through its nuclear weapons programs and its recent attacks on the South have reminded us of the military threat and raised deep concerns in Northeast Asia. The Korean Peninsula remains a dangerous place. However, there has been a spectacular success story amidst ongoing tensions. South Korea has risen to become the world's 14th largest economy, a vibrant democracy, and a valued ally for the United States in a critical region. It is currently America's 7th largest trading partner and 7th largest export market. The economic arguments for KORUS are compelling. The most economically significant trade agreement (FTA) negotiated by the United States in over 15 years, KORUS would boost U.S. goods exports by up to $11 billion dollars and U.S. GDP by nearly $12 billion, according to the independent, nonpartisan U.S. International Trade Commission. The agreement would create as many as 70,000 new jobs for Americans at a time when we most need them. It is important to bear in mind that KORUS offers an opportunity to level the playing field with a trading partner whose market has historically been less open than ours. Currently, Korea's average duty on industrial and consumer goods is more than double that of the U.S., and its average duty on agriculture is more than four times that of the U.S. Looking at these differences, it is clear that the U.S. will be in a better position across the board to benefit from the market opening that will flow from KORUS. Ninety-five percent of bilateral trade in industrial and consumer products will become duty free in three years and nearly two-thirds of U.S. agricultural exports--everything from feed corn, to frozen French fries, to fine wines--will enter Korea duty-free as soon as KORUS comes into effect. In addition, KORUS will establish a fair and transparent legal framework for U.S. investors in Korea, and benefit U.S. exporters in telecommunications, financial, pharmaceutical, and other sectors where U.S. companies are on the cutting edge. Koreans see KORUS as a means to make its economy more open, and that is very much in the U.S. interest. More broadly, moving ahead with KORUS will be a concrete demonstration that the United States is prepared to lead on trade in Asia, a signal that all of our partners in the region want to see. We cannot afford to wait on the sidelines while the region pursues agreements that leave us out. The economies of Asia are in the process of integration and are now trading more with each other than they are with the United States. Bilateral and regional free trade agreements are proliferating, and the ROK is in the vanguard. Less than a decade ago, the United States was by far South Korea's leading trading partner. Now, we are competing with the European Union for third place, after China and Japan. With South Korea set to implement an FTA with the European Union in July, we can expect to fall to fourth place, and American farmers, manufacturers, and service providers will be the losers. KORUS will give us special access to the Korean market, enhancing our ability to compete with China, Japan and India, and Europe, even as it strengthens Korea's ties to the U.S. KORUS may also provoke wider liberalization. Approval of KORUS will lend impetus to the effort to develop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And Asia's third largest economy, Japan, may feel compelled to seek a similar agreement. This, too, would be great for America, provided Japan agrees to open its markets to the same degree Korea will under KORUS. But the economic benefits of KORUS are just part of the equation. Strategic interests are also overwhelming at a time when the U.S. is dealing with a host of new security threats, including North Korea's nuclear weapons program, this free trade agreement will strengthen our strategic partnership with an important Asian ally that shares our belief in democracy and has stepped up to the plate with significant military and economic support in the Middle East and Afghanistan. While creating new American jobs, KORUS will reinforce the full partnership we have with South Korea at a time when that country is playing a growing international role. Furthermore, KORUS will have positive strategic effects that will resonate beyond the Korean peninsula. One of South Korea's primary goals in seeking the Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. is to broaden and strengthen its relationship with its ally at a time when China's rapid rise has provoked significant changes in power relationships in Asia. We strongly share the Republic of Korea's interest in solidifying and broadening this critical alliance. A failure to approve KORUS would be exactly the wrong signal to North Korea and to our allies and friends in Asia who want us to remain strongly engaged. The agreement with South Korea will stand as a new anchor for our longstanding leadership position in a rapidly changing Asia. For more than fifty years, the United States' political and economic commitment to Asia has contributed to the region's stability and prosperity. Nowhere has our engagement been more positive than with the Republic of Korea, which, with our help, rose from the ruins of the Korean War to become a vibrant democracy and one of the largest economies in the world. Americans and South Koreans shared blood together to prevent a communist takeover of the entire Peninsula 60 years ago. We still stand together in facing the many challenges from the North. Republic of Korea Forces stood with us when we needed them in Vietnam and continue to support our common interests in today's military conflicts. The FTA with Korea will strengthen America's relationship with a long-time ally and enhance our presence and influence in the region. I am convinced that America, for its own sake, must remain a leader in Asia. Ratification of this agreement is one way of ensuring that our engagement with the world's fastest growing region will support our fundamental security and economic interests into the future.</span><br />

T<span style="text-decoration: none;">he Korean FTA also is part of East Asia's greater economic game. A rising China is bumping up against a still dominant America. Strengthening trade ties is one way for Washington to ensure continued American influence in East Asia.</span> Especially since East Asian countries have increasingly turned, with or without the U.S., to bilateral economic agreements to promote trade. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Despite the Wall Street crash, the U.S. retains the world's largest and most productive economy. However, the PRC now possesses the second largest economy. Moreover, China's rapid economic growth has naturally led to expanded Chinese investment and trade throughout East Asia</span>. China's top trading partner is the U.S., but the former's second through fifth largest are Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan. Australia, Malaysia, and Singapore fall in at numbers seven, nine, and ten. Between 2007 and 2008, all of these countries except Singapore saw its trade with the People's Republic of China increase faster than its trade with America. China's increasing economic growth is leading to increasing Chinese domination of East Asian economies. American companies have been pushed into second and even third place, most notably in South Korea and Japan. As recently as 2003, the U.S. was number one in the former. <span style="text-decoration: none;">At the same time, the PRC is asserting itself politically throughout Asia, including in the ROK. China has linked its growing economic power with strong diplomatic initiatives throughout Asia</span>. In June Beijing finalized the economic framework cooperation agreement with Taiwan, and is pressing for FTAs with Australia and Japan. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Most important, the PRC and South Korea have discussed the possibility of a FTA. There are significant barriers to agreements between Beijing and all of these nations. But the fact the PRC is pursuing this strategy — and that America's three leading military allies in the region view FTAs with China as a serious possibility — illustrate the challenge now facing Washington.</span><br />

O<span style="text-decoration: none;">bviously, it is of vital importance to the United States that the PRC does not become the hegemon of Eastern Eurasia. </span>As noted above, however, regardless of what Washington does, China’s success in such an endeavor is not as easily attainable as pessimists might assume. The PRC appears to be on track to be a very great power indeed, but geopolitical conditions are not favorable for any Chinese effort to establish sole hegemony; a robust multipolar system should sufﬁce to keep China in check, even with only minimal American intervention in local squabbles. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The more worrisome danger is that Beijing will cooperate with a great power partner, establishing a very muscular axis. Such an entity would present a critical danger to the balance of power, thus both necessitating very active American intervention in Eastern Eurasia and creating the underlying conditions for a massive, and probably nuclear, great power war. </span>Absent such a “super-threat,” however, the demands on American leaders will be far more subtle: creating the conditions for Washington’s gentle decline from playing the role of unipolar quasi-hegemon to being “merely” the greatest of the world’s powers, while aiding in the creation of a healthy multipolar system that is not marked by close great power alliances.<br />

 <strong>The plan forces Obama to spend political capital</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Whittington, 9/7</span></strong> (Mark R., author, he has written on space subjects for a variety of periodicals, including The Houston Chronicle, The Washington Post, USA Today, the L.A. Times, and The Weekly Standard, 9/7/2011, “Obama Administration Thinks $62 Billion for Space Exploration is Too Expensive,” <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thenewsworld.info/obama-administration-thinks-62-billion-for-space-exploration-is-too-expensive-contributornetwork.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenewsworld.info/obama-administration-thinks-62-billion-for-space-exploration-is-too-expensive-contributornetwork.html</a></span>)<br />
<br />
A Wall Street Journal article entitled “White House Experiences Sticker Shock Over <span style="text-decoration: none;">NASA</span>’s Plans” <span style="text-decoration: none;">has observers of the space program abuzz for its conclusion that</span> NASA’s <span style="text-decoration: none;">current space exploration</span> program would <span style="text-decoration: none;">cost</span> about <span style="text-decoration: none;">$62 billion through 2025</span>.<br />
Included in the cost is apparently not only the Space Launch System, the much discussed, much argued about heavy lift launch vehicle, but also the Orion Multi Purpose Crew Vehicle and some kind of vehicle to either land astronauts on the moon or send them to an asteroid. The article suggests <span style="text-decoration: none;">White House and OMB officials are experiencing “sticker shock” over the numbers.</span><br />
The number is somewhat less that the Augustine Committee suggested a space exploration program would cost through the first mission, about $98 billion. Averaged out over 14 years, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the cost</span> quoted in the Wall Street Journal article <span style="text-decoration: none;">comes out to $4.4 billion a year</span>. Even considering that the figure is just an average, with peak funding likely being more, the number quoted does not sound all that bad, under ordinary circumstances.<br />
These are not, of course, ordinary circumstances. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The</span> organization calling itself “<span style="text-decoration: none;">Tea Party in Space” has issued an instant communique condemning</span> the SLS, <span style="text-decoration: none;">NASA’s plans for space exploration, and Un</span>ited <span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span>tates <span style="text-decoration: none;">Senators who support it.</span><br />
“<span style="text-decoration: none;">There is nothing fiscally responsible, limited in government, or accessing the free markets about this program</span>. These senators are destroying NASA for their own personal greed. There are so many alternatives to SLS and yet these senators are blinded by power. To these senators, NASA is not Humanity’s space program but their own personal slush funds that have been flowing freely for over 40 years.<br />
“TPIS has reached out to our Tea Party Caucus members on Capitol Hill. We do not want to kill NASA, we want to save NASA. The fiscal reality is that <span style="text-decoration: none;">if we allow these senators to continue down this path, we will not have American human space flight … at all</span>.”<br />
The TPIS has not given any details about the “alternatives to SLS” and why they would be cheaper and safer than the current plan.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: none;">While people and organizations such as the Tea Party In Space who</span> seem <span style="text-decoration: none;">oppose</span>d to <span style="text-decoration: none;">space exploration beyond Earth orbit are using purple prose to defend their position, they</span> are in line with the zeitgeist of the time, which <span style="text-decoration: none;">strongly oppose</span>s <span style="text-decoration: none;">new spending programs in an era of huge budget deficits</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Absent a president who is willing to place his influence and political capital at the service of jump-starting a program to explore space beyond low Earth orbit, it is not likely that such an undertaking will get off the ground</span>.<br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">NASA supporters are bracing for an uphill battle to get</span> the extra <span style="text-decoration: none;">funding </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; text-decoration: none;">needed </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">to take on missions more ambitious than visits to the i</span>nternational <span style="text-decoration: none;">s</span>pace <span style="text-decoration: none;">s</span>tation. A high-level panel told President Barack Obama last week that the space program needs an infusion of about $3 billion more a year by 2014. That may be a tough sell, even though the amount could be considered spare change in a fast-spending capital where the White House and <span style="text-decoration: none;">Congress are on track to dole out nearly $4 trillion</span> this year <span style="text-decoration: none;">to finance federal operations,</span> including bailouts for Wall Street firms, banks and automakers. <span style="text-decoration: none;">“The congressional agenda over the next year is going to be focused on cutting programs, not adding</span> to <span style="text-decoration: none;">them</span>,” said Scott Lilly, a scholar at the Center for American Progress. Adding resources to the nation's $18.7 billion-a-year space program would require cuts in other areas, said Lilly, who doesn't think lawmakers are willing to make those trades. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Rep. </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; text-decoration: none;">Pete </span>Olson<span style="font-size: 14.6667px; text-decoration: none;">, </span>R-Sugar <span style="text-decoration: none;">Land, the ranking Republican on the House </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; text-decoration: none;">subcommittee </span>that has jurisdiction over NASA<span style="font-size: 14.6667px; text-decoration: none;">, </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">said wrangling the additional $3 billion a year would be “an enormous challenge</span>— but one I am prepared to win.” Added Olson, whose district includes Johnson Space Center: “NASA doesn't require bailout funds — it needs the promised level of investment that previous Congresses have endorsed.” The 10-member panel of space experts led by retired aerospace executive Norman Augustine suggested extending U.S. participation in the $100 billion space station for five years, extending budgeting for the retiring shuttle fleet by six months, delaying plans for a 2020 return to the moon and extending the timeline for the next generation of manned spacecraft by two years at least until 2017. But the experts warned in their 12-page preliminary report to Obama on Tuesday that “meaningful human exploration” would be possible only under “a less constrained budget ramping (up) to approximately $3 billion per year” in additional spending by 2014. Former astronaut Sally Ride, a member of the committee, forecast $27. 1 billion in additional funds would be needed over the next decade — a 27 percent increase over the $99.1 billion currently planned. Even before Obama publicly reacts to Augustine's report to map the next steps in the nation's manned space exploration, members of Congress are scrambling. <span style="text-decoration: none;">“The immediate challenge goes beyond money to just getting NASA on the radar screen when everyone is focused on health care reform,”</span> said a key congressional staffer involved in NASA issues. <em>Finding support</em> NASA supporters initially are targeting the Democratic leadership of appropriations subcommittees in the House and Senate with jurisdiction over NASA. Space advocates have an ally in Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., chair woman of the Senate Appropriations Committee panel that handles space agency spending. But in the House<span style="text-decoration: none;">, pro-NASA lawmakers expect a fight with Rep. Alan Mollohan, D-W.Va., chair man of the House Appropriations Committee panel that cut next year's NASA spending nearly $500 million below what Obama requested</span>. Lawmakers are looking for a House-Senate conference committee to restore the funds that Mollohan cut before the Augustine panel completed its work. Aides to Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., chairman of a Senate subcommittee that oversees NASA, said they have already identified six potential sources of additional NASA funding within the federal budget, including some of the $8 billion promised over the next decade to private energy firms to research fossil fuels and deep drilling for oil and gas. Lawmakers also are exploring the possibility of redirecting some of the two-year, $787 billion economic stimulus package from shovel-ready transportation construction projects and other federally subsidized programs into the NASA budget. The administration so far has only paid out $160 billion of the total, according to Vice President Joe Biden. “A lot of stimulus money has not been spent,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-San Antonio. “We should redirect some of those stimulus funds to pay for enhancements to the NASA budget because I believe human space flight is so important.” Aerospace executives and veteran space experts are hoping for reliable year-to-year funding. “<span style="text-decoration: none;">These are challenging economic times,</span> but this is not the moment to turn away from leading a global space exploration effort,” said Dean Acosta, head of the Houston-based Coalition for Space Exploration. <em>President's</em> <span style="text-decoration: none;">influence Presidential leadership will be essential to gaining an increase</span>, emphasized John Logsdon, a space policy expert who served on the Shuttle Columbia Accident Investigation Board. <span style="text-decoration: none;">“The president has to use some portion of his political capital to put forward an Obama space program.”</span><br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: none;">The US space program remained focused</span>, not on duplicating Apollo, but <span style="text-decoration: none;">on achieving another difficult goal such as going to Mars</span>, a logical extension truly of the Apollo effort. Twice, the presidents Bush provided the presidential rationale, if not support, for achieving great things. The Space Exploration Initiative (<span style="text-decoration: none;">SEI</span>) in 1989 <span style="text-decoration: none;">and</span> the Vision for Space Exploration (<span style="text-decoration: none;">VSE</span>) in 2004 <span style="text-decoration: none;">were announced with great fanfare but neither survived the realities of congressional and presidential budgeting. The VSE appeared on paper more realistic about funding, but its choices were draconian: the ISS and space shuttle were both to be sacrificed on the altar of the new program.</span> The earlier SEI died quickly, so hard choices were not required, while the VSE in the form of <span style="text-decoration: none;">the Constellation Program lingers on although its effective demise appears certain</span>. The <span style="text-decoration: none;">Obama</span> Administration <span style="text-decoration: none;">prefers another approach while the new Congress is likely more hostile to big ticket discretionary spending. If the Tea Party faction in the Republican House caucus means what it says, the future for Constellation or any other similar program is a dim one.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: none;">The reality is that</span> the Apollo program, the SEI, and <span style="text-decoration: none;">the VSE are examples in space terms of the home run approach</span>. Such efforts confront the cruel but obvious reality that the <span style="text-decoration: none;">human spaceflight program is considered by the public and most of Congress to be a “nice to have,” but not a necessity when compared to other programs or national priorities. Congressional support is narrow and constituency-driven</span> (i.e. protect local jobs), <span style="text-decoration: none;">which means most in Congress only support the space program in the abstract. Big ticket items or programs are not a priority for most</span>, given other priorities. <span style="text-decoration: none;">What happens is what can be loosely termed normal politics: a situation where human spaceflight remains a low priority on the national agenda. Funding for bold new initiatives is going to be hard to come by even when the economy recovers and deficits are under control</span>. The home run approach has run its course at least for a time; <span style="text-decoration: none;">now the small ball approach becomes your mantra.</span><br />

If we are to clean up space, it will certainly be complex and very expensive. If we continue, as we have, to use these very popular orbits in near-Earth space, the density of debris and collision events will surely increase,&quot; Kaplan told SPACE.com. The good news is that no immediate action is necessary in terms of removing debris objects, Kaplan advised, as experts estimate that the situation will not go unstable anytime soon. &quot;But, when it does, operational satellites will be destroyed at an alarming rate, and they cannot be replaced. We must prepare for this seemingly inevitable event,&quot; Kaplan said. While there are many options for debris removal that have been proposed, he feels that none are sensible. &quot;Barring the discovery of a disruptive technology within the next decade or so, there will be no practical removal solution,&quot; Kaplan added. &quot;We simply lack the technology to economically clean up space.&quot; [</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Lasers Could Zap Space Junk Clear From Satellites</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">] For Kaplan, the issue of dealing with orbital debris will become dire. &quot;The proliferation is irreversible. Any cleanup would be too expensive. Given this insight, it is unlikely spacefaring nations are going to do anything significant about cleaning up space,&quot; Kaplan said. &quot;The fact is that we really can't do anything. We can't afford it. We don't have the technology. We don't have the cooperation. Nobody wants to pay for it. Space debris cleanup is a 'growth industry,' but there are no customers.

Garver, former Associate Administrator for Policy and Plans, NASA; and Marc Kaufman, Reporter, The Washington Post <span style="text-decoration: none;">America must continue with its scientific exploration of outer space, though the costs</span> of building a space station on the Moon as a launch pad for sending astronauts to Mars and beyond—-estimated by some at over $400 billion--<span style="text-decoration: none;">may be too much for Congress and the public to swallow. That was the consensus of a panel of experts at the Congress Project Seminar on Congress and America’s Future in Space. Professor</span> Howard E. <span style="text-decoration: none;">McCurdy of American University traced the history of America’s space program while exploding “the myth of presidential leadership in space.” According to that myth, says McCurdy, all the President has to do is move his lips and say the words, and it will be done. But that ignores both the independence of Congress and the ways of the NASA bureaucracy. Congress sometimes says “no” and sometimes, “go slow.” While Congress did largely defer to the President during the 1960s</span> when John F. Kennedy called for putting a man on the moon within the decade, <span style="text-decoration: none;">that began to change with the next stages of our space program. When</span> President George W. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Bush announced in 2004 his “Vision for Space Exploration,”</span> which included building a Moon station for manned flights to Mars, <span style="text-decoration: none;">he was recycling an idea that’s been kicked around for the last 50 years, says McCurdy. In fact, in 1989 Bush’s father called for the exact same thing, calling it the “Space Exploration Initiative.” But it died a natural death in Congress.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">It’s time to worry, says a new report from the National Research Council. The amount of debris floating in orbit around Earth has been growing exponentially and may have already reached a “tipping point.” </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">What kind of tipping point? Well, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">in 1978 a NASA scientist named Donald Kessler predicted that, as the amount of space debris grows, it could eventually become dense enough to touch off a “collision cascade.” In that scenario, each collision would generate new debris, causing more debris-generating collisions, untillow Earth orbit becomes hopelessly clogged and unusable by spacecraft or even satellites.We’re not there yet, but we could be on our way</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, the Washington Post reports. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">A pair of recent collisions has doubled the number of fragments since 2007. There are now an estimated 22,000 hunks of debris large enough for NASA to track individually, and there could be hundreds of thousands or millions more bits that we can’t see.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> From the Post: </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Active satellites are at risk of damage and “as the amount of debris increases, there will beincreases in the cost of operating</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">” satellites, said Brian Weeden, a technical adviser with the Secure World Foundation, which focuses on space sustainability. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Manned spacecraft are also in danger. The international space station had a close call in late June, when an unidentified object came within 1,100 feet</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> but caused no damage; astronauts were preemptively evacuated to emergency spacecraft.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Estimates </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">of the future levels of risk are even more speculative than estimates of current risk levels, but most </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">show an alarming trend of increasing debris. A </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">January 2006</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">NASA study </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">estimates the amount of debris ten centimeters and larger in LEO will triple within 200 years, increasing the likelihood of debris collisions by a factor of ten. n126 The greatest concentration of orbital debris will be located in the regions 800-900 kilometers and 1400-1500 kilometers in altitude. n127 The study acknowledges it </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">seriously underestimates the future risk</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">because it assumes no further launches into space. n128 For each of the past five years, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">launch providers have sent an average of sixty-one rockets into orbit each year. n</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">129 Considering that </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">each of these launches produces multiple pieces of debris in addition to one or more payloads,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> the future risk in the NASA study is understated. The cascade effect is the greatest fear of those who study the problem of orbital debris. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">If the cascade effect begins, orbital debris would collide with other space objects, which in turn would create new debris that would cause even more collisions.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> In this way, orbital </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">debris would become self-generating and could make certain regions of space completely unusable, even without new satellites</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> [*19] being placed in those areas. n130 International efforts aimed at mitigating the creation of new debris have helped, n131 but will not alone solve the problem.

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">This is the second of two scenarios that consider how U.S. space weapons might create incentives for America’s opponents to behave in dangerous ways. The previous scenario looked at the systemic risk of accidents that could arise from keeping nuclear weapons on high alert to guard against a space weapons attack. This section focuses on the risk that a single accident in space, such </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">as a piece of space debris striking a Russian early-warning satellite, might be the catalyst for an accidental nuclear war. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">As we have noted in an earlier section, the United States canceled its own ASAT program in the 1980s over concerns that the deployment of these weapons might be deeply destabiliz- ing. For all the talk about a “new relationship” between the United States and Russia</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">, both sides retain thousands of nuclear forces on alert and conﬁgured to ﬁght a nuclear war.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> When briefed about the size and status of U.S. nuclear forces, President George W. Bush reportedly asked “What do we need all these weapons for?”43 The answer, as it was during the Cold War, is that the forces remain on alert to conduct a number of possible contingencies, including a nuclear strike against Russia. This fact, of course, is not lost on the Rus- sian leadership, which has been increasing its reliance on nuclear weapons to compensate for the country’s declining military might. In the mid-1990s, Russia dropped its pledge to refrain from the “ﬁrst use” of nuclear weapons and conducted a series of exercises in which Russian nuclear forces prepared to use nuclear weapons to repel a NATO invasion. In October 2003, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov reiter- ated that Moscow might use nuclear weapons “preemptively” in any number of contingencies, including a NATO attack.44 So, it remains business as usual with U.S. and Russian nuclear forces. And business as usual includes the occasional false alarm of a nuclear attack. There have been several of these incidents over the years. In September 1983, as a relatively new Soviet early-warning satellite moved into position to monitor U.S. missile ﬁelds in North Dakota, the sun lined up in just such a way as to fool the Russian satellite into reporting that half a dozen U.S. missiles had been launched at the Soviet Union. Perhaps mindful that a brand new satel- lite might malfunction, the ofﬁcer in charge of the command center that monitored data from the early-warning satellites refused to pass the alert to his superiors. He reportedly explained his caution by saying: “When people start a war, they don’t start it with only ﬁve missiles. You can do little damage with just ﬁve missiles.”</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">45 In January 1995, Norwegian scientists launched a sounding rocket on a trajectory similar to one that a U.S. Trident missile might take</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> if it were launched to blind Russian radars with a high altitude nuclear detonation. The incident was apparently serious enough that, the next day, Russian President Boris </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Yeltsin stated that he had activated his “nuclear football”</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> – a device that allows the Russian president to communicate with his military advisors and review his options for launching his arsenal. In this case, the Russian early-warning satellites could clearly see that no attack was under way and the crisis passed without incident.46 In both cases, Russian observers were conﬁ-dent that what appeared to be a “small” attack was not a fragmentary picture of a much larger one. In the case of the Norwegian sounding rocket,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> space-based sensors played a crucial role in assuring the Russian leadership that it was not under attack.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> The Russian command sys-tem, however, is no longer able to provide such reliable, early warning. The dissolution of the Soviet Union cost Moscow several radar stations in newly independent states, creating “attack cor-ridors” through which Moscow could not see an attack launched by U.S. nuclear submarines.47 Further, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Russia’s constellation of early-warn-ing satellites has been allowed to decline</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> – only one or two of the six satellites remain operational, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">leaving Russia with early warning for only six hours a day.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Russia is attempting to reconstitute its constellation of early-warning satellites, with several launches planned in the next few years. But </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Russia will still have limited warning and will depend heavily on its space-based systems to provide warning of an American attack.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">48 As the previous section explained, the Penta- gon is contemplating military missions in space that will improve U.S. ability to cripple Russian nuclear forces in a crisis before they can execute an attack on the United States. Anti-satellite weapons, in this scenario, would blind Russian reconnaissance and warning satellites and knock out communications satellites. Such strikes might be the prelude to a full-scale attack, or a limited ef- fort, as attempted in a war game at Schriever Air Force Base, to conduct “early deterrence strikes” to signal U.S. resolve and control escalation.49 By 2010, the United States may, in fact, have an arsenal of ASATs (perhaps even on orbit 24/7) ready to conduct these kinds of missions – to coerce opponents and, if necessary, support preemptive attacks. Moscow would certainly have to worry that these ASATs could be used in conjunction with other space-enabled systems – for example, long-range strike systems that could attack targets in less than 90 minutes – to disable Russia’s nuclear deterrent before the Rus- sian leadership understood what was going on. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">What would happen if a piece of space debris were to disable a Russian early-warning satel-lite</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> under these conditions? Could the Russian military distinguish between an accident in space and the ﬁrst phase of a U.S. attack? Most Russian early-warning satellites are in elliptical Molniya orbits (a few are in GEO) and thus difﬁcult to attack from the ground or air. At a minimum, Moscow would probably have some tactical warn-ing of such a suspicious launch, but given the sorry state of Russia’s warning, optical imaging and signals intelligence satellites there is reason to ask the question. Further, the advent of U.S. on-orbit ASATs, as now envisioned50 could make both the more difﬁcult orbital plane and any warning systems moot. The unpleasant truth is that the </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Russians likely would have to make a judgment call. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">No state has the ability to deﬁnitively deter-mine the cause of the satellite’s failure</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">. Even the United States does not maintain </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">(nor is it likely to have in place by 2010) </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">a sophisticated space surveillance system that would allow it to distin- guish between a satellite malfunction, a debris strike or a deliberate attack – and Russian space surveillance capabilities are much more limited by comparison.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Even the risk assessments for col-lision with debris are speculative, particularly for the unique orbits in which Russian early-warning satellites operate. During peacetime, it is easy to imagine that the Russians would conclude that the loss of a satellite was either a malfunction or a debris strike. But how conﬁdent could U.S. planners be that the Russians would be so calm if the accident in space occurred in tandem with a second false alarm, or occurred during the middle of a crisis? What might happen if the debris strike oc-curred shortly after a false alarm showing a mis-sile launch? False alarms are appallingly common – according to information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) experienced 1,172 “moderately seri-ous” false alarms between 1977 and 1983 – an average of almost three false alarms per week. Comparable information is not available about the Russian system, but there is no reason to believe that it is any more reliable.51 Assessing the likelihood of these sorts of co- incidences is difﬁcult because Russia has never provided data about the frequency or duration of false alarms; nor indicated how seriously early- warning data is taken by Russian leaders. More- over, there is no reliable estimate of the debris risk for Russian satellites in highly elliptical orbits.52 The important point, however, is that such a coincidence would only appear suspicious if the United States were in the business of disabling satellites – in other words, there is much less risk if Washington does not develop ASATs. The loss of an early-warning satellite could look rather ominous if it occurred during a pe- riod of major tension in the relationship. While NATO no longer sees Russia as much of a threat, the same cannot be said of the converse. Despite the warm talk, Russian leaders remain wary of NATO expansion, particularly the effect expan- sion may have on the Baltic port of Kaliningrad. Although part of Russia, Kaliningrad is separated from the rest of Russia by Lithuania and Poland. Russia has already complained about its decreas- ing lack of access to the port, particularly the uncooperative attitude of the Lithuanian govern- ment.53 News reports suggest that an edgy Russia may have moved tactical nuclear weapons into the enclave.54 If the Lithuanian government were to close access to Kaliningrad in a ﬁt of pique, this would trigger a major crisis between NATO and Russia. Under these circumstances</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">, the loss of an early-warning satellite would be extremely suspi-cious. It is any military’s nature during a crisis to interpret events in their worst-case light.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> For ex- ample, consider the coincidences that occurred in early September 1956, during the extraordinarily tense period in international relations marked by the Suez Crisis and Hungarian uprising.55 On one evening the White House received messages indicating: 1. the Turkish Air Force had gone on alert in response to unidentiﬁed aircraft penetrat- ing its airspace; 2. one hundred Soviet MiG-15s were ﬂying over Syria; 3. a British Canberra bomber had been shot down over Syria, most likely by a MiG; and 4. The Russian ﬂeet was moving through the Dardanelles. Gen. Andrew Goodpaster was reported to have worried that the conﬂuence of events “might trigger off … the NATO operations plan” that called for a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union. Yet, all of these reports were false. The “jets” over Turkey were a ﬂock of swans; the Soviet MiGs over Syria were a smaller, routine escort returning the president from a state visit to Mos- cow; the bomber crashed due to mechanical difﬁculties; and the Soviet ﬂeet was beginning long-scheduled exercises. In an important sense, these were not “coincidences” but rather different manifestations of a common failure – human er- ror resulting from extreme tension of an interna- tional crisis. As one author noted, “The detection and misinterpretation of these events, against the context of world tensions from Hungary and Suez, was the ﬁrst major example of how the size and complexity of worldwide electronic warning systems could, at certain critical times, create momentum of its own.” Perhaps most worrisome, the United States might be blithely unaware of the degree to which the Russians were concerned about its actions and inadvertently escalate a crisis. During the early 1980s, the Soviet Union suffered a major “war scare” during which time its leadership concluded that bilateral relations were rapidly declining. This war scare was driven in part by the rhetoric of the Reagan administration, fortiﬁed by the selective reading of intelligence. During this period, NATO conducted a major command post exercise, Able Archer, that caused some elements of the Soviet military to raise their alert status. American ofﬁcials were stunned to learn, after the fact, that the Kremlin had been acutely nervous about an American ﬁrst strike during this period.56 All of these incidents have a common theme – that </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">conﬁdence is often the difference between war and peace. In times of crisis, false alarms can have a momentum oftheir own</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. As in the second scenario in this monograph, the lesson is that </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">commanders rely on the steady ﬂow of reli-able information. When that information ﬂow is disrupted – whether by a deliberate attack or an accident – conﬁdence collapses and the re- sult is panic and escalation. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Introducing ASAT weapons into this mix is all the more dangerous, because such weapons target the elements of the command system that keep leaders aware, informed and in control. As a result, the mere presence of such weapons is corrosive to the conﬁdence that allows national nuclear forces to operate safely. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Although international relations have changed drastically since the end of the Cold War,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> both </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Russia and the U.S. continue to keep the bulk of their nuclear missiles on high-level alert.

(Dr. Louiza,Against Ethics? Iconographies of Enmity and Acts of Obligation in Carl Schmitt’s <em>Theory of the Partisan</em>,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.louizaodysseos.org.uk/resources/Odysseos+ISA+2008+Against+Ethics.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.louizaodysseos.org.uk/resources/Odysseos+ISA+2008+Against+Ethics.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Most importantly, and related to this concern, there is the relation of the concept of humanity to ‘the other’, and to war and violence. In its historical location, the humanity concept had critical purchase against aristocratic prerogatives; yet its utilisation by <span class="BoldUnderline">liberal ethical discourses within a philosophy of an ‘absolute humanity’,</span> Schmitt feared, <span class="BoldUnderline">could bring about new and unimaginable modes of exclusion</span> (1996a, 2003, 2004/2007):<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">By virtue of its universality</span> and abstract normativity, <span class="BoldUnderline">it has no</span> localizable polis, no <span class="BoldUnderline">clear distinction between what is inside and what is outside. </span>Does humanity embrace all humans? Are there no gates to the city and thus no barbarians outside? If not, against whom or what does it wage its wars? (Rasch 2003: 135).<br />
‘Humanity as such’, Schmitt noted, ‘cannot wage war because it has no enemy’, (1996a: 54), indicating that humanity ‘is a polemical word that negates its opposite’ (Kennedy 1998: 94; emphasis added). In The Concept of the Political Schmitt argued that humanity ‘excludes the concept of the enemy, because the enemy does not cease to be a human being’ (1996a: 54). However, in his 1950 book with an international focus, The Nomos of the Earth, Schmitt noted how <span class="BoldUnderline">only when ‘man appeared to be the embodiment of absolute humanity, did the other side</span> of this concept <span class="BoldUnderline">appear in the form of a new enemy: the inhuman’</span> (2003a: 104). It becomes apparent that, historically examined, <span class="BoldUnderline">the concept of humanity engenders a return to a ‘discriminatory concept of war’,</span> by which Schmitt meant that <span class="BoldUnderline">it reintroduces the legitimacy and need for substantive causes of justice in war</span> (Schmitt 2003b: 37-52). This in turn disallows the notion of <em>justus hostis</em>, of a ‘just enemy’ – explored in section three – associated with the notion of non-discriminatory interstate war which took the shape of <em>guerre en forme</em> (Schmitt 2003a: 142-144). <span class="BoldUnderline">The concept of humanity</span>, therefore, <span class="BoldUnderline">shatters</span> the formal concept of <span class="BoldUnderline">justus hostis, allowing the enemy to</span> now <span class="BoldUnderline">be designated</span> substantively <span class="BoldUnderline">as an enemy of humanity</span> as such. <span class="BoldUnderline">This leaves the enemy</span> of humanity <span class="BoldUnderline">with no value and open to dehumanisation</span> and political <span class="BoldUnderline">and</span> physical <span class="BoldUnderline">annihilation</span> (Schmitt 2004: 67). In discussing the League of Nations, Schmitt highlights that, compared to the kinds of wars that can be waged on behalf of humanity, the interstate European wars from 1815 to 1914 in reality were regulated; they were bracketed by the neutral Great Powers and were completely legal procedures in comparison with the modern and gratuitous police actions against violators of peace, which can be dreadful acts of annihilation (Schmitt 2003a: 186).<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">Enemies of humanity cannot be considered ‘just and equal’. Moreover, they cannot claim neutrality</span>: one cannot remain neutral in the call to be for or against humanity or its freedom; <span class="BoldUnderline">one cannot</span>, similarly, claim a right to resist or <span class="BoldUnderline">defend oneself</span>, in the sense we understand this right to have existed in the international law of Europe (the <em>jus publicum Europeaum</em>). <span class="BoldUnderline">Such a denial of self-defence and resistance ‘can presage a dreadful nihilistic destruction of all law’</span> (ibid.: 187). When the enemy is not accorded a procedural justice and formal equality, <span class="BoldUnderline">the notion that peace can be made</span> with him <span class="BoldUnderline">is unacceptable</span>, as Schmitt detailed through his study of the League of Nations, which had declared the abolition of war, but in rescinding the concept of neutrality only succeeded in the ‘dissolution of “peace”’ (ibid.: 246). <span class="BoldUnderline">It is with the dissolution of peace that total wars of annihilation become possible</span>, <span class="BoldUnderline">where ‘the other’ cannot be assimilated, or accommodated, let alone tolerated</span>: the friend/enemy distinction is not longer taking place with a <em>justus hostis</em> but rather between good and evil, human and inhuman, where ‘<span class="BoldUnderline">the negative pole</span> of the distinction <span class="BoldUnderline">is to be fully and finally consumed without remainder’</span> (Rasch 2003: 137).<br />

<br />
Such critiques, however, do not negate that there exists ‘an urgent <em>plea</em> for<span class="BoldUnderline"> a </span>universal morality’ (Nielsen 1966: 545; cf. Cochran 1999: 206; Booth 1999: 53). Put otherwise, these <span class="BoldUnderline">objections</span> and critiques <span class="BoldUnderline">do not</span> actually <span class="BoldUnderline">articulate the <em>impossibility</em> of an ethics. </span>They are not tantamount to a denial of its need or possibility but <span class="BoldUnderline">variably </span>suggest other, better, paths to ethics: ontological ethics (Benso 1994), originary ethics (Caputo 1989), dialogical ethics (Coles 1992) etc.: that ethics might lie, in other words, in an ‘<span class="BoldUnderline">openness’</span> (in the sense of disposition, sensibility or even obligation) towards the other(Campbell 1994, 1996; Warner 1996; Odysseos 2003, 2007a). Even political realists are really idealists of prudence. <span class="BoldUnderline">Ethics holds us in captivity to it: </span>we have, as John Caputo accuses Emmanuel Levinas, ‘<span class="BoldUnderline">made ethics into a holy of holies, an inviolable inner sanctum, pure and uncontaminated’</span> (1993: 125). Yet, the situation is far more ‘polymorphic’<span class="BoldUnderline"> and there are other ‘games’ to play: </span>there is politics, Caputo says (ibid.). Coming from a philosopher particularly interested in the <em>question</em> of ethics (cf. Scott 1990) and working intensively in the Heideggerian and Levinasian traditions, this<span class="BoldUnderline">declaration against</span> (universal, originary, fundamental, etc.) ethics is important<span class="BoldUnderline">.</span> Caputo moves from the question of ethics to the possibility of a notion of obligation that cannot be contained within ethics, which shatters ethics (1993). Caputo’s injunction begs the question: <span class="BoldUnderline">might we conceive of a different trajectory? Can we</span> today speak <em>against</em> ethics, <span class="BoldUnderline">hope for an anti-ethics?</span> This paper situates itself in much this vein of thinking, yet by further specifying and refocussing its domain of concern: tospeak against ethics, to hope for an anti-ethics, is to listen to the demands of and for politics. The paper examines Carl Schmitt’s particular, if increasingly familiar, critique of universal ethics. This critique argues that, in as<span class="BoldUnderline">much as ethics is predicated on the </span>discourse of a universal humanity (and its human rights), it produces and objectifies<span class="BoldUnderline">the other as the inhuman, which then </span>becomesthe proper <span class="BoldUnderline">object of annihilation</span> as the enemy of humanity (Schmitt 1996a, 2003, 2004; Rasch 2003; Odysseos 2007b). The paper extends this critique to include the ways in which the discourse of humanity transforms itself in the era of global governmentality into ‘biopolitical care of the living’, taking ‘population’ as its privileged object (Foucault 2001, 2007a), and leading to an governmental stance that the paper analyses as the ethics and politics of the subject of (enforced) freedom. Inherent, too, in this governmental transformation of universal ethics is the figure of the enemy.<br />

 <strong>Security discourse causes apocalypse in the name of survival</strong><br />
Peter <strong>Coviello,</strong> Asst Prof of English – Bowdoin, <strong>‘1</strong><br />

<br />
Perhaps. But to claim that American culture is at present decisively postnuclear is not to say that the world we inhabit is in any way post-apocalyptic. Apocalypse, as I began by saying, <em>changed</em> – it did not go away. And here I want to hazard my second assertion: if, in the nuclear age of yesteryear, apocalypse signified an event threatening everyone and everything with (in Jacques Derrida’s suitably menacing phrase) “remainderless and a-symbolic destruction,”6 then in the postnuclear world apocalypse is an affair whose parameters are definitively <em>local</em> in shape and in substance, apocalypse is defined now by the affliction it brings <em>somewhere else</em>, always to an “other” people whose very presence might then be written as a kind of dangerous contagion, threatening the safety and the prosperity of a cherished “general population.” This fact seems to me to stand behind Susan Sontag’s incisive observation, from 1989, that, “Apocalypse is now a long-running serial: not ‘Apocalypse Now’ but ‘Apocalypse from Now On.’”7 The decisive point here in the perpetuation of the threat of apocalypse (the point Sontag goes on, at length, to miss) is that apocalypse is ever present because, as an element in a vast economy of power, it is ever useful. That is, through the perpetual threat of destruction – through the constant reproduction of the <em>figure</em> of apocalypse – agencies of power ensure their authority to act on and through the bodies of a particular population. No one turns this point more persuasively than Michel Foucault, who in the final chapter of his first volume of <em>The History of Sexuality</em> addresses himself to the problem of a power that is less repressive than productive, less life-threatening than, in his words, “life-administering.” Power, he contends, “exerts a positive influence on life … [and] endeavors to administer, optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations.” In his brief comments on what he calls “the atomic situation,” however, Foucault insists as well that the productiveness of modern power must not be mistaken for a uniform repudiation of violent or even lethal means. For as “managers of life and survival, of bodies and the race,” agencies of modern power presume to act “<em>on</em> <em>the behalf of the existence of everyone</em>.” Whatsoever might be construed as a threat to life and survival serves to authorize <em>any</em> expression of force, no matter how invasive or, indeed, potentially annihilating. “If genocide is indeed the dream of modern power,” Foucault writes, “this is not because of a recent return to the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population.”8 For a state that would arm itself not with the power to kill its population, but with a more comprehensive power over the patterns and functioning of its collective life, the threat of an apocalyptic demise, nuclear or otherwise, seems a civic initiative that can scarcely be done without.<br />

<br />
This goal is pursued in ways which are still unconventional in the intellectual milieu of international relations in Australia, even though they are gaining influence worldwide as traditional modes of theory and practice are rendered inadequate by global trends that defy comprehension, let alone policy. The inability to give meaning to global changes reflects partly the enclosed, elitist world of professional security analysts and bureaucratic experts, where entry is gained by learning and accepting to speak a particular, exclusionary language. The contributors to this book are familiar with the discourse, but accord no privileged place to its ‘knowledge form as reality’ in debates on defence and security. Indeed, they believe that <span class="BoldUnderline">debate will be furthered only through a</span> long overdue <span class="BoldUnderline">critical re-evaluation</span> of elite perspectives. Pluralistic, democratically-oriented perspectives on Australia’s identity are both required and essential if Australia’s thinking on defence and security is to be invigorated.<br />
This is not a conventional policy book; <span class="BoldUnderline">nor should it be</span>, in the sense of<span class="BoldUnderline"> offering policy-makers</span> and their academic counterparts sets of <span class="BoldUnderline">neat alternative solutions</span>, <span class="BoldUnderline">in familiar language and format</span>, to problems they pose. <span class="BoldUnderline">This expectation is in itself a considerable part of the problem</span> to be analysed. It<span class="BoldUnderline"> is</span>, however, <span class="BoldUnderline">a book about policy</span>, one <span class="BoldUnderline">that </span>questions how problems are framed by policy-makers. It challenges the proposition that irreducible bodies of real knowledge on defence and security exist independently of their ‘context in the world’, and it demonstrates how <span class="BoldUnderline">security policy is articulated authoritatively by the elite keepers of that knowledge</span>, experts trained to recognize enduring, universal wisdom. All others, from this perspective, must accept such wisdom or remain outside the expert domain, tainted by their inability to comply with the ‘rightness’ of the official line. But it is precisely the official line, or at least its image of the world, that needs to be problematised. <span class="Dottedunderline">If the critic responds directly to the demand for policy alternatives, without addressing this image, he or she is tacitly endorsing it</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Before engaging in the policy debate the critics need to reframe the basic terms of reference</span>. This book, then, reflects and underlines the importance of Antonio Gramsci and Edward Said’s ‘critical intellectuals’.15<br />
The demand, tacit or otherwise, that the policy-maker’s frame of reference be accepted as the only basis for discussion and analysis ignores a three thousand year old tradition commonly associated with Socrates and purportedly <span class="BoldUnderline">integral</span> to the Western tradition of democratic dialogue. More immediately, it ignores post-seventeenth century democratic traditions which insist that a good <span class="BoldUnderline">society must have</span> within it <span class="BoldUnderline">some way of critically assessing its knowledge</span> and the decisions based upon that knowledge which impact upon citizens of such a society. This is a tradition with a slightly different connotation in contemporary liberal democracies which, during the Cold War, were proclaimed different and superior to the totalitarian enemy precisely because there were institutional checks and balances upon power. In short, one of the major differences between ‘open societies’ and their (closed) counterparts behind the Iron Curtain was that the former encouraged the critical testing of the knowledge and decisions of the powerful and assessing them against liberal democratic principles. The latter tolerated criticism only on rare and limited occasions. For some, this represented the triumph of rational-scientific methods of inquiry and techniques of falsification. For others, especially since positivism and rationalism have lost much of their allure, it meant that for society to become open and liberal, sectors of the population must be independent of the state and free to question its knowledge and power. Though we do not expect this position to be accepted by every reader, contributors to this book believe that critical dialogue is long overdue in Australia and needs to be listened to. For all its liberal democratic trappings, Australia’s security community continues to invoke closed monological narratives on defence and security.<br />
This book also questions the distinctions between policy practice and academic theory that inform conventional accounts of Australian security. One of its major concerns, particularly in chapters 1 and 2, is to illustrate how theory is integral to<span class="BoldUnderline"> the practice of</span> security analysis and policy<span class="BoldUnderline"> prescription</span>. The book also calls on<span class="BoldUnderline"> policy-makers, </span>academics and students of defence and security to thinkcritically about what they are reading, writing and saying; to begin to ask, of their work and study, difficult and searching questions raised in other disciplines; to recognise, no matter how uncomfortable it feels, that what is involved in theory and practice is not the ability to identify a replacement for failed models, but a realisation that terms and concepts – state <span class="BoldUnderline">sovereignty</span>, <span class="BoldUnderline">balance of power</span>, security, <span class="BoldUnderline">and so on</span> – <span class="BoldUnderline">are</span> contested and <span class="BoldUnderline">problematic</span>, and that the world is indeterminate, always becoming what is written about it. <span class="BoldUnderline">Critical analysis which shows how particular</span> kinds of <span class="BoldUnderline">theoretical presumptions can</span> effectively <span class="BoldUnderline">exclude vital areas of political life</span> from analysis <span class="BoldUnderline">has direct practical implications for policy-makers</span>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">academics and citizens who face the daunting task of steering Australia through some potentially choppy international waters over the next few years. There is also much of interest in the chapters for those struggling to give meaning to a world where so much that has long been taken for granted now demands imaginative, incisive reappraisal. The contributors, too, have struggled to find meaning, often despairing at the terrible human costs of international violence. This is why readers will find no single, fully formed panacea for the world’s ills in general, or Australia’s security in particular. There are none. Every chapter, however, in its own way, offers something more than is found in orthodox literature, often by exposing ritualistic Cold War defence and security mind-sets that are dressed up as new thinking. Chapters 7 and 9, for example, present alternative ways of engaging in security and defence practice. Others (chapters 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8) seek to alert policy-makers, academics and students to</span> <span class="BoldUnderline">alternative theoretical possibilities</span> which <span class="BoldUnderline">might better serve</span> an Australian community pursuing <span class="BoldUnderline">security and prosperity</span> in an uncertain world. All chapters confront the policy community and its counterparts in the academy with a deep awareness of the intellectual and material constraints imposed by dominant traditions of realism, but they avoid dismissive and exclusionary terms which often in the past characterized exchanges between policy-makers and their critics. This is because, as noted earlier, attention needs to be paid to the words and the thought processes of those being criticized. A close reading of this kind draws attention to underlying assumptions, showing they need to be recognized and questioned. A sense of doubt (in place of confident certainty) is a necessary prelude to a genuine search for alternative policies. <span class="BoldUnderline">First comes an awareness of the need for </span>new perspectives, then specific policies may follow.<br />
As Jim George argues in the following chapter, <span class="BoldUnderline">we need to look not so much at contending policies</span> as they are made for us but at<span class="BoldUnderline"> challenging ‘the discursive process</span> which gives<span class="BoldUnderline"> [favoured </span>interpretations of “reality”]their meaning<span class="BoldUnderline"> and which direct</span> [Australia’s] <span class="BoldUnderline">policy</span>/analytical/military <span class="BoldUnderline">responses’</span>. This process is not restricted to the small, official defence and security establishment huddled around the US-Australian War Memorial in Canberra. It also encompasses much of Australia’s academic defence and security community located primarily though not exclusively within the Australian National University and the University College of the University of New South Wales. These discursive processes are examined in detail in subsequent chapters as authors attempt to make sense of a politics of exclusion and closure which exercises disciplinary power over Australia’s security community. <span class="BoldUnderline">They</span> also <span class="BoldUnderline">question the discourse of ‘regional security’, ‘security cooperation’, ‘peacekeeping’ and ‘alliance politics’</span> that are central to Australia’s official and academic security agenda in the 1990s. This is seen as an important task especially when, as is revealed, the disciplines of International Relations and Strategic Studies are under challenge from critical and theoretical debates ranging across the social sciences and humanities; debates that are nowhere to be found in Australian defence and security studies. The chapters graphically illustrate how Australia’s public policies on defence and security are informed, underpinned and legitimised by a narrowly-based intellectual enterprise which draws strength from contested concepts of realism and liberalism, which in turn seek legitimacy through policy-making processes. Contributors ask whether Australia’s policy-makers and their academic advisors are unaware of broader intellectual debates, or resistant to them, or choose not to understand them, and why?<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Several studies of the role of </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">narrative in the production of scientific knowledge</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> have identified it as a means of generating coherence in science that both enables and </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">constrains further research</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> (Haraway, 1989; O’Hara, 1992; Rouse, 1996; Brown, 1998). Richard Harvey Brown is the most explicit about what constitutes a narrative, defining it as ‘an accounting of events or actions temporally that explains them causally or motivationally’ (Brown, 1998: 98). Brown’s definition of narrative fits with that of narrative theorists such as Mieke Bal (1997) who have stressed that narrative entails not a random unfolding of events but a sequenced ordering involving a tran- sition from one state to another brought about or experienced by actors. One implication of this is the fundamental role of causality and agency. Another is that </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">a narrative beginning always anticipates an ending</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> – a reso- lution or closure to the events that have been set in motion. Historian Hayden White (1981: 23) has argued that the tendency to present history as </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">narrative ‘arises out of a desire to have real events display the coherence, integrity, fullness, and closure of an image or life that is and can only be imaginary’. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">He finds that narrative closure involves a passage from one moral order to another. ‘</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">Where</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">, in any account of reality, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">narrativity is pres- ent, we can be sure</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> that morality or </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">a moralizing impulse is present too’</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> (White, 1981: 22). In this sense, narrative is inherently teleological and ide- ological. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">The inexorable movement of a narrative towards a predetermined end ensures that its many assumptions go unchallenged.An analytical approach to the interaction between military and civilian science that recognizes the ideological function of narrative can help side- step</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> some of the </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">difficulties</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> associated with the distortionist thesis often attributed to Paul Forman’s (1987) landmark paper on the military basis of US post-war physics. Forman has been criticized for implying that without military patronage, physics would have followed an ideal direction unaf- fected by outside interests (for example, Kevles, 1990). By looking at what sorts of narratives scientists draw on, we can avoid Forman’s supposed ide- alism. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">The question is not so much whether science has been distorted, but through which of many possible stories a research programme has been articulated. To ask which stories have been invoked is to ask which ideolo- gies have implicitly been accepted.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> And to ask that is to allow that, on ide- ological grounds, some stories are preferable to others. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">Classical asteroid science had dealt in the prediction of eternal truths and the recounting of cosmic history.Asteroid orbits</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> had demonstrated the Newtonian order of the Solar System and </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">were accommodated within narra- tives of origins that reinforced the timeless generalities of Newtonianism.But once impact–extinction theory had drawn asteroids into the history of terres- trial evolution, they came to be identified with</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> contingent events and with Downloaded from sss.sagepub.com by guest on July 14, 2011 504 Social Studies of Science 37/4 </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">timelines that had both beginnings and endings</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">. In this context, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">the predictive goal of physical science could be re-oriented towards future contingencies. The growing empirical evidence that supported the view of impacts as a sig- nificant force in geological history did not itself determine a view of asteroids as signifiers of the human future. That required asteroids to be located within a new set of stories.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> During the 1980s, a few astronomers began to resignify asteroids in this way, but for some years they had only limited success in con- verting others to their view of asteroids as a threat. Taking a prophetic turn, these </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">scientists began telling stories about the future of human civilization and how space technologies could save the world. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Doug Davis (2001) has argued that the idea that the extinction of the dinosaurs was caused by an impact drew the study of the planetary past into the networks of Cold War science. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">Participants in the impact–extinction controversy </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">debated the relevance of Carl Sagan’s nuclear winter calcula- tions, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">drew on studies of bomb-cratering and invoked the models and metaphors of total-war fighting. As astronomers began to take the prophetic turn, they extended the conceptual alignment between impact science and the culture of total war into the study of the planetary future. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Since the 1930s, asteroid collision rates had been understood well enough for some astronomers to have recognized the possibility of future impacts with Earth, but they had not dwelt on this possibility or framed their work in terms of human consequences.7 In 1967, a predicted close approach by the asteroid Icarus prompted a student exercise at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) into how to prevent an imagined impact. The find- ings were published (Kleiman, 1979), but were not pursued beyond the classroom or the popular press. It was only in 1980, when Luis Alvarez and others examined the possibility of future impacts as part of an attempt to formulate a new vision for NASA, that asteroids began to be constructed as a threat by the research community (Chapman &amp; Morrison, 1989: 276). The following year, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">NASA sponsored a workshop</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> at Snowmass, CO, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">on the consequences of asteroid impacts.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">8 In addition to questions about how best to detect near-Earth asteroids – the traditional observational domain of astronomy – </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">the workshop also considered questions about the vulnera- bility of society if agriculture were to be wiped out for a year, the instabil- ity of social and economic structures in the aftermath of an impact, and how to deflect or destroy a potential impactor</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">, a question already antici- pated in Alvarez’s analysis.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;"> Such questions firmly located asteroids within the sphere of human action.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> The workshop also brought astronomers into direct contact with defence scientists. According to the astronomer Tom Gehrels, who pre- sented details of his new Spacewatch asteroid survey to the workshop, already at this time astronomers recognized that </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">the energies involved in deflecting an asteroid would require nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> and </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">they therefore asked ‘the people familiar with nuclear engineering to take an interest</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> in Downloaded from sss.sagepub.com by guest on July 14, 2011 Mellor: Colliding Worlds 505 these problems’ (Gehrels, 2001). In fact, some of the defence </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">scientists were quick to do just that.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> Unlike many of the civilian scientists who were slow to pursue the impact threat, one of the defence scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory wrote a report on the asteroid threat as early as 1984 and impacts with Earth were a favourite topic of conversation among Lowell Wood’s group at the lab at this time (Broad, 1985: 107, 190).</span><br />

 <strong>the affirmative’s discourse of space as a solution to apocalyptic threats to earth is trojan horse for the securitization of the heavens—their benign rhetoric will become a mask for militarism</strong><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Although it may feel like it at times, the militarization/weaponization debate is not simply a case of intellectual hair-splitting. It matters in all sorts of ways in terms of the existing framework of space law (and any revisions to it), to the way we categorize pro- gramme development and specific technologies, and the way that the actions of space powers are analysed and judged. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> potential </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">problem with the eternal return of the militarization/weaponization debate</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, however, is </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">that it is in some ways detached from the broader context of understandings of ‘space security’</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> that analysis of space law and policy has to take account of. In particular, the issue of </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">space arms control is further complicated by what might be termed the ‘securitization’</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> of outer space, which captures a range of dynamics that fall beyond the boundaries of the militarization/ weaponization debate. 2. Securitization - a new framework for analysis of space policy? What, then, is ‘securitization’, and why should it be regarded as anything other than another ‘-ation’ to be added to the pot? </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Recent decades have seen</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> a rapid and </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">extensive ‘broadening’ of the contexts in which the concept of security is applied and in the range of issues it is seen to cover. From a relatively circumscribed historical association with military threats</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> and issues, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the concept of security is increasingly used in reference to ‘non-traditional’ issues, such as</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> migration and </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">environmental degradation</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">In both policy and academic discourse non-military issues are now frequently referred to as ‘security’ issues by policy makers. Space policy has been far from immune from this wider trend. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Such </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">moves to widen the spectrum of security issues can be classified as</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> attempts at ‘</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">securitization’</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, a term coined by the group of scholars within security studies commonly referred to as the ‘CopenhagenSchool’.2 </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Securitization is</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, in broad terms, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the process through which a non-military issue comes to be seen as an issue of security. When an issue comes to be treated as an issue of national security, it is justifiable to use exceptional political measures to deal with it. It is ‘securitized’</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">: that is, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">it is treated with the same degree of urgency as military threats tothe very existence of a state</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (as traditionally captured in the concept of ‘national security’), </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">or</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> what the Copenhagen School labels ‘</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">existential threats’. At its most fundamental the idea of national security assumes that the state must be protected</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">therefore it is necessary for the state to maintain standing armies, weapons production and procurement, intelligence agencies, and so on</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">One of the ways we can distinguish an existential threat</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, then, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">is by the level of response it generates. When an issue or development is successfully presented as an existential threat, it legitimises the use of exceptional political </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">measures. A classic military example in inter- national relations </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">is</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> a state’s right to </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">self-defence</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. If a state is </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">under attack, it claims the legitimate use of extraordinary measures</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> that go beyond normal day-to-day politics: the declaration of a state of emergency or </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">martial law</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, the </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">rationing</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> of certain goods and services, closure of roads and schools, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">and so on</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Commonly</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, then, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the identification of existential threats sets in chain a number of effects that characterize the specific quality of security problems: urgency - the issue takes priority; and extraordinary measures - authorities claim powers that they would not otherwise have, or curtail rights and liberties that might otherwise apply</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> In sh</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">ort, securitization is a style of argumentation used in attempts to legitimate the application of extraordinary measures by positioning an issue as equivalent to a threat to national security as it is more traditionally understood. By attempting to portray an issue as a security issue, a securitizing move is made; that is, a move to class an issue in the same category as national defence. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">3. The EU as a securitizing actor The reasoning behind this introduction of securitization theory here into debates on space policy is that </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the militarization/weaponization debate only partially captures (at best) the multiple ways in which outer space is being linked to security in the space policy discourses</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> of leading states and international organizations - </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">ways that encompass not only ‘traditional’ military securitybut also the security of economic, environ-mental, scientific and technical infrastructures</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. As is discussed below, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">space policy is one of the areas where we have seen a rapid proliferation of ‘securitizing moves’ that identify space as crucial to national security and survival in a variety of ways.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Even if some of these moves might be argued to be more successful than others in terms of their actual political effects, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the sheer prevalence of attempted securitization within space policy provides a rationale for revisiting the question of whether militarization/weaponization is a sufficient way of framing the analysis of space policy in relation to security. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">It is worth emphasising that at a general level </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the ‘securitization of outer space’ is</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, in itself,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> not a novel phenomenon</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> or development. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The extent to which ostensibly civil uses of outer space have been driven by, and have overlapped with, national security functions historically-or, as in the case of the space race between the USA and USSR, have acted as a surrogate for direct military engagement-is well documented.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Similarly the characterization of the Sputnik launch in 1957 as placing the USA ‘in the greatest danger in its history’ suggests that the representation of space technologies as potential ‘existential threats’ is not entirely new either.3 </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Of significance, though, is the intensification, expansion and entrenchment of ‘securitizing moves’ as a feature of contemporary space policies. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">In this respect the European Union stands out as a ‘securitizing actor’ par excellence, with an ever-increasing range of activities deemed as issues of space security that demand new and intensified levels of regional cooperation. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso, has</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, in this vein, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">argued that Europe</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> needs ‘more security in and from space’, defining this not only in ways that encompass traditional fears of attacks on space assets as an ‘existential threat’, but also by including a range of other issues: Our space assets and infrastructure are indispensable for our economy and security and we need to protect them. The EU should develop an independent capacity to monitor satellites and debris orbiting the Earth and the space environment, and tackle possible hazards. We </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">should also exploit the potential of space infrastructure (already available</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, for example, t</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">hrough GMES [Global Monitoring for Environment and Security]) to protect our citizens</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> and our ground infrastructure </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">against natural and manmade hazards</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> and to be at the service of European Security and Defence Policy goals. These capacities should be developed in partnership with Member States. Here </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">security is understood in a more expansive and comprehensive sense than the traditional conception of military security</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, in a manner that parallels the ‘broad’ understanding of security in EU policy discourse more generally. Thus, as well as citing the role of space in European Defence, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the existential threats identified here also include the prospects of environmental disaster and economic meltdown</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Similarly, the European Space Agency has argued that security needs are ‘connected to [.] technological progress’, and ‘Space systems are a fundamental aspect of “technological security”: they offer extremely versatile solutions in a global, international dimension.’5 Both these arguments complement a final ‘security’ function, which is that space can become a catalyst of further European integration, thus preserving the political security of the Union: ‘Security applications provided by space technologies are a linchpin of European policy. But Space security goes far beyond this utilization logic: Space technologies directly contribute to the building of an EU political project.’6 4. The wider context Although securitization is a prevalent feature of EU space policy discourse, it is by no means Europe’s sole preserve. In its overview of global space policies, the Space Security Index report Space Security 2009 explicitly noted that ‘National space policies consistently emphasize international cooperation and the peaceful uses of outer space’, but equally that there is a ‘Growing focus within national policies on the security uses of outer space’. As well as developments in EU space policy, the report notes that national security has become a central principle of China’s emerging space programme, and that France’s White Paper on Defence and National Security calls for an overhaul of its national space strategy.7 Another prominent instance in this regard is Japan’s 2008 ‘Basic Law of Space Activities’, the first significant alteration to the Japanese space policy framework established in 1969. Whereas the latter studiously adhered to the ‘peaceful purposes’ of the Outer Space Treaty (interpreting this strictly to mean ‘non-military’ purposes), the 2008 framework has lifted the previous ban on military space activities by citing the importance of ‘national security’, thus potentially allowing a greater space role for Japan’s Ministry of Defence in this regard. The move attracted controversy given Japan’s ‘Peaceful Constitution’8 and the strict interpretation of ‘peaceful purposes’ in the 1969 framework. Japan has used ‘multi-purpose’ Information Gathering Satellites (IGS) for tasks such as monitoring North Korean missile programmes long prior to 2008 but, as Kazuto Suzuki notes, ‘It was [previously] difficult even to mention the term “dual-use” because that would imply the possibility of participation of the MoD.’9 Post-2008 Japan’s space budget has been weighted more heavily towards military research and the use of outer space for defensive purposes. An attempt to articulate a broader understanding of security, however, has been used to ‘soften’ the military implications of the new framework. Although many commentators suspect the primacy of concerns about North Korea (and China), it is notable that the 2008 framework alludes to crisis management, disaster monitoring and potential involvement in overseas peacekeeping as key facets of this understanding of the security functions of Japanese satellites.10 Even </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">US space policy appears to have moved towards securitization of an ever greater range of issues</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> that include - but also extend well beyond - a narrow military definition of security. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The US National Space Policy of 2006 identified US military capabilities as ‘critically dependent upon space capabilities’, but equally cited space capabilities as ‘critical’ to ‘.a wide range of civil, commercial, and national security users’, thus assuming wider security implications of space as well as its more direct military uses.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">11 </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">This stated centrality of space to both military and civilian infrastructures was subsequently used to justify the exceptional, unilateralist stance taken by</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> the George W.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> Bush</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> administration towards any proposals for new legal regimes on outer space or restrictions on military research and development. Although the National Space Policy of 2010 is diametrically opposed in its attitude towards international cooperation, space law and arms control (‘The United States will consider proposals and concepts for arms control measures if they are equitable, effectively verifiable, and enhance the national security of the United States and its allies’12),</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> the Obama administration</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> nevertheless </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">shares with its predecessor the assumption that space security is more than just military, as is exemplified in its National Security Strategy: </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Across the globe, we must work in concert with allies and partners to optimize the use of shared sea, air, and space domains. These shared areas, which exist outside exclusive national jurisdictions, are the connective tissue around the globe upon which all nations’ security and prosperity depend. The United States will continue to help safeguard access, promote security, and ensure the sustainable use of resources in these domains.13 5. Space securitization -promise or peril? </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Attempts at securitization are</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> thus </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">a rapidly growing feature of contemporary space policy discourse</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Merely making this observation, however, leaves aside the question of whether such securitizing moves should be encouraged or avoided by policy makers and analysts. On </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the one hand, the idea of space as a key part of the ‘connective tissue’ th at binds global security might seem an attractive proposition to those seeking to shift the emphasis away from militaristic national concerns. In this light</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">attempts to securitize environmental monitoring, critical infrastructure and economic prosperityunder the rubric of space security might be welcomed as the basis for a more multilateral, cooperative global approach</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">there is a legitimate concern that the securitization of space policy effectively acts as a Trojan horse for the expansion of national-military interests</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. One previous viewpoint contributor contends in relation to EU space policy that ‘.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Europe’s “security research” has slowly paved the way for the introduction of much more controversial “military research” within the European domain</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">’14, and Manriquez suspects that, with Japan’s space law revision, ‘the nation inches [further] towards re-militarization with the likely opening of space for military use.’15 Similarly, the new space policy of </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the Obama administration appeals simultaneously to an expansive definition of global security and a more narrow, traditional focus on the national-military interest of the USA included within this. All of this points to the importance of taking the securitization of space policy seriously as a key element of debates on space security. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Focusing on militarization and weaponization alone simply isn’t sufficient.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Complaining that the Clinton administration had cut $426bn from defense equipment investments, and that none of the ten divisions were fully combat ready, the PNAC authors bemoaned the fact that military facilities are still in Germany when the security dangers are in South East Europe. The language of crises pervades the PNAC document, for which the opportunity to rebuild American power will be missed if the next president fails to adequately fund the defense forces and ensure the dominance of American arms into the future. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">The unipolar moment may pass and America face rivals for its hegemony</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> if military readiness slips further and equipment and personnel are further neglected. The rhetoric is familiar from earlier days of cold war fears and from alarm at post-Vietnam force reductions; the late 1970s were replete with alarms about relative weaknesses and the need to rebuild the military; many of the neoconservatives who subsequently became influential were part of the Reagan presidencies where military spending was increased and the cold war is a pervasive tendency in the rationalizations for new attempts to assert the supremacy. What is notably absent in all this discussion is any rival that might make American military dominance questionable. But, so the logic of the argument goes, ensuring that one is not even tempted to try is the only reliable way to assert Pax Americana – and yes, the PNAC report explicitly uses the phrase suggesting parallels with Rome and Britain in earlier periods.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Homeland defense takes priority in the PNAC document, especially the need for missile defense so that states which acquire ballistic missiles cannot deter American military action. This is the first priority. But the military must also preserve and expand the zone of democratic peace – according to much of the American liberal school of international relations thinking that ensues the democratic peace thesis – where democratic states apparently do not fight each other and are in one way or another aligned with the US, to ensure global prosperity. Where the forces in the cold war were primarily concerned with a conflict with the USSR in Europe, now in the post cold war they are concerned with fighting regional wars, but in a context where the potential strategic rivalries are focused in Asia. There is a very different geography to American power now, and one that requires a refocused strategic posture. Constabulary duties, such as the deployment of American forces in the Balkans, are a clear part of the Pentagon’s mandate too and require suitable force structures. Increasing the number of active forces and reducing reliance on reserve forces is seen as important, especially if constabulary duties are taken seriously. Nuclear weapons upgrades were apparently forgotten by the Clinton administration which was castigated for its negotiation of the supposedly ineffective comprehensive test ban treaty, which the Republican-controlled Senate defeated, leaving the treaty ungratified.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">There is a rich irony in the warning in <em>Rebuilding America’s Defenses</em> where the authors wonder about the utility of aircraft carriers in the navy of the future. Will the navy carriers be rendered redundant by unmanned airplanes and guided missiles, in much the same way as carrier planes rendered battleships redundant at Pearl Harbor? Given that the PNAC document does not mention terrorism as a threat to American power, the adage about planning to fight the last war seems strangely apt. Alarm over the revolution in military affairs and the technological capabilities of potential future foes ignored the foes that actually did strike America on September 11th, 2001. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">The focus</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> solely </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">on rival states</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> is noteworthy.

A policy story can be defined as follows: </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">A set of</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> factual, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">causal claims, normative principles and a desired objective</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">, all of which are constructed as a more or less coherent argument </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">astory which points to a problem to be addressed and the desirability and adequacy of adopting a specific policy approach to resolve it.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> This conceptualization incorporates how politically motivated actors integrate scientifically produced imowledge in the form of facts, concepts or theories in order to i) convince others that a certain phenomenon is a problem, (ii) demonstrate that this problem is best understood in a certain way as shown by the facts presented, and (iii) link these factual claims to normative principles giving moral force to the argument that it should be resolved. This perspective thus subjects the factual dimensions of political processes to the interests and normative commitments of actors, in the sense that knowledge is used to justify and legitimize calls for adopting certain policies to resolve what is seen to be a problem that 'ought' to be resolved. The formulation is partly inspired by Rein and Schuss (1991. 265), who refer to problem</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">-setting stories that 'link causal accounts of policy problems to particular proposals for action</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> and </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">facilitate thenormative leap from &quot;is&quot; to 'ought&quot;'</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">.

 <strong>The attempt to sever is a disavowal of the political nature of their position—the elevation of pure knowledge to the highest social actor makes the worst forms of violence possible in its name</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; text-decoration: none;">Zizek</span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">, Senior researcher at the Institute of Sociology, University of Ljubljana, 200</span><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; text-decoration: none;">6</span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> [Slavoj, The Universal Exception, p. 183-189]</span><br />
Although politics proper is thus something specifically 'European', <span style="text-decoration: none;">the entire history of European political thought is ultimately nothing but a series of disavowals of the political moment</span>, of the proper logic of political antagonism. There are four main versions of this disavowal: Archipolitics: the 'communitarian' attempt to define a traditional, close, organically structured, homogeneous social space that allows for no void in which the political moment or event can emerge. Parapolitics: the attempt to depoliticize politics. One accepts the political conflict but reformulates it into a competition, within the representational space, between acknowledged parties/agents for the (temporary) occupation of the place of executive power. This parapolitics, of course, has a series of different successive versions: the main rupture is that between its classical formulation and its modern Hobbesian version, which focuses on the problematic of social contract, of the alienation of individual rights in the emergence of sovereign power. Habermasian or Rawlsian ethics are perhaps the last philosophical vestiges of this attitude: the attempt to de-antagonize politics by formulating clear rules to be obeyed so that the agonistic procedure of litigation does not explode into politics proper. Marxist (or utopian socialist) metapolitics: political conflict is fully asserted, but as a shadow theatre in which events whose proper place is in another scene (that of economic processes) are played out. The ultimate goal of true politics is thus its self-cancellation, the transforma-tion of the administration of people into the administration of things within the fully self-transparent rational order of a collective will. (More precisely, Marxism is here ambiguous since the very term political economy also opens up a space for the opposite gesture of introducing politics into the very heart of the economy, that is, of denouncing the apolitical character of the economic processes as the supreme ideological illusion. Class struggle does not express some objective economic contradiction; it is the very form of existence of this contradiction.) The ultrapolitics of Carl Schmitt: the attempt to depoliticize the conflict by way of bringing it to extremes, via the direct militarization of politics. In ultrapolitics, the repressed political returns in the guise of the attempt to resolve the deadlock of political conflict by its false radicalization — that is, by reformulating it as a war between us and them, our enemy, where there is no common ground for symbolic conflict. It is deeply symptomatic, for example, that instead of class struggle the radical Right speaks of class (or sexual) warfare. What we have in all four cases is thus an attempt to gentrify the properly traumatic dimension of the political. Something emerged in ancient Greece under the name of the demos demanding its rights, and, from the very beginning (that is, from Plato's Republic onwards) to the recent revival of liberal political philosophy, political philosophy itself was an attempt to suspend the de-stabilizing potential of the political, to disavow and/or regulate it in one way or another: by bringing about a return to some pre-political social body, by fixing the rules of political competition and so forth. Political philosophy is thus, in all its different shapes, a kind of defence formation, and perhaps its typology could be established by reference to the different modalities of defence against some traumatic experience in psychoanalysis.5 Archi-, para-, meta- and ultrapolitics form a kind of Greimasian logical square: [Image in Original] Archi· and ultra· are the two faces of the traditionalist attitude (self enclosed community versus war of a community against external enemies), and para· and meta· the two versions of modern politics (democratic formal rules versus the notion that this kind of democratic game merely expresses and/or distorts the level of pre-political socio- economic processes at which things really happen). On the other axis both meta· and ultrapolitics involve the notions of unsurpassable struggle, conflict and antagonism against the assertion of harmonious collaboration in archi- and parapolitics. From politics to post-politics Of importance here is Ranciere's critical distance towards Marxist metapolitcs. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The key feature of metapolitics is that</span>, to put it in the terms of Jacques Lacan's matrix of the four discourses, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the place of the agent is occupied. by knowledge</span>. Marx presented his position as scientific materialism, which is to say that <span style="text-decoration: none;">metapolitics is a politics that legiti-mizes itself by means of a direct reference to the scientific status of its knowledge.</span> (It is this knowledge that enables metapolitics to draw a distinction between those immersed in politico-ideological illusions and the Party, which grounds its historical intervention in knowledge of effective socio-economic processes.) This knowledge (about class society and relations of production in Marxism) suspends the classic opposition of Sein and Sollen, of Being and the Ought, of that which Is and the ethical Ideal. The ethical Ideal towards which the revolutionary subject strives is directly grounded in (or coincides with) the 'objective', 'disinterested' scientific knowledge of social processes. <span style="text-decoration: none;">This coincidence opens upa space for totalitarian violencebecause, in this way, acts that run against the elementary norms of ethical decency can be legitimized as grounded in (insight into) historical necessity</span> (<span style="text-decoration: none;">say, the mass killing of members of the bourgeois class</span> is grounded in the scientific insight that this class is already in itself condemned to disappear, past the moment in which it played a progressive role). Therein resides the difference between the standard, destructive, even murderous dimension of strict adherence to the ethical Ideal and modern totalitarianism. The terrorism of the Jacobins in the French Revolution, grounded in their adherence to the ideal of egaliberte, that is, in their attempt to realize directly this Ideal, to impose it directly on to reality, this coincidence of the purest idealism with the most destructive violence, analyzed by Hegel in the famous chapter of his Phenomenology of Spirit on absolute terror,7 is not enough to explain twentieth-century totalitarianism. What the Jacobins lacked was reference to the objective or neutral scientific knowledge of history to legitimize their exercise of unconditional power. It is only the Leninist revolutionary, not yet the Jacobin, who thus occupies the properly perverted position of the pure instrument of historical necessity, made accessible by means of scientific knowledge.<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">(The Zen of International Relations, “Forget IR Theory,” p. 37-9)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Stories, so we are told by prevailing social science wisdom, are not part of international relations (IR) scholarship. Stories belong to the realm of fiction, not the deomain of fact. And yet, stories freely whiz in and out of IR. Indeed, if we look more carefully, IR appears as nothing but a set of narratives that provide us with meaning and coherence. Consider how critical scholars increasingly portray the locus classicus of </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">IR</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> – the state, that is – not only as an institution, but also, and primarily, as a series of stories. These </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">stories</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">, Michael Shapiro points out, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">are part of a legitimization process that highlights, promotes and naturalises certain political practices</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> and the territorial context within which they take place. Taken together, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">these stories</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> provide the state with a sense of identity, coherence and unity. They create boundaries between an insider and an outside, between a people and its Others. But by virtue of what they are and do, state-stories also exclude, for they seek “to </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">repress or delegitimise other stories and practices</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> of identity and space they reflect.”3</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Of course, the prevailing IR stories have not gone unchallenged. Since the early 1980s, IR has come under harsh criticism. We have heard not only of state-centrism, but also of masculine values, structural determinism, ethnocentrism, positivism, and indeed, of the refusal to engage altogether in epistemological debates.4 And yet, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">orthodox approaches to IR appear surprisingly resilient</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">, or so at least they present themselves. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">Many IR scholars</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> who occupy key positions in the Western academy, particularly in North America, unwaveringly </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">pursue the same research agendas</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. They reaffirm the realist dilemmas that allegedly arise from the anarchical character of the international system, contemplate the role of regimes and international institutions, or revisit one more time the issue of absolute versus relative gains.5 </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">What accounts for this</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> surprising </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">resilience</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> of entrenched IR stories? Are prevalent realist and liberal stories simply more convincing than others?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">The power to tell stories is the power to define common sense. Prevalent IR stories have been told for so long that</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> they no longer appear as stories. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">They are accepted as fact</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">, for their metaphorical dimensions have vanished from our collective memories. We have become accustomed to our distorting IR metaphors until we come to lie, as Nietzsche would say, ‘herd-like in a style obligatory for all’.6 As a result, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">dominant IR stories have successfully transformed</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> one specific interpretation of world political realities, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">the realist one, into reality</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> per se.7 Realist perceptions of the international have gradually become accepted as common sense, to the point that </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">any critique against them has to be evaluated in terms of an already existing and objectivised world view</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. There </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">are powerful mechanisms of control precisely in this ability to determine meaning and rationality</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. ‘</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">Defining common sense’</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">, Steve </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">Smith argues, ‘is the ultimate act of political power</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">.’8 </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">It separates the possible from the impossible and directs the theory and practice of i</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">nternational </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">r</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">elations on a particular path.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The prime objective of this essay is to challenge prevalent IR stories. The most effective way of doing so, the chapter argues, is not to critique these stories, but to forget them, to tell new stories about world politics – stories that are not constrained by the boundaries of established and objectified IR narratives. Such an approach diverges from many critical engagements with world politics. Most challenges against dominant IR stories have been advanced in the form of critiques. While critiquing orthodox IR stories remains an important task, it is not sufficient. Exploring the origin of problems, in this case discourses of power politics and their positivist framing of political practice, cannot overcome all the existing theoretical and practical dilemmas. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">By articulating critique in relation to arguments advanced by orthodox IR theory, the impact of critical voices remains confined within the larger discursive boundaries that have been established through the initial framing of debates. A successful challenge</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> of orthodox IR stories must do more than merely critique their narrow and problematic nature. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">To be effective, critique must be supplemented with a process of forgetting the object of critique, of theorizing world politics beyond the agendas, issues</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> and terminologies </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">that are preset by orthodox debates</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. Indeed, the most powerful potential of critical scholarship may well lie in the attempt to tell different stories about IR, for once these stories have become validated, they may well open up spaces for a more inclusive and less violence-prone practice of world politics.</span><br />

After years of declining budgets, public apathy, and failed missions, NASA has gotten a big boost from the Bush Administration's recent promises of extravagant missions to permanently settle the moon and eventually explore Mars.

The results are written all over the past twenty years of NASA's history</span>: the space program is a political animal, <span class="BoldUnderline">marked by shifting, inconsistent, and ill-defined goals</span>. The space shuttle was built and maintained to please clashing constituencies, not to do a clearly defined job for which there was an economic and technical need. The shuttle was to launch satellites for the D<span class="BoldUnderline">epartment </span>o<span class="BoldUnderline">f </span>D<span class="BoldUnderline">efense and private contractors—</span>which could be done more cheaply by lightweight<span class="BoldUnderline">, disposable </span>rockets<span class="BoldUnderline">. It was to carry scientific experiments—which could be done more efficiently by unmanned vehicles. </span>But one &quot;need&quot; came before all technical issues: NASA's<span class="BoldUnderline">political need</span>for showy manned vehicles. The result<span class="BoldUnderline">, as great a technical achievement as it is, </span>was an over-sized, over-complicated, over-budget, overly dangerous vehicle that does everything poorly and nothingwell. Indeed, the space shuttle program was supposed to be phased out years ago, but the search for its replacement has been halted, largely because space contractors enjoy collecting on the overpriced shuttle without the expense and bother of researching cheaper alternatives. <span class="BoldUnderline">A private industry could have fired them</span>—<span class="BoldUnderline">but not so in a government project, with home-district congressmen to lobby on their behalf</span>. There is reason to believe that the political nature of the space program may have even been directly responsible for the Columbia disaster. Fox News reported that NASA chose to stick with non-Freon-based foam insulation on the booster rockets, despite evidence that this type of foam causes up to 11 times as much damage to thermal tiles as the older, Freon-based foam. Although NASA was exempted from the restrictions on Freon use, which environmentalists believe causes ozone depletion, and despite the fact that the amount of Freon released by NASA's rockets would have been trivial, the space agency elected to stick with the politically correct foam. It is impossible to integrate the contradictory. To <span class="BoldUnderline">whatever extent an engineer is forced to base his decisions, not on the realities of science but on the arbitrary, unpredictable, and often impossible demands of a politicized system, he is stymied</span>. Yet <span class="BoldUnderline">this </span>politicizing is an unavoidable consequence of governmental control over scientific research and development. <span class="BoldUnderline">Nor would it be difficult to spur the private exploration of space</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Phase out government involvement in space exploration, and </span>the free market will work to produce whatever there is demand for, just as it now does with traditional aircraft, both military and civilian. <span class="BoldUnderline">Develop a system of property rights to any stellar body reached and exploited by an American company, and profit-minded business will have the incentive to make it happen</span>. We often hear that the most ambitious projects can only be undertaken by government, but in fact the opposite is true. The more ambitious a project is, the more it demands to be broken into achievable, profit-making steps—and freed from the unavoidable politicizing of government-controlled science.<span class="BoldUnderline"> If space development is to be transformed from an expensive national bauble whose central purpose is to assert national pride to a practical industry with real and direct benefits, </span>it will only be by unleashing the creative force of free and rational minds. Extending man's reach into space is not, as some have claimed, our &quot;destiny.&quot; <span class="BoldUnderline">Standing between us and the stars are enormous technical difficulties, </span>the solution of which will require even more heroic determination than that which tamed the seas and the continents. But first, we must make a fundamental choice: will America continue to hold its best engineering minds captive to politics, or will we set them free?<br />

The first step, of course, would be to retool and restructure NASA from top to bottom and not just tweak it a little around the edges. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The first step would be to explore what space activities can truly be commercialized and see where NASA could be most effective by stimulating innovation in the private sector</span> rather than under- taking the full mission itself.

But one &quot;need&quot; came before all technical issues: NASA's political need for showy manned vehicles. The result, as great a technical achievement as it is, was an over-sized, over-complicated, over-budget, overly dangerous vehicle that does everything poorly and nothing well. Indeed, the space shuttle program was supposed to be phased out years ago, but the search for its replacement has been halted, largely because space contractors enjoy collecting on the overpriced shuttle without the expense and bother of researching cheaper alternatives. A private industry could have fired them--but not so in a government project, with home-district congressmen to lobby on their behalf. There is reason to believe that the political nature of the space program may have even been directly responsible for the Columbia disaster. Fox News reported that NASA chose to stick with non-Freon-based foam insulation on the booster rockets, despite evidence that this type of foam causes up to 11 times as much damage to thermal tiles as the older, Freon-based foam. Although NASA was exempted from the restrictions on Freon use, which environmentalists believe causes ozone depletion, and despite the fact that the amount of Freon released by NASA's rockets would have been trivial, the space agency elected to stick with the politically correct foam. <span style="text-decoration: none;">It is impossible to integrate the contradictory. To whatever extent an engineer is forced to base his decisions, not on the realities of science but on the arbitrary, unpredictable, and often impossible demands of a politicized system, he is stymied</span>. Yet <span style="text-decoration: none;">this politicizing is an unavoidable consequence of governmental control over scientific research and development</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Nor would it be difficult to spur the private exploration of space. Phase out government involvement in space exploration, and the free market will work to produce whatever there is demand for, just as it now does with traditional aircraft, both military and civilian.</span> Develop a system of property rights to any stellar body reached and exploited by an American company, and profit-minded business will have the incentive to make it happen. We often hear that the most ambitious projects can only be undertaken by government, but in fact the opposite is true. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The more ambitious a project is, the more it demands to be broken into achievable, profit-making steps--and freed from the unavoidable politicizing of government-controlled science. If space development is to be transformed from an expensive national bauble whose central purpose is to assert national pride to a practical industry with real and direct benefits, it will only be by unleashing the creative force of free and rational minds. </span>Extending man's reach into space is not, as some have claimed, our &quot;destiny.&quot; <span style="text-decoration: none;">Standing between us and the stars are enormous technical difficulties, the solution of which will require even more heroic determination than that which tamed the seas and the continents</span>. But <span style="text-decoration: none;">first, we must make a fundamental choice: will America continue to hold its best engineering minds captive to politics, or will we set them free?</span><br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">A group of more than 55 space leaders is petitioning Congress to support commercial spaceflight</span> in an open letter this week. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The plea comes as lawmakers are debating a new federal budget, including the question of how much money to devote to NASA.</span> President <span style="text-decoration: none;">Obama and NASA chief </span>Charlie <span style="text-decoration: none;">Bolden are advocating for more funds to spur the development of private spaceships</span> to replace the iconic space shuttle as the flagship of U.S. astronaut transportation to the International Space Station. <span style="text-decoration: none;">That plan</span>, they say, <span style="text-decoration: none;">would allow NASA to invest in a longer-term project to build a rocket that can carry astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit to asteroids and Mars.</span><br />

 <strong>NASA empirically blocks private investment</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 16px; text-decoration: none;">Powers 3</span></strong> (Blake, Director of Outreach for NASA’s Space Product Development Program, “A Time for Everything,” August 24, <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://laughingwolf.net/archives/000400.html" rel="nofollow">http://laughingwolf.net/archives/000400.html</a></span>)<br />
<br />
At the same time, <span style="text-decoration: none;">NASA has not exactly been a friend to commercial space enterprises</span>. This is particularly true for efforts to develop alternative manned space access. <span style="text-decoration: none;">NASA has a great deal invested in being the only way to get people into space</span>, from hardware and infrastructure to an internal culture that claims that only career NASA civil servants can be called astronauts. All those others who fly, or meet the international guidelines for being called such, cannot be called such in any NASA publication. <span style="text-decoration: none;">NASA has for years tried to block the development of manned commercial access. Just take a look at the regulatory environment</span> for such and NASA’s role in it. <span style="text-decoration: none;">NASA has bitterly resisted any suggestion that any other launch service be used, unless it was completely under their control</span>. There are many other examples, for those who care to go do the homework and look them up. <span style="text-decoration: none;">It’s official support of commercial activities has been limited. Despite various actions by Congress and its own charter, the agency has not been supportive of commercial research and development</span>. Just go take a look at the history of the Space Product Development Program, which has managed to do some very important and good things with industry, for a good example. Take a good look at the so-called commercialization efforts of Dan Tam, or the idea that Headquarters had that companies would pay for large portions of the ISS without being able to display logos or use their sponsorship in advertising. Those ideas were patently ridiculous, obvious to anyone who had any real-world experience, and beloved by top NASA management who should have known better.<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">THE DISSOLUTION OF THE SOVIET UNION marked the emergence of historically unprecedented U.S. advantages in the scales of world power. No system of sovereign states has ever contained one state with comparable material preponderance</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">.1 Following its invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the United States loomed so large on the world stage that many scholars called it an empire,2 but the costly turmoil that engulfed Iraq following the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003 quieted such talk. Suddenly, the limits of U.S. power became the new preoccupation. Many analysts began to compare the United States to Britain at the beginning of the twentieth century—an overstretched, declining, “weary Titan” that “staggers under the too vast orb of his fate.”3</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">What accounts for this sudden shift in assessments of American power? For most observers, it was not new information about material capabilities. As Robert </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">Jervis observes, “Measured in any conceivable way, the U</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">nited </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">S</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">tates </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">has a greater share of world power than any other</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> country </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">in history</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">.”4 That statement was as accurate when it was written in 2006 as it would have been at any time after 1991, and the </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">primacy</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> it describes </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">will long persist, even if the most pessimistic prognostications about U.S. economic, military, and tech</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">nological </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">competitiveness come true</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">. For most scholars of international relations, what really changed after 2003 were estimates of the political utility of America’s primacy. Suddenly, scholars were impressed by the fact that material preponderance does not always translate into desired outcomes. For many, theories of international relations (IR) that explain constraints on the use of power were vindicated by American setbacks in Iraq and elsewhere.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">For more than three decades, much IR scholarship has been devoted to theories about how the international environment shapes states’ behavior. 5 Applying them to the case at hand, scholars have drawn on each of the main IR theories—realism, institutionalism, constructivism, and liberalism—to identify external (or “systemic”) constraints that undermine the value of the United States’ primacy, greatly restricting the range of security policies it can pursue. Scholars emphasize a variety of elements in the international system that constrain U.S. security policy: international institutions, balancing dynamics, global economic interdependence, and legitimacy. The upshot is simple but portentous for the contours of international politics in the decades to come: the political utility of U.S. material primacy is attenuated or even negated by enduring properties of the international system.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">The purpose of this book is to undertake a systematic evaluation of the external constraints that scholars have highlighted and thereby gain a better understanding of the United States’ global role. This entails answering four questions: </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">Does the U</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">nited </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">S</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">tates </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">face</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> the imminent prospect of </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">having its power checked by</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> a </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">balancing</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> coalition of other great powers? As it has become increasingly exposed to </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">the</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> international </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">economy</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">, has the United States become more vulnerable to other actors’ attempts to influence its security policies? Is the United States tightly bound by the need to maintain a good general </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">reputation</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> for cooperation in international institutions? Does the United States need to adhere to existing rules to sustain legitimacy and thus maintain today’s international institutional order?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Our answer to each of these questions is </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">no</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">—a finding that overturns the scholarly conventional wisdom, according to which these factors strongly constrain U.S. security policy.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Perceptions of rapid polarity shifts of this sort are not unusual. In the early 1960s, only a decade after analysts had developed the notion of bipolarity, scholars were already proclaiming the return of multipolarity as postwar recoveries in Europe and Japan took off. After the fall of Saigon in 1975, they again announced the advent of multipolarity. The most influential scholarly book on international relations of the past generation, Kenneth N. Waltz’s Theory of International Politics, was written in part to dispel these flighty views and show that bipolarity still endured. If one looks past the headlines to the deep material structure of the world, Waltz argued, one will see that bipolarity is still the order of the day. Yet in the early 1990s, Waltz himself proclaimed that the return of multipolarity was around the corner. Such perceived polarity shifts are usually accompanied by decline scares—concern that as other powers rise, the United States will lose its competitive edge in foreign relations. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">The current decline scare is the fourth since 1945</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">—the first three occurred during the 1950s (Sputnik), the 1970s (Vietnam and stagflation), and the 1980s (the Soviet threat and Japan as a potential challenger).</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">In all of these cases, real changes were occurring that suggested a redistribution of power. But in each case, analysts’ responses to those changes seem to have been overblown. Multipolarity—an international system marked by three or more roughly equally matched major powers—did not return in the 1960s, 1970s, or early 1990s, and each decline scare ended with the United States’ position of primacy arguably strengthened.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">It is impossible to know for sure whether or not the scare is for real this time—shifts in the distribution of power are notoriously hard to forecast. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">Barring geopolitical upheavals</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> on the scale of Soviet collapse, the </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">inter-state scales of power</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> tend to </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">change slowly</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">. The trick is to determine when subtle quantitative shifts will lead to a major qualitative transformation of the basic structure of the international system. Fortunately, there are some simple rules of power analysis that can help prevent wild fluctuations in response to current events. Unfortunately, arguments for multipolarity’s rapid return usually run afoul of them.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Rule No. 1: Be Clear About Definitions of Power</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">It is important to ask why opinion has gyrated so wildly from bullishness to bearishness in conversations on US power. It is not—as in some of the earlier cases—that perceptions of actual US capabilities or resources have changed. The United States is still widely recognized to be the most powerful state in a material sense since the modern international system took shape in the sixteenth century. I have conducted many of these measurements myself, and I can report that </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">there has been no change in</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> these “</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">objective” indicators</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> over the past three years sufficient enough to explain a shift in elite perspectives of US power. What have shifted are peoples’ views of the real utility of these resources and capabilities. Current discussions of the limits of US power are really focused on the limited usefulness of large amounts of military and economic capabilities. Political scientists generally use the term “power” to refer to a relationship of influence. As Robert Dahl put it, power is “A’s ability to get B to do something it would not otherwise have done” (or, of course, to prevent B from doing something it otherwise would have done). In international relations, the same term of “power” is often equated with resources: measurable elements that states possess and use to influence others. In popular commentary, these two meanings of power are often conflated, with unfortunate results. To begin with, the challenge of converting power-as-resources into power-as-influence is not a uniquely US problem. All great powers confront these challenges. If the cause of the new gloominess concerning US power had to be reduced to one word, it would be “Iraq.” In 2003, fresh from apparent military victories in Afghanistan and Iraq, the United States appeared to be a colossus. Yet in 2007, its inability to suppress the Iraqi counterinsurgency and civil war seems to have revealed feet of clay. All the hard data on US military superiority—its over one-half of global defense spending, some 70 percent of global military R&amp;D, and dominance in information-intensive warfare—now appear in a new light. The world’s most vaunted military machine is not even able to tame disorganized Sunni and Shi’a militias in Mesopotamia. But the example of Iraq exhibits a balance of power dynamic between states and non-state insurgents, not one between several different states. There is no reason to believe that China, Russia, India, or the European Union would perform any better if faced with the challenges that the US military confronts in Iraq. Some scholars argue that Iraq demonstrates new information about the state versus non-state balance. They contend that counterinsurgency campaigns have become much more difficult to execute than what used to be the case. But if this is so, then it applies to all the great powers, not just the United States. According to numerous recent studies conducted by the US military and independent scholars, this argument is not correct. Insurgency has always been difficult to thwart. Once an insurgency takes root, governments rarely prevail. When they do—as in the case of Britain in South Africa at the turn of the last century and more recently, Russia in Chechnya—it is usually the result of deploying very large military forces willing to use ferocious violence on a mass scale against innocent civilians. With a comparatively small force in a large and populous country, the United States’ inability to foster stability in Iraq is tragic, but not surprising. The bottom line is that the world did not suddenly become multipolar when the United States’ counterinsurgency in Vietnam failed. And simply because high-technology weaponry has not altered the centuries-old power balance between governments and armed insurgents, it does not necessarily follow that unipolarity is about to end</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Rule No. 2: Watch the Goalposts</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">The larger problem with conflating power-as-resources with power-as-influence is that it leads to a constant shifting of the goalposts. The better the United States becomes at acquiring resources, the greater the array of global problems it is expected to be able to resolve, and the greater the apparent gap between its material capabilities and the ends it can achieve. The result is an endless raising of the bar for what it takes to be a unipolar power. Samuel Huntington defined a unipolar state as one able “effectively to resolve all important international issues alone, and no combination of other states would have the power to prevent it from doing so.” This is an extraordinary standard that essentially conflates unipolarity with universal empire. Great European powers did not lose great power status when they failed to have their way, in, for example, the Balkans in the nineteenth century. In turn, the United States did not cease to be a superpower when it failed to overthrow Fidel Castro in the 1960s. The fact that Washington cannot prevent Hugo Chavez from thumbing his nose at US power is interesting and perhaps even important, but it does not have bearing on the polarity of the international system.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Defining power as the ability to solve whatever global problem is currently in the headlines virtually guarantees highly volatile prognostications about polarity. This sort of headline chasing led to talk of “empire” in 2002 and 2003, just as it feeds today’s multipolar mania. Assessing active attempts by the United States to employ its power capabilities may well be the most misleading way to think about power. This approach inevitably leads to a selection bias against evidence of the indirect, “structural” effects of US power that are not dependent upon active management. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">Many effects</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> that can be </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">attributed to</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> the </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">unipolar</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> distribution of </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">power</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> are developments that </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">never occur</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">: </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">counter-balancing</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> coalitions, Cold War-scale </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">arms races</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">hegemonic rivalry for dominance</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">security dilemmas</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> among Asian powers, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">and decisions</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> by Japan and others </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">to nuclearize</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">(Testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, www.cbo.gov, 2/28)</span><br />
<span style="text-decoration: none;">Macroeconomic volatility has been significantly lower during the past 20 years than in preceding decades</span>. Although recessions can still be quite painful for particular sectors and workers, <span style="text-decoration: none;">recessions have been less severe overall—in duration, frequency, and magnitude—than</span> they were <span style="text-decoration: none;">between 1950 and the</span> mid-19<span style="text-decoration: none;">80s</span>. The quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in gross domestic product (GDP) have become smaller (see the top panel of Figure 1). In addition, the level and volatility of inflation over the past 20 years have also been relatively low (see the bottom panel of Figure 1). Volatility in more recent years has been less than half that of the previous period (see Table 1). The corresponding reduction in people’s uncertainty about prices allows them to plan better for the future. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Volatility has declined not only in the growth of overall GDP and inflation but also in virtually all of the major components of GDP and in aggregate unemployment, wages, and income.</span> Although there is no conclusive explanation for the decline in the volatility of GDP growth and inflation, numerous reasons have been advanced, many of which are closely interrelated. The proposed <span style="text-decoration: none;">explanations fall into four broad categories</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">A More “Flexible” Economy</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Improvements in production processes and investments in information technologies</span>(such as those that facilitate just-in-time inventory management), increases in temporary and flexible work arrangements, <span style="text-decoration: none;">and</span> the <span style="text-decoration: none;">deregulation</span> of many industries (especially in the transportation sector) have <span style="text-decoration: none;">made it possible for the economy to adjust</span> much more smoothly to changes in the availability of, or demand for, goods and services. The economy can <span style="text-decoration: none;">more easily</span> adapt <span style="text-decoration: none;">to shocks</span>, such as the energy price shock of 2004 and 2005, <span style="text-decoration: none;">without large changes</span> in output or large jumps in inflation.(1) Improvements in Financial Markets and Institutions. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Financial innovations since the 1970s have enhanced</span> businesses' and households' <span style="text-decoration: none;">access to credit and</span> thereby enabled them to borrow more readily when their income turns down. Those <span style="text-decoration: none;">innovations include improved assessment and pricing of risk</span> (including the development of credit derivatives and interest rate swaps) and the greater use of financial markets in supplying credit (through securitization, for example).(2) In addition, <span style="text-decoration: none;">changes in government regulations have allowed more diversification in banking and made housing financing more stable. Even though those changes</span> in capital markets <span style="text-decoration: none;">seem esoteric</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">they</span> appear to have broadened and deepened access to credit for both businesses and households and to <span style="text-decoration: none;">have improved the resiliency of the financial system by spreading the risk of default more widely and efficiently</span>. Management of Monetary Policy. During the past two decades, the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Federal Reserve</span> has shown a strong commitment to keeping inflation low and stable. Its <span style="text-decoration: none;">actions</span> to reduce and contain inflationary pressures seem, in turn, to have <span style="text-decoration: none;">stabilized</span> firms’ and households’ <span style="text-decoration: none;">expectations of future inflation. As a result, the Federal Reserve has not needed to respond as forcefully as in the past to dampen swings in expectations of inflation or to bring inflation down</span> from a high level. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The result may be reduced macroeconomic volatility. </span> Fewer Shocks to <span style="text-decoration: none;">the</span> Economy. <span style="text-decoration: none;">This explanation—that fewer shocks to the economy</span>, particularly the worldwide economy, <span style="text-decoration: none;">have occurred</span>—was proposed before the rapid rise in oil prices from 2004 to mid-2006. Given the mild effect of that oil price shock on economies worldwide, the explanation <span style="text-decoration: none;">now seems less persuasive</span>. Moreover, <span style="text-decoration: none;">overall</span> U.S. economic <span style="text-decoration: none;">growth was little affected by</span> other <span style="text-decoration: none;">major shocks during the past 20 years, such as the Asian currency crisis of</span> 1997, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the Russian debt crisis</span> of 1998, <span style="text-decoration: none;">and the terrorist attacks</span> of September 11, 2001.<br />

<br />
The question may be reformulated. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Do wars spring from</span> a popular reaction to <span style="text-decoration: none;">a sudden economic crisis</span> that exacerbates poverty and growing disparities in wealth and incomes? Perhaps one could argue, as some scholars do, that it is some dramatic event or sequence of such events leading to the exacerbation of poverty that, in turn, leads to this deplorable denouement. This exogenous factor might act as a catalyst for a violent reaction on the part of the people or on the part of the political leadership who would then possibly be tempted to seek a diversion by finding or, if need be, fabricating an enemy and setting in train the process leading to war. <span style="text-decoration: none;">According to a study</span> under- <span style="text-decoration: none;">taken by</span> Minxin Pei and Ariel Adesnik of<span style="text-decoration: none;"> the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, there would not appear to be any merit in this hypothesis. After studying ninety-three episodes of economic crisis in twenty-two countries</span> in Latin America and Asia in the <span style="text-decoration: none;">years since the Second World War they concluded that</span>:19 <span style="text-decoration: none;">Much of the conventional wisdom about the political impact of economic crises may be wrong ... The severity of economic crisis</span> – as measured in terms of inflation and negative growth <span style="text-decoration: none;">– bore no relationship to the collapse of regimes ... (or</span>, in democratic states, rarely) <span style="text-decoration: none;">to an outbreak of violence</span> ... In the cases of dictatorships and semi-democracies, the ruling elites responded to crises by increasing repression (thereby using one form of violence to abort another).<br />

Niall Ferguson: “There will be blood, in the sense that <span style="text-decoration: none;">a crisis of this magnitude is bound to increase</span> political as well as economic [<span style="text-decoration: none;">conflict</span>]. It is bound to destabilize some countries. It will cause civil wars to break out, that have been dormant. It will topple governments that were moderate and bring in governments that are extreme. These things are pretty predictable. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The question is whether the general destabilization</span>, the return of, if you like, political risk, ultimately <span style="text-decoration: none;">leads to something really big in</span> the realm of <span style="text-decoration: none;">geopolitics. That seems a less certain outcome.</span> We've already talked about why <span style="text-decoration: none;">China and the U</span>nited <span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span>tates <span style="text-decoration: none;">are in an embrace they don't dare end. If Russia is looking for trouble</span> the way Mr. Putin seems to be, <span style="text-decoration: none;">I</span> still have some <span style="text-decoration: none;">doubt</span> as to <span style="text-decoration: none;">whether it can really make this trouble, because of the weakness of the Russian economy.</span> It's hard to imagine Russia invading Ukraine without weakening its economic plight. They're desperately trying to prevent the ruble from falling off a cliff. <span style="text-decoration: none;">They're spending all their reserves to prop it up. It's hardly going to help if they do another Georgia</span>.”<br />
“I was more struck Putin's bluster than his potential to bite, when he spoke at Davos. But he made a really good point, which I keep coming back to. In his speech, he said crises like this will encourage governments to engage in foreign policy aggression. I don't think he was talking about himself, but he might have been. It's true, one of the things historically that we see, and also when we go back to 30s, but also to the depressions 1870s and 1980s, weak regimes will often resort to a more aggressive foreign policy, to try to bolster their position. It's legitimacy that you can gain without economic disparity – playing the nationalist card. I wouldn't be surprised to see some of that in the year ahead.<br />
It's just that <span style="text-decoration: none;">I don't see it producing anything comparable with</span> 19<span style="text-decoration: none;">14 or</span> 19<span style="text-decoration: none;">39. It's</span> kind of <span style="text-decoration: none;">hard to envisage a world war.</span> Even when most pessimistic, I struggle to see how that would work, because <span style="text-decoration: none;">the U.S., for all its difficulties</span> in the financial world, <span style="text-decoration: none;">is</span> so <span style="text-decoration: none;">overwhelmingly dominant in the military world.”</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Constraints on the capacity of adversaries also needs to be taken into account. Russia under Putin has put pressure on its immediate neighbors and seeks to rebuild its armed forces, but Moscow’s ability to regain the superpower status of the former Soviet Union remains limited. The Russian armed forces are in woeful condition, the total population is half that of the USSR and declining by 700,000 per year, the economy is overwhelmingly dependent on revenues from oil and natural gas and thus vulnerable if world market prices soften, and the long term stability of its crony capitalism and increasingly authoritarian political system are uncertain. China, despite extraordinary economic growth and modernization, will continue to depend on rapid expansion of trade and the absorption of vast numbers of people moving from the countryside to the cities. It may well become a major military challenger of the United States, first regionally and even globally, but only over the long term. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">First, the present dispute lacks the Cold War’s system-forming element, that is, bipolarity. In addition to the global and transregional centers of economic and military force, such as the U.S., the EU, Japan, Russia and China, the world is witnessing the growth of regional leaders, among them India, Pacific ‘small tigers,’ member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Iran, Brazil, South Africa and Nigeria. Additionally, the mighty currents of globalization and the information revolution are eroding traditional forms of interstate relations. Nor can we discount the ubiquitous growth of nationalism, and the increased role of transnational economic, political and even military actors. Russian-U.S. relations no longer represent the central axis of global politics. It is just one of its many facets – and not the most important one in many issues. Apart from some contradictions, Russia and the West share major common interests. Finally, they have other competitors beside themselves. Thus, a zero-sum game is out of the question. Whatever disagreements may divide Russia and the West, they are on the same side of the barricades in the ongoing international conflicts. In Afghanistan, for example, they act jointly, seeking to prevent a resurgence of Taliban and al-Qaeda activities. On other issues, such as the nuclear programs of North Korea and Iran, and the situations involving Palestine and Nagorno-Karabakh, they are attempting to solve these problems through multilateral negotiations. The once irreconcilable ideological rivalry between the two parties is now relegated to the past. The real ideological divide now lies between liberal-democratic values and Islamic radicalism, between the North and the South, and between the forces of globalization and anti-globalization. Russia may not be fertile ground for liberal values, but it will certainly never embrace radical Islam. Over the last 20 years, Russia has sustained the greatest losses in the struggle against Islamic extremism (the war in Afghanistan, and the wars and conflicts in Chechnya, Dagestan and Tajikistan).With regard to the arms race, despite the current growth in U.S. and Russian defense spending, the present situation is not remotely comparable to what took place during the Cold War. In the period from 1991 to 2012, that is, since the signing in Moscow of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START-I) until the expiry of the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT, also known as the Moscow Treaty), signed in 2002, the strategic and tactical nuclear weapons of the two countries will be reduced by about 80 percent [the Moscow Treaty expires on December 31, 2012].&gt;&gt;</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">Over the years, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">we've heard numerous theories and hypotheses as to how the dinosaurs went extinct, and what caused the global event responsible for it. We've been thought to believe a comet or an asteroid is more than capable of wiping out all life on Earth, but a new research seems to contradict that.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> That's not to say that an asteroid wouldn't have the ability to destroy us altogether, but </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">it would also have to do away with the entire planet in the process</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">. For any other cases, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">the original impact has to be doubled by a secondary extinction event, to ensure that life is completely annihilated.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> And, according to the latest studies, it would appear that the “honor” belongs to volcanoes, which are the ones stirred up immediately after a comet impacts the crust. Because of the large amount of vibrations and the immense shock, most craters near the impact site, and later others, explode, and the magma trapped underground finally finds its way out. But the true extinction comes from the plumes of these volcanoes, from the ashes and the dust that set around their cones for hundreds of miles. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">Scientists at the Hobart and William Smith Colleges,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> led by Nan Arens, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">argue in a paper published recently in the journal Paleobiology that there are two types of extinction events – “pulls” and “presses.” A “pull” is a sudden event, such as a comet or an asteroid impact, while “presses” are more Earthly phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions that last for millions of years. Their research shows that a “pull” alone is not enough to destroy 90 percent of life on the planet, as it happened during the Permian-Triassic extinction period. Rather, that particular destruction was caused by a volcano in Siberia, which erupted non-stop for well over 200,000 years.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> This means that it wasn't shock or flying stones that killed all animals, but climate change, as nature became unable to support life, due to all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The global warming process that was triggered by the eruption allowed only for a very short range of creatures to survive, along with trees, which multiplied in order to get more carbon out of the air. Naturally, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">when both “pulls” and “presses” are combined, the results are devastating. 65 million years ago, when a comet struck the Earth, near the Yucatan Peninsula,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> the Deccan Traps, a supermassive volcano over what is today India was already erupting. This meant that the dinosaurs never stood a chance of surviving in the shape that they had at the time. As a result, their only living relatives are now some turtles, crocodiles, and a few birds.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">The smallest falling bodies, those </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">with diameters under a few meters, are of “no practical concern,” </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">says Chapman, and in fact they are to be desired, at least by those who keep their eyes on the skies watching for brilliant fireballs whose burning up in the atmosphere provides a show far more spectacular than the most lavish Fourth of July fireworks. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">Even bodies with diameters of 10–30 meters</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">, of which Chapman estimates six may fall to earth in a century, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">cause little more than broken windows. They explode too high in the atmosphere to cause serious harm</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">. The next largest potential strikers of Earth are those in the Tunguska range of 30 meters–100 meters. The shock waves from the atmospheric explosion would “topple trees, wooden structures and ignit[e] fires within 10 kilometers,” writes Chapman. Human deaths could result if the explosion took place over a populated area. Though Chapman estimates the likelihood of a Tunguska occurring in any given century at four in ten, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">it is worth noting that there is no evidence that such an explosion has killed a single human being in all of recorded history</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">. Either we’re overdue or that 40 percent is high. Moreover, given that the location of such an explosion is utterly unpredictable</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">, it would be far more likely to happen over an ocean or a desert than over, say, Tokyo or Manhattan. The after effects would be minimal, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">and Chapman says that “nothing practical can be done about this modest hazard other than to clean up after the event.” In fact, “It makes no sense to plan ahead for such a modest disaster… other than educating the public about the possibility.” </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">The cost of a telescopic survey capable of picking up bodies of such diminutive size would be prohibitive</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">. It would be the ultimate Astronomers Full Employment Act. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">A body of 100 meters–300 meters in diameter would either explode at low altitude or upon impact with the ground</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">; it would be “regionally devastating,” but </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">Chapman pegs the chances of such a catastrophe at 1 percent per century</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">. A small nation could be destroyed </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">by the impact of a body of 300 meters—1 km in diameter</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">, or a “flying mountain” of sorts, which would explode with energy yield ten times more than “the largest thermonuclear bomb ever tested.” If striking land, it would carve out a crater deeper than the Grand Canyon. If it hit a populated area, the death toll could be in the hundreds of thousands. The likelihood of such a collision </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">Chapman estimates at 0.2 percent per century. An asteroid or comet of 1–3 kilometers in diameter </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">would cause “major regional destruction,” possibly verging on “civilization-destruction level.” Chapman puts </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">the chances of this at 0.02 percent per century. The impact of a body more than 3 kilometers in diameter might plunge the Earth into a new Dark Age</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">, killing most of its inhabitants, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">though the chances of this are “extremely remote”— less than one in 50,000 per century</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;">. Finally, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">mass extinction would likely occur should a body greater than 10 kilometers pay us a visit, though the chances of this are less than one in a million every century, or so infinitesimal that even the most worry-wracked hypochondriac will not lose sleep over the possibility.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> In fact, for any impact with a Chapman-calculated likelihood of less than one in a thousand per century, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px; text-decoration: none;">he concedes that there is “little justification for mounting asteroid-specific mitigation measures.” The chance of a civilization-ender is so remote that he counsels no “advance preparations” — or almost none.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13.3333px;"> For Chapman recommends further study of NEOs, as well as investigation into methods of their diversion. 82 This is exactly what the NEO lobby wants.</span><br />
