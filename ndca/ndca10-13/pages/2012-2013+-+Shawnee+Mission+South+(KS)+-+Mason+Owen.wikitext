======Disclaimer====== 
I'm not a frequent LD debater, i've focused a lot more on policy debate this year. I'll be updating this page for the CFL national tournament. The LD debate in my district has rather inexperienced judges, so i'm not going to bother with previously read arguments from earlier this season due to their Lay style adaptation. If you would like to know what kinds of arguments i like to read and go for, go ahed and either check out my Policy Wiki

==Horrors of War== 
===1AC=== 

[[file:1AC.docx]]

===2AC Overview=== 

**WWI German soldier Paul Hub writes to his girlfriend:**
**“I've already seen quite a lot of misery of war. . . . Maria, this sort of a war is so //unspeakably miserable//. If only you saw a line of stretcher-bearers with their burdens, you'd know what I mean. I haven't had a chance to shoot yet. We're having to deal with an unseen enemy. . . . Every day brings //new horrors//. . . . Every day the fighting gets fiercer and there is still no end in sight. Our blood is flowing in torrents. . . . That's how it is. All around me, the most gruesome devastation. Dead and wounded soldiers, dead and dying animals, horse cadavers, burnt-out houses, dug-up fields, cars, clothes, weaponry — all this is scattered around me, a real mess. I didn't think war would be like this. We can't sleep for all the noise.”**

**Tournament after tournament, year after year debaters travel to the CFL national tournament to test their knowledge of making ethical decisions when lives are on the line, but too often are we separated through text, through TV, through media FROM the implications of our values. It’s easy to say that initiating war is necessary when we’re not on the frontline shooting at enemies, when we’re not civilians wondering if today will be the day that a drone strikes our home. A typical Affirmative would present their case, we’d have a debate, and we’d file our discussion away in our tubs and folders and leave the experience to end once you’ve written the last word on your ballot. But what we have a unique opportunity to do is to interrogate the methods and practices present in the debate community. Instead of reducing the topic to a simple game of wits and cards to be thrown around and disposed of, we should approach the question of initiating war from a different perspective, the REAL experiences that we never get to see (or rather, never want to see).**

**These effects of war that make us uncomfortable have to be brought into focus—shutting out these discussions in the name of ideology or argumentative tradition systematically silences the voices of people who suffer this structural violence—this means that ultimately these problems in the world will never be solved**

**This debate comes down to who best performatively and methodologically makes War real— My 1AC unearths depictions of these Wars and how they effect people who we exclude from discussions, and ultimately body counts. Passages and narratives from people who fought and died in initiated Wars, aesthetic interpretations in literature, vivid images of what happens when we say that it is ok for “Just countries to initiate war.”**

**Voting for me is not going to resolve conflict or make these wars magically disappear, but what it does is verify the truth in not just my words but those of Tim O’brien, Paul Hub, Haider Asghar, and countless others who have suffered from these decisions that we push out of our sight for something more comforting. We use the knowledge that we gain from discussions like this in our everyday lives which shapes how we as individuals engage in institutional as well as micro-political movements to affect the world that we live in. With that, let’s look at the Negatives specific arguments.**

=<span style="line-height: 1.5;">CFL Negative Strategies</span>= 

==Value--Preserving Human life== 

**My Value is preservation of Human life—this should be evaluated by who best limits suffering and prevents loss of life. Here is evidentiary support:**
Mitchell <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Smolkin, </span>doctor who specializes in depression, Understanding Pain, 19<span style="font-size: 12pt;">89</span> p75-79

For Camus, the absurdity of the human condition consists in the incongruity between what humans naturally desire, and the reality of the world. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Humans naturally desire not to be injured and killed. They desire to understand life and</span> to <span style="font-size: 10pt;">find meaning in living.</span> They desire to feel at home in the universe. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Despite these</span> natural <span style="font-size: 10pt;">needs, [humanity]</span> man is confronted with a silent universe that does not answer human questions about meaning. He <span style="font-size: 10pt;">is surrounded by</span> irrational <span style="font-size: 10pt;">destructiveness, and</span> by <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the spectre of suffering and pain hurtling out of the void capriciously at human recipients with no regard for their relative merits.</span> Man is estranged from a universe which seems so antagonistic to his natural needs. He feels homeless, in exile, a stranger in his own land. He <span style="font-size: 10pt;">[Humanity] hears</span> his <span style="font-size: 10pt;">“nights and days filled</span> always, everywhere <span style="font-size: 10pt;">with the eternal cry of</span> human <span style="font-size: 10pt;">pain.”</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">56 Man has been “sentenced, for an unknown crime to an indeterminate period of punishment. And while a good many people adapted themselves to confinement and carried out their humdrum lives as before, there were others who rebelled, and whose one idea was to break loose from the prison house.” Like Ivan Karamozov (Bk V, Chap 4), Camus refuses to accept the idea that future goods such as Divine salvation or eternal happiness “can compensate for a single moment of human suffering,”57 or a child’s tears. Both Ivan Karamozov and Camus believe that “if evil is essential to Divine creation, then creation is unacceptable.” They wish to replace “the reign of grace by the reign of justice.”58 They both assert that no good man would accept salvation on these terms. “There is no possible salvation for the man who feels real compassion,” because he would side with the damned and for their sake reject eternity.59 What is to be gained by rebellion, what are its dangers, and </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">how does one avoid</span> merely <span style="font-size: 10pt;">“beating the sea with rods” in a nihilistic orgy?</span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">With great perceptiveness, Camus discusses these issues in The Rebel. He begins by outlining the entire history of nihilistic rebellion. He admits that once God is declared dead and life meaningless, there is the tendency to rebel in anger by engaging in irrational acts of violence and destruction. Andre Breton has written that the simplest surrealistic act consists “in going out in the Street, revolver in hand, and shooting at random into the crowd.”6° Camus cites “the struggle between the will to be and the desire for annihilation, between the yes and the no, which we have discovered again and again at every stage of rebellion.”61 Citing numerous historical examples, he continually warns against this degeneration of rebellion into crime and murder. Another danger of rebellion which Camus discusses is the sub- stitution of human gods and concepts of salvation for the dead God. This error is more subtle than shooting at random into the crowd, but leads to much more killing and human suffering than the nihilist sniper. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Camus criticizes “Nietzsche</span>, at least <span style="font-size: 10pt;">in his theory of super-humanity,</span> and Marx before him, with his classless society, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">[who]</span> both <span style="font-size: 10pt;">replace The Beyond by the Later On.”</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">62 In this respect, these thinkers have not abandoned the notion that history marches toward redemption in which some messianic goal will be realized. Camus urges moderation in the quest for distant goals. He writes, “the absolute is not attained nor, above all, created through history. Politics is not religion, or if it is, then it is nothing but the inquisition.”63 </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">He contrasts rebellion, which he applauds with revolution which leads to murder</span> in the name of vague future goals. “<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Revolution consists in loving[those]</span> a man <span style="font-size: 10pt;">who does not yet exist,” and in murdering [those]</span> men <span style="font-size: 10pt;">who do</span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">exist.64 “He who dedicates himself to this history, dedicates himself to nothing, and in his turn is nothing.”65 In The Plague, the character Tarrou renounces his revolutionary past. He states, For many years I’ve been ashamed, mortally ashamed of having been, even with the best intentions, even at many removes, a murderer in my turn. . . All I maintain is that on this earth there are pestilences and there are victims, and its up to us, so far as possible, not to join forces with the pestil- ences.66 Though obviously attuned to the dangers of rebellion, he insists that “these consequences are in no way due to rebellion itself, or at least they occur to the extent that the rebel forgets his original purpose.”67 What is the original purpose that has been forgotten? Rebellion begins because the rebel denounces the lack of justice in the world. He denounces the idea that the end, whether it be the coming of the messianic age, or the revo- lution, or eternal bliss, justifies means which involve so much suffering.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Once injustice and suffering are denounced, [people]</span> man <span style="font-size: 10pt;">need</span>s <span style="font-size: 10pt;">to exert all</span> his <span style="font-size: 10pt;">effort against injustice and in solidarity with the sufferers</span> in the world. Killing existing men for a questionable future good, would not be a rational method of exhibi tingsolidarity with the sufferers. Nor would solidarity be shown by stoical acceptance of the status quo. Camus urges his rebels to renounce murder completely and <span style="font-size: 10pt;">work for justice and</span> for <span style="font-size: 10pt;">a decrease in suffering.</span> Like Dr. Rieux in The Plague, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">one should take the victim’s side and “share with</span> his <span style="font-size: 10pt;">fellow citizens the only certitude they have in common—love, exile, suffering.”</span>68 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">What can be accomplished through rebellion? Camus</span>’ goals are modest. He <span style="font-size: 10pt;">realizes that the rebel is doomed to “a never ending defeat,”</span>69 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">in that</span> death, finitude and <span style="font-size: 10pt;">suffering will always conquer</span> him. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">He realizes that after [humanity]</span> man <span style="font-size: 10pt;">has mastered everything in creation</span> that can be mastered and rectified everything that can be rectified, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">children will still die unjustly even in a perfect society.</span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Even by his greatest effort man can only purpose to diminish arithmetically the sufferings of the world. But the injustice and the suffering will remain and, no matter how limited they are, they will not cease to be an outrage.7° </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">However, there are ephemeral victories and rewards for the rebel. </span>He <span style="font-size: 10pt;">[One] who dedicates [oneself]</span> himself for the duration of his life to the house he builds, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">to the dignity of [hu]mankind,</span> dedicates himself the earth and <span style="font-size: 10pt;">reaps from it the harvest that sows its seed and sustains the world again and again. Those whose</span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">desires are limited to man and his humble yet formidable love, should enter, if only now and then, into their reward. They know that if there is one thing one can always yearn for and sometimes attain, it is human love. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Society must be arranged to limit injustice and suffering as much as possible so that each individual has the leisure and freedom to</span> pursue his own <span style="font-size: 10pt;">search for meaning. Future utopias must be renounced, and “history can no longer be presented as an object of worship.”</span>74 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">“It is time to forsake our age and its adolescent furies,” and to aim for what is possible—more justice, solidarity, and love among [people]</span> men. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The rebel must</span> “reject divinity in order to <span style="font-size: 10pt;">share in the struggles and destiny of all</span> men.”75 Redemption is impossible. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Human dignity and love can intermittently be achieved with struggle and constant vigilance against the plague</span> bacillus <span style="font-size: 10pt;">that “never</span> dies or <span style="font-size: 10pt;">disappears</span> for good. .. [but can] rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city.”76


==Realism/Schmitt cards== 

**Assuming there is a final solution to the question of war creates excessive violence—Just Societies should engage to check escalation.**
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Rasch 4 </span>(William, Prof. of German Studies, Indiana U, Sovereignty and its Discontents, Birkbeck Law Press, pg. 70-71) my
Despite a persistent tendency to identify Schmitt’s friend/enemy distinction automatically with this absolutist position, his commentary on St Joan’s response indicates an alternative, one that not only emulates St Joan’s modesty regarding knowledge of God’s likes and dislikes, but also one that is carefully agnostic with regard to the feasibility of the Marxist project. Emphasizing, as Schmitt does, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the essentially agonistic aspect of politics is not the same as equating it with revolution.</span> When Schmitt originally advanced the friend/ enemy pair in his The Concept of the Political, he explicitly dissociated it from moral, aesthetic, or other categories (Schmitt, 1976, pp 25–27). Far from being cynical, this disassociation was itself ethically motivated, since Schmitt felt that e<span style="font-size: 10pt;">xcesses of violence could only be limited by acknowledging conflict as an existentially inevitable and thus a thoroughly legitimate feature of all genuine political activity. He defines politics as conflict, not to glorify violence, but to regulate i</span>t.7 Thus Schmitt’s notion of the political – to continue with the imagery introduced by St Joan – assumes that God respected the distance that separates the Heavenly from the Earthly City, or at least assumes that there is no one on earth who has exclusive and privileged access to the heavenly vision. Consequently, in the absence of an ultimate judge who could decide the outcome of mortal disputes, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">politics becomes the structure by which shape is given to the unavoidable necessity of conflict. Politics is</span> not the means by which the universally acknowledged Good is actualized, but <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the mechanism that negotiates and limits disputes in the absence of any universally acknowledged Good</span>. Politics exists because the just society does not. It soon becomes apparent, therefore, that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">if political struggle is an ever-shifting alliance of friends confronting an ever-shifting alliance of enemies</span>, if politics is more Sisyphean than millennial, then <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the aim of revolution is precisely the abolition of politics, the abolition of conflict and dissent, all done in the name of a universal principle</span> that is enunciated by a privileged particular instance. In other words, from within a given framework, from within a given social order, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">politics-as-conflict cannot be seen as the revolutionary destruction of the system, but rather as the activity that reproduces the system</span>. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Enemies are as much a part of this reproduction as friends</span>. Thus, from the perspective of a thoroughly agonistic politics, the demand for revolution can only be seen as an eschatological appeal to a singular vision of the good life, the actualization of which would eventually preclude further political conflict. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">In a just society, we must all be friends, because there are no actual enemies, only absolute ones. And these must be absolutely eliminated</span>.8

**States will inevitably compete for power to survive—this aspect of Realism means that there will always be certain instances where initiating war is good to check the escalation of conflict.**
John<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt" style="font-size: 12pt;">Mearsheimer </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">– </span>Prof of PoliSci at U. Chicago<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> – </span><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt" style="font-size: 12pt;">2001</span>The Tragedy of Great Power Politics p. 2-3
This <span style="font-size: 10pt;">unrelenting pursuit of power means that great powers are inclined to look for opportunities to alter the distribution of world power in their favor</span>. They will seize these opportunities if they have the necessary capability. Simply put, great powers are primed for offense. But not only does a great power seek to gain power at the expense of other states, it also tries to thwart rivals bent on gaining power at its expense. Thus, a great power will defend the balance of power when looming change favors another state, and it will try to undermine the balance when the direction of change is in its own favor. Why do great powers behave this way? My answer is that <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the structure of international system forces states which seek only to be secure nonetheless to act aggressively</span> toward each other. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Three features </span>of the international system <span style="font-size: 10pt;">combine to cause states to fear one another: 1) the absence of a central authority that</span> sites above states and <span style="font-size: 10pt;">can protect them from each other, 2) the fact that states always have some offensive military capability, and 3) the fact that states can never be certain about other states’ intentions. Given this fear – which can never be wholly eliminated – states recognize that the more powerful they are relative to their rivals, the better their chances of survival.</span> Indeed, the best guarantee of survival is to be a hegemon, because no other state can seriously threaten such a mighty power.

==Invade Iran Hypo-Testing!== 

**The word “Never” in the resolution means the Affirmative is an absolute declarative statement, and must prove that a deliberately initiated war could never be justified. All I have to do as the Negative is prove this untrue in one instance to give you a reason why the resolution that the 1AC defends is either bad, or just not true. I will prove that there is an exception to this rule. The exception is Iran.**
**Deliberately initiating a War with Iran is not just beneficial, but necessary for several reasons:**

==**Value Justification/Nietzsche K**== 

**There is no inherent, a-priori morality in the world. There are no transcendent values. To affirm a moral sense because one simply ought to is the ultimate form of tautology. The unquestioning acceptance of morality in the 1AC allows arbitrary values to become divine and negates the beauty in deciding morality for the self**
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Turnali, 03</span> (The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 26 (2003) 55-63, Nietzsche and the Later Wittgenstein: An Offense to the Quest for Another World, Aydan Turanli, Professor, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Istanbul Technical
University).

Nietzsche questions idealization in ethics: <span style="font-size: 10pt;">On the Genealogy of Morals is designed to show that concepts regarding moral issues cannot be analyzed in a vacuum</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">and this attitude is actually the product of thinking that there can be an external standpoint in analyzing concepts. Nietzsche criticizes Plato's attempt to define the perfect man through concepts such as "good," "wise," "just," and "dialectician." According to him, this is to define "individuum in itself." It is the "denaturalization of moral values" (WP II 430) and to remove a plant from all soil.</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Moral values are naturalized through Nietzsche's conceptual analysis: he gives the genealogy of the concepts "good" and "evil" to show that there are no moral values such as good-in-itself and morality-in-itself over and above the actual uses of "good" and "evil." "Good" and "bad" are not defined by our a priori knowledge of them</span>. In order to show this he appeals to descriptions of historical processes in which these concepts have been used. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The origin of evil does not lie behind this world</span>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Rather than searching for the origin behind this world, we should, Nietzsche suggests, ask "under what conditions did man invent the value judgements good and evil" (GM III Preface). Nietzsche's depiction of the master-slave morality presumes that the relation between the concepts "good" and "bad" depends on a class relation, the relation between the ruling class and the lower class. "Good" was imposed upon the lower class by the upper or ruling class (GM I 2). "Good" was always associated with the upper class, with Aryans, fair-haired, noble, spiritually distinct, and pure. "Bad" was identified with working class, common, inferior, and poor. Historically, they were correlated with race and class. While previously concepts or values such as "good," "noble," "happy," and "powerful" were under the monopoly of aristocrats, with the influence of the Slave Revolt of Jews and Christians this changed. "Good" became associated with the poor, powerless, sick, ugly, and truly blessed (GM I 6). Hence, in almost all nations, the values "good," and "bad" were inculcated, or imposed upon the lower class by the ruling class, the class that possesses power.</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nietzsche's analyses of moral values show that there is no a priori necessity for associating the word "good" with unegoistic actions</span>(GM I 2). <span style="font-size: 10pt;">There is no meaning-in-itself determining the meaning of the concepts "good" and "bad" once and for all. Other concepts concerning moral values such as "guilt," "obligation," or "justice" are also analyzed in historical perspective in the Genealogy. They too, like other moral concepts, are seen within the perspective of class relationships, power relationships, purchase and sale relationships, and exchange relationships of creditor and debtor. Nietzsche's conviction that there is no one characteristic defining moral values stems from his complete rejection of the traditional Platonic understanding. For him, the whole history of a thing, or a custom, is a chain of reinterpretations</span> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">rather than progress toward a goal (GM II 12). With this step Nietzsche rejects traditional teleological explanations and this paves the way for accepting the fluidity of meanings. The concept of "punishment," for example, has many meanings (GM II 13). The conclusions Nietzsche draws from the analysis of the concept "punishment" show the great similarities between his views and those of Wittgenstein. Nietzsche says, "the history of punishment up to now in general, the history of its use for a variety of purposes, finally crystallizes in a kind of unity which is difficult to dissolve back into its elements, difficult to analyse and, this has to be stressed, is absolutely undefinable" (ibid.). He says further that "all concepts in which an entire process is semiotically concentrated defy definition; only something which has no history can be defined" (ibid.). He also stresses that there cannot be one element defining a concept, because although in some cases one element becomes predominant, in other cases other elements may become important. So the definition of "punishment" per se cannot be given because it is totally dependent on history, context, and uses in actual cases. This is very similar to Wittgenstein's concept of "family resemblance." Wittgenstein too points out that concepts have meaning only in the flux of life and most concepts of daily life cannot be defined by a single characteristic. There is no quality of **[End Page 59]** a concept corresponding to the actual features of the world in our immediate environment. Hence, the intrinsic definition of concepts cannot be given. Despite this, Wittgenstein and Nietzsche differ with respect to the methodology of conceptual analysis. Nietzsche goes to the origins of concepts. He gives the genealogy of concepts. According to him, concepts can only have meaning when seen from a historical perspective. He appeals to history, and shows in what ways concepts were used under different circumstances. Wittgenstein, on the other hand, by showing connections between concepts, tries to get us to see that most of our concepts elude clear-cut definition. While criticizing Frege's view that a concept should have definite boundaries, he says, "Stand roughly there" is also enough to describe a concept (PI §71). To define the concept "game," we give examples and we intend them to be taken in a particular way. There is nothing common to all types of games. There is rather "a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail" (PI §66). Wittgenstein does not appeal to history; he does not give us the origin of concepts. He suggests that we look and see how concepts are used in daily life, and what relation they have to other concepts in order to show us that there is no uniformity in their usage. The point of similarity, on the other hand, is that both Nietzsche and Wittgenstein reject categories and a prioricity. According to Nietzsche, the-meaning-in-itself, like other concepts of traditional metaphysics such as "unity," "truth," "purpose," "totality," "permanence," "doer," "atom," and "the thing-in-itself," is "only the seduction of language (and the fundamental errors of reason petrified within it)" (GM I 13</span>). <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nothing in the world actually corresponds to these concepts. They are, for Nietzsche, subjective categories of the human mind having no objective existence</span>. … Nietzsche's rejection of traditional metaphysics finds its culmination in his remark "God is dead." <span style="font-size: 10pt;">For Nietzsche, "God is dead" can be interpreted as saying that there is no realm of transcendent reality, no supersensible world, no absolute values. Presupposing that there are two different realms, one an immutable, absolute realm of universal essences, is to degrade the world in which we live into a world of illusion. It is to deny reality, the world of senses, of change, and opposition. With the devaluation of the highest values,</span>Nietzsche abandons the idea that there are two worlds having an unequal ontological rank: the true and transcendent world of ideas and the inferior world of senses<span style="font-size: 10pt;">. The only world we have is the world of sensations, change, and contradiction</span>.

==Impact Turn--Dedev==

**Economic collapse does not cause war—their historical arguments are wrong**

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Lewis ‘98</span>
[Chris H. Lewis, Professor of American Studies at the University of Colorado-Boulder, 1998, in The Coming Age of Scarcity, Dobkowski and Wallimann, eds, pp. 55-56.]
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The successful collapse of global industrial civilization is</span>, in part, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">dependent on the 80 percent not fully integrated with the global economy breaking free from their ties to modern industrial civilization</span>. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Faced with growing threats of economic and ecological collapse, many underdeveloped nations and regions should declare their independence from the global economy, recognizing that this economy is the larger cause of their poverty. After breaking free from the First World’s economic and political hegemony, underdeveloped countries can then use their resources and people to feed themselves and improve their quality of life</span>. Of course, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">we have been witnessing such attempts for the past fifty years</span> after World War II as colonial and neocolonial struggles for independence. The <span style="font-size: 10pt;">wars in Vietnam, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Angola, Mozambique, Somalia, and in the nations of the former Soviet Union were all struggles to win independence from foreign domination</span>. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The cold war was</span>, in large part, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">a struggle between the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 10pt;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 10pt;">and the Soviet Union over who would dominate the modern world and the so-called nonaligned nations</span> of the Third World. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">With the global instability created by the end of the cold war, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the decline of American hegemony, underdeveloped countries may find that they have the strategic opportunity to demand their independence from First World domination</span>. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">They can refuse to pay their debts, withdraw from the global industrial economy, nationalize foreign corporations that are exploiting their wealth, and create local and regional economies to support their own people</span>. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">But</span> Third World <span style="font-size: 10pt;">independence from the First World-dominated global economy will not come without a heavy economic, political, and military price. With the withdrawal of underdeveloped countries from the global economy within the next thirty to fifty years, the developed countries will face continual material, ecological, and energy shortages that will force them to downscale their economies</span>. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The First World will</span>, ironically, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">be forced to follow the lead of the Third World and create local and regional economies that are sustainable and self-sufficient</span>. In many instances, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">nations will break up, forming smaller polities tied together by ethnic, religious, or social bonds</span>. If <span style="font-size: 10pt;">these polities</span> and nations take responsibility for helping their peoples survive the hardship and suffering imposed by the devolution of the global industrial civilization and economy, they <span style="font-size: 10pt;">will be better able to reduce the real threat of mass death and genocide that will arise from the collapse of modern industrial civilization</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The core elements in the response to the events of September 11, 2001 made by Western media, governments, and general publics was a stunned incredulity that anyone would want to do such things. </span>As the editors of Monthly Review put it, people respond as if "A benevolent democratic and peace loving nation was brutally attacked by insane evil terrorists who hate the US …" 1. Consequently the acts could only be interpreted as irrational, unjustified, criminal and driven by fanaticism and/or insanity. This response derives from the dominant view of the way the global economy works. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">This view assumes a world market economy in which a nation’s fate is rightly determined primarily by its capacity to compete according to the rules of the impartial and efficient global market place. </span>Rich nations are assumed to have achieved far higher living standards because they are further down the path to modernity, a path which all can and will follow, although many Third World countries are severely handicapped by corruption, difficult environments and lack of resources. Rich countries are taken to assist poor countries in their struggle to develop, giving aid and loans and bringing foreign investment. Because development is essentially seen in terms of increasing the volume of production for sale it is understood that the more poor countries facilitate market forces, trade and investment, financial transfers with rich countries the faster development will occur. The problems poor countries experience are seen to be either due to difficult circumstances beyond their control, such as poor soils, overpopulation, or corruption, or their technical and social backwardness. The relationship is therefore regarded as being based on mutual benefit, and more commonly as noble in that rich countries are helping poor countries to develop. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">This dominant, taken for granted view of the situation is almost entirely invalid. </span>Following are some of the core elements in a more accurate representation of the way the world works. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Rich countries are taking most of the world’s resource production. </span>Their per capita resource consumption is about 20 times the average of the poorest half of the world’s people. That they are consuming far more than their fair share is evident in many measures; for example, to provide a North American lifestyle requires approximately 12 ha of productive land, but the per capital average amount of productive land on the planet is only 1.2 ha. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The rich squander resources on affluent living standards and frivolous luxuries while billions live in poverty. </span>Many of these resources are drawn from the Third World. Much of the productive capacity of the Third World has been allocated to the production of commodities and manufactured goods for the benefit of the corporations and banks in the rich countries, who own the plantations and factories, and of the people who shop in rich world supermarkets. Very little of the benefit goes to the poor majority in the Third World. Shirt makers in Bangladesh are paid 15 cents an hour.2 In other words, the development that has taken place is almost totally inappropriate to the needs of most Third World people.
