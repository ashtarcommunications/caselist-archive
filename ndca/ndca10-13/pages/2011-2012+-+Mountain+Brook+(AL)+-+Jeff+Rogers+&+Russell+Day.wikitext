My partner and I negate the resolution; Resolved: Direct popular vote should replace electoral vote in presidential elections. Obviously, the burden in this round rests upon the pro side, which must prove that electoral college is so bad and that direct popular vote is so much better that we should completely throw out the Electoral College.

**Contention 1 is Governmental Legitimacy: The Electoral College is the only way to ensure widespread respect for the United States government.**

<span class="Underline">**By upholding the American ideal of checks and balances, The Electoral College maintains a cohesive form of government that represents a medley of interests through compromise. Warren Elaborates:**</span>
<span class="Underline">December 2000. Houston Objectivism Society (lol) “In Defense of the Electoral College” http://www.houstonobjectivism.com/letter_electoralcollege.htm</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The first point to understand is that </span>the Electoral College <span class="Underline">… </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">that even a college education is not a cure here; in fact, it is the disease - the totalitarians are his professors).</span>


<span class="Underline">**The Electoral College is neither antiquated nor out of date. It is updated to meet the needs of the people when necessary. Diamond explains:**</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Martin Diamond is a professor of government and holds the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Chair on the Foundation of American Freedom at Georgetown University. 1977</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“The Electoral College and the Idea of American Democracy” http://www.ashbrook.org/articles/electoralcollege-diamond.pdf</span>

<span class="Underline">The word archaic evokes</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> all </span><span class="Underline">those </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">… </span> [the Framers<span class="Underline">] they </span>intended<span class="Underline">.What more could one ask</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of a constitutional provision? </span>

<span class="Underline">**In fact, we believe that a direct popular vote would do two things:**</span>

<span class="Underline">**1. It would spark national unrest and internal friction, both of which would gain unstoppable inertia. When we question one of the foundations of the government system, it opens the floodgates for broader doubt of governmental legitimacy.**</span>

<span class="Underline">**2. It would force candidates to have more extreme left and extreme right campaign platforms in order to gain more support of the political bases on their side of the political spectrum. An electoral college forces candidates to be more moderate in order to gain votes in “swing” states, allowing for a more nationally cohesive administrations. The result is a more effective and unified government**</span>


<span class="Underline">**Contention Two is the destruction of the two party system. A shift to direct popular vote opens the race for third party candidates to have a real shot at winning the election.**</span>

<span class="Underline">**First, only the Electoral College efficiently completes the job of electing the president without Balkanizing the political parties. A switch in method would have unintended consequences for the election process.**</span>
<span class="Underline">**Warren Elaborates:**</span>
<span class="Underline">December 2000. “In Defense of the Electoral College” http://www.houstonobjectivism.com/letter_electoralcollege.htm</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">On the issue of workability, Pierce Butler stated (p. 366) that … himself to the presidency by equating a dimple with a vote. </span>

<span class="Underline">**This is bad because if multiple third party candidates run in an election, they will collectively attract a large portion of the vote, spreading out the support of the people. In this scenario, a candidate could win the election with a small, unrepresentative portion of the people. For this reason we should not accept a direct popular vote.**</span>

<span class="Underline">**With that, we urge a con ballot, thank you.**</span>

==<span class="Underline">**Pro**</span>== 

<span class="Underline">**The 2000 election made a mockery of the current Electoral College system in the United States. Al Gore received more than half a million more votes than George Bush, yet he still lost the election. That’s right. 500,000 more people, almost the size of a small state such as Alaska, chose that they would rather have Al Gore as their president, yet we still got Bush. How does a nation that boasts the oldest successful functioning democracy and proclaims itself as the bastion of liberty allow this to happen? Broken and outdated, the Electoral College simply makes no sense today. Therefore, my partner and I affirm today’s resolution, “Resolved:** </span>**Direct popular vote should replace electoral vote in presidential elections.”**

<span class="Underline">**Our interpretation of this debate is that the winner is the side who demonstrates the election system that best reflects the will of the people. Therefore, we, the Pro, win if we prove that a direct popular vote is more net-representative of the popular will. We will provide several reasons why a direct popular vote is more advantageous in this manner.**</span>


<span class="Underline">**The Electoral College has an inherent bias towards voters in larger states and violates the one man one vote principle. Because one’s vote in a large state has a tremendously greater impact on the general election than one’s vote in a small state, the distribution of voting power within the Electoral College is horrendously unequal. The winner-take-all and proportionality aspects of the Electoral College distorts the popular will. Only a direct popular vote truly creates an equal voice for all citizens. The Harvard Law Review explains:**</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The conventional wisdom among statisticians …</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> to gain advantage. Kennedy was able to gain that advantage in i96o, whereas Humphrey was not in i968. </span>

<span class="Underline">**Upholding the value of equality by restoring the one-man-one vote principle and implementing a direct popular vote outweighs any normative justifications for the Electoral College. The Harvard Law Review continues:**</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Although many viable reasons in support of the electoral college remain, … foundational and federal underpinnings; it merely argues that the strength of the case for the electoral college is diminished by these realities. </span>

<span class="Underline">**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">Second, many people simply do not vote in presidential elections because they believe their vote does not matter or they simply do not understand how the electoral college works. The media will constantly berate voters long before the polls end on election day with tallies and predictions, making voters think their vote is insignificant. This nature of the Electoral College decreases voter turnout. The popular vote determined in today’s elections is not an accurate reflection of the true popular will because millions of people do not vote because of the Electoral College. A direct popular vote creates transparency for the voters and allows them to understand what happens as a result of their vote. The Harvard Law Review explains:</span>**</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">The Transparency Value. - In addition to furthering political equality, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the …</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> transparency in the present system make it considerably less attractive. </span>



<span class="Underline">**In conclusion, this debate is about democratic values. If the United States is such a nation that is willing to lay down the lives of thousands of our military men and women and spend trillions of dollars in promoting democracy worldwide, it should not allow its very own process of choosing its president to be so unfair. Therefore, I urge a pro ballot.** </span>
