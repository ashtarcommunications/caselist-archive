__Advantage One – Solar Storms__
**They’ll hit Earth in 2013 – we have no precise mechanism for predicting the time of impact**

An active region of the sun ... to come in 2013

**But current space weather monitoring relies on space craft which is __twelve years__ beyond its lifecycle**

Pursuing this theme, several participants....from an L1-based spacecraft.

**We control the direction of __every impact__ – if we aren’t ready when the storm hits, catastrophe is inevitable**
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Brooks 9</span> (Michael, PhD in quantum physics, Space storm alert: 90 seconds from catastrophe, March 23)

Over the last few decades, .... the clock is ticking for America.

**It hits globally and escalates**
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Brooks 9</span> (Michael, PhD in quantum physics, Space storm alert: 90 seconds from catastrophe, March 23)

Such nightmare scenarios... unreliable by the day

**No chance for recovery – a solar storm would cause __permanent damage__ to the grid**
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Brooks 9</span> (Michael, PhD in quantum physics, Space storm alert: 90 seconds from catastrophe, March 23)

The truly shocking finding is that this ... 4-10 years to recover.

**Scientific revealing good – we can interpret truth and reason from empiricism and reasoned argument – to reject “knowing” on the basis of some supposedly deeper thought is to devastate leftist politics.**

**Critique debaters replace instrumentally effective action with ideological mystification when they race to “its all because of capital-race-sex-neo-liberal-age –nuclear -oriental – - or fill in the blank-ism” .the result is that questions of material existence 4/5th of the planet face everyday get ignored in favor of political resignation framed as “deep philosophical thought.”**
