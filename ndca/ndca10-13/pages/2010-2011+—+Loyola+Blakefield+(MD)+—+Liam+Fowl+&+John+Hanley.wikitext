Plan: The United States federal government should withdraw its tactical nuclear presence from Turkey.


CONTENTION 1: The STATUS QUO

the US has been withdrawing it’s nuclear weapons from Turkey over the last 20 years.
Bell and Loehrke 09 (Alexandra, Truman National Security Fellow, Benjamin, Grad student in Public Policy, “The Status of US nuclear weapons in Turkey”)



We will inevitably remove TNW’s in the future—it’s a question of doing it coherently or muddling through.
Ingram 9
Paul Ingram, Executive Director, British American Security Information Council, April 2009, “Eliminating battlefield nuclear weapons from Europe and moving towards the adoption of a non-nuclear weapon security doctrine for the Alliance,” in “The Shadow NATO Summit: Options for NATO - pressing the reset button on the strategic concept,” British American Security Information Council


However; Turkey still hosts 90 U.S B-61 gravity bombs at the Incirlik Air Base – and they’re outdated

Bell and Loehrke 09 (Alexandra is a Truman National Security Fellow and Benjamin is a grad student at the U of Maryland, “The status of U.S. nuclear weapons in Turkey”, accessed at http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/the-status-of-us-nuclear-weapons-turkey on 6/21/10//dml)


CONTENTION 2: THE BREAKING POINT



The development of TNWs does not act as a deterrent against future nuclear attacks. The very idea of the casual use of nuclear weapons must be opposed.

Rajaraman 2, JNU professor of theoretical physics, 4-22-02 [R, The Hindu, “Ban battlefield nuclear weapons” http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2002/04/22/stories/2002042200431000.htm, accessed 7-6-10, ]



Nuclear war has not happened because of the psychological fear of the image of pure destruction. Breaking the barrier of fear surrounding nuclear weapons ensures the end of all life.

Rajaraman 2, JNU professor of theoretical physics, 4-22-02 [R, The Hindu, “Ban battlefield nuclear weapons” http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2002/04/22/stories/2002042200431000.htm, accessed 7-6-10, ]



The roadblock to nuclear holocaust is the highest level of the state having the ability to prevent it. The decentralization of tnws ensures nuclear holocaust.

Rajaraman 2, JNU professor of theoretical physics, 4-22-02 [R, The Hindu, “Ban battlefield nuclear weapons” http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2002/04/22/stories/2002042200431000.htm, accessed 7-6-10, ]



Publicly debating about the firebreak is the only way to maintain it- reducing tnws is the only way to avert the risk of global annihilation.

Derber 90, Boston College sociology professor, and Schwartz, Boston College sociology doctoral student, 1990 [Charles and William, “The Nuclear Seduction” p. 39-40, accessed 7-6-10, ]



CONTENTION 3: IRAN



Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons now

Turkish credibility is key to reducing Iran’s arsenal – they’re the single most influential actor

However, Turkey can’t convince Iran to stop their nuclear program unless the U.S removes their TNWs

Kibaroglu 6/7/10 (Mustafa, Professor and Vice Chair of the IR dept @ Bilkent U, “Reassessing the Role of U.S. Nuclear Weapons in Turkey”, Arms Control Today pg 12, June 2010//dml)

This results in nuclear war

The impact is ARMAGEDDON – Iranian proliferation leads to every major impact

CONTENTION 3: Terrorism
Terrorists are trying to steal TNWs from turkey now

Removing the TNW’s prevents terrorists from stealing them

And, it prevents terrorists from using them

Terrorism causes global nuclear war.

CONTENTION 4: Turkish Soft Power


Withdrawal of TNWs from Turkey increases Turkish soft power – key to negotiating Middle East security pacts

Plan is overwhelmingly popular with the Turkish public and is key to successful Turkish-Mideast relations

A Turkish ability to negotiate successfully with Middle East countries is key to regional stability
