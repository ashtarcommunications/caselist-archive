<strong>Violence is not an unintended consequence; it is a structural feature of occupation. US presence can never reduce violence, only promote it.

<strong>Policy making about Iraq must explicitly examine the way past Iraq policies were formulated based on extreme, apocalyptic images of global calamity. The militarization of our democratic discourse is intimately related to the violence of our foreign policy. We must recognize that the desires to secure and order the world are unattainable fantasies before we can produce meaningful policy reform.</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The invasion of </span><u>Iraq was a defining moment</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> for the United States. This was </span><u>the kind of war</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> ....</span> <strong><u>domestic well-being are far more alarming</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><br />
<strong>Military futurism is intimately connected to military presence - the two can't be discussed in isolation. The ideological underpinnings of US base structure are the doom and gloom scenarios concocted by military futurists. Think tanks, the media, and academia are becoming vertically integrated into the military industrial complex because their apocalyptic scenario planning provides the ideological ammyunition for imperialism- the result is endless presence and endless war</strong><br />
<strong>Carr 10</strong> [Matt, Writer and Journalist “Slouching towards dystopia: the new military futurism” Institute of Race Relations,<span style="background-color: initial;"><span style="background-color: initial;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://rac.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/51/3/13" rel="nofollow">http://rac.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/51/3/13</a></span></span>]<br />

<br />
<strong>Contention 2: Decision Calculus</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>An ethical decision about occupation requires a three pronged approach</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>First, the role of the judge is to be a critical intellectual, this role best fulfills your obligation to filter and interpret the knowledge claims and policies of militaristic governments. This role requires a rejection of occupation</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Ashcroft</span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, School of English Univ of New South Wales, </span><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">and Ahlowalia</span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, Head of politics Dept. University of Adelaide, <u>Edward Said: The Paradox of Identity</u> 19</span><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">99 </span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">p. 142-3</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">In the essay, `Speaking truth to power', Said asks the basic questions ... and the global interact to produce a better world for all.</span><br />
<strong>Second, Epistemology must be the primary determinant of argument quality.</strong> <strong>The decision of the ballot must be filtered through the historical understanding of US actions in Iraq, this historical diagnosis is a pre-requisite to policy action. The only solution is an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of US presence. A functioning Iraqi state is only possible after an end to the occupation allows political realignment.</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Zaid </span><strong>Al-Ali</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is an attorney at the New York Bar and specialises in international commercial arbitration. He has graduated from King's College London, the Sorbonne University in Paris and Harvard Law School. He is also the editor of www.iraqieconomy.org [31] <em>The United States in Iraq: the case for withdrawal</em> 1-19-200</span><strong>7</strong><span style="background-color: initial; font-size: 8pt;"><span style="background-color: initial;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/print/4264" rel="nofollow">http://www.opendemocracy.net/print/4264</a></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The explosion [7] at Mustansiriyah University that killed more than ...</span> <u>what they need is to be free once and for all.</u><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Third, Positionality.</strong> <strong>Use your ballot to reject security rationales for occupation. US presence is universally reviled by Iraqi citizens as the source of instability- arguments to the contrary are part of a colonial narrative created to sanitize imperial violence. The demand for swift and total withdrawal cannot be compromised or violence will escalate</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Sami </span><strong>Ramadani</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> was a political refugee from Saddam Hussein's regime. He is a senior lecturer in sociology at London Metropolitan University, <em>Iraq: not civil war, occupation</em></span><span style="background-color: initial; font-size: 8pt;"><span style="background-color: initial;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/print/4161" rel="nofollow">http://www.opendemocracy.net/print/4161</a></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 12-7-</span><strong>6</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">When he was asked by the BBC whether he thought Iraq was going through a civil war...</span> <strong><u>States-led occupation in their midst. It's called the right to self-determination.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Finally,</strong> <strong>Our demand for immediate and unconditional withdrawal is the crucial starting point for a broader anti war movement to challenge aggressive militarism. Imperial foreign policy requires a network of established, permanent bases. The demand for withdrawal is crucial to revitalize popular movements to restrain US violence</strong><br />

<strong>Filtering all arguments through the position of the occupied provides epistemological insights necessary to resist imperialism</strong><br />

These are some of the questions in the minds ... cognitively constructed beforehand.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Once China is represented as a threat, nothing it does can deter the hawks in the U.S. from their commitment to go to war.

<br />
Thus, the problem is less about the... <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">The following examples help us explain this point. </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Enmity motivated by security will cause Extinction. These threats aren’t real but are invented by leaders manipulating us.</strong><br />
<strong>Mack 1988</strong> (John E., M.D. an American psychiatrist, writer, and professor at Harvard Medical School. He was a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer. “The Enemy System” 1988. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2457:http://www.johnemackinstitute.org/passport/enemysystem.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.johnemackinstitute.org/passport/enemysystem.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.johnemackinstitute.org/passport/enemysystem.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2457 -->, MT)<br />
<br />
The threat of nuclear annihilation has stimulated us... The security of each depends on the other, and the communication of this reality must become a major focus of our educational system.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>In particular, Status quo representations of China as threatening on-balance make war more likely – even if the intent is peace, these reps spiral out of their control, culminating in full-on war.</strong><br />
<strong>Pan 4</strong> Chengxin Pan, Department of Political Science and International Relations, Faculty of Arts, at Deakin University, August 2004, Discourses Of ‘China’ In International Relations: A Study in Western Theory as (IR) Practice, p. 154-156<br />
<br />
To sum up, in this chapter, I have argued that ... may not be enoughimplications are for contemporary Sino-Western relations.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>These “violent” identities must be challenged, otherwise extinction becomes inevitable</strong><br />
<strong>Dillon and Campbell 92</strong> (Michael, Lancaster and David, Newcastle, The Political Subject of Violence, p. 163-164)<br />
<br />
This interpretation of violence as constitutive of identity ... at home in any other house'.10<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Thus, the plan: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence in Japan.</strong><br />
<br />
<u><strong>Contention 2 is what you're voting for:</strong></u><br />
<br />
<strong>Representations come first and create political reality, framing our understanding- star this card</strong><br />
<strong>Hinds &amp; Windt Jr. 1991</strong><br />

<br />
The primary materials for this examination ... the political construction of reality.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Overlooking assumptions breeds serial policy failure—interpretive analysis is the only way to craft effective solutions. Learning about representations and assumptions effects is key to effective policymaking.</strong><br />
<strong>Hajer &amp; Wagenaar 2003</strong> (Maarten and Hendrik, Professor of Political Science University Van Amsterdam, “Editors Introduction, Deliberative Policy Analysis: Understanding Governance in the Network Society” PDF p.29-30)<br />
<br />
The third section, ‘Foundations of... ideal of a ‘policy science of democracy’<br />
<br />
<strong>The world does not pre-exist our attempts to name and describe it, and neither does China. Traditional realist theories of international relations rely on a positivist, empiricist understanding of the world and the way we gather knowledge about it – this itself is a form of violence done to the world that cannot capture the complexity of U.S.-China relations, which makes our framework a pre-requisite to any effective policy discussion.</strong><br />

<br />
I will pursue some of these themes later... dominance throughout the Cold War era.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 3 is realism</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Realist ‘China Experts’ use flawed methodologies—their conclusions should be rejected.</strong><br />

<br />
The (neo) realist paradigm has dominated ... this (neo) realist prism.<br />

<strong>Human nature has both aggressive and peaceful capacities which furthers the need for positive socialization, biological determinism is scientifically wrong we can override drives and our ability for self reflection allows us to shape the factors that create action.</strong><br />

<br />
Negative views of human nature support ...decrease fear and enhance trust.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Political predictions are both false and annihilate agency-- disads have ended in nuclear war impacts for over twenty years and nothing has happened and we start thinking in terms of these predictions and not our decisions.</strong><br />
<strong>Bleiker 2k</strong> (Roland, Professor of International Relations at the University of Queensland, Popular dissent, Human Agency, and Global Politics, pg 48-49, MT)<br />
<br />
Prediction, in particular, is a highly problematic standard ... Wall, is true or false.<br />

<strong>Worst case scenarios focus on abstract threats that are not even real concerns leads to bad risk calculus, obfuscating real predictions and leading to dangerous situations.</strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">In practice, the existence of patriarchy in western religious societies not only ensures the greatest degree of equality between men and women, it also engenders the greatest levels of freedom, personal power, happiness, and economic progress. We can say decisively that America's addiction to feminism has enslaved about half of men to families without giving them anything in return, left more women and children in poverty than at any other time in American history, and forced women to &quot;do it all&quot; as full-time mothers and workers. In-effect, we have done to over half of American men what the Taliban do to women: created an arbitrary, forceful system of family laws and policies that gives tremendous power to one sex, while leaving the other at the mercy of a tyrannical and punitive government. Restoration of patriarchy in Western cultures must begin within the major religions. We can predict America's future if churches fail to remove radical feminist activists from positions of authority. We are only one law away from creating the feminist equivalent of a Talibanic state. Let everyone who believes in salvation begin this great healing task now.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Throughout the broad sweep of human history, there are many examples of people, or classes of people, who chose to avoid the costs of parenthood. Indeed, falling fertility is a recurring tendency of human civilization. Why then did humans not become extinct long ago? The short answer is patriarchy. Patriarchy does not simply mean that men rule. Indeed, it is a particular value system that not only requires men to marry but to marry a woman of proper station. It competes with many other male visions of the good life, and for that reason alone is prone to come in cycles. Yet before it degenerates, it is a cultural regime that serves to keep birthrates high among the affluent, while also maximizing parents’ investments in their children. No advanced civilization has yet learned how to endure without it. Through a process of cultural evolution, societies that adopted this particular social system—which involves far more than simple male domination—maximized their population and therefore their power, whereas those that didn’t were either overrun or absorbed. This cycle in human history may be obnoxious to the enlightened, but it is set to make a comeback. The Conservative Baby Boom The historical relation between patriarchy, population, and power has deep implications for our own time. As the United States is discovering today in Iraq, population is still power. Smart bombs, laser-guided missiles, and unmanned drones may vastly extend the violent reach of a hegemonic power. But ultimately, it is often the number of boots on the ground that changes history. Even with a fertility rate near replacement level, the United States lacks the amount of people necessary to sustain an imperial role in the world, just as Britain lost its ability to do so after its birthrates collapsed in the early 20th century. For countries such as China, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain, in which one-child families are now the norm, the quality of human capital may be high, but it has literally become too rare to put at risk. Falling fertility is also responsible for many financial and economic problems that dominate today’s headlines. The long-term financing of social security schemes, private pension plans, and healthcare systems has little to do with people living longer. Gains in life expectancy at older ages have actually been quite modest, and the rate of improvement in the United States has diminished for each of the last three decades. Instead, the falling ratio of workers to retirees is overwhelmingly caused by workers who were never born. As governments raise taxes on a dwindling working-age population to cover the growing burdens of supporting the elderly, young couples may conclude they are even less able to afford children than their parents were, thereby setting off a new cycle of population aging and decline. Declining birthrates also change national temperament. In the United States, for example, the percentage of women born in the late 1930s who remained childless was near 10 percent. By comparison, nearly 20 percent of women born in the late 1950s are reaching the end of their reproductive lives without having had children. The greatly expanded childless segment of contemporary society, whose members are drawn disproportionately from the feminist and countercultural movements of the 1960s and 70s, will leave no genetic legacy. Nor will their emotional or psychological influence on the next generation compare with that of their parents. Meanwhile, single-child families are prone to extinction. A single child replaces one of his or her parents, but not both. Nor do single-child families contribute much to future population. The 17.4 percent of baby boomer women who had only one child account for a mere 7.8 percent of children born in the next generation. By contrast, nearly a quarter of the children of baby boomers descend from the mere 11 percent of baby boomer women who had four or more children. These circumstances are leading to the emergence of a new society whose members will disproportionately be descended from parents who rejected the social tendencies that once made childlessness and small families the norm. These values include an adherence to traditional, patriarchal religion, and a strong identification with one’s own folk or nation. This dynamic helps explain, for example, the gradual drift of American culture away from secular individualism and toward religious fundamentalism. Among states that voted for President George W. Bush in 2004, fertility rates are 12 percent higher than in states that voted for Sen. John Kerry. It may also help to explain the increasing popular resistance among rank-and-file Europeans to such crown jewels of secular liberalism as the European Union. It turns out that Europeans who are most likely to identify themselves as “world citizens” are also those least likely to have children. Does this mean that today’s enlightened but slow-breeding societies face extinction? Probably not, but only because they face a dramatic, demographically driven transformation of their cultures. As has happened many times before in history, it is a transformation that occurs as secular and libertarian elements in society fail to reproduce, and as people adhering to more traditional, patriarchal values inherit society by default.</strong><br />

<strong>As exciting as podcasting is, it may be iBods that drive the next wave of iPod and iPod-like device adoption. iBods are soft porn offered by Playboy for downloading and viewing on iPod Photo. Pornography often drives new technologies over the chasm to mass markets. This is a marketing observation on my part, not a moral one. On the web, the “adult” sites have the kind of successful paid model which almost no other content providers have been able to achieve. All of us who were involved with ISPs know that viewing porn was one of the important drivers of early demand for dial access. Demand for broadband is similarly goosed by the desire to download more porn faster. Camera phones are significantly used for both personal and commercial porn. One great advantage of a digital camera is that no nosy developer gets to look at the pictures you take. A generation ago, Polaroid filled this niche successfully. One of the many advantages of cable and satellite and soon-to-be Internet TV are that wardrobe malfunctions are permitted here. The most important revenue source for AT&amp;T’s “intelligent network” was 900 service which was used mainly for – surprise, surprise – sex talk. In fact, the PC boards first used for VoIP are direct descendants of boards developed by Dialogic, Brooktrout and others for VARs whose major applications supported call-for-sex. Going back to ancient history, the skin flick trade was a huge early adopter of video tape technology – beta and VHS. They produced content which drove VCR sales. Consumer video cameras helped expand the cottage porn industry. The popularization of the Super 8 projector was boosted by the pornographic content which was quickly available for it. The Super 8 camera was a favorite for fraternity house “home movies” although it was a drawback that the film had to be developed. Why does porn have such a key role in driving the mass adoption of new technologies? One reason is obvious: sex sells. A corollary is that sex sells particularly well to almost the same demographic as new technology: young men. Very early adopters typically care more about the technology they are buying than the content available for it. That’s a good thing because there never is sufficient content until there is a market of people with the right players to look at and/or listen to it. The high margin and guaranteed demand for porn encourages its production early in the technology adoption cycle. Just when the market of early adopters is depleted, sexual content vastly expands the market for the device. More devices mean both more content and lower unit cost for the devices. Ironically, “sin” plays a major role in closing the virtuous circle of: 1. more content creates a broader market for the device 2. which leads to lower prices 3. and an even better market for the content 4. both of which further broaden the market for the device. Populations obviously wouldn’t grow without sex; many technologies wouldn’t either.</strong><br />

It’s the only hope for global survival<br />

<br />
<strong>I am not, to say it once more, advocating an uncritical technophilia as a desirable alternative. Technology is too heedless of human values, and the history of technology is too saturated with unintended consequences, for that to be either morally or intellectually tenable. I am constrained by the realization that the globe now contains more than five billion members of our species- large, aggressive, wily mammals who are extremely irritable when hungry, and who frequently resort to violence under far less extreme deprivation. I am further constrained in that, unlike some “deep ecologists,” I am ethically unable to accept a “Malthusian” solution to the problems posed by these huge numbers. Consequently, I’m driven by both hopefulness and realism to the notion that an intense commitment to technology, along with a degree of faith that its nasty side can be mastered, is the only possible path to a decent human future. To put it another way, any serious move to abandon technology or to constrict it seriously is absolutely certain to bring about disasters as severe as those that haunt the nightmares of technophobes.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The threat of being called a “traitor” and a “foreigner” hangs over those who dare tread upon the topic of national identity. For the longest time, the term “Afghan” has been pushed upon every ethnic group of Afghanistan and for years, that is what Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, Turkmans, and other non-Pashtuns were known by the rest of the world. Today, however, it needs to be made clear that “Afghan” is not the rightful national identity for the country. The history behind the word “Afghan” is disputable due to various sources of where it originated from. However, one thing is clear: “Afghan” has always been synonymous with Pashtun. Writers and travellers to and from the country have stated that the word “Afghan” was always used to distinguish between the Pashtuns and non-Pashtuns such as the Tajiks, Hazaras, etc. The name of country is believed to have been given by the British when they first invaded it in the 19th century. The areas that they encountered were predominantly Pashtun and since they knew “Afghan” as synonymous with “Pashtun”. They therefore erroneously declared the entire country as “Land of the Afghan” or Afghanistan. And even though the majority of Afghanistan isn’t even Afghans, the name has stuck since then. Before the invention of the “Afghanistan”, the land used to be known as other names: Ariana and Khorasan, with the most recent being Khorasan. The region was called Khorasan for 1500 years and the name was fairer and represented the state as well as the people better. It clearly doesn’t favour one ethnicity over another. As Khorasan, the region was once an advancing civilization and embodied many ethnicities. However, as the Pashtun nomads entered and invaded the regions, they scattered and spread over, imposing their existence as well as a need for a country. Now, it doesn’t take a Ph.D. — self-taught or not — to figure out that those events were not just. And no matter what changes the country and the people have gone through, the term “Afghan” is not a legitimate one. Tajiks and Hazaras and Uzbeks and other non-Pashtuns were never and will never be Afghan. When the literal term of a word obviously means something you are not why would you be crazy enough to fight for the right to be called one? By non-Pashtuns adamantly choosing to call themselves Afghan just because they want peace and quiet, they are inadvertently throwing their rights and their heritage away. Losing your identity as a Hazara or a Tajik, Uzbek, or Turkman, you are being oppressed and your heritage and history is being rewritten to those who crawled out of the Suleiman Mountains. When you don’t even speak the language of an Afghan (supposedly Pashto) then why call yourself one? There are a lot of people that will threaten you if you refuse to call yourself an Afghan when you aren’t one. They will call you a “traitor” or “foreigner” and try to get the mass against you. There is a full culture and history behind the names of “Tajik” and “Hazara”, etc. When the world thinks of “Afghans” hardly anything good will come to mind. It is often associated with the horrors of Ahmad Shah Abdali, paedophilia, the Taliban, and now drug dealers. Though there are some bad within non-Pashtuns, they, however, have contributed greatly to the world and to civilization. When you begin to associate yourself with what you rightfully are, you will see just how rich your past is. Rumi, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, they were not Afghans and would never have called themselves one. The national identity is constantly surrounded by lies and deceit. Pashto is trying to be pushed upon those who have no need for it, the word Afghan is insisted upon even though the majority of Afghanistan isn’t even Pashtun. Afghans have always and will always be known as Pashtuns only. A Tajik and an Uzbek and other non-Pashtuns are separate and they should be known as separate. When this comes to light, only then will the people be able to gain the rest of their rights. Only then will the name of the country be forced to change because it isn’t a fair representation of the majority of the people. The people who don’t wish to call themselves Afghan are not trying to start trouble. Instead, they have opened their eyes and trying to open the eyes of others to the mistake and the lie that has covered the entire people. Issues like these need to be discussed because even though they might seem minor, they are in fact major. If the name non-Pashtuns choose to call themselves isn’t such a “big deal” then why are people trying so hard to fight those that decline the name Afghan?</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Approaches that deconstruct theoretical practices in order to disclose what is hidden in the use of concepts such as “national security” have something valuable to say. Their more reflexive and critically-inclined view illustrates how terms used in realist discourses, such as state, anarchy, world order, revolution in military affairs, and security dilemmas, are produced by a specific historical, geographical and socio-political context as well as historical forces and social relations of power (Klein, 1994: 22). Since realist analysts do not question their ontology and yet purport to provide a neutral and objective analysis of a given world order based on military power and interactions between the most important political units, namely states, realist discourses constitute a political act in defense of the state. Indeed, “[…] it is important to recognize that to employ a textualizing approach to social policy involving conflict and war is not to attempt to reduce social phenomena to various concrete manifestations of language. Rather, it is an attempt to analyze the interpretations governing policy thinking. And it is important to recognize that policy thinking is not unsituated” (Shapiro, 1989a: 71). Policy thinking is practical thinking since it imposes an analytic order on the “real world”, a world that only exists in the analysts’ own narratives. In this light, Barry Posen’s political role in legitimizing American hegemonic power and national security conduct seems obvious: U.S. command of the commons provides an impressive foundation for selective engagement. It is not adequate for a policy of primacy. […] Command of the commons gives the United States a tremendous capability to harm others. Marrying that capability to a conservative policy of selective engagement helps make U.S. military power appear less threatening and more tolerable. Command of the commons creates additional collective goods for U.S. allies. These collective goods help connect U.S. military power to seemingly prosaic welfare concerns. U.S. military power underwrites world trade, travel, global telecommunications, and commercial remote sensing, which all depend on peace and order in the commons” (Posen, 2003: 44 and 46). Adopting a more critical stance, David Campbell points out that “[d]anger is not an objective condition. It (sic) is not a thing which exists independently of those to whom it may become a threat. […] Nothing is a risk in itself; [...] it all depends on how one analyses the danger, considers the event” (Campbell, 1998: 1-2). In the same vein, national security discourse does not evaluate objective threats; rather, it is itself a product of historical processes and structures in the state and society that produces it. Whoever has the power to define security is then the one who has the authority to write legitimate security discourses and conduct the policies that legitimize them. The realist analysts and state leaders who invoke national security and act in its name are the same individuals who hold the power to securitize threats by inserting them in a discourse that frames national identity and freezes it.9 Like many concepts, realism is essentially contested. In a critical reinterpretation of realism, James Der Derian offers a genealogy of realism that deconstructs the uniform realism represented in IR: he reveals many other versions of realism that are never mentioned in International Relations texts (Der Derian, 1995: 367). I am aware that there are many realist discourses in International Relations, but they all share a set of assumptions, such as “the state is a rational unitary actor”, “the state is the main actor in international relations”, “states pursue power defined as a national interest”, and so on. I want to show that realism is one way of representing reality, not the reflection of reality. While my aim here is not to rehearse Der Derian’s genealogy of realism, I do want to spell out the problems with a positivist theory of realism and a correspondence philosophy of language. Such a philosophy accepts nominalism, wherein language as neutral description corresponds to reality. This is precisely the problem of epistemic realism and of the realism characteristic of American realist theoretical discourses. And since for poststructuralists language constitutes reality, a reinterpretation of realism as constructed in these discourses is called for.10 These scholars cannot refer to the “essentially contested nature of realism” and then use “realism as the best language to reflect a self-same phenomenon” (Der Derian, 1995: 374). Let me be clear: I am not suggesting that the many neorealist and neoclassical realist discourses in International Relations are not useful. Rather, I want to argue that these technicist and scientist forms of realism serve political purposes, used as they are in many think tanks and foreign policy bureaucracies to inform American political leaders. This is the relevance of deconstructing the uniform realism (as used in International Relations): it brings to light its locatedness in a hermeneutic circle in which it is unwittingly trapped (Der Derian, 1995: 371). And as Friedrich Kratochwil argues, “[…] the rejection of a correspondence theory of truth does not condemn us, as it is often maintained, to mere ‘relativism’ and/or to endless “deconstruction” in which anything goes but it leaves us with criteria that allows us to distinguish and evaluate competing theoretical creations” (Kratochwil, 2000 : 52). Given that political language is not a neutral medium that gives expression to ideas formed independently of structures of signification that sustain political action and thought, American realist discourses belonging to the neorealist or neoclassical realist traditions cannot be taken as mere descriptions of reality. We are trapped in the production of discourses in which national leaders and security speech acts emanating from realist discourses develop and reinforce a notion of national identity as synonymous with national security. U.S. national security conduct should thus be understood through the prism of the theoretical discourses of American political leaders and realist scholars that co-constitute it. Realist discourses depict American political leaders acting in defense of national security, and political leaders act in the name of national security. In the end, what distinguishes realist discourses is that they depict the United States as having behaved like a national security state since World War II, while legitimating the idea that the United States should continue to do so. Political scientists and historians “are engaged in making (poesis), not merely recording or reporting” (Medhurst, 2000: 17). Precisely in this sense, rhetoric is not the description of national security conduct; it constitutes it. It is difficult to trace the exact origins of the concept of “national security”. It seems however that its currency in policymaking circles corresponds to the American experience of the Second World War and of the early years of what came to be known as the “Cold War”. In this light, it is fair to say that the meaning of the American national security state is bound up with the Cold War context. If one is engaged in deciphering the meaning of the Cold War prism for American leaders, what matters is not uncovering the “reality” of the Cold War as such, but how, it conferred meaning and led people to act upon it as “reality”. The Cold War can thus be seen as a rhetorical construction, in which its rhetorical dimensions gave meaning to its material manifestations, such as the national security state apparatus. This is not to say that the Cold War never existed per se, nor does it “make [it] any less real or less significant for being rhetorical” (Medhurst, 2000: 6). As Lynn Boyd Hinds and Theodore Otto Windt, Jr. stress, “political rhetoric creates political reality, structures belief systems, and provides the fundamental bases for decisions” (Hinds and Windt, cited in Medhurst, 2000: 6). In this sense, the Cold War ceases to be a historical period which meaning can be written permanently and becomes instead a struggle that is not context-specific and not geared towards one specific enemy. It is “an orientation towards difference in which those acting on behalf of an assumed but never fixed identity are tempted by the lure of otherness to interpret all dangers as fundamental threats which require the mobilization of a population” (Campbell, 2000: 227). Indeed, if the meaning of the Cold War is not context-specific, the concept of national security cannot be disconnected from what is known as the Cold War, since its very meaning(s) emerged within it (Rosenberg, 1993 : 277).11 If the American national security state is a given for realist analysts,12 it is important to ask whether we can conceive the United States during the Cold War as anything other than a national security state.13 To be clear, I am not suggesting that there is any such essentialized entity as a “national security state”.14 When I refer to the American national security state, I mean the representation of the American state in the early years of the Cold War, the spirit of which is embodied in the National Security Act of 1947 (Der Derian, 1992: 76). The term “national security state” designates both an institutionalization of a new governmental architecture designed to prepare the United States politically and militarily to face any foreign threat and the ideology – the discourse – that gave rise to as well as symbolized it. In other words, to understand the idea of a national security state, one needs to grasp the discursive power of national security in shaping the reality of the Cold War in both language and institutions (Rosenberg, 1993 : 281). A national security state feeds on threats as it channels all its efforts into meeting current and future military or security threats. The creation of the CIA, the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security Council at the onset of the Cold War gave impetus to a state mentality geared to permanent preparedness for war. The construction of threats is thus essential to its well-being, making intelligence agencies privileged tools in accomplishing this task. As American historian of U.S. foreign relations Michael Hogan observes in his study on the rise of the national security state during the Truman administration, “the national security ideology framed the Cold War discourse in a system of symbolic representation that defined America’s national identity by reference to the un-American ‘other,’ usually the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, or some other totalitarian power” (Hogan, 1998: 17). Such a binary system made it difficult for any domestic dissent from U.S. policy to emerge – it would have “amounted to an act of disloyalty” (Hogan, 1998: 18).15 While Hogan distinguishes advocates from critics of the American national security state, his view takes for granted that there is a given and fixed American political culture that differs from the “new” national security ideology. It posits an “American way”, produced by its cultural, political, and historical experience. Although he stresses that differences between the two sides of the discourse are superficial, pertaining solely to the means, rather than the ends of the national security state, Hogan sees the national security state as a finished and legitimate state: an American state suited to the Cold War context of permanent war, while stopping short of a garrison state: Although government would grow larger, taxes would go up, and budget deficits would become a matter of routine, none of these and other transformations would add up to the crushing regime symbolized in the metaphor of the garrison state. The outcome instead would be an American national security state that was shaped as much by the country’s democratic political culture as it was by the perceived military imperatives of the Cold War (Hogan, 1998: 22). I disagree with this essentialist view of the state identity of the United States. The United States does not need to be a national security state. If it was and is still constructed as such by many realist discourses, it is because these discourses serve some political purpose. Moreover, in keeping with my poststructuralist inclinations, I maintain that identity need not be, and indeed never is, fixed. In a scheme in which “to say is to do”, that is, from a perspective that accepts the performativity of language, culture becomes a relational site where identity politics happens rather than being a substantive phenomenon. In this sense, culture is not simply a social context framing foreign policy decision-making. Culture is “a signifying part of the conditions of possibility for social being, […] the way in which culturalist arguments themselves secure the identity of subjects in whose name they speak” (Campbell, 1998: 221). The Cold War national security culture represented in realist discourses was constitutive of the American national security state. There was certainly a conflation of theory and policy in the Cold War military-intellectual complex, which “were observers of, and active participants in, defining the meaning of the Cold War. They contributed to portray the enemy that both reflected and fueled predominant ideological strains within the American body politic. As scholarly partners in the national security state, they were instrumental in defining and disseminating a Cold War culture” (Rubin, 2001: 15). This national security culture was “a complex space where various representations and representatives of the national security state compete to draw the boundaries and dominate the murkier margins of international relations” (Der Derian, 1992: 41). The same Cold War security culture has been maintained by political practice (on the part of realist analysts and political leaders) through realist discourses in the post-9/11 era and once again reproduces the idea of a national security state. This (implicit) state identification is neither accidental nor inconsequential. From a poststructuralist vantage point, the identification process of the state and the nation is always a negative process for it is achieved by exclusion, violence, and marginalization. Thus, a deconstruction of practices that constitute and consolidate state identity is necessary: the writing of the state must be revealed through the analysis of the discourses that constitute it. The state and the discourses that (re)constitute it thus frame its very identity and impose a fictitious “national unity” on society; it is from this fictive and arbitrary creation of the modernist dichotomous discourses of inside/outside that the discourses (re)constructing the state emerge. It is in the creation of a Self and an Other in which the state uses it monopolistic power of legitimate violence – a power socially constructed, following Max Weber’s work on the ethic of responsibility – to construct a threatening Other differentiated from the “unified” Self, the national society (the nation).16 It is through this very practice of normative statecraft,17 which produces threatening Others, that the international sphere comes into being. David Campbell adds that it is by constantly articulating danger through foreign policy that the state’s very conditions of existence are generated 18.</strong><br />

<strong>The threat of nuclear annihilation has stimulated us to try to understand what it is about mankind that has led to such self-destroying behavior. Central to this inquiry is an exploration of the adversarial relationships between ethnic or national groups. It is out of such enmities that war, including nuclear war should it occur, has always arisen. Enmity between groups of people stems from the interaction of psychological, economic, and cultural elements. These include fear and hostility (which are often closely related), competition over perceived scarce resources,[3] the need for individuals to identify with a large group or cause,[4] a tendency to disclaim and assign elsewhere responsibility for unwelcome impulses and intentions, and a peculiar susceptibility to emotional manipulation by leaders who play upon our more savage inclinations in the name of national security or the national interest. A full understanding of the &quot;enemy system&quot;[3] requires insights from many specialities, including psychology, anthropology, history, political science, and the humanities. In their statement on violence[5] twenty social and behavioral scientists, who met in Seville, Spain, to examine the roots of war, declared that there was no scientific basis for regarding man as an innately aggressive animal, inevitably committed to war. The Seville statement implies that we have real choices. It also points to a hopeful paradox of the nuclear age: threat of nuclear war may have provoked our capacity for fear-driven polarization but at the same time it has inspired unprecedented efforts towards cooperation and settlement of differences without violence. The Real and the Created Enemy: Attempts to explore the psychological roots of enmity are frequently met with responses on the following lines: &quot;I can accept psychological explanations of things, but my enemy is real. The Russians [or Germans, Arabs, Israelis, Americans] are armed, threaten us, and intend us harm. Furthermore, there are real differences between us and our national interests, such as competition over oil, land, or other scarce resources, and genuine conflicts of values between our two nations. It is essential that we be strong and maintain a balance or superiority of military and political power, lest the other side take advantage of our weakness&quot;. This argument does not address the distinction between the enemy threat and one's own contribution to that threat-by distortions of perception, provocative words, and actions. In short, the enemy is real, but we have not learned to understand how we have created that enemy, or how the threatening image we hold of the enemy relates to its actual intentions. &quot;We never see our enemy's motives and we never labor to assess his will, with anything approaching objectivity&quot;.[6] Individuals may have little to do with the choice of national enemies. Most Americans, for example, know only what has been reported in the mass media about the Soviet Union. We are largely unaware of the forces that operate within our institutions, affecting the thinking of our leaders and ourselves, and which determine how the Soviet Union will be represented to us. Ill-will and a desire for revenge are transmitted from one generation to another, and we are not taught to think critically about how our assigned enemies are selected for us. In the relations between potential adversarial nations there will have been, inevitably, real grievances that are grounds for enmity. But the attitude of one people towards another is usually determined by leaders who manipulate the minds of citizens for domestic political reasons which are generally unknown to the public. As Israeli sociologist Alouph Haveran has said, in times of conflict between nations historical accuracy is the first victim.[8] The Image of the Enemy and How We Sustain It: Vietnam veteran William Broyles wrote: &quot;War begins in the mind, with the idea of the enemy.&quot;[9] But to sustain that idea in war and peacetime a nation's leaders must maintain public support for the massive expenditures that are required. Studies of enmity have revealed susceptibilities, though not necessarily recognized as such by the governing elites that provide raw material upon which the leaders may draw to sustain the image of an enemy.[7,10] Freud[11] in his examination of mass psychology identified the proclivity of individuals to surrender personal responsibility to the leaders of large groups. This surrender takes place in both totalitarian and democratic societies, and without coercion. Leaders can therefore designate outside enemies and take actions against them with little opposition. Much further research is needed to understand the psychological mechanisms that impel individuals to kill or allow killing in their name, often with little questioning of the morality or consequences of such actions. Philosopher and psychologist Sam Keen asks why it is that in virtually every war &quot;The enemy is seen as less than human? He's faceless. He's an animal&quot;.&quot; Keen tries to answer his question: &quot;The image of the enemy is not only the soldier's most powerful weapon; it is society's most powerful weapon. It enables people en masse to participate in acts of violence they would never consider doing as individuals&quot;.[12] National leaders become skilled in presenting the adversary in dehumanized images. The mass media, taking their cues from the leadership, contribute powerfully to the process. The image of the enemy as less than human may be hard to dislodge. For example, a teacher in the Boston area reported that during a high school class on the Soviet Union a student protested: &quot;You're trying to get us to see them as people&quot;. Stephen Cohen and other Soviet experts have noted how difficult it is to change the American perception of the Soviet Union, despite the vast amount of new information contradicting old stereotypes.&quot; Bernard Shaw in his preface to Heartbreak House, written at the end of World War I, observed ironically: &quot;Truth telling is not compatible with the defense of the realm&quot;. Nations are usually created out of the violent defeat of the former inhabitants of a piece of land or of outside enemies, and national leaders become adept at keeping their people's attention focused on the threat of an outside enemy.[14] Leaders also provide what psychiatrist Vamik Volkan called &quot;suitable targets of externalization&quot;[10] – i.e., outside enemies upon whom both leaders and citizens can relieve their burdens of private defeat, personal hurt, and humiliation.[15] All-embracing ideas, such as political ideologies and fixed religious beliefs act as psychological or cultural amplifiers. Such ideologies can embrace whole economic systems, such as socialism or capitalism, or draw on beliefs that imply that a collectivity owes its existence to some higher power in the universe. It was not Stalin as an individual whom Nadezhda Mandelstam blamed for the political murder of her poet husband Osip and millions of other citizens but the &quot;craving for an all-embracing idea which would explain everything in the world and bring about universal harmony at one go”.[16] Every nation, no matter how bloody and cruel its beginnings, sees its origins in a glorious era of heroes who vanquished less worthy foes. One's own race, people, country, or political system is felt to be superior to the adversary's, blessed by a less worthy god. The nuclear age has spawned a new kind of myth. This is best exemplified by the United States' strategic defense initiative. This celestial fantasy offers protection from attack by nuclear warheads, faith here being invested not in a god but in an anti-nuclear technology of lasers, satellites, mirrors, and so on in the heavens.Individual Group Linkages and Lessons in Childhood: To find out the source of hatred or antagonism we need to understand the complex relationship between the psychology of the individual, and the national group.[17] We can start by examining how enmity develops in childhood. In the first year of life a child begins to have a sense of self,[18] which includes the ability to distinguish between familiar people with whom he or she feels comfortable and those who are strangers or are felt to be alien. The small child's ability to distinguish between friends and strangers[19] is accompanied by thought patterns that tend to divide people and things into good and bad, safe and unsafe. It is out of such primitive thinking that the structures of enmity later grow. In the second year the child learns that ill-will directed towards those upon whom he is dependent is dangerous to his own well-being. He develops, therefore, mechanisms such as displacement and externalization which allow him to disown such negative impulses. Grandparents and parents may pass on to their children stories of the designated enemy groups' evil actions so that chosen displacements persist from one generation to another. From the drawings and comments of children in Germany, the United States, Central America, and Samoa, Hesse showed that by age five a child understands the idea of an enemy, which he or she will depict as whatever in the culture seems most immediately fearful or threatening-a monster, wild animal, or bad man.[20] By age eight a child understands that &quot;the idea of the enemy&quot; has to do with an unfriendly relationship. But this idea does not usually become cast in political terms until age ten to twelve. It is noteworthy that Hesse's research children, including the older ones, tend not to see their own country as bad or responsible for bad actions. The small child's sense of helplessness is accompanied by a feeling of vulnerability and awareness of dependence on others. The formation of relationships or alliances with other individuals and groups, beginning with family members and extending to the neighborhood, classroom, school playground, and teenage youth group, is an important strategy for gaining a sense of power. Such alliances are the prototype for later political relationships. All of these primitive, or child-like, mechanisms provide fertile soil for political leaders in real life interethnic or international conflicts. Nationalistic slogans and media manipulation focus the child's mind (or the child-mind of the adult) on the peoples or system he is supposed to hate or fear (Jews, Arabs, capitalists, or communists). In the United States patriotic recruitment is accompanied by commercial profiteering-for example, robotic war toys designed to kill communists.[21] The extraordinary dimensions of the nuclear threat have also spawned examples of apocalyptic thinking, in which the world is divided into forces of good and evil, and the belief that, in the event of a nuclear holocaust, the good would be saved and the evil would perish. In such thinking the primitive, polarizing tendencies of the child's mind are all too evident. Creating a Safer World: Hesse's finding that even older children do not perceive their own country's responsibility for states of enmity is in accord with those of psychologists and social scientists - that there is no self-awareness or self-responsibility at the political level which corresponds to the awareness of personal responsibility with which we are familiar in a clinical setting.&quot; In political life, the assignment of blame, disclaiming of responsibility, and the denial of one's own nation's contribution to tensions and enmity are the norm.[23] The first task, therefore, is to apply the insights of the behavioral sciences to create a new expectation of political self-responsibility. Nuclear weapons have connected all the peoples of the earth. Not only the nuclear superpowers but also all peoples are now interdependent and mutually vulnerable. Nations may have conflicting values but they cannot afford to have enemies. Education in elementary and secondary schools that reflects this new reality should be our highest priority. Instead of constant blaming of the other side, we need to give new attention to the adversary's culture and history, to his real intentions as well as his hopes, dreams, and values. To understand is not to forgive, but awareness and knowledge could lead to a more realistic appreciation of who has contributed what to the problems and tensions that exist in the world. Young people should be taught in their homes and schools how to identify and resist ideological propaganda. In the nuclear age we need to redefine hackneyed ideas such as national security or the national interest. just as we can no longer afford enemies, there is no longer such a notion as national security. The security of each depends on the other, and the communication of this reality must become a major focus of our educational system.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>This goal is pursued in ways which are still unconventional in the intellectual milieu of international relations in Australia, even though they are gaining influence worldwide as traditional modes of theory and practice are rendered inadequate by global trends that defy comprehension, let alone policy. The inability to give meaning to global changes reflects partly the enclosed, elitist world of professional security analysts and bureaucratic experts, where entry is gained by learning and accepting to speak a particular, exclusionary language. The contributors to this book are familiar with the discourse, but accord no privileged place to its ‘knowledge form as reality’ in debates on defence and security. Indeed, they believe that debate will be furthered only through a long overdue critical re-evaluation of elite perspectives. Pluralistic, democratically-oriented perspectives on Australia’s identity are both required and essential if Australia’s thinking on defence and security is to be invigorated. This is not a conventional policy book; nor should it be, in the sense of offering policy-makers and their academic counterparts sets of neat alternative solutions, in familiar language and format, to problems they pose. This expectation is in itself a considerable part of the problem to be analysed. It is, however, a book about policy, one that questions how problems are framed by policy-makers. It challenges the proposition that irreducible bodies of real knowledge on defence and security exist independently of their ‘context in the world’, and it demonstrates how security policy is articulated authoritatively by the elite keepers of that knowledge, experts trained to recognize enduring, universal wisdom. All others, from this perspective, must accept such wisdom or remain outside the expert domain, tainted by their inability to comply with the ‘rightness’ of the official line. But it is precisely the official line, or at least its image of the world, that needs to be problematised. If the critic responds directly to the demand for policy alternatives, without addressing this image, he or she is tacitly endorsing it. Before engaging in the policy debate the critics need to reframe the basic terms of reference. This book, then, reflects and underlines the importance of Antonio Gramsci and Edward Said’s ‘critical intellectuals’.15 The demand, tacit or otherwise, that the policy-maker’s frame of reference be accepted as the only basis for discussion and analysis ignores a three thousand year old tradition commonly associated with Socrates and purportedly integral to the Western tradition of democratic dialogue. More immediately, it ignores post-seventeenth century democratic traditions which insist that a good society must have within it some way of critically assessing its knowledge and the decisions based upon that knowledge which impact upon citizens of such a society. This is a tradition with a slightly different connotation in contemporary liberal democracies which, during the Cold War, were proclaimed different and superior to the totalitarian enemy precisely because there were institutional checks and balances upon power. In short, one of the major differences between ‘open societies’ and their (closed) counterparts behind the Iron Curtain was that the former encouraged the critical testing of the knowledge and decisions of the powerful and assessing them against liberal democratic principles. The latter tolerated criticism only on rare and limited occasions. For some, this represented the triumph of rational-scientific methods of inquiry and techniques of falsification. For others, especially since positivism and rationalism have lost much of their allure, it meant that for society to become open and liberal, sectors of the population must be independent of the state and free to question its knowledge and power. Though we do not expect this position to be accepted by every reader, contributors to this book believe that critical dialogue is long overdue in Australia and needs to be listened to. For all its liberal democratic trappings, Australia’s security community continues to invoke closed monological narratives on defence and security. This book also questions the distinctions between policy practice and academic theory that inform conventional accounts of Australian security. One of its major concerns, particularly in chapters 1 and 2, is to illustrate how theory is integral to the practice of security analysis and policy prescription. The book also calls on policy-makers, academics and students of defence and security to think critically about what they are reading, writing and saying; to begin to ask, of their work and study, difficult and searching questions raised in other disciplines; to recognise, no matter how uncomfortable it feels, that what is involved in theory and practice is not the ability to identify a replacement for failed models, but a realisation that terms and concepts – state sovereignty, balance of power, security, and so on – are contested and problematic, and that the world is indeterminate, always becoming what is written about it. Critical analysis which shows how particular kinds of theoretical presumptions can effectively exclude vital areas of political life from analysis has direct practical implications for policy-makers, academics and citizens who face the daunting task of steering Australia through some potentially choppy international waters over the next few years. There is also much of interest in the chapters for those struggling to give meaning to a world where so much that has long been taken for granted now demands imaginative, incisive reappraisal. The contributors, too, have struggled to find meaning, often despairing at the terrible human costs of international violence. This is why readers will find no single, fully formed panacea for the world’s ills in general, or Australia’s security in particular. There are none. Every chapter, however, in its own way, offers something more than is found in orthodox literature, often by exposing ritualistic Cold War defence and security mind-sets that are dressed up as new thinking. Chapters 7 and 9, for example, present alternative ways of engaging in security and defence practice. Others (chapters 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8) seek to alert policy-makers, academics and students to alternative theoretical possibilities which might better serve an Australian community pursuing security and prosperity in an uncertain world. All chapters confront the policy community and its counterparts in the academy with a deep awareness of the intellectual and material constraints imposed by dominant traditions of realism, but they avoid dismissive and exclusionary terms which often in the past characterized exchanges between policy-makers and their critics. This is because, as noted earlier, attention needs to be paid to the words and the thought processes of those being criticized. A close reading of this kind draws attention to underlying assumptions, showing they need to be recognized and questioned. A sense of doubt (in place of confident certainty) is a necessary prelude to a genuine search for alternative policies. First comes an awareness of the need for new perspectives, then specific policies may follow. As Jim George argues in the following chapter, we need to look not so much at contending policies as they are made for us but at challenging ‘the discursive process which gives [favoured interpretations of “reality”] their meaning and which direct [Australia’s] policy/analytical/military responses’. This process is not restricted to the small, official defence and security establishment huddled around the US-Australian War Memorial in Canberra. It also encompasses much of Australia’s academic defence and security community located primarily though not exclusively within the Australian National University and the University College of the University of New South Wales. These discursive processes are examined in detail in subsequent chapters as authors attempt to make sense of a politics of exclusion and closure which exercises disciplinary power over Australia’s security community. They also question the discourse of ‘regional security’, ‘security cooperation’, ‘peacekeeping’ and ‘alliance politics’ that are central to Australia’s official and academic security agenda in the 1990s. This is seen as an important task especially when, as is revealed, the disciplines of International Relations and Strategic Studies are under challenge from critical and theoretical debates ranging across the social sciences and humanities; debates that are nowhere to be found in Australian defence and security studies. The chapters graphically illustrate how Australia’s public policies on defence and security are informed, underpinned and legitimised by a narrowly-based intellectual enterprise which draws strength from contested concepts of realism and liberalism, which in turn seek legitimacy through policy-making processes. Contributors ask whether Australia’s policy-makers and their academic advisors are unaware of broader intellectual debates, or resistant to them, or choose not to understand them, and why?</strong><br />

The alternative solves - breaking out of our obsession with security allows alternative relationships to the future - their predictions are ideologically loaded and suspect.<br />

Since then he has published numerous books and articles. His most recent work has been towards the development of a critique of security. “CRITIQUE OF SECURITY” 2008. Pg. 185-186, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The only way out of such a dilemma, to escape the fetish, is perhaps to eschew the logic of security altogether – to reject it as so ideologically loaded in favour of the state that any real political thought other than the authoritarian and reactionary should be pressed to give it up. That is clearly something that can not be achieved within the limits of bourgeois thought and thus could never even begin to be imagined by the security intellectual. It is also something that the constant iteration of the refrain ‘this is an insecure world’ and reiteration of one fear, anxiety and insecurity after another will also make it hard to do. But it is something that the critique of security suggests we may have to consider if we want a political way out of the impasse of security. This impasse exists because security has now become so all-encompassing that it marginalises all else, most notably the constructive conflicts, debates and discussions that animate political life. The constant prioritising of a mythical security as a political end – as the political end – constitutes a rejection of politics in any meaningful sense of the term. That is, as a mode of action in which differences can be articulated, in which the conflicts and struggles that arise from such differences can be fought for and negotiated, in which people might come to believe that another world is possible – that they might transform the world and in turn be transformed. Security politics simply removes this; worse, it removes it while purportedly addressing it. In so doing it suppresses all issues of power and turns political questions into debates about the most efficient way to achieve ‘security’, despite the fact that we are never quite told – never could be told – what might count as having achieved it. Security politics is, in this sense, an anti-politics,141 dominating political discourse in much the same manner as the security state tries to dominate human beings, reinforcing security fetishism and the monopolistic character of security on the political imagination. We therefore need to get beyond security politics, not add yet more ‘sectors’ to it in a way that simply expands the scope of the state and legitimises state intervention in yet more and more areas of our lives. Simon Dalby reports a personal communication with Michael Williams, co-editor of the important text Critical Security Studies, in which the latter asks: if you take away security, what do you put in the hole that’s left behind? But I’m inclined to agree with Dalby: maybe there is no hole.142 The mistake has been to think that there is a hole and that this hole needs to be filled with a new vision or revision of security in which it is re-mapped or civilised or gendered or humanised or expanded or whatever. All of these ultimately remain within the statist political imaginary, and consequently end up re- affirming the state as the terrain of modern politics, the grounds of security. The real task is not to fill the supposed hole with yet another vision of security, but to fight for an alternative political language which takes us beyond the narrow horizon of bourgeois security and which therefore does not constantly throw us into the arms of the state. That’s the point of critical politics: to develop a new political language more adequate to the kind of society we want. Thus while much of what I have said here has been of a negative order, part of the tradition of critical theory is that the negative may be as significant as the positive in setting thought on new paths. For if security really is the supreme concept of bourgeois society and the fundamental thematic of liberalism, then to keep harping on about insecurity and to keep demanding ‘more security’ (while meekly hoping that this increased security doesn’t damage our liberty) is to blind ourselves to the possibility of building real alternatives to the authoritarian tendencies in contemporary politics. To situate ourselves against security politics would allow us to circumvent the debilitating effect achieved through the constant securitising of social and political issues, debilitating in the sense that ‘security’ helps consolidate the power of the existing forms of social domination and justifies the short-circuiting of even the most democratic forms. It would also allow us to forge another kind of politics centred on a different conception of the good. We need a new way of thinking and talking about social being and politics that moves us beyond security. This would perhaps be emancipatory in the true sense of the word. What this might mean, precisely, must be open to debate. But it certainly requires recognising that security is an illusion that has forgotten it is an illusion; it requires recognising that security is not the same as solidarity; it requires accepting that insecurity is part of the human condition, and thus giving up the search for the certainty of security and instead learning to tolerate the uncertainties, ambiguities and ‘insecurities’ that come with being human; it requires accepting that ‘securitizing’ an issue does not mean dealing with it politically, but bracketing it out and handing it to the state; it requires us to be brave enough to return the gift.143</strong><br />

The affirmative’s strategy is not political. Instead it is a strategy against politics. This undermines the possibility of liberation.<br />

The aff poses the question of ethics insofar as it relates to the domain of politics. Tying ethical reorientation of ourselves with the reorientation of our collective political spheres, making our relationship with others merely a background for political transformations. The aff makes the question not how much we can change ourselves but instead how we can change our institutions to change ourselves. This process produces a mediated relationship that makes genuine ethical engagement impossible.<br />
Zupancic 2k <strong>[Alenka; Research Institute of Philosophy- Ljubljana; <em>Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan</em>; March; pg. 10-11]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In other words, one cannot... desire as a priori.</strong><br />
<br />
The displacement of our ethics onto external political institutions culminates in genocidal violence. Once we accept that our ethics are contingent on the political, all atrocities become possible.<br />
Zupancic 2k <strong>[Alenka; Research Institute of Philosophy- Ljubljana; <em>Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan</em>; March; pg. 96-97]</strong><br />
<br />
For the aff, the ethical and the political are the same. The political domain has become incomplete without ethical intervention and vice versa. It is this logic that is responsible for the genuine corruption of our ethics. Reading ethics through the lens of politics ignores that ethical possibilities are all around us. The aff builds a wall between these ethical possibilities, insisting that they are only possible when our political gestures are transformed<br />
Zizek 1 <strong>[Slavoj; Senior Researcher at the Institute of Social Studies, Ljubljana; &quot;Did Somebody say Totalitarianism&quot; pg. 160-163]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The problem here is: is Lacan's 'ethics... agency of symbolic regulations.</strong><br />
<br />
The aff will respond that the plan and the political play no prominent role. This is the premise of our argument. Their belief that the political must remain in the background in order to generate change is the ultimate sell-out of their ethical commitment. This gesture is intrinsically unethical because it admits from the get-go that the ethical posture is insufficient absent its capacity to generate change within the domain of institutional politics.<br />

The aff’s use of traditional security discourse creates gendered representations of situations within international relations. These reps perpetuate masculine dominance and result in inevitable war<br />
Harrison 3 <strong>(Deborah, Adjunct professor of Sociology at the U. of New Brunswick, “Military Masculinities: Identity and the State” p. 73)</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Research that addresses the 'violent reproduction of the international' conceives of security as a set of discourses rather than as something that can be achieved either in absolute or relative terms, and is also concerned with the demarcation of boundaries in the study and practice of I/international R/relations.16 Engaging with research that works within this conceptualisation can explore how these discourses function to reproduce, through various strategies, domains of the international with which IR is self-consciously concerned. Thus the violences and the threats, as much as the states and security itself, are interpreted though the practices that enable individuals as social beings to make sense of their social location and identity. Literature that addresses 'the violent reproduction of gender' conceives of violence as a site at which genders are reproduced; literature that addresses the 'violent reproduction of the international' conceives of violence, of which security practice and policy is an integral part, as sites at which the international is reproduced. Including not just acts of inter-state war, but also instances of civil conflict and oppressive practices within and between states, expanding further to problematise the legal structures, policy practices and the research that guides these, theorists are enabled to investigate the ways in which these acts of violence articulated through discourses of security function to perpetuate 'the international' as various spatial and conceptual realms. Thus, within this conceptualisation it is possible to say that states, acting as unitary authoritative entities, perform violences, but also that violences, in the name of security, perform states. Undertaking research within this conceptualisation allows for a holistic perspective on the ways in which discourses of security reproduce grammatically correct narratives of identity and being-in-the-world, of which in international relations the 'international' is a key organising concept. One aspect of the ways in which discourses of security, and the violences undertaken with reference to these discourses, function within international relations is to delimit the state as boundary between the domestic and the international realms. States are assumed to be unitary and authoritative, to maintain both internal and external sovereignty, and furthermore, it is assumed that the internal organisation of the state is undertaken in the best interests of the citizenship—to protect and serve the population. Unsettling 'the international' as an a priori unsafe/safe domain (in the discourses of 'national security' and 'international security', respectively) challenges this truth of security as propounded by the two conceptualisations outlined above. Considering the ways in which this domain is (re)produced is vital to understanding how security functions as a discourse. James Der Derian addresses the 'new technological practice' of simulation as a means of identifying 'the reality principle that international relations theory in general seeks to save' (Der Derian 1990, 300). The reality principle of the international as a conceptual domain is undermined by the intertextuality of simulation and policy procedure and discourses of security help to reassert the primacy of the international in the ways described above, through the identification of objective threats, the construction of international order and the perpetuation of the myth of the state. Towards a Feminist Reconceptualisation As Spike Peterson and Jacqui True comment, 'our sense of self-identity and security may seem disproportionately threatened by societal challenge to gender ordering' (Peterson and True 1998, 17). That is, the performance of gender is immanent in the performance of security and vice versa, both concern issues of ontological cohesion (as illustrated in Table 2). Taking this on board leads me to the conclusion that perhaps security is best conceived of as referring to ontological rather than existential identity effects. Security, if seen as performative of particular configurations of social/political order, is inherently gendered and inherently related to violence. Violence, on this view, performs an ordering function—not only in the theory/practice of security and the reproduction of the international, but also in the reproduction of gendered subjects. Butler acknowledges that 'violence is done in the name of preserving western values' (Butler 2004, 231); that is, the ordering function that is performed through the violences investigated here, as discussed above, organises political authority and subjectivity in an image that is in keeping with the values of the powerful, often at the expense of the marginalised. 'Clearly, the west does not author all violence, but it does, upon suffering or anticipating injury, marshal violence to preserve its borders, real or imaginary' (ibid.). While Butler refers to the violences undertaken in the protection of the sovereign state—violence in the name of security—the preservation of borders is also recognisable in the conceptual domain of the international and in the adherence to a binary materiality of gender. This adherence is evidenced in the desire to fix the meaning of concepts in ways that are not challenging to the current configuration of social/political order and subjectivity, and is product/productive of 'the exclusionary presuppositions and foundations that shore up discursive practices insofar as those foreclose the heterogeneity, gender, class or race of the subject' (Hanssen 2000, 215). However, the terms used to describe political action and plan future policy could be otherwise imagined. They could 'remain that which is, in the present, never fully owned, but always and only redeployed, twisted, queered from prior usage and in the direction of urgent and expanding political purposes' (Butler 1993, 228). The concepts both produced by and productive of policy could reflect an aversion to essentialism, while recognising that strategic gains can be made through the temporary binding of identities to bodies and constraining of authority within the confines of the territorial state. This is, in short, an appeal to a politics of both/and rather than either/or. Both the state (produced through representations of security and violence) and the subject (produced through representations of gender and violence) rely on a logic of sovereignty and ontological cohesion that must be problematised if alternative visions of authority and subjectivity are to become imaginable. International Relations as a discipline could seek to embrace the investigation of the multiple modalities of power, from the economic to the bureaucratic, from neo-liberal capitalism to the juridical. Rather than defending the sovereign boundaries of the discipline from the unruly outside constituted by critical studies of development, political structures, economy and law, not to mention the analysis of social/political phenomena like those undertaken by always-already interdisciplinary feminist scholarship, IR could refuse to fix its own boundaries, and refuse to exercise sovereign power, in terms of authority, over the meanings of its objects of analysis. Future research on global politics could look very different if it were not for the inscription of ultimately arbitrary disciplinary borderlines that function to constrain rather than facilitate understanding. It may seem that there is a tension between espousing a feminist poststructural politics and undertaking research that seeks to detail, through deconstruction, the ways in which particular discourses have failed to manifest the reforms needed to address security and violence in the context of gendered subjectivity and the constitution of political community. In keeping with the ontological position I hold, I argue that there is nothing inherent in the concepts of (international) security and (gender) violence that necessitated their being made meaningful in the way they have been. Those working on policy and advocacy in the area of security and violence can use the reconceptualisation I offer 'to enable people to imagine how their being-in-the-world is not only changeable, but perhaps, ought to be changed' (Milliken 1999, 244). As a researcher, the question I have grown most used to hearing is not 'What?' or 'How?' but 'Why?'. At every level of the research process, from securing funding to relating to the academic community, it is necessary to be able to construct a convincing and coherent argument as to why this research is valuable, indeed vital, to the field in which I situate myself. A discursive approach acknowledges that my legitimacy as a knowing subject is constructed through discursive practices that privilege some forms of being over others. In the study of security, because of the discursive power of the concept, and of violence, which can quite literally be an issue of life and death, these considerations are particularly important. Furthermore, as a result of the invigorating and investigative research conducted by exemplary feminist scholars in the field of IR,17 I felt encouraged to reclaim the space to conduct research at the margins of a discipline that itself functions under a misnomer, being concerned as it is with relations inter-state rather than inter-national. As Cynthia Enloe has expressed it, To study the powerful is not autocratic, it is simply reasonable. Really? ... It presumes a priori that margins, silences and bottom rungs are so naturally marginal, silent and far from power that exactly how they are kept there could not possibly be of interest to the reasoning, reasonable explainer (Enloe 1996, 188, emphasis in original). If this is the case, I am more than happy to be unreasonable, and I am in excellent company</strong><br />
