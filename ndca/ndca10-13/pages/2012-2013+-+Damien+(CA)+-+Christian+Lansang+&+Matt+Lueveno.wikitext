==Contention 3: Solvency== 

====Plan: The United States federal government should substantially invest in a national, CO2 sequestration pipeline infrastructure for the purposes of carbon capture and storage.==== 


The private sector can~’t move forward with CCS developments until the government acts with pipelines – It will spur private activity

The United States is embarking for the first time on examining and reducing CO2 emissions

predictability and confidence to invest in this very important part of our infrastructure.


Non-Federal Actors Fail – Lack eminent domain, fail to spur investment and lack uniformity on pipelines – Drives up prices, causes delays, can~’t solve nation-wide

Siting regulations affect companies~’ ability to build where pipelines are needed, or wanted.
