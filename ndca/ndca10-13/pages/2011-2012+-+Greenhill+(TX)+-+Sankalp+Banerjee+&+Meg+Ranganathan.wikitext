<span style="background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none;">Space is also cluttered by electronic signals. Roughly 9,000 satellite transponders that send communications between space and the ground are expected to be active by 2015, increasing the probability of radio frequency interference. Military planners are keenly aware that a satellite does not need to be physically damaged to be rendered useless it only has to be jammed, intentionally or otherwise. The dramatic increase in physical and electronic hazards means we are approaching a point at which the limitless frontier no longer seems quite so limitless.</span>
