<span class="Underline">Thus the plan: RELEASE THE KRAKEN!</span>

===Evidence=== 

We may or may not read this, depending on how many creative ideas we can come up with before the round.

<span style="line-height: 19px;">**Resist the attempt to take everything and lay the world open to analysis. We must maintain the intelligence of mystery or suffer planetary symbolic extinction**</span>

<span style="line-height: 19px;"> **Debate and your arguments are structured based on accumulation and acceleration.

<span style="line-height: 19px;">Every process growing …. Cancels itself out</span>


<span style="line-height: 19px;"> **Like meaning, criticism is categorically unhappy and hopefless.

<span style="line-height: 19px;">It is not a question …. Cannot be resolved</span>


<span style="line-height: 19px;"> **The lack of theory is to unmask the illusion of the objective and causal reality. Epistemological claims that claim to mirror the reality of the world are illusion. Bet on radical illusion.** **Baudrillard 5** </span>

**<span style="font-family: Times,serif;">Act 2. The Cutting. </span>**

**“Sacrifice the 1AC. Severe its head, flay its corpse, and wear its skin.”**

**Sacrificial theater offers a moment of transfiguration. Risk this intimate encounter with death to give your life meaning beyond mere existence and duration.**
