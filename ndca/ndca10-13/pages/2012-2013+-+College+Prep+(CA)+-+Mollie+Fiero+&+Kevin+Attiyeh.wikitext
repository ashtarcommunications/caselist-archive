the futility of trying to challenge so powerful a force head-on:
[T]he strong tendency toward counterhegemonic balancing in the European system during the last five centuries has not been replicated in the global maritime system.
High concentrations of naval power (and in the economic correlates of naval power) tend to generate alliances with the leading power rather than against it. The decision of many of the strongest powers in the contemporary system to ally with the United States rather than against it in the Cold War and post–Cold War periods is fully consistent with behavior in the global system for the last five centuries.[2]

===Contention Three===

Definitions that focus on transportation infrastructure investment as a function of economic productivity are politically biased and intellectually lazy – it’s much harder for economists to measure military impact so they leave it out of their studies. However, the most logical definition is public-owned natural monopolies – aka military investments; other interpretations simply devolve this topic to a States CP every round, leading us to the same round every time.

The US is a critical international beacon of scientific diplomacy



Turekian 10 [Vaugh. Director, Center for Science Diplomacy, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Keynote Address at USC Center for on Public Diplomacy Conference, 2010. http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/media/Science%20Diplomacy%20Proceedings.pdf]

Dr. Vaughan Turekian began his keynote speech at the opening dinner of Science Diplomacy and the Prevention of Conflict with the proposition that a new era of science diplomacy is emerging, one that brings together a number of relevant actors, including the public diplomacy community, scientists, NGOs, universities, foundations, and governments. In recent years we have seen the waning effectiveness of hard, soft, and smart power, and the time is ripe for an emphasis on science diplomacy. Turekian pointed out that the world appears to be becoming multipolar, with coalitions forming around specific interests and issues. Nearly every major issue, whether global or national in scale, features science and technology as either the underlying cause or ultimate cure. In setting the context for the conference, Turekian noted that the United States is currently, and for the foreseeable future will be, the world’s major scientific center. Not only does the United States employ the most scientists in major research areas, it also spends the most money, produces the most publications, and is home to many of the world’s top ranked research universities. However, the United States’ lead is decreasing as other countries begin to see the potential for science to boost economic growth and improve standards of living. Turekian went on to explain his view of science diplomacy. Since science and diplomacy are two terms that may not always mesh coherently, he found it useful to delineate the terms in three ways. First, “science in diplomacy” explains how science can help identify and address many of the global and foreign policy issues we face today, as can be seen in the case of climate change. Second, “diplomacy for science” occurs when the science community requires access to the resources of other nations and 12 Opening Night and Keynote Address must turn to the diplomatic community for assistance. The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) serves as a prime example. Lastly, there exists “science for diplomacy,” commonly known as science diplomacy, which Turekian defined as: the application of international science cooperation, motivated by the desire to establish or enhance relationships between societies. Turekian addressed the concept of access in science. Scientists desire access to tangible items such as counterparts, ideas, samples, funding, equipment, and machinery, which may only be obtainable through foreign cooperation.

And, science diplomacy checks escalation of conflicts – it’s an impact filter – independently solves arctic conflict, deforestation, and ocean acidification



Royal Society 10 – a Fellowship of more than 1400 outstanding individuals from all areas of science, mathematics, engineering and medicine, who form a global scientific network of the highest calibre. The Fellowship is supported by over 130 permanent staff with responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Society and its activities. [January, 2010, “New frontiers in science diplomacy”]



Over the next thirty years, foreign policy will be increasingly shaped by the linked challenges of global sustainability (Lee 2009). Professor John Beddington FRS, the UK Government’s Chief Scientifi c Adviser, has warned of a ‘perfect storm’ of food shortages, scarce water and insuffi cient energy resources, which threaten to unleash public unrest, crossborder confl icts and mass migration (Beddington 2009). Science will be critical to addressing these challenges, and the priority of science in diplomacy should be to ensure the effective uptake of high quality scientifi c advice by policymakers (NAS 2002). The scientifi c community must inform policymakers with up-to-date information on the dynamics of the Earth’s natural and socio-economic systems. Scientists must also identify where uncertainties exist, or where the evidence base is inadequate (Royal Society 2005). Probably the best known example of a mechanism for informing policymaking with scientifi c advice is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), to provide the world with a clear scientifi c view on the current state of climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic consequences. The IPCC does not carry out its own original research, but reviews and produces periodic assessments of recent scientifi c, technical and socio-economic research. Thousands of scientists from all over the world contribute to its work on a voluntary basis. Review is an essential part of the IPCC process, and differing viewpoints within the scientifi c community are refl ected in the IPCC reports. In December 2007, the IPCC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (jointly with former U S Vice- President Al Gore) ‘for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change’.5 National academies and learned societies are also an important source of independent scientifi c advice to international policymakers. For example, since 2005, the national academies of science of the G8 + 5 countries have met annually to produce joint statements relating to the themes of the G8 Presidency. Similarly, the InterAcademy Panel on International Issues (IAP), which represents over 100 of the world’s national academies of science, has published statements in 2009 on ocean acidifi cation and deforestation, as a contribution to the United Nations climate change negotiations.6 Even on sensitive issues of national security, collaboration between scientists can help to facilitate political negotiations. The Chinese Scientists Group on Arms Control and the US National Academy of Sciences Committee on International Security and Arms Control (CISAC) recently collaborated on the fi rst Chinese-English glossary of nuclear security terms ‘to remove barriers to progress in exchanges and diplomatic, cooperative, or other activities where unambiguous understandings is essential’ (NAS 2008). And in the Arctic, a collaborative project led by the Geological Survey of Canada and involving researchers from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States recently published the fi rst comprehensive atlas of Arctic geology, which has implications for contentious sovereignty claims (Natural Resources Canada 2009).

===Contention Four=== 
Contention Four is We Are Topical

Definitions that focus on transportation infrastructure investment as a function of economic productivity are politically biased and intellectually lazy – it’s much harder for economists to measure military impact so they leave it out of their studies. However, the most logical definition is public-owned natural monopolies – aka military investments; other interpretations simply devolve this topic to a States CP every round, leading us to the same round every time.

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 8px;">The decline of the public sphere in late twentieth-century America poses a series of great dilemmas and challenges. Many ideological currents are scrutinized here – localism, metaphysics, spontaneism, post-modernism, Deep Ecology – intersect with and reinforce each other. While these currents have deep origins in popular movements of the 1960s and 1970s, they remain very much alive in the 1990s. Despite their different outlooks and trajectories, they all share one thing in common: a depoliticized expression of struggles to combat and overcome alienation. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing impulses is accompanied by a loss of public engagement, an erosion of citizenship and a depleted capacity of individuals in large groups to work for social change</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 8px;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">As this ideological quagmire worsens, urgent problems that are destroying the fabric of American society will go unsolved – perhaps even unrecognized – only to fester more ominously in the future</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 8px;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">And such problems (ecological crisis, poverty, urban decay, spread of infectious diseases</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 8px;">, technological displacement of workers) cannot be understood outside the larger social and //<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">global</span>// context of internationalized markets, finance, and communications. Paradoxically, the widespread retreat from politics, often inspired by localist sentiment, comes at a time when agendas that ignore or sidestep these global realities will, more than ever, be reduced to impotence. In his commentary on the state of citizenship today, Wolin refers to the increasing sublimation and dilution of politics, as larger numbers of people turn away from public concerns toward private ones. By diluting the life of common involvements, we negate the very idea of politics as a source of public ideals and visions. 74 In the meantime, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">The unyielding truth is that, even as the ethos of anti-politics becomes more compelling and even fashionable in the United States, it is the vagaries of political power that will continue to decide the fate of human societies</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 8px;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">This last point demands further elaboration. The shrinkage of politics hardly means that corporate colonization will be less of a reality, that social hierarchies will somehow disappear, or that gigantic state and military structures will lose their hold over people’s lives. Far from it: the space abdicated by a broad citizenry, well-informed and ready to participate at many levels, can in fact befilled by authoritarian and reactionary elites – an already familiar dynamic in many lesser-developed countries. The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world,not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retreat</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 8px;">. In this way the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a //<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">reassertion</span>// of politics in more virulent guise – or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure. In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collective interests that had vanished from civil society. 75</span>

The affirmative’s glorification of wanderlust betrays a lingering faith in the foundational American myth of mobility-as-freedom. Behind the façade of beatnik grandeur, behind the worship of mobility and the uncontrollable lust for the road, lies a much darker story. A cursory glance at the history of transportation in the United States reveals that the originary function of the highway system is not the enhancement of freedom but the facilitation of racism through the spatial and societal confinement of black bodies. From the inception of the automobile, to the separate but equal laws of the early 19th century, to the placement of black communities at ground zero by Cold War defense planners, the possibility of white mobility is always already the condition of black suffering.

==Nietzsche K== 

Attempts to resolve the chaotic aspects of life and avoid suffering require the construction of an ideal world toward which our apparent world aspires. Suffering and antagonism are __inevitable__ aspects of human existence and their focus on the elimination of difference codifies a constant state of emergency into politics.

We are forced to obfuscate our joy in the present world in the hopes of reaching the world of our ideals – this is the __only__ world we’ve got and their direction of hatred against it produces creative impotence and infinite resentment.

==Spanos K== 


First, this metaphysics of presence inherent in the 1AC’s “neutral” policymaking paradigm ensures error replication and the reaffirmation of the imperial knowledge paradigm. The radical egoism of the policymaker’s objective perspective produces the policymaker as the omniscient, supreme being who assigns beings and events their role in a larger narrative which produces violent drives of colonization against the periphery while simultaneously foreclosing this imperialism as necessary to the larger civilizational project-at-hand.
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Spanos 2000 (William V, Prof of English at SUNY-Binghamton, America’s Shadow: An Anatomy of Empire, p.20-24)</span>
<span style="font-size: 8px;">¶ </span><span class="UnderliningChar">To perceive physis from meta, understood as "above</span>," is not sim
AND
encompassing<span class="BoldUnderliningChar"> (policing/imperial) </span>metaphysical eye,<span class="BoldUnderliningChar"> which is "elsewhere."</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">¶ </span>

Second, their framework is predicated on a valorization of intellectual security which produces violent drives towards colonialism.
The drive to “fix” the world in the affirmative’s obsession with policymaking is a form of reactive mastery that attempts to reify the anxiety of our subjective “thrownness” with the spatialization of differential temporality. This ideology of certitude expresses itself in a will to expand and dominate the Otherness of the periphery- the neurotic dream of creating absolute peace with absolute homogeneity.
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Spanos 2000 (William V, Prof of English at SUNY-Binghamton, America’s Shadow: An Anatomy of Empire, p.32-34)</span>

<span class="UnderliningChar">In the "contradictorily coherent" veridical and imaginative discourses of the ontotheological tradition</span>,
<span style="font-size: 8px;">AND</span>
, the circle of Beauty and the circle of Domination are the same.<span style="font-size: 8px;">¶ </span>
Third, policymaking is not a neutral form of knowledge production- it is ideologically biased.
Do not be deluded by the affirmative’s claims that policymaking can correct itself. Policymaking, as a problematic, is ultimately limited by its own attempts at elucidation and vision. The age-old axiom of Cartesian subjectivity is a myth- within Occidental metaphysics makers don’t make policy, policy makes the makers.
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Spanos 2008 (William V, Prof of English @ SUNY-Binghamton, American Exceptionalism in the Age of Globalization: The Specter of Vietnam, 47-50)</span>

<span class="UnderliningChar">This metaphysical epistemology of the liberal capitalist dispensation</span> ^— <span class="UnderliningChar">reifies</span> or, more precisely,
<span class="UnderliningChar">AND</span>
<span class="UnderliningChar">order not to look at them</span>. (CMP, 25-26)<span style="font-size: 8px;">¶</span>
Fourth: We outweigh.
This type of metaphysical knowledge-production inherent in policymaking does not exist in a vacuum. The dual metaphorics of the privileged eye and the centered circle find their elaboration in an ideology with America the exceptional at its center. The difference of temporality is subsumed under a notion of Manifest Destiny which places things knowable in relation to American utility and identity. This errant academic framework ultimately produces a spectral and molecular Other– resulting in global annihilation.
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Spanos 2008 (William V, Prof of English @ SUNY-Binghamton, American Exceptionalism in the Age of Globalization: The Specter of Vietnam, 95-97)</span>

AND
<span class="BoldUnderliningChar">America suffered in the Vietnam War—or the annihilation of the planet.</span>

Finally, our argument is not purely theoretical. We have an empirical and recent example of self-defeating nature of metaphysics of policymaking which parallels Vietnam- the Afghanistan conflict – three reasons
A. The Taliban’s successful adoption of the asymmetrical molecular strategies of Vietnamese guerillas- representing the limits to knowledge produced by the hegemonic problematic of US state-based warfare
B. The overstretch of troop deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan that ensured dual failure- a result of the metaphysical drive to mastery
C. The self-defeating fueling of conflict- higher kill count for US soldiers ensures Taliban/Afghani aggressive sentiment resulting in the exponential creation of more fighters and escalation of conflict-representing the spectral force at the limits of the exceptionalism of policymaking

Text: The United States federal government should substantially invest in its transportation infrastructure by recognizing current transportation infrastructure as heteronormative and reconfiguring public transportation infrastructure in the United States to be non-heteronormative.

Feminism’s reliance upon identity politics dooms their project to the inevitable coercion and exclusion of those individuals feminism seeks to protect. Their reliance upon a stable feminine subject dooms their project to failure.
Butler, Prof. of Humanities and Rhetoric-formerly of UC Berkeley and Johns Hopkins, 1990 (Judith, __Gender Troubles__, pp. 4-5)

My suggestion is that the presumed universality …__opens itself to charges of gross misrepresentation__.


Reject their second wave feminist attempt to ascribe an ontology of gender onto politics. Femisism fixes and constrains the very subjects it seeks to liberate within ready-made heteronormative binaristic subjects of either male or female; masculine or feminine.

Butler, Prof. of Humanities and Rhetoric-formerly of UC Berkeley and Johns Hopkins, 1990 (Judith, __Gender Troubles__, pp. 148-9)

If taken as the grounds of feminist theory or politics….denaturalization of gender as such?

Society is haunted by the death drive – a drive towards nonexistence and death. The necessity of political intervention to save us from impending doom and fear of death is a fantasy of self-fulfillment that denies the existence of the death drive and projects anxiety onto queer bodies who are deemed futureless.
