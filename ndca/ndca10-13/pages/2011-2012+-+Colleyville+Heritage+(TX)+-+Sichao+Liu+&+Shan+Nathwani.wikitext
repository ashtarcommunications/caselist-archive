===<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Contention One is Inherency</span>=== 

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">The failure of Advanced Composition Explorer or ACE is creating a huge operational gap in our ability to predict solar storms – DSCOVR key to solve</span>**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In addition to events such as the Haitian earthquake and global warming,</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">__there lurks another potentially devastating challenge of a different sort to which neither the public nor policy makers have devoted sufficient attention__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">... </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">__We simply cannot afford to let DSCOVR's launch funding be eliminated__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">And Thus, the Plan:</span>**

===<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Contention Two is The Advantages</span>=== 

====**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Advantage One is Solar Storms</span>**==== 

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">They’ll hit Earth in 2013 – we have no precise mechanism for predicting the time of impact</span>**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">An active region of the sun that blasted out powerful solar storms four days in a row last week likely isn't done yet, scientists say... </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">__Scientists expect the peak of the current cycle__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which is known as Solar Cycle 24,</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">__to come in 2013__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">We control the direction of every impact – if we aren’t ready when the storm hits, catastrophe is inevitable</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Brooks 09 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Michael, PhD in quantum physics, New Scientist, “Space storm alert: 90 seconds from catastrophe”, http://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/broadbandgrants/comments/7927.pdf]</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Over the last few decades, western civilisations have busily sown the seeds of their own destruction... From that moment,</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">__the clock is ticking for America__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">It hits globally and escalates</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Brooks 09 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Michael, PhD in quantum physics, Space storm alert: 90 seconds from catastrophe, March 23)</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Such nightmare scenarios are not restricted to North America… Our early warning system is becoming more unreliable by the day.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">No chance for recovery – a solar storm would cause permanent damage to the grid</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Brooks 09 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Michael, PhD in quantum physics, Space storm alert: 90 seconds from catastrophe, March 23)</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">The truly shocking finding is that this whole situation would not improve for months, maybe years: melted transformer hubs cannot be repaired, only replaced… 4-10 years to recover </span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Solar storms cause global meltdowns - nuclear plants lack sufficient back-up power</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Kappenman 1/24</span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">/12, John, 1/24/12, [[http://www.linkedin.com/in/johnkappenman|John Kappenman]] is a leading expert on the disastrous consequences a severe geomagnetic storm could have on the electrical infrastructure, [[http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/the-smarter-grid/a-perfect-storm-of-planetary-proportions/0/hundreds-of-fukushimas]]</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">In a massive geomagnetic storm that could trigger a long-term power outage across large portions of the globe, the world's 400-some nuclear plants would be particularly vulnerable to catastrophic failure, for two reasons… So a massive solar storm that knocks out nuclear power plants' ability to transmit power and destroys their backup power systems could very well trigger dozens or even hundreds of meltdowns.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The impact is extinction - melted radioactive cores will affect all aspects of human life</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Wasserman 02 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(March 22, 2002, Earth Island Journal), [[http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2001/10/00_wasserman_nuclear-threat.htm]])</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The intense radioactive heat within today's operating reactors is the hottest anywhere on the planet… There are 103 of these potential Bombs of the Apocalypse now operating in the United States. </span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">DSCOVR is the only mechanism for providing early warning</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">NRC 08 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(National Research Council of the National Academies, Space Studies Board Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, private, nonprofit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare., Severe Space Weather Events--Understanding Societal and Economic Impacts Workshop Report, [[http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12507.html]])</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Following Bogdan’s presentation on the NOAA SWPC, panelists discussed the benefits of receiving high-qual- ity space weather forecasts, as well as the cost of receiving less than accurate or inaccurate (false-alarms) alerts, for operations such as airline polar flights, power company maintenance work and transfers of power between adjacent systems in the grid, and seismic surveys for offshore oil exploration, engineering, and production... Joseph Fennel of the Aerospace Corporation pointed out that half of the anomalies observed on spacecraft occur when there is no large storm activity on the Sun, but rather when energy is transferred within the magnetosphere, a process defined as a substorm, and that modeling of these events will be much more difficult. </span>

====**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Advantage Two is Warming</span>**==== 

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s real and anthropogenic</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Braganza 11 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Karl, Manager, Climate Monitor at the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia, The Bureau presently operates under the authority of the Meteorology Act 1955, which requires it to report on the state of the atmosphere and oceans in support of Australia's social, economic, cultural and environmental goals. His salary is not funded from any external sources or dependent on specially funded government climate change projects. Karl Braganza does not consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has no relevant affiliations “The greenhouse effect is real: here’s why,” [[http://theconversation.edu.au/the-greenhouse-effect-is-real-heres-why-1515]])</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">In public discussions of climate change, the full range and weight of evidence underpinning the current science can be difficult to find... </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Satellite measurements of outgoing long-wave radiation from the planet reveal increased absorption of energy in the spectral bands corresponding to carbon dioxide, exactly as expected from fundamental physics</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">The DSCOVR satellite is the missing link – “L1” data collection provides unprecedented proof through the most accurate climate models – overcomes warming skeptics</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> Anderson 10 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Mitchell, Staff Writer, The Tyee News, Vancouver Based Science Journalist, The Satellite that Could Save the World, http://mitchellanderson.blogspot.com/2010/02/satellite-that-could-save-world.html)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The media missed the real story about the so-called “climate-gate” scandal... If there is a bright side to the sinister theft of thousands of emails just before the Copenhagen Conference, it is that we can now start to have a more intelligent conversation on the glaring discrepancies in our Earth observation instruments. </span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Warming causes extinction and outweighs nuclear war</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Lynas 07 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Mark, winner of the Royal Society Prize for Science Books, advisor on climate change to the President of the Maldives, Visiting Research Associate at Oxford University’s School of Geography and the Environment, The Guardian, “Six Steps to Hell,”[[http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/apr/23/scienceandnature.climatechange]])</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Scientists estimate that we have at best 10 years to bring down global carbon emissions if we are to stabilise world temperatures within two degrees of their present levels... Acting much like today’s fuel-air explosives (or “vacuum bombs”), major oceanic methane eruptions could release energy equivalent to 10,000 times the world’s stockpile of nuclear weapons.</span></span>
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Accurate data is a prerequisite to any effective policy solution – the plan stimulates government and private sector responses</span>**

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">On a national level, the United States is beginning a similar effort to better inform decisionmak- ers about climate change… Fragmentation damages the effective use of the information that we currently collect.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">Predictions are necessary to create plans to combat warming—people can’t form effective strategies if they’re trying to fix the wrong problem</span>**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Slowly, painfully, we are developing a new policy framework that we hope will enable our society to cope with a changing climate... We need to establish methods of assessing the relative costs and benefits of more aggressive action that will allow us to prioritize actions to take for climate change, and, of course,</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">__we need to continuously improve on understanding how and why the Earth’s climate is changing so as to build greater certainty into policy efforts__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">DSCOVR will verify the cause and reality of global warming - stops the debate in the U.S., which leads to international cooperation to solve warming</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Clark 09 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Stephen, “Testing, review continue for grounded climate satellite”, [[http://microhotshops.info/news/n0910/15dscovr/index.html]])</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">After being criticized by lawmakers and NASA's inspector general, Triana was put on hold in 1999 and missed its scheduled launch on the space shuttle in 2000... NASA, NOAA and the Air Force are awaiting direction from the White House or Congress on the next chapter of DSCOVR's story, whatever that may be, officials said.</span>

===<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Contention Three is Solvency</span>=== 

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">DSCOVR is the cheapest, fastest, and most suitable way to replace the current technology monitoring space storms, which could cause trillions in disaster</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Clark 11 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Stephen C., Space Flight Now, “NOAA Taps Dscovr satellite for space weather mission,” [[http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1102/21dscovr/]]]</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The White House is requesting $47 million in fiscal year 2012 to convert a climate satellite grounded by politics into an observatory to monitor space weather and warn of solar storms... The Obama administration is also requesting money to start work on 12 new small COSMIC satellites with Taiwan to obtain global temperature and moisture profile measurements. </span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">Finally, DSCOVR can be launched now – it’s ready</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Clark 09 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Stephen, “Mothballed Satellite Sits In Warehouse, Waits For New Life”, Space.com, [[http://www.space.com/2286-mothballed-satellite-sits-warehouse-waits-life.html]])</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Valero said the cost of launching DSCOVR's full set of instruments, which includes payloads designed to monitor the solar wind, would not be much different than the cost of flying a new instrument package geared only toward space environment studies... If they don't start working and spending money to remove things, that would be wonderful."</span>
