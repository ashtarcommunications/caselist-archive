After two Koreas exchanged fires early this week, South Korea’s Defense minister Kim Tae-young resigned Thursday.  His resignation was demanded by opposition party’s criticizing their &quot;passive military.&quot; Kim has already offered to resign early this year when their warship sank from North Korean attack.  Presidential Chief of Staff Yim Tae-hee accepted his resignation to improve military’s atmosphere, he said, but Kim is to keep his job until his replacement is named this Friday.<br />
South Korea sent more troops to five islands close to North Korea to strengthen its military force as the North has warned of more attacks. The US has 28000 troops deployed in the South.<br />
Pyongyang blamed Seoul for the attacks and said that they did not like the South’s military exercises in the area at the time and did not like the presence of US troops near its territory.<br />

Concessions like the plan are key to prevent further North Korean belligerence<br />

On the other hand, if the Obama administration is pulled into talks with the North Koreans, it won't be able to escape the appearance that it is caving in the face of pressure. &quot;We've had an underlying philosophy of not rewarding bad behavior with concessions,&quot; a senior administration official said.<br />
Still, without some form of renewed engagement, analysts such as Siegfried Hecker, the former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory who was shown North Korea's uranium-enrichment program on Nov. 12, worry that the North will simply continue along its confrontational path. &quot;You have to address the fundamentals of North Korean security,&quot; he said.<br />

The plan is THE KEY concession that prevents provocations from escalating to war in a matter of weeks − it also forces South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia to pressure North Korea<br />
Trifkovic 11/29 − Foreign Affairs Editor, and Director of the Rockford Institute’s Center for International Affairs (Srdja, “Time To Leave Korea,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2168:http://novakeo.com/?p=8796 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://novakeo.com/?p=8796" rel="nofollow">http://novakeo.com/?p=8796</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2168 -->) Crowe<br />
North Korea’s artillery attack on a South Korean island on Tuesday was the latest in a series of Pyongyang’s aggressive moves over the past year and a half. They started with ballistic missile tests in April of last year, soon followed by a nuclear test in May. Kim Jong Il, who may be mad, upped the ante last March with the sinking of a South Korean corvette, the Cheonan, with the loss of 46 lives. Given his erratic ways and the hellish nature of his regime, America would be well advised to leave the Koreans, north and south, to sort out their differences well alone.<br />
Contrary to the flawed and ignorant New York Times “analysis,” the artillery attack had nothing to do with North Korea feeling “under stress or threatened” by the international sanctions, or “frustrated” with the U.S. negotiating position on its nuclear enrichment program. If this were true, all that is needed is a signal from the White House that America is ready for another round of talks and the tension will subside.<br />
Even less was the barrage connected to alleged “recent moves by the ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong-il to position his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, as heir apparent.” The claim that the Beloved Leader is trying to ensure “that the Kim family dynasty continues for a third generation by winning the loyalty of the powerful military with shows of force” is laughable. The loyalty of North Korea’s officers does not need to be “won,” as any hint that it is anything but total means the death of the suspect. In any event, at the metaphysical level of North Korea’s brand of dialectics the succession debate is superfluous: it is Kim Il Sung—the Great Leader, the Beloved Leader’s father—who is still in charge of the country, having been appointed “Eternal President” by the Supreme People’s Assembly in 1994, four years before his temporal death.<br />
North Korea is acting aggressively because it is weak. Its economy—a surreal mix of Stalinist central planning and Maoist autarky—cannot feed its twenty-odd million people. (Two million are estimated to have died of starvation over the past decade and a half.) Food and money assistance from the South have stopped coming. Kim wants the flow resumed, and he is being obnoxious in the hope of getting a bribe to be tolerable once again. If offered a peace treaty that’s to his liking, he may even become nice. If he gets nothing, he’ll do something even uglier in a few weeks or months. It is a crude ploy, but he is a crude man.<br />
The only reason Kim’s histrionics matter to the United States is the existence of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and the anachronistic and unnecessary presence of American troops in South Korea. The best way to deal with the problem is for the United States to withdraw all its troops from the Korean peninsula and let those most affected by Pyongyang’s behavior—South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia—deal with Kim as they deem fit.<br />

South Korea will respond militarily to further North Korean belligerence − U.S. military presence on the Peninsula guarantees we get drawn into the war<br />
Carpenter 11/29 − vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute (Ted Galen, “Does Washington Need to Fear South Korea More than North Korea?” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2169:http://nationalinterest.org/node/4488 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nationalinterest.org/node/4488" rel="nofollow">http://nationalinterest.org/node/4488</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2169 -->) Crowe<br />
U.S. officials understandably focus on the dangers that could arise from North Korea’s actions. But there is a less obvious risk that merits more attention than it has received: that South Korea has had enough of its neighbor’s aggression and may decide to respond in a manner that triggers a crisis. Events over the past week suggest that South Korea’s military and political leadership might be going down that path.<br />
One has come to expect the North Korean propaganda apparatus to spout apocalyptic warnings on a regular basis. Korea watchers have probably lost count of the number of times Pyongyang has threatened to turn Seoul into “a sea of fire” over the years. And predictably, following the latest incident, North Korean media warned that the region teetered on the brink of war, and that both South Korean and U.S. forces would experience dire punishment if such a conflict erupted. There was nothing new in any of this.<br />
What is new—and more than a little ominous—is the tone coming out of South Korea. President Lee Myung-bak thundered that there would be “enormous retaliation” should the North launch another attack like the shelling incident. Presumably, he has something more substantial in mind than the limited economic sanctions that his government imposed following the sinking of the Cheonan. Speaking at the funeral of two South Korean marines killed in the shelling, the commander of those forces vowed “a thousand-fold revenge” for their deaths. Other prominent figures have adopted a similar strident rhetoric.<br />
Of course, this all may be little more than patriotic bluster for domestic consumption. But having staked-out a strong position against Pyongyang’s latest outrage, political and military leaders risk looking weak—indeed, buffoonish—if the actual response is just more ineffectual symbolism. Equally important, the South Korean public seems to be more supportive of serious retaliatory measures than in the past.<br />
During previous crises, many South Koreans worried that Washington’s response to a Pyongyang provocation might plunge the Peninsula into war against the wishes of the South Korean people and government. They had reasons for such fears. In the months leading up to the 1994 Agreed Framework freezing Pyongyang’s plutonium program, the Clinton administration seriously considered air strikes against North Korean targets. South Koreans also remember how Senator John McCain advocated a similar strategy in 2003, and was openly dismissive of possible South Korean objections. Seoul would not have had a veto over U.S. actions in either case, despite the obvious negative consequences.<br />
But now the opposite risk has emerged—that South Korea could drag the United States into an unwanted war. Washington is counseling restraint, and the Obama administration has publicly praised the South Korean government for its patience and prudence to this point. It is more likely than not that U.S. pressure will prevail and cause tempers in Seoul to cool. Yet even if that happens in this case, U.S. policymakers and the American people should soberly assess the grave risks that our country is incurring by maintaining the defense alliance with South Korea and, even more so, by keeping a tripwire military force on the Peninsula.<br />
If Pyongyang continues to prod and provoke its neighbor, at some point South Korean leaders will likely conclude that they must respond militarily. Like the mild- mannered student who is continuously harassed by the playground bully, there often comes a breaking point and that victim takes a stand. In some cases, the bully then backs down and the overall situation improves significantly. But in other cases, a major fight erupts with highly unpredictable results.<br />
If that happens on the Korean Peninsula, Americans will rue the day that their leaders foolishly maintained a military presence in such a dangerous neighborhood.<br />

U.S. involvement means the conflict quickly escalates to global nuclear war<br />
KCNA 10 − Korean Central News Agency (“US Arms Sale to South Korea Flayed,” September 7, Lexis) Crowe<br />
The US is the arch criminal driving the puppet forces to the escalated confrontation with the DPRK and disturbing the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, the commentary notes, and goes on: The US moves to bolster up its combat capability have turned South Korea into a hotbed of a new war, a nuclear war and created a touch and go situation on the Korean Peninsula.<br />
US nuclear weapons are densely deployed in South Korea and in its vicinity and the interests of powers are intermingled with each other on the Korean Peninsula. In case a war breaks out there, it will quickly develop into a world thermonuclear war.<br />
Defusing the tension and ensuring peace on the peninsula are not only a regional problem but also the most important and responsible task to save the world from a nuclear war disaster.<br />
If the US shuns the conclusion of a peace treaty and seeks to bring down the DPRK by force of arms from the stand of strength to stifle the DPRK, the hostile relations between the DPRK and the US will fester and a war on the peninsula will be unavoidable.<br />
Whether a war is averted and peace is ensured on the peninsula or not entirely depends on the US attitude.<br />

WASHINGTON — North Korea secretly and with unusual speed has built a large new facility to enrich uranium, says an American nuclear scientist who visited the site, according to The New York Times.<br />
The scientist, Siegfried Hecker, told the newspaper in an interview that he was &quot;stunned&quot; by the sophistication of the enrichment facility which included hundreds of newly installed centrifuges. The facility has what he described as an &quot;ultra-modern control room.&quot;<br />
Hecker, a professor at Stanford University and former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, privately informed the White House of his findings a few days ago, said the newspaper in an account published late Saturday on its Web site.<br />
Hecker, who left North Korea last week, had previously described the construction by the North Korean regime of an experimental light-water reactor, confirming satellite photographs that had recently been made public.<br />
But until now, Hecker has made no mention of the discovery of a new uranium enrichment operation that can be used to produce weapons grade material. He told the Times that the North Koreans claimed 2,000 centrifuges had already been installed and were running.<br />

The ever more assertive Beijing obviously believes that stability matters more than anything else. Indeed, the Chinese have been expanding investment in the North. The result has been to discourage reform.<br />
Nothing is likely to change in the near future. Washington should step back and leave the issue to the North's neighbors.<br />
The only Americans within easy reach of Pyongyang's weapons are the thousands of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. Given the South's manifold advantages over North Korea, an American military garrison is unnecessary. The troops should come home.<br />
Then Washington should adopt a policy of benign neglect towards the North. Let Seoul, Tokyo, and Beijing bear the risk of implosion, war, or proliferation.<br />

Unconditional withdrawal of U.S. troops is a PREREQUISITE to denuclearize North Korea − solves Iranian prolif and nuclear terrorism<br />
DeVore 11/23 − California State Assemblyman, lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army (retired) Reserve, Reagan White House appointee in the Pentagon (Chuck, “Time for fresh thinking on Korea,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2173:http://chuckdevore.com/2010/11/time-for-fresh-thinking-on-korea/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://chuckdevore.com/2010/11/time-for-fresh-thinking-on-korea/" rel="nofollow">http://chuckdevore.com/2010/11/time-for-fresh-thinking-on-korea/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2173 -->) Crowe<br />
But continuing the status quo on the Korean peninsula isn’t acceptable either.  Every day that goes by with the North Korean regime intact is another day that allows them to sell nuclear technology and even nuclear weapons to nations such as Iran or to terrorists with cash.  North Korea knows this, which is why they constantly extort South Korea and America, offering to curtail their nuclear program in exchange for assistance, only to later renege on their promises.<br />
America could break this dismal cycle of extortion if it wanted to, but doing so would require more daring and ingenuity than is likely possible from the U.S. foreign policy establishment.  The bold action: pull American troops out of South Korea.  American military power is no longer needed in South Korea, at least not in the purely balance of power sense.  In fact, the American military presence along the DMZ with North Korea only serves to constrain our initiative.  Instead of doing what’s best for U.S. national security, acting to dismantle the North Korean nuclear weapons program, we are hobbled by our alliance with the South into not doing anything that might provoke the North.<br />
My oath of office as a U.S. Army officer doesn’t mention anything about protecting Seoul from attack, but it does specifically say that I am to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic…”  If defending Seoul prevents us from effectively “defend(ing) the Constitution of the United States against all enemies” perhaps it’s time we rethink our increasingly obsolete troop commitment in Korea.  Evacuating U.S. forces from South Korea would allow American foreign policy makers wider latitude in dealing with North Korea.  For instance, the U.S. could issue an ultimatum to the North Korean regime to dismantle its clandestine nuclear weapons program or else face the consequences, which might include an attack on North Korean nuclear facilities, a naval blockade, or an attack on North Korean leadership.  These actions would be entirely within the right of America to defend itself from a regime that continues to threaten U.S. national security.  But, so long as America remains tied at the hip with South Korea, none of these more effective steps will be taken.<br />
Lastly, our 15-year record of impotent and vacillating dealings with North Korea over their nuclear weapons program only serves to send a message to Iran, and other nations, that the U.S. will do nothing to interrupt their drive to nuclearize.  There is far more at stake on the Korean peninsula than the fate of Seoul and the survival of the weird and brutal regime in Pyongyang.<br />

North Korean and Iranian prolif guarantee extinction − the brink is now<br />
Allison 10 − Foreign Affairs (Graham, “Nuclear Disorder,” Jan/Feb, Lexis) Crowe<br />
EDITED FOR GENDERED LANGUAGE<br />
In 2004, the secretary-general of the UN created a panel to review future threats to international peace and security. It identified nuclear Armageddon as the prime threat, warning, &quot;We are approaching a point at which the erosion of the nonproliferation regime could become irreversible and result in a cascade of proliferation.&quot; Developments since 2004 have only magnified the risks of an irreversible cascade. The current global nuclear order is extremely fragile, and the three most urgent challenges to it are North Korea, Iran, and Pakistan. If North Korea and Iran become established nuclear weapons states over the next several years, the nonproliferation regime will have been hollowed out. If Pakistan were to lose control of even one nuclear weapon that was ultimately used by terrorists, that would change the world. It would transform life in cities, shrink what are now regarded as essential civil liberties, and alter conceptions of a viable nuclear order. Henry Kissinger has noted that the defining challenge for statesmen is to recognize &quot;a change in the international environment so likely to undermine a nation's security that it must be resisted no matter what form the threat takes or how ostensibly legitimate it appears.&quot; The collapse of the existing nuclear order would constitute just such a change -- and the consequences would make nuclear terrorism and nuclear war so imminent that prudent states[people] must do everything feasible to prevent it. THE NUCLEAR CASCADE Seven story lines are advancing along crooked paths, each undermining the existing nuclear order. These comprise North Korea's expanding nuclear weapons program, Iran's continuing nuclear ambitions, Pakistan's increasing instability, al Qaeda's enduring remnant, growing cynicism about the nonproliferation regime, nuclear energy's renaissance, and the recent learning of new lessons about the utility of nuclear weapons in international affairs. Most of the foreign policy community has still not absorbed the facts about North Korean developments over the past eight years. One of the poorest and most isolated states on earth, North Korea had at most two bombs' worth of plutonium in 2001. Today, it has an arsenal of ten bombs and has conducted two nuclear weapons tests. It is currently harvesting the plutonium for an 11th bomb and restoring its reactor in Yongbyon, which has the capacity to produce a further two bombs' worth of plutonium a year. In addition, Pyongyang has repeatedly tested long-range missiles that are increasingly reliable, has proliferated nuclear technology (including the sale of a Yongbyon-style reactor to Syria), and may be developing a second path to nuclear weapons by building a facility to enrich uranium. From the perspective of the nuclear nonproliferation regime, two questions jump off the page. First, does Kim Jong Il imagine that he could get away with selling a nuclear weapon to Osama bin Laden or Iran? The fact that he sold Syria a plutonium-producing reactor suggests that he does.<br />

Nuclear terrorism is an existential threat − it escalates to nuclear war with Russia and China<br />
Ayson 10 − Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand at the Victoria University of Wellington (Robert, “After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects,” Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism, Vol. 33, Iss. 7, July, InformaWorld)<br />
Washington’s early response to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own soil might also raise the possibility of an unwanted (and nuclear aided) confrontation with Russia and/or China. For example, in the noise and confusion during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist nuclear attack, the U.S. president might be expected to place the country’s armed forces, including its nuclear arsenal, on a higher stage of alert. In such a tense environment, when careful planning runs up against the friction of reality, it is just possible that Moscow and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S. intentions to use force (and possibly nuclear force) against them. In that situation, the temptations to preempt such actions might grow, although it must be admitted that any preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response.<br />
As part of its initial response to the act of nuclear terrorism (as discussed earlier) Washington might decide to order a significant conventional (or nuclear) retaliatory or disarming attack against the leadership of the terrorist group and/or states seen to support that group. Depending on the identity and especially the location of these targets, Russia and/or China might interpret such action as being far too close for their comfort, and potentially as an infringement on their spheres of influence and even on their sovereignty. One far-fetched but perhaps not impossible scenario might stem from a judgment in Washington that some of the main aiders and abetters of the terrorist action resided somewhere such as Chechnya, perhaps in connection with what Allison claims is the “Chechen insurgents’ … long-standing interest in all things nuclear.”42 American pressure on that part of the world would almost certainly raise alarms in Moscow that might require a degree of advanced consultation from Washington that the latter found itself unable or unwilling to provide.<br />

Vessey Senior Fellow in Conflict Prevention and Director of the Center for Preventive Action at the Council on Foreign Relations (Paul, “On Escalation in Korea,” January 13, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2194:http://38north.org/2011/01/on-escalation-in-korea/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://38north.org/2011/01/on-escalation-in-korea/" rel="nofollow">http://38north.org/2011/01/on-escalation-in-korea/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2194 -->)<br />
Despite intermittent crises and many deadly clashes, nearly six decades have passed since the armistice agreement “ending” the Korean War was signed without there being a serious resumption of military hostilities. Though the armed standoff in Korea is hardly a desirable state of affairs, this record can be taken as a reassuring sign of its underlying stability. But how sanguine should we be that the current crisis will recede in much the same way that earlier ones have and that the deterrent relationship will hold? In fact, recent events raise some troubling questions about the volatility of the situation in Korea today. <br />
First, the November 23, 2010 shelling of Yeongpyeong Island by North Korean artillery clearly caught many experts by surprise. North-South relations had been thawing after a summer of heightened tensions following the sinking of the ROK naval ship Cheonan in March. Even the revelation of new nuclear enrichment facilities immediately prior to the attack had seemed to accomplish its putative goal of convincing the outside world that North Korea could not be left to stew in its own juices and that engagement was now imperative. So why would North Korea set back its coercive diplomatic campaign  by launching yet another deadly provocation that antagonized everyone—including its principal patron China—just when the wind was clearly beginning to blow in its favor? Did North Korea fail to see this or did it miscalculate the impact of its actions? Did other factors, notably the succession process underway in Pyongyang, affect the calculus or tip the scales in some decisive way?<br />
Second, the attack on Yeongpyeong Island was also surprising in that it targeted areas inhabited by civilians for the first time since the Korean War. This was no accident, but a carefully choreographed and well executed attack as Joe Bermudez’s excellent account of what happened indicates. Yes, the numbers killed were still less than previous incidents. And yes, one can infer that the choice of Yeongpyeong still signaled restraint by North Korea as the military base on the island had been the source of offending live fire drills and, moreover, represented an “off peninsula” target and thus less likely to trigger wider escalation. But why would North Korea decide to brazenly disregard such an established “red line,” to say nothing of a cardinal international norm, at this time? Can we infer from this a growing willingness to breach other red lines and engage in still more risky behavior?<br />
Third, the rapid change in South Korean public opinion from being largely pacifist and unwilling to countenance a forceful response against North Korea to the situation today where a majority now favor military retaliation if provoked has introduced a new element into the crisis. Tough statements by senior ROK officials—including President Lee Myung Bak—that South Korea will use force in the event of another aggressive act suggest that the days of Southern forbearance are over. This is completely understandable and, to many, a necessary prerequisite to deter future provocations. Yet, how confident can we be—especially in light of recent events—that North Korea will take the threat of South Korean retaliation seriously? Might it only goad them further? And should we worry that South Korea might take preemptive action if it had credible indications of another provocation?<br />
Remarkably, despite all the commentary on the current crisis, to say nothing of the obvious stakes involved, scant attention has been given to how tensions might actually escalate rather than dissipate contrary to past experience. Certainly plenty of commentators have warned about how “miscalculation,” “loss of control” and “unintended escalation” could trigger a new Korean war, but rarely beyond such broad generalizations and assertions. Conversely, those who discount the likelihood of significant escalation should the South retaliate militarily in the future have been no more forthcoming in explaining why the risk remains low other than repeating the broad conviction that it is in neither side’s interests to go to war. As we have seen in many cases, however, an expectation of rational behavior—especially for decision makers under conditions of stress and incomplete information¬¬—is not something that can be reliably assumed.<br />
The propensity of another major clash on or around the peninsula to escalate militarily depends on numerous complex factors. Understanding them may seem like an arcane or academic exercise, but it is in fact critically important to considering how best to manage the current crisis and prevent the very outcome that everyone—including presumably the North Koreans—wishes to avoid. Four interrelated variables are likely to be the critical ingredients to how another deadly clash might escalate. These can be simplified as the “who, where, what and why” factors:<br />
Who’s Involved: In the most recent provocations, North Korea has evidently been careful to confine their operations to South Korean targets. A future incident that either intentionally or accidentally involves U.S. forces or citizens in Korea would clearly raise the stakes. It is has been some time since this has happened and one could infer that North Korea understands that the risks have grown too high and thus they will continue to refrain from any direct or harmful interactions with the United States. The decision to carry out joint U.S.-ROK naval exercises in the vicinity of the recent provocations presumably had this in mind to help deter further attacks. Yet, how sure can we really be that North Korea would not target U.S. forces in the future? Might they make the same calculation that the U.S. will be just as risk averse to taking retaliatory action as the ROK has been to date? And even if they do continue to avoid provocations that may involve the U.S., how confident are we that they would know when U.S. forces or citizens are not in harm’s way? Finally, while the involvement of the U.S. would clearly increase the risk of military escalation, we should also not overlook the potential role of Japan. It too has been the target of past provocations and its tolerance for aggressive North Korean behavior has lessened considerably in recent years while its capacity for military retaliation has manifestly increased.<br />
Where the Interactions Take Place: As several analysts have pointed out, the Cheonan and Yeongpyeong incidents are the latest in a decade-long sequence of military clashes along the disputed Northern Limit Line (NLL)—all of which have stayed localized. Were additional incidents to occur in this same general area, the supposition is that South Korea would retaliate in the proximate vicinity and in a proportional way to reduce the risk of further escalation. This raises the question of whether North Korea would view South Korean retaliation against mainland, i.e. “on peninsular” targets—which are reportedly now being considered—as a qualitatively different and therefore disproportionate response regardless of how discrete or contained they were? There is no assurance, in any case, that North Korea would confine any future provocations to the NLL/Yellow Sea area. Meddling with the Kaesong Industrial Complex, including the detention of South Koreans who work there, has been mentioned as a possibility. Insertion of special forces into the South if only for reconnaissance purposes is also not out of the question. There have been plenty of precedents after all. Neither should Seoul be viewed as off limits as demonstrated by the failed assassination attempt in late 2009 by a North Korean “hit team” against their most senior defector Hwang Jang Yop. How South Korea would respond proportionately to these or similar types of activities are not immediately clear, though one can anticipate considerable public agitation to retaliate promptly.<br />
What Type of Interactions Take Place: The scale, intensity, and nature of any further military interactions clearly have a major bearing on how a crisis would subsequently escalate. Intermittent artillery duels across the NLL and even the DMZ would probably not precipitate a major outbreak of hostilities. The use of airpower, however, which has been raised as a possible retaliatory option by the new ROK Defense Minister, introduces a new, more uncertain element since it entails the direct incursion of sovereign territory and thus represents a clearer political affront to the North. (It also introduces the possibility of downed and captured pilots that could also complicate matters). Targeting major symbols of national power such as nuclear facilities and missile bases—however surgically undertaken—would undoubtedly represent a still greater challenge to the North which we can reliably assume would not go unanswered. The most important variable, however, will be the perceived operational status of each side’s main offensive capabilities. If either North or South Korea perceives that opposing forces are being readied to engage in large scale offensive operations, the incentives to strike first will inevitably increase. For the North the reason would be to avert the almost certain demise of the regime and for the South it would be to minimize the risk to Seoul. But, as has often been observed, precautionary defensive measures designed to bolster deterrence are not easily distinguishable from offensive preparations and thus the potential for miscalculation exists. Here changes to the size, disposition, and alert status of U.S. forces in and around Korea, including the potential activation of reinforcements and the evacuation of non-combatants from forward areas, will be absolutely critical to perceptions of intent.<br />
Why Further Provocations are Initiated: If North Korea’s recent actions along the NLL are really just the latest manifestations of a more than decade long effort to redress perceived grievances about the maritime border and, moreover, to settle scores with the South Korean military for previous setbacks, then new provocations for this purpose and the likely response that they prompt would probably keep the crisis from escalating significantly, notwithstanding the cautionary factors noted above. However, if North Korea conducts further military provocations primarily for the purpose of relieving the diplomatic and economic pressure that has been brought to bear on it in recent years (or it feels that negotiations are not producing sufficient concessions), South Korean retaliation would presumably have to incur significantly extra costs to make North Korea desist from continuing its campaign. This also presumably increases the odds that Pyongyang would feel compelled to respond in kind, which could set in motion a dangerous escalatory dynamic. Furthermore, if the leadership in Pyongyang is primarily or even secondarily motivated by the desire to embarrass the leadership in Seoul and/or bolster the legitimacy of the heir apparent—Kim Jong Il’s young and inexperienced third son, Kim Jong Un—through further provocations, then additional escalatory pressures could come into play. Not only would it likely increase the demands on the South to respond forcefully, but its subsequent retaliation would likely be harder for the North to ignore because of its potential harmful effect on the standing of the designated successor. Potential voices of caution and restraint could in the process become muted to avoid appearing less than fully supportive or loyal to the new leadership. Indeed, to curry favor, the incentives to be bold and aggressive may actually increase. This will be especially true if Kim Jong Un is personally directing the recent provocations as some believe he is.<br />
All this should make us think more than twice about how to respond to any future North Korean provocations. In particular, it should remind us about the “fallacy of the last move” and the potential for unintended consequences when military action is contemplated against North Korea. Getting on a moving escalator is much easier than getting off one. <br />

U.S. military presence is the SOLE FACTOR that escalates the conflict to war with China<br />

The DPRK is well aware of this, hence the reaffirmation of the zero tolerance policy at Yeonpyeong. On 23 November, in the aftermath of the clash, the KPA issued a communiqué which reiterated the policy:<br />
It is a traditional mode of counter-action of the army of the DPRK to counter the firing of the provocateurs with merciless strikes. <br />
Should the south Korean puppet group dare intrude into the territorial waters of the DPRK even 0.001 mm, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will unhesitatingly continue taking merciless military counter-actions against it.[91]<br />
This is a calculated policy of brinkmanship, designed to avert war, by threatening war. The danger is, of course, that the momentum of events will bring war about. That, unfortunately, is becoming ever more likely.<br />
Lee Myung-bak is a consummate politician. He has set things in motion to produce, and replicate crisis, while giving the appearance of being reluctant. His address to the nation on 29 November used the same rhetorical device as Antony’s speech about Julius Caesar, where he claims to be burying Caesar, not praising him, but of course is doing just that. Lee combined ‘humility’ with an aggressive stance in such a way as to suggest he was reluctant to exacerbate the situation but was being forced into it.<br />
President Lee Myung-bak’s address Monday is being summarized as consisting mainly of “humility toward the people of South Korea” and an “ultra-hardline response to North Korea.” Analysts say it shows the president’s perception of the current crisis facing him and its solution following the North Korean artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island.<br />
Although even North Korea acknowledged the attack to be a “provocation,” President Lee has faced harsh criticism domestically. Surveys show that more than 70 percent of South Koreans, conservative and progressive alike, feel that the military and Lee Myung-bak administration did not respond appropriately at the time of the attack. The fact that the president began his address Monday with what amounted to an apology to the people of South Korea reflected a consideration of this situation. [emphasis added]<br />
The performance so impressed the reporter from the liberal Hankyoreh that we get manifestly false statement that ‘North Korea acknowledged the attack to be a ‘provocation’. <br />
Throughout the crises of 2001, especially over Cheonan and then Yeonpyeong, Lee Myung-bak has been very adroit in fanning the flames while give the impression that he was attempting to put them out. In respect of the Cheonan incident President Obama was reported as saying<br />
&quot;I think President Lee has shown extraordinary restraint given these circumstances.’[92]<br />
It may be objected that this was a public statement and should not be taken too literally; politicians often say in public the opposite of what they think in private. However, there does seem to be a consensus among Western observers at least that Lee is a reluctant warrior being driven into taking steps by the provocative obduracy of the North.[93] Take, for instance, this STRATFOR interview where the interviewer comments:<br />
I talked to three former [US?] envoys to Seoul this week and all of them agreed that South Korea had handled this in a pretty cool and sensible fashion[94]<br />
The South Korea public is rather more sceptical.<br />
One of the WikiLeaks cables [09SEOUL59] illustrates the confusion in the minds of US officials:<br />
President Lee is determined not to give in to North Korean pressure. Our Blue House contacts have told us on several occasions that President Lee remained quite comfortable with his North Korea policy and that he is prepared leave the inter-Korean relations frozen until the end of his term in office, if necessary. It is also our assessment that Lee's more conservative advisors and supporters see the current standoff as a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the North, even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship.[95]<br />
On the one hand we have Lee facing up to North Korean pressure, but we also get the admission that the ‘current standoff’ ( this was in 2009) is seen as ‘ a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the North, even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship’.<br />
Lee’s brinkmanship is, in fact, far more profound and aggressive than the US diplomat realised. Both North and South are engaging in brinkmanship, but the nature of the two is very different. Pyongyang is far poorer and weaker than its adversaries, which include not merely South Korea but the United States, and Japan.[96] North Korea’s brinkmanship is therefore inherently defensive. It is designed to protect the country (or regime if you prefer that) from attack and conquest. That does not mean that it is wise, or will be successful, that is a matter of debate. But it is important to recognise its essential characteristic of defensiveness.<br />
South Korea’s brinkmanship, on the other hand, is offensive. It is designed to bring about the collapse of the DPRK and its takeover by the ROK. Lee Myung-bak does not have to do this. His immediate predecessors (Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun) had very different policies. Indeed, his aggressive brinkmanship is arguably a new development because even in the days of the military dictatorships while there was hostility towards the North because the balance of forces if anything favoured the North, there was not such an ambitious policy.<br />
However, Lee Myung-bak is reputedly pragmatic and opportunistic. Soon after he won the presidency he was described in the New York Times thus: <br />
Mr. Lee has a reputation as a pragmatist who, in contrast to President Roh Moo-hyun, holds few strong ideological positions. As mayor, he created parks and reformed the public transportation system. As president, he said, his main agenda would be to revive the country’s economy.[97]<br />
If that is correct, his brinkmanship has been a response to events and opportunities, rather than a considered strategy. In addition, we may discern three factors which may be propelling him to accelerate the buildup of tension on the peninsula.<br />
• A desire to renew the anti-North momentum after the relative failure of the Cheonan incident. His setback in the May elections, the widespread public scepticism about the investigation, and the failure to get the UN Security Council to condemn North Korea must rankle. The Yeonpyeong incident is seen as away to rekindle anti-North Korea sentiment<br />
In his address on 29 November he specifically made the point:<br />
There was a split in public opinion over the torpedoing of the Cheonan. Unlike that time, our people have united as one this time.[98]<br />
Despite the frequent assertions of implosion and crisis, the DPRK is not facing collapse. Whilst sanctions must have caused huge damage it appears that the economy is recovering. Certainly Pyongyang, from personal observation on a visit in November 2010, is manifestly economically improved over my last visit three years ago, with more motor vehicles, bicycles, and shops. The electricity supply is much better and there is a very noticeable increase in street lighting. These observations are broadly corroborated by series of recent American visitors.[99] If the South is to take over the North then something must be done to reverse this recovery. <br />
Time is not on Lee Myung-bak’s side. His term of office comes to an end on 25 February 2013 and under the present constitution he is ineligible to run again. Moreover, there are suggestions that because of demographic changes the conservative ascendancy represented by the Lee administration may not be sustainable and that South Korea will move to more progressive administrations.[100]<br />
Since the North’s brinkmanship is defensive, it is reactive and this leaves the initiative in the hands of the South. Seoul has reinforced its forces on the NLL island and has announced that there will be artillery exercises from Daecheong Island, and again on Yeonpyeong. [101] It seems inevitable that Pyongyang will feel compelled to respond. The new ROK Defence Minister, Kim Kwan-jin, has threatened what he calls ‘self-defense air raids’ in the event of another clash; ‘self defense’ being used in the Japanese sense.[102] It will be recalled that clause 9 of the Japanese constitution prohibits the establishment of armed forces, so the Japanese army, navy and air forces all have ‘self-defense’ in their titles thus solving the constitutional problem. <br />
Kim Kwan-jin’s air strike policy is all part of what the New York Times rather approvingly, and with a professional use of euphemism, called a new ‘muscular military posture’.[103] The implications of this new policy are obvious. Not merely has the South great superiority in aircraft, but the new rules allow great flexibility for escalation. <br />
However, there are limits to the ROK military’s freedom of action. There is the legal issue of operational control – when would war be deemed a war and thus trigger US control of the ROK military ? But before that stage is reached, the ROK air force is dependent on US intelligence to operate. Thus any serious escalation of the situation on the Korean peninsula would require US endorsement.<br />
Would this be forthcoming? Unfortunately it looks as if it would. The Obama administration has termed its policy towards Korea as one of ‘strategic patience’. [104] It might be better described as ‘strategic paralysis’. Not merely has it ignored that calls of a many Korea experts to engage with the DPRK, but it has effectively relinquished control of events to Lee Myung-bak.[105] It might be said that ‘strategic paralysis’ is not confined to US Korea policy but is the defining characteristic of Obama foreign policy, and that would be true, but nowhere is it more perilous than in Korea.<br />
Because ultimately Korea is China. A second Korean war would, like the first, soon become a Sino-American war.<br />
<br />
That’s global nuclear war<br />
STRATFOR 10 (“North Korea, South Korea: The Military Balance on the Peninsula,” May 26, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2196:http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100526_north_korea_south_korea_military_balance_peninsula --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100526_north_korea_south_korea_military_balance_peninsula" rel="nofollow">http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100526_north_korea_south_korea_military_balance_peninsula</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2196 -->)<br />
So the real issue is the potential for escalation — or an accident that could precipitate escalation — that would be beyond the control of Pyongyang or Seoul. With both sides on high alert, both adhering to their own national (and contradictory) definitions of where disputed boundaries lie and with rules of engagement loosened, the potential for sudden and rapid escalation is quite real.<br />
Indeed, North Korea’s navy, though sizable on paper, is largely a hollow shell of old, laid-up vessels. What remains are small fast attack craft and submarines — mostly Sang-O “Shark” class boats and midget submersibles. These vessels are best employed in the cluttered littoral environment to bring asymmetric tactics to bear — not unlike those Iran has prepared for use in the Strait of Hormuz. These kinds of vessels and tactics — including, especially, the deployment of naval mines — are poorly controlled when dispersed in a crisis and are often impossible to recall.<br />
For nearly 40 years, tensions on the Korean Peninsula were managed within the context of the wider Cold War. During that time it was feared that a second Korean War could all too easily escalate into and a thermonuclear World War III, so both Pyongyang and Seoul were being heavily managed from their respective corners. In fact, USFK was long designed to ensure that South Korea could not independently provoke that war and drag the Americans into it, which for much of the Cold War period was of far greater concern to Washington than North Korea attacking southward.<br />
Today, those constraints no longer exist. There are certainly still constraints — neither the United States nor China wants war on the peninsula. But current tensions are quickly escalating to a level unprecedented in the post-Cold War period, and the constraints that do exist have never been tested in the way they might be if the situation escalates much further.<br />

Advantage 2 − Unification<br />
<br />
War will obliterate the North’s regime and reunify Korea under Southern control<br />
Brady 10 − OpEd writer, B.A. in Political Science (Kyle, “The Two Imminent Wars,” December 12, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2197:http://is.gd/iCPoQ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://is.gd/iCPoQ" rel="nofollow">http://is.gd/iCPoQ</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2197 -->) Najor<br />
Korea is a similar story, in overview, with similar players. North Korea and South Korea have had an uneasy understanding between them since the end of the Korean War, but no-one expected that to last forever – the recent attacks on South Korea by Kim Jong-Il’s regime were inevitable. The difference between the present and past skirmishes, however, is that South Korea no longer seems willing to passively engage North Korea after being attacked: post-attack, the South Korean Defense Minister resigned, new and aggressive “engagement policies” were created, and the existential rhetoric ratcheted up quite a few notches. A major problem in this conflict is that while no-one fears North Korea in a military or political sense, the fact is that they may have a nuclear weapon, however unsophisticated.<br />
It may not occur by the end of the year, but it appears a war between North and South Korea is inevitable, which would destroy the North Korean regime and result in reunification of the artificially divided countries. Similar to Israel, South Korea would have a devastating military advantage, but their international support will be dependent upon the details of the moment: the United States, and others, are unlikely to support an open attack on North Korea, but if it’s a response to an actual attack, the support becomes more conditional. Since China is a nominal ally of North Korea, standing opposite the United States, and Russia has a presence in the region, this war becomes a game of extreme politics. Japan, through their so-called Defense Force, would support the actions of South Korea, as they are just as threatened by Kim Jong-Il – the United States is an ally of both nations, and the direct involvement of the US could result in Chinese reactionary support of North Korea.<br />
The worst case scenario is a disastrous World War: China, Russia, and North Korea against the United States, Japan, and South Korea, with other nations strewn about. Excepting the will of the Koreas, this is a situation that is likely to be avoided at nearly all cost, for the obvious reasons. More realistically is a fast, devastating air-and-sea war conducted by South Korea and Japan against the North, with the vocal, but nominally military, support of the United States – both China and Russia would denounce the war, and would post forces on their respective Korean borders, but not enter the war. The only way American forces could hold a large participatory role in this war would be with the explicit agreement of China and Russia to not become involved, which, based on recent revelations, may be not only possible, but freely offered.<br />
The Israel-Iran and Korean wars will share the same qualities of shortened length, complex American support, and inevitability, but they differ in one key area: casualties. Israel will pay close attention to minimalizing casualties, if only for PR reasons, and therefore the damage will be mostly military and structural in nature. North Korean casualties, however, will be massive: all military and government institutions will be obliterated, with unavoidable civilian casualties, and the attacks will cause the destruction of the entire core infrastructure of a nation. All of this is assuming that no nuclear weapons are used by Israel, Iran, North Korea, or South Korea – this may or may not be a logical assumption.<br />
These wars will see the involvement, on at least a vocal level, of the United States, and they will change the power structure of their respective regions, lending an even heavier burden to the situations than already exists. Korean reunification will be supremely costly and will challenge the dominance of China in the region. Iranian defeat at the hands of the Israelis may deface the powerless President Ahmadinejad, but Israel will see political, economic, and possibly military consequences at the hands of their Arab neighbors, some of whom are also Muslim states.<br />
The remaining weeks of 2010, and the opening of 2011, will be nothing if not geopolitically tense.<br />

Whether there is a change or not, China’s role in finding a solution to the North Korean crisis is critical. However, like any other country, China will get on board with an effective response only if it sees that its interests are affected or its interests can be served better by an active role. For China, there are three issues that could drive a more active role. As mentioned earlier, one of the major imperatives for China keeping Pyongyang as an ally is because it is a buffer state between the pro-west US-allies and Beijing. The Chinese have been paranoid about the US troops on its border. <br />

The plan is key to get China to support a unified Korea<br />

Let’s take an example. North Korea is a mostly isolated, totalitarian, unpredictable, and downright weird regime. Its only “friend” in the world is China, which provides fuel and food to prop up a North Korean regime that cannot even feed its people during bumper harvests. With increasingly better relations with a South Korea that has a GDP greater than 30 times that of the North, why does China continue to provide a lifeline for the destitute North?  A New York Times editorial answered this question and then moralized by saying something that the Obama administration would likely agree with:  “China has long enabled North Korea, making clear that its only real concern is stability on its border. But China should realize that an erratic neighbor armed with nuclear weapons is anything but a recipe for stability…. After the [North Korean] shelling [of South Korean islands], China called only for a resumption of six-party nuclear talks. It has said nothing about the [newly discovered North Korean nuclear] enrichment plant.”  But if this were the full story, the Times argument would appear logical and valid. Why would China prop up a volatile nuclear power on its border?  When policy seems to defy logic, usually something is missing. In that same day’s newspaper, buried in a regular news story related to China’s reaction to North Korea’s shelling of South Korea and the discovery of the North ‘s enrichment plant, the Times unearthed something that confounded its own moralizing about China’s shoring up of the nefarious North Korean regime. Times reporters reference and then quote Cai Jian, professor of Korean studies at Fudan University:  “The [Chinese] support continues because China fears that the vacuum created by a sudden collapse [of North Korea] there would open the door to rule by South Korea, ‘and that will put an American military alliance on the doorstep of China.’”  Although never mentioned by the Times, the implicit conclusion is that China’s seemingly irrational propping up of pariah North Korea becomes logical if China fears encirclement by a superpower and its allies practicing neo-containment more than it does a small, erratic nuclear country on its border.  Given these uncomfortable facts, the United States could undermine Chinese support for North Korea by giving South Korea five years notice that it will abrogate the U.S.-South Korean security alliance. This alliance is an anachronism from the early years of the Cold War before South Korea’s economic miracle, when North Korea was backed by both the Soviet Union and communist China. If given time to beef up its military before the U.S. withdraws, the now wealthy South Korea could easily defend itself from the impoverished North. Furthermore, because South Korea refuses to significantly open its markets to U.S. goods, the United States is essentially paying a rich nation to defend it.  Thus, even if North Korea collapsed, the Korean peninsula was reunited, and South Korea ruled the unified country, China would no longer have to fear a U.S. alliance on its border. With this greater threat eliminated, China might very well rather deal with a more rational, wealthy, and stable united Korea, rather than have to prop up an erratic and bellicose North Korea. Thus, Chinese might very well have an incentive to end assistance to the North – the only thing that keeps the regime from collapsing. Also, a U.S. withdrawal from the South would greatly diminish the possibility that the United States could be embroiled in a brush-fire war over a peninsula that was of questionable strategic value even during the Cold War.  China, South Korea, and the United States could all benefit from the disintegration of North Korea. Thus, everyone – except North Korea – would benefit from a more realistic U.S. policy toward the Koreas.  <br />

New U.S. sanctions may make life uncomfortable for North Korea's elite, but the North will not feel real pain unless the United States gets help from a reluctant China, Pyongyang's main economic and diplomatic lifeline.  The sanctions announced Wednesday by the Obama administration are a show of solidarity with Seoul over the sinking of a South Korean warship blamed on North Korea. The measures are intended to shine a spotlight on shady North Korean business and weapons dealings.  Forcing the North to abandon its nuclear ambitions, however, will depend in large part on whether China joins tough measures meant to cut off the flow of cash North Korea gets from alleged money laundering, counterfeiting of cigarettes and U.S. currency, drug smuggling, and the sale of missile and nuclear technology.  Getting China to pressure a country it considers a buffer between itself and South Korean-based U.S. troops will not be easy.<br />
<br />
Scenario 1 − Ballistics<br />
<br />
North Korea will have ICBMs by 2015 − they’re a real threat<br />
Shaughnessy 11 − CNN National Security Producer (Larry, “Gates: North Korea could have long-range missile within 5 years,” January 11, Lexis) Crowe<br />
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said Tuesday that North Korea is becoming a direct threat to the United States, asserting that the rogue Communist regime is within five years of developing intercontinental ballistic missiles.<br />
&quot;I think that North Korea will have developed an intercontinental ballistic missile within that time frame,&quot; Gates told reporters during a visit to China. But he said he has doubts that the North Koreans will be able to field many ICBMs. &quot;I believe they will have a very limited capability,&quot; he said.<br />
A spokesman for the Defense Intelligence Agency later supported Gates' remarks, saying, &quot;North Korea's two recent attempts at 'space launches' indicate a continued trend toward development of ICBM capabilities. This trend of development, in addition to North Korea's stated goal of developing a nuclear warhead, supports the Secretary of Defense's recent statement regarding potential threats from North Korea.&quot;<br />
If North Korea acts with urgency, it could have ICBMs in five years, said John Pike, founder of GlobalSecurity.org, a military analysis group.<br />
Part of development is just a matter of trial and error.<br />
&quot;If you test enough times, you will eventually test out whatever fabrication and design flaws there are and you will have a workable missile,&quot; Pike told CNN.<br />
North Korea's most recent test of it's longest-range ballistic missile, in April 2009, was a failure in that it did not put a satellite into space. But experts point out that it flew over Japan before crashing, farther than any other North Korean missile. The 2,000-mile flight proved North Korea is getting better at building long-range missiles.<br />
The North Koreans are &quot;pretty aggressive with its ballistic missile program,&quot; said one U.S. official. &quot;It poses a &quot;serious threat.&quot;<br />
The Gates assessment reflects not new thinking but rather an intelligence estimate put out a decade ago, according to US officials. The 2001 National Intelligence Estimate reads &quot;most Intelligence Community agencies project that before 2015 the United States most likely will face ICBM threats from North Korea.&quot;<br />
 <br />
The impact is nuclear war<br />
Mistry 3 – assistant professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati (Dinshaw, “Containing missile proliferation”, Google Books, pages 9-12)<br />
Thus the missile threat is real (hundreds of short- and medium-range missiles can strike states in Europe and Asia), but its most dangerous aspect (the proliferation of ICBMs) is still limited. The threat could either expand or remain limited in the coming years: it would increase significantly if regional powers obtain foreign technical assistance to build greater quantities of more powerful missiles; it could be limited if foreign technical assistance remains embargoed and political initiatives and institutional barriers restrain target missile programs. The Strategic Consequences of Missile Proliferation Ballistic missiles are particularly deadly nuclear delivery systems and terror weapons because they cover distances of hundreds to thousands of kilometers in a matter of minutes, and are hard to defend against. Missile attacks and deployments therefore have serious strategic, political, and military consequences. On strategic grounds, missile proliferation undermines the nuclear, biological, and chemical nonproliferation regimes. Ballistic missiles enable states (and nonstate actors and terrorist groups) to quickly deliver weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) to distant regions, thereby exacerbating the WMD threat and weakening the nonproliferation regime. Conversely, halting missile proliferation mitigates the WMD threat, strengthens the nonproliferation regime, and enhances international security.  Missile attacks are a significant military threat to armed forces, international peacekeeping forces, and civilian populations. Missiles have been used in several international and civil conflicts: Germany fired thousands of missiles against London and Antwerp in World War II; Iraq launched hundreds of missiles against Iran and several dozen at Israel and Saudi Arabia; Afghan groups fired hundreds of missiles in their civil war, and missiles were used on a smaller scale in other conflicts. The military impact of missiles in these conflicts should not be exaggerated, because missiles are not very accurate, most missiles did not hit any significant targets, and they did not result in mass fatalities. Yet the occasional missile caused dozens, even hundreds, of casualties. In the Gulf War, a Scud strike on an American military barracks caused 28 fatalities, which was the largest number of allied fatalities in a single engagement Another Scud landed some 300 meters from cargo and oil facilities and would have caused high casualties if it had hit these targets. Missiles can be even more deadly against civilian populations; in World War II, a V-2 strike on Antwerp's Rex cinema caused 270 fatalities. Moreover, the above examples involved missiles with conventional warheads. A WMD missile attack would be far more catastrophic. Missile activity has destabilizing political consequences in both wartime and peacetime. Missile strikes that terrorize a target population and increase pressures on political leaders to retaliate can considerably escalate conflicts. In the Gulf War, Iraq's missile strikes against Israel could have had a very serious political impact. The Coalition might have fractured as Arab states left it if Israel had retaliated against Iraq. Further, ballistic missiles escalated tensions in the prewar phase (because of Iraq's declared policy of threatening Israel), widened the war's parameters once the fighting began, and diverted significant air power and special force resources away from other military tasks. Even when they are not used in wars, missile deployments and tests exacerbate interstate tensions. Three examples illustrate this point. First, Soviet missile deployments in Cuba provoked the 1962 missile crisis that brought the two superpowers to the brink of a nuclear exchange. Second, Chinese missile tests off Taiwan in 1995 and 1996 led to a tense standoff between the United States and China, and two U.S. naval battle groups were sent to the Taiwan Strait Third, North Korea's August 1998 rocket test over Japan terrorized Japan's population. Tokyo demanded an apology and explanation from Pyongyang and sus- pended its economic aid. North Korea responded harshly, declaring &quot;Japan's behavior is ridiculous,&quot; adding, &quot;We warn Japan to ... act with discretion and renounce its anachronistic hostile policy.&quot;8  Missile proliferation can also increase the likelihood of interstate conflict in the long term. International conflict studies suggest that neighboring states are more likely to fight wars with each other, and that proximity correlates positively with conflict.9 Ballistic missiles can quickly strike distant states and thereby bring distant states &quot;closer&quot; to each other, which (especially if deterrence stability cannot be attained) could increase interstate tensions and the likelihood of regional conflict. Moreover, missile deployments can be provocative in a region where nuclear weapons are vulnerable to a preemptive strike. Missiles then under- mine the stability of deterrence.<br />

It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to Bowman, “even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage—even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!”67 In the same laser technology touted by President Reagan as the quintessential tool of peace, David Langford sees one of the most wicked offensive weapons ever conceived: “One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people.”68 Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that any nation subjected to a space weapon attack would escalate by retaliating with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen.  <br />
 <br />
Scenario 3 − Cyber<br />
<br />
North Korea is the only nation that can and will launch a cyber war<br />
Clarke and Gross 10 (Richard, counterterrorism czar under Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush, Bush's special advisor on cyber-security, Terry, National Public Radio, “On The Growing 'Cyber War' Threat,” April 19, Lexis) Crowe<br />
GROSS: Now, getting back to your point about how cyber-war can skip the battlefield, you can attack through cyber-war without an elaborate military, you said that North Korea is a real power in terms of cyber-war. What are their capabilities?<br />
Mr. CLARKE: Well, they're a real power because they don't have certain kinds of capabilities. This is very counterintuitive. I think the way you determine how powerful a nation is in cyber-war is to add up how good it is in offense and how good it is in defense and get a sum total.<br />
So the United States is very good at offense and very bad at defense, because we really can't defend anything beyond the military. So our score is kind of middling.<br />
If you look at the North Korea, there's some good intelligence information that they have a fairly decent - not world-class, but fairly decent offensive capability. And they do it from outside North Korea. They attack from South Korea. They attack from China. And in terms of a defensive capability, they're about the best, because there are only a few lines leading into North Korea, and very few things in North Korea are controlled by computer networks.<br />
So in terms of a pure cyber-war against one country and the cyber-war back, North Korea can do some damage to us, and we can do almost no damage to them.<br />
GROSS: What do you think the odds are that they would actually launch a cyber- attack?<br />
Mr. CLARKE: Well, with North Korea, I think it's actually pretty high. Because when you say: Why would China hurt the U.S. banking system? They're invested in it. There's a lot of truth to that. Nations have an investment in the international system and the international stability it creates. North Korea doesn't. North Korea could very well pull the temple down around it at some point.<br />
<br />
A North Korean cyber-attack triggers global war<br />
Dallas News 10 − The Dallas Morning News (“Cyber threat,” May 2, Lexis) Crowe<br />
What are the options for retaliation?<br />
Under some circumstances, the attacker would spoof the ID of who launched it. So you might find out relatively quickly [who did it], but you might be wrong. Let's say we know that country X did it. But what if country X doesn't have much in the way of cyberspace? A cyber war begins, but it quickly becomes a full-blown war because you're looking for something to retaliate against. ...<br />
There was a little experimental attack by North Korea last July 4th. Say they do a big attack. You cannot respond against North Korea with a commensurate cyber attack because there's nothing to attack. So people who think that cyber war is neat, clean, no bodies, isn't dangerous - I think they're dangerous because they could get us into a shooting war.<br />

Mr. CLARKE: There are lots of parallels between the development of nuclear strategy in the 1960s and the strategy for cyber-war that one could develop now - I don't think one has been developed, and one of the things we say is we'd like a strategy to be developed and publicly discussed - that the key part of nuclear strategy was, as you say, deterrence. Don't blow me up because even if you do that, I will be able to blow you up.<br />
That doesn't work in cyberspace. All too often, we don't know who's attacking - the attribution problem, as it's called. You can say I'm China, and I'm attacking, and it may be somebody else. You can spoof who is doing the attack.<br />
And because there hasn't been, yet, a big, destructive cyber-war, we don't really believe what the effects will be. With nuclear war, we had had two cities destroyed, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There were 2,200 nuclear bombs that had been exploded in the atmosphere over the course of many years by the United States, Russia, China and other countries.<br />
So the - there was credibility behind the use of the weapon. For deterrents to work in cyberspace, we'd have to know who had weapons and how powerful they would be and how successful they would be, and when the attack came, we'd have to know with good certainty who it was that was attacking, and none of that exists.<br />
GROSS: And so if you're attacked, you don't know what to do. If you attack the country you think it is, and it's the wrong country, that would be very bad. And if you do nothing, that, too, is very bad.<br />
Mr. CLARKE: And it all happens in seconds. It all happens so quickly that for political authorities, for national leaders to really gain control of this, would be hard. I think once a cyber-war starts, it could be a spasm war that, in a few minutes, decisions are made, signals are sent and destruction occurs, and we may have gotten it very, very wrong.<br />

The impact is nuclear war<br />

So it's insanely short-fused as it is. But when I spoke to Blair in Washington last week, he noted an additional cause for concern: cyber-attacks. <br />
He pointed to the preface of his Oslo paper, which focused on how &quot;information warfare&quot; in cyberspace heightened the threat of &quot;inadvertent&quot; nuclear war.<br />
&quot;The nuclear command systems today operate in an intense information battleground,&quot; Blair wrote, &quot;on which more than 20 nations including Russia, China, and North Korea have developed dedicated computer attack programs. These programs deploy viruses to disable, confuse, and delay nuclear command and warning processes in other nations. At the brink of conflict, nuclear command and warning networks around the world may be besieged by electronic intruders whose onslaught degrades the coherence and rationality of nuclear decision-making. The potential for perverse consequences with computer-launched weapons on hair-trigger is clear.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perverse consequences&quot; seems to understate the matter. In a footnote, Blair cites one scary example: the discovery of &quot;an unprotected electronic backdoor into the naval broadcast communications network used to transmit launch orders by radio to the U.S. Trident deterrent submarine fleet. Unauthorized persons including terrorists might have been able to seize electronic control of shore-based radio transmitters ... and actually inject a launch order into the network. The deficiency was taken so seriously that new launch order validation protocols had to be devised, and Trident crews had to undergo special training to learn them.&quot;<br />
Is this the only &quot;electronic back door&quot;? Or is it just the only one we've discovered? And if an unauthorized launch order could be insinuated into the system by hackers, why not a false-attack warning, which could generate an authorized (but mistaken) launch order? So in addition to the potential for accidental nuclear war, there is an even more disturbing threat of deliberate-but-unauthorized nuclear launches.<br />

The timeframe is 15 minutes<br />
Spillius 10 − The Daily Telegraph (Alex, “Cyber attack 'could fell US within 15 minutes',” May 8, Lexis) Crowe<br />
THE United States must prepare for a full-scale cyber attack that could cause death and destruction across the country within 15 minutes, a former anti-terrorism official has warned.<br />
Richard Clarke, an adviser to Bill Clinton and George W Bush, claimed that America's lack of preparation for the annexing of its computer system by terrorists could lead to an &quot;electronic Pearl Harbour&quot;.<br />
Mr Clarke's new book, Cyber War: The Next National Security Threat, written with Robert Knake, warns that tens of thousands of Americans could die in an attack comparable to a nuclear bomb. Yet it would take no more than 15 minutes and involve not a single terrorist or soldier setting foot in the US.<br />
The book outlines a doomsday scenario in which the problems would start with the collapse of one of the Pentagon's computer networks.<br />
Following the attacks, internet service providers would be in meltdown, while chemical plants malfunctioned, releasing lethal clouds of chlorine.<br />
Planes would collide in mid-air and underground trains crash in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. More than 150 cities would be hit by power cuts.<br />
<br />
An effective cyber attack breaks the taboo − causes global cyber wars<br />
Clarke and Gross 10 (Richard, counterterrorism czar under Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush, Bush's special advisor on cyber-security, Terry, National Public Radio, “On The Growing 'Cyber War' Threat,” April 19, Lexis) Crowe<br />
GROSS: Is there a fear that, like, if we're the first country to actually launch a really big and effective, crippling cyber attack that it will set a precedent?<br />
Mr. CLARKE: There is. There very much is that fear. On the other hand, a commander in the future, an American president in the future will probably be told, Mr. President, if you don't do this 3,000 Americans may die trying to do the exact same them in the more traditional kinetic way of doing it. Under those circumstances I think a president is going to probably say, fine. Let's to cyber.<br />

Advantage 3 − Relations<br />
<br />
China supports North Korea because it wants to diminish the influence of U.S. military presence on the Peninsula<br />
Snyder 11 − Director of the Center for U.S.-Korea Policy at The Asia Foundation and a Senior Associate at Pacific Forum CSIS, the Adjunct Senior Fellow for Korean Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations (Scott, “Value and Significance of Korean Reunification Within the Dynamics of Northeast Asia,” SERI Quarterly, Vol. 4, No. 1, January, ProQuest) Crowe<br />
A series of North Korean provocations, including two rounds of missile and nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009, the Cheonan sinking, its enriched uranium announcements, and the recent artillery barrage on the South's Yeonpyeong Island, have clearly revealed the extent to which North Korea's provocations are counter-productive to Chinese interests. However, China's prioritization of peace and stability as the foundations for its continued growth clearly limit the level of punitive measures that it is willing to apply to North Korea. Instead, the Chinese leadership decided in the summer and fall of 2009 that it would seek stronger relations with the North Korean leadership as a means to ensure stability and further promote an environment that would facilitate North Korea's economic reform. This made denuclearization a secondary objective. Second, China has determined that its long-term strategic interests include a Korean peninsula that remains friendly toward Beijing and an environment that diminishes US influence and military presence on the Korean peninsula. <br />
This sense of competition with the United States has strengthened as China's post-Cheonan response has merged with disputes over the South China Sea and the Senkaku Islands during the summer and fall of 2010, as well as its neutral posture in the ongoing Yeonpyeong Island incident. These disputes have tended to further Sino-US differences, rather than serving as opportunities for cooperation. China's tendency to view the Korean peninsula as a strategic issue in Sino-US relations, rather than as a security problem with potential spillover effects on China's periphery, has further exacerbated the mismatch among Chinese, American, and South Korean efforts to manage North Korea related tensions. Likewise, the failure of these three parties to prepare for possible contingencies, despite a shared recognition that internal factors for instability in North Korea are rising, suggests that lack of cooperation by North Korea's neighbors may lead to protracted chaos, which would induce unnecessary, and indeed, catastrophic costs for all parties in the region. <br />

China won’t pressure North Korea in the status quo − it’s a buffer between it’s border and U.S. forces<br />
Bolton 11 − senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (John, “North Korea: Not the Time for Talks,” January 3, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2203:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059562894156474.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059562894156474.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059562894156474.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2203 -->) Crowe<br />
The talks themselves exemplify how, for almost a decade, Washington has followed Beijing's Korea policy as if it were its own. China does not want a bellicose, nuclear North Korea destabilizing East Asia, prompting Japan and others to seek nuclear weapons. But it has definitely prized the North as a buffer state against U.S. forces in the South. China would prefer a nonnuclear North Korea but has feared to act on that goal lest the North itself collapse and the Koreas reunify. The talks are Beijing's mechanism for maintaining the uneasy equilibrium of its contradictory policies, and keeping both the U.S. and North Korea in line.<br />

SQ What kind of reunited Korean peninsula is China likely to favor? What are the biggest concerns for China regarding the birth of a united Korea? This includes the US military forces in Korea Korean nationalism, and the loss of China's vested interests in North Korea <br />
Jin While China supports peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula, we emphasize that there should be no external intervention. So we are strongly against intervention from the US forces. <br />
We are not very concerned with nationalism. Nationalism is really strong around the entire East Asian region, particularly in South Korea. We believe it will be mitigated after reunification. <br />
As for vested interests in North Korea, China has already paid quite a lot. China is not much concerned with vested interests. <br />

Now is key<br />
Tae-Seop 11 − research fellow at SERI, MA in Political Science (Bahng, “The Korean Peninsula after the Yeonpyeong Island Attack,” SERI Quarterly, Vol. 4, No. 1, January, ProQuest) Crowe<br />
Thus, it is critical at this point to prevent current economic tensions between the US and China from escalating to political and military conflict. In this respect, there are legitimate concerns that the US and China may engage in a &quot;proxy conflict&quot; on the Korean peninsula which would vastly worsen the situation for all parties. President Obama's trip to Asia in November 2010 clearly indicated a growing US discomfort with China.5 During his trip, Obama tacitly acknowledged that a certain degree of friction with China was already a long term fixture by pursuing a policy of quasi &quot;containment&quot; of China through alliances with its neighbors.6 Chinese President Hu Jintao in turn is scheduled to visit Washington on January 20, 2011 and while the outcome of his visit cannot be known at this time, results are unlikely to be salutary should the two countries continue to engage in a war of nerves. Hu Jintao's visit to the US may simply affirm both countries in their respective stances, resulting in no compromises at all.<br />

Provocations by the North will collapse US-Sino relations − this is the key issue<br />
Feigenbaum 10 − Adjunct Senior Fellow for East, Central, and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations (Evan, “Korean conflict: Could it escalate?” December 8, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2204:http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/08/korean-conflict-could-it-escalate/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/08/korean-conflict-could-it-escalate/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/08/korean-conflict-could-it-escalate/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2204 -->) Najor<br />
Still, that almost certainly means the crisis will sharpen US-China tensions. The US continues to bet that Chinese leverage will set limits on escalation by Pyongyang and restrain further provocations. But China has shown scant appetite for coercing North Korea, and that seems unlikely to change in a fundamental way. Indeed, while Beijing may well be privately telling the North to knock it off, those private messages have been sweetened by public displays of even-handedness and calls for ‘mutual’ restraint. And with President Hu Jintao coming to Washington in about six weeks, this issue has rocketed toward the top of the US-China agenda. North Korea won’t crowd out every other piece of business, some of which will be positive. But, like a growing number of issues in US-China relations, this one will produce more rancor than agreement.<br />
<br />
Lack of China pressure causes policymakers to shift to a confrontational policy with China<br />
STRATFOR 10 − global intelligence think tank (“Kerry's Speech on China and Hu's Visit to the U.S.” December 8, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2205:http://www.stratfor.com/memberships/177542/analysis/20101208-kerrys-speech-china-and-hus-visit-us --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/memberships/177542/analysis/20101208-kerrys-speech-china-and-hus-visit-us" rel="nofollow">http://www.stratfor.com/memberships/177542/analysis/20101208-kerrys-speech-china-and-hus-visit-us</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2205 -->) Najor<br />
These negotiations come at a critical time for the countries, which are preparing for a highly anticipated visit by Hu in January 2011. The two have sparred over a variety of economic, political and security disagreements, which have intensified since the global economic crisis. The North Korean attacks on the South Korean ChonAn and Yeonpyeong Island raised distrust to a new level, however, with the United States and its allies making shows of force and China resisting their calls to exert more pressure on Pyongyang.  This dispute has re-energized discussions in Washington about the possibility of adopting a fundamentally more confrontational strategy toward China, which has lurked in the background throughout the year as the United States accelerated its re-engagement of the Asia Pacific region, especially given China’s growing willingness to collide with its neighbors and even the United States over differences. Washington has several tools at its disposal, including trade barriers against China’s still-export-dependent economy, if it seeks a more confrontational posture. Given the intensity of the ongoing Korean tensions and trade disputes, there is a risk that the Hu visit could be canceled. <br />

If current trends continue unabated, the year 2011 is likely to see Washington and Beijing return to the 'megaphone diplomacy' that they sought to avoid in 2009. Adoption of this approach tends to occur naturally when the nationalistic sentiments of both populaces become increasingly galvanized. It makes both governments less amenable to compromise and restricts flexibility.  However, this is likely to become critically dangerous over the course of 2012, as the US approaches yet another presidential election in November of that year. There would be nothing to stop bilateral relations from fossilizing into some variation of a cold war. By this time, any compromise on Obama's part will be perceived as weakness and could put his re-election at risk.  Fortunately, there is still time for Beijing and Washington to adjust their bilateral trajectory; they have until late 2011 to turn things around. Having grasped the nature of US presidential power shifts, Beijing tends to see the second and third years of a first-term presidency as 'windows of opportunity' to improve bilateral relations. Washington too must seek engagement; both parties have little choice but to constructively engage each other.<br />

China's development needs a peaceful international environment, particularly in its periphery. We will continue to play a constructive role in global and regional affairs and sincerely look forward to amicable coexistence and friendly cooperation with all other countries, the United States included. We will continue to push for good-neighborliness, friendship and partnership and dedicate ourselves to peace, stability and prosperity in the region. Thus China's development will also mean stronger prospect of peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large. China and the US should, and can, work together for peace, stability and prosperity in the region.<br />
Given the highly complementary nature of the two economies, China's reform, opening up and rising economic size have opened broad horizon for sustained China-US trade and economic cooperation. By deepening our commercial partnership, which has already delivered tangible benefits to the two peoples, we can do still more and also make greater contribution to global economic stability and prosperity.<br />
Terrorism, cross-boundary crime, proliferation of advanced weapons, and spread of deadly diseases pose a common threat to mankind. China and the US have extensive shared stake and common responsibility for meeting these challenges, maintaining world peace and security and addressing other major issues bearing on human survival and development. China is ready to keep up its coordination and cooperation in these areas with the US and the rest of the international community.<br />

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - Impoverished North Korea could bring its own collapse if it keeps pouring scarce national resources into its nuclear weapons program and military, a senior South Korean official warned in an interview to be broadcast Monday.<br />
South Korean officials have used tough language against North Korea after two deadly attacks last year killed dozens of people. But it's still rare for a top Seoul official to speak publicly on a potential North Korean collapse and shows the South's growing impatience with its communist neighbor.<br />
&quot;I think they will come to the point where they can no longer sustain the burden of military expenditures,&quot; Chun Yung-woo told &quot;PBS NewsHour,&quot; according to part of the interview posted on the U.S. public broadcaster's website.<br />
Chun is South Korea's chief presidential adviser on national security and foreign affairs and once was the South's top negotiator on now-stalled six-nation talks on the North's nuclear weapons program.<br />
&quot;They are already suffering from misery ... I think they will be worse off,&quot; Chun said. &quot;I think their obsession with their military capabilities, especially weapons of mass destruction like nuclear weapons, chemical weapons ... that would be a short-cut to their demise.&quot;<br />
He said &quot;the energy for changing&quot; North Korea is growing but declined to predict when that change might happen.<br />
North Korea's state-controlled economy was devastated by natural disasters and mismanagement in the 1990s, and a botched 2009 currency reform and massive flooding last year are feared to have worsened it. However, experts say the North still devotes much of its scarce resources to its 1.2 million-member military under its &quot;army-first&quot; policy.<br />
In November, the North unveiled a uranium enrichment facility that could give it a second way to make atomic bombs in addition to its known plutonium-based program. North Korea has deployed new types of tanks near the border with South Korea and boosted its special operations forces in recent years, according to an official South Korean defense document released late last month.<br />
Tension on the peninsula spiked after North Korea unleashed artillery shells on a front-line South Korean island near their disputed sea border, killing four people. The shelling came eight months after a deadly warship sinking that South Korea and the U.S. have blamed on Pyongyang. The North has denied its responsibility for the sinking that killed 46 sailors, and it says the South provoked the island attack with nearby military drills.<br />
Chun said the attacks indicate how desperate North Korea is due to its economic crisis.<br />
&quot;I think North Korea's behavior enabled us to see North Korea as it is, not as we want to see it,&quot; Chun said. &quot;I am inclined to see it as an indication of their desperation.&quot;<br />

North Korea will never play nice − it’s aggression is ideologically built in − this makes regime collapse inevitable<br />
Myers 10 − director of the international studies department at Dongseo University in Busan, South Korea, contributing editor of The Atlantic (B.R., “North Korea Will Never Play Nice,” November 25, Lexis) Crowe<br />
The provocation view of North Korean behavior also distorts our understanding of the domestic situation. Analysts tend to focus too much on the succession issue; they interpret the attack on the island as an effort to bolster the reputation of Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il's son and anointed successor. Their conclusion is that North Korea will play nice once the young man is firmly in power.<br />
In fact, as both its adversaries and supporters should realize, the North can never play nice. Just as our own economy-first governments must ensure growth to stay in power, a military-first regime must deliver a steady stream of victories or lose all reason to exist.<br />
There is no easy solution to the North Korea problem, but to begin to solve it, we must realize that its behavior is aggressive, not provocative, and that its aggression is ideologically built in. Pyongyang is thus virtually predestined to push Seoul and Washington too far, thereby bringing about its own ruin.<br />
The Chinese should take note of this, since their rationalization for continuing to support North Korea derives from the vain hope that they can prop it up indefinitely. The military-first state is going to collapse at some stage; let's do what we can to make that happen sooner rather than later.<br />

U.S. troops will go to China’s border post-unification<br />
Zhebin 9 − director, Korean Studies Center, Far East Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences (Alexander, “MOSCOW FACING THE KOREAN RUBICON; Any military action close to Russia's borders is unacceptable,” June 5, Lexis) Crowe<br />
Those politicians and analysts who hasten to condemn Pyongyang's resistance to America's dictates are somehow ignoring the fact that if North Korea is eliminated, we would very soon end up with an Asian version of NATO: the USA, Japan, the unified Korea, and Australia (which signed a military cooperation agreement with Japan in 2008). And the US troops now stationed in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula would move into its northern part, along the 1,400-kilometer border with China and the 17-kilometer border with Russia.<br />

This causes China to kick us out of East Asia entirely − obliterates heg and the economy<br />
Jin 11 − Deputy Dean at the School of International Studies at Renmin University of China (Canrong, “SQ INTERVIEW: China’s North Korea Policy,” SERI Quarterly, Vol. 4, No. 1, January, ProQuest) Crowe<br />
The main obstacle to unification is the large disparity between the North and South. China has always insisted on no external intervention in unification. One situation that China will absolutely not accept is the prospect of US forces stationed near the YaIu River after unification. China paid very high costs during the Korean War to fight with US forces and push them back to the 38th Parallel. Therefore, for China, it is unacceptable to have US forces stationed near the YaIu River after reunification. <br />
In short, China supports the unification of the peninsula. But as long as North Korea exists, China will not openly discuss this issue. Second, China will absolutely not accept American Forces at the YaIu River after reunification. Finally, in the long run, I think reunification will be achieved, and China as a country that is getting stronger and stronger, is willing to see that happen. <br />
Japan might have some concerns about unification. Japan's economy is declining, and the rise of the Korean peninsula might be perceived as a threat. Russia cares relatively little about reunification. Because of its shrinking economy, Russia's focus will narrow and it will concentrate on its European side. The United States cares greatly about unification; because after reunification, if the US cannot handle its relationship with China well, it will be forced to leave the Korean peninsula. After that, it may find it difficult to stay in Japan as well. This means that the US will generally lose its leadership position in Asia. This will encourage a knock-on effect around the world and the US will lose its position in Europe and Latin America. What would happen if the US lost its global leadership position? The foundation of its economic development would collapse. Its &quot;virtual economy&quot; would find it difficult to carry on.<br />

As rival powers rise, Asia in particular is likely to emerge as a zone of great-power competition. Beijing’s economic rise has enabled a dramatic military buildup focused on acquisitions of naval, cruise, and ballistic missiles, long-range stealth aircraft, and anti-satellite capabilities. China’s strategic modernization is aimed, ultimately, at denying the United States access to the seas around China. Even as cooperative economic ties in the region have grown, China’s expansive territorial claims — and provocative statements and actions following crises in Korea and incidents at sea — have roiled its relations with South Korea, Japan, India, and Southeast Asian states. Still, the United States is the most significant barrier facing Chinese hegemony and aggression.<br />

This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline, but it encompasses a trend that appears to be negative and perhaps alarming. Although the US still possesses incomparable military prowess and its economy remains the world’s largest, the once seemingly indomitable chasm that separated America from anyone else is narrowing. Thus, the global distribution of power is shifting, and the inevitable result will be a world that is less peaceful, liberal and prosperous, burdened by a dearth of effective conflict regulation.<br />
Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts.<br />
However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid.<br />
As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves.’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law.<br />
Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations.<br />
However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that America’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way.<br />
Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations.<br />
For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy.<br />
Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973).<br />
A world without American hegemony is one where great power wars re-emerge, the liberal international system is supplanted by an authoritarian one, and trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy.<br />

A multipolar world that is not moving toward nuclear disarmament is a world of an expanding Nuclear Club. While Russia and the West continue to argue with each other, states that are capable of developing nuclear weapons of their own will jump at the opportunity. The probability of nuclear weapons being used in a regional conflict will increase significantly.<br />
International Islamic extremism and terrorism will increase dramatically; this threat represents the reverse side of globalization. The situation in Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North and East Africa will further destabilize. The wave of militant separatism, trans-border crime and terrorism will also infiltrate Western Europe, Russia, the U.S., and other countries.<br />
The surviving disarmament treaties (the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty) will collapse. In a worst-case scenario, there is the chance that an adventuresome regime will initiate a missile launch against territories or space satellites of one or several great powers with a view to triggering an exchange of nuclear strikes between them. Another high probability is the threat of a terrorist act with the use of a nuclear device in one or several major capitals of the world.<br />

Soon the economy will collapse. As you know, America relies upon Japan and other foreign investors to prop up its dollar. We are a bankrupt nation. Much profit could be made from the collapse of the U.S. economy. U.S. land and industries will be up for sale at bargain basement prices for foreign capital. At this point Americans will lose control of their whole country and the U.S. will become like a third world nation, with its starving and homeless population standing by watching its wealth being shipped abroad for the benefit of its foreign investors.<br />
Our political system and economic system are all figments of the collective imagination. We can dissolve them instantly with just a moment of unanimous disbelief... Our deadline, the last possible chance to do it before we are swept away inexorably to our doom, is when the economy collapses. <br />
At that time there will be skyrocketing inflation, and quite possibly the flow of food to the cities could be disrupted. Large-scale rioting and civil war would be likely to break out. Martial law would be declared and then the military would be in total control of our society. Our democratic civil rights would be suspended and we would be powerless to stop the government from launching into that final global nuclear war which would obliterate our country and much of the rest of the world.<br />

The plan diverts money for long-range bombers<br />
States News Service 11 (“US PLANS CUT IN ARMY TROOPS BY 2015,” January 6, Academic OneFile) Crowe<br />
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates says without faster-than-expected growth in his department's budget in the coming years, the United States will have to reduce the size of its Army by 27,000 soldiers by the year 2015. But Gates says the Army will still be larger than it was when he took office four years ago. <br />
Secretary Gates announced that his staff has found $150 billion in savings over the next five years, which will be plowed back into the budget to fund cost increases and provide money to start new projects. Cuts include a new amphibious landing craft for the Marine Corps and the Corp's version of the new U.S. fighter jet. <br />
The cuts will free up money for new investments, including an Air Force plan to re-start development of a long-range bomber with conventional and nuclear bombs capable of penetrating hardened facilities, an Army plan to buy more high technology surveillance and communications gear and Navy plans to buy more ships, fighter jets and unmanned aircraft. <br />
But even with the savings, Secretary Gates says unless the Defense Department's budget grows more than expected during the coming years of budget austerity, the U.S. Army will have to shrink by 27,000 in 2015, on top of the 22,000 reduction already planned and an expected reduction of 15,000-20,000 in the U.S. Marine Corps. <br />

But the bunker buster may look attractive as a tool against nonnuclear countries, said Thomas Cochran, a proliferation and nuclear war expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit group that is heavily involved in the arms debate.<br />
&quot;The difficulty, basically, is this gives you an underground capability, to go after these bunkers with smaller yield devices,&quot; Mr. Cochran said.<br />
Referring to the possibility of using a nuclear bomb to prevent others from developing nuclear weapons, he added, &quot;Arguably, this will increase the likelihood of using these in these counter-proliferation scenarios.&quot;<br />
Robert S. Norris, a nuclear weapons expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council said: &quot;This is really a carry-over from the cold war, when our targeting plans from the 80's were leadership, command and control, deeply buried structures like silos and things. We decided that if they were held at risk, the Soviets would be deterred.&quot;<br />

Wilson 8 (Frank, “In praise of ...” November 2, Lexis) Crowe<br />
I worked in the field of arms control and disarmament off and on during the 1960s. I believe that the threat of annihilation was actually less then than it is now. The superpowers knew what the conequences of nuclear war would be and took steps to prevent it. The real threat then was the one that remains a threat today: nuclear proliferation. A rogue state with nuclear weapons lacks the restraints the superpowers imposed on themselves.<br />

Cyber attacks kill the economy<br />
Clarke and Gross 10 (Richard, counterterrorism czar under Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush, Bush's special advisor on cyber-security, Terry, National Public Radio, “On The Growing 'Cyber War' Threat,” April 19, Lexis) Crowe<br />
GROSS: So you write in your book that a cyber-attack can be almost as devastating as weapons of mass destruction in its ability to cripple the country. Fortunately, nothing like that has happened yet. You've mentioned some cyber-attacks, but they haven't crippled the country. Give us a scenario in which a cyber-attack can actually cripple the country and be the equivalent of WMD.<br />
Mr. CLARKE: Well, I think - I will in a sec, but before I do, I should point out that weapons of mass destruction that most people are real - nuclear weapons - people worry about them. They've never crippled the country, either. So suspend disbelief when I talk about a cyber-war doing it because, after all, you believe in nuclear war, and nuclear war hasn't done it.<br />
What could cyber-war do? It could derail trains all over the country. It could blow up pipelines. It could cause blackouts and damage electrical power grids so that the blackouts would go on for a long time. It could wipe out or confuse financial records so that we would not know who owned what, and the financial system would be badly damaged.<br />
It could do things like disrupt traffic in urban areas by knocking out traffic control computers. It could, in nefarious ways, do things like wipe out medical records.<br />
GROSS: Now, you warned the Bush administration about the threat from al-Qaida in the early days of the Bush administration, and you were kind of shoved aside, and then al-Qaida attacked. So I take your warnings very seriously.<br />

With what seems like almost constant U.N. controversy towards North Korea, the country still defies the international community and continues its nuclear program and rocket testing. The rise of Kim Jong-Un to power and his need to prove himself could be an underlying reason. Although North Korea may just be throwing a fit in an attempt to receive aid. Never-the-less due to this constant belligerent behavior on the part of the North Koreans it is clear a war is inevitable.<br />
Rumors of downsized military recruitment may soon go away if the United States asserts military control in the Korean region. A considerably large amount of American soldiers would make their way to the region. With a large amount of US troops having already engaged in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan the military will be stretched thin and seeking new recruitment. Considering the outcome of the last Korean War it is hard to say if this war will lead to a unified Korea or another stale mate. In either event South Korea has been a victim of injustice and military action will take place somewhere in the near future if diplomacy fails, and if history repeats itself, it most definitely will fail and lead to war.<br />
<br />
Overstretch causes miscalc and great power war<br />
Gordon 7 − chief military correspondent for the New York Times (Michael, “Survival, Break Point? Iraq and America’s Military Forces”)<br />
The risks presented by a constrained number of ground forces extend beyond Iraq. They raise the possibility that an adversary might miscalculate, projecting that it can undertake provocative actions that the United States would find it difficult to respond to. The Iraq War was intended by the Bush administration as a demonstration of American power and resolve that would serve as a cautionary lesson to nations like Iran, which is pursuing a nuclear-weapons capability, or Syria, which has supported Hizbullah. With the difficulties of the United States in Iraq, the lesson has backfired. But the limited number of forces may add to the perception that the United States is bogged down in Iraq and unable to respond adequately to other contingencies.<br />

North Korea’s totalitarian regime systematically murders millions of its own people and will continue to do so − failure to respond to this amounts to complicity in the face of democide − this is a side constraint − unification through war is the only solution, and it’s worth it<br />
<br />
Rummel 4 − Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of Hawaii (Rudolph, “The Democial Famine in North Korea,” February 12, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2220:http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles4/RummelKorea.php --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles4/RummelKorea.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles4/RummelKorea.php</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2220 -->) Crowe<br />
<br />
One of the most ignored cases of ongoing democide is the Kim Chong-il's regime created famine in North Korea. Perhaps as many as 3,000,000 North Koreas already have died of starvation or associated diseases, not to mention those that have been summarily executed. While it is true that this famine was not intentional in the sense that Kim said &quot;Let there be famine--I want to starve to death as many people as I can,&quot; or, &quot;I will use famine to enforce communism on the people,&quot; as was true for Stalin's intentional famine of the Ukraine in 1932, it is intentional in another sense. If parents cause the death of their children through a reckless and depraved indifference to their lives, such as punishing them through starvation, even were their deaths not intended, they could be tried in a court of law for murder. And the North Korean famine is intentional in that sense--the very communist totalitarian policies that created the famine continue despite their mortal consequences for the North Korean People, and with what must be Kim's clear knowledge of this.<br />
And here there can be no doubt that it is the fanatical devotion to communism itself that is responsible. Consider the world's most devastating famines. They all occurred under communist regimes. That in China under Mao in the early 1960s may have starved to death as many as 40,000,000 people, although a more conservative estimate puts the toll at 27,000,000. Even this estimate would make the famine the worlds deadliest, ever. This was due to Mao's Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s and especially his forcible collectivization of all peasants into factory like communes. Then there was the famine in the early twenties in the new Soviet Union under Lenin during which he tried to impose communist agricultural policies on the peasant, seize land from &quot;rich&quot; estates, and forcible requisition grain and produce. This caused huge peasant rebellions all over the country, and a Bread War between peasants and the communist regime in which hundreds of thousands were killed. The resulting famine alone may have killed about 5,000,000 people, and another 5,000,000 million may have been saved by foreign food aid, particularly from the United States. Then there was the aforementioned Stalin made famine in the early 1930s in Ukraine in which some 5,000,000 Ukrainians were killed, and another 2,000,000 died in the caucuses and elsewhere.<br />
Now, there is North Korea in which even as I write this people are dying by the thousands everyday due to the regime. These are human beings; these are men, woman, and children, old and young, all with individual personalities, individual skills, and human potential; all by virtue of their humanity, having a right to not only life, but also freedom. Yet, they die because of the ideological fanaticism of the small gang of thugs who hold power over them with their guns.<br />
Consider what these people face just in their human need for food and health, leaving aside their enslavement:<br />
North Korea's population requires about six million tons of food for each person to have a minimum diet. The regime controls all farming, all agriculture, and can only produce about four million tons. This causes a food shortfall of two million tons, or 33 percent below what is minimally required. <br />
Kim has imposed rationing, and his handouts are the only way to legally obtain food. There are no independent channels of distribution, except for the black market. This means that people get food as Kim and his thugs desire. <br />
Thus, Kim's food distribution system is highly unequal. Food is put aside first for &quot;patriotic rice&quot; and &quot;military rice.&quot; This has resulted in Kim cutting the consumption of 700g of food a day per person by 22 percent, or to 400g a day, well below the minimum consumption of rice set by the World Food and Agricultural Organization.<br />
This is not all. In this &quot;classless&quot; communist society, the regime has divided North Koreans into a rigid hierarchy of three classes, and fifty-one subdivisions, depending on a person's status within the communist North Korean Workers Party and the military, their perceived faithfulness to communism, and family backgrounds. In other words, Kim uses the very food people need to live as a tool to reward and punish his subject slaves. Thus, vast numbers of people whose loyalties are questioned or may be deemed useless to the regime do not receive enough food to live long. The worst off are those people and families incarcerated in Kim's concentration or forced labor camps. They receive the lowest food allowance of all, in spite of their being forced to work from 5 am to 8 pm.<br />
There are no hospitals, doctors, or medical distribution and supply companies independent of the regime. All are nationalized. As with food, therefore, medical treatment and medicine is distributed as reward and punishment. Not surprisingly, medicine is in short supply and not available everywhere. Thus, the diseases associated with famine and malnutrition often gets no medical treatment at all. Even a cold under such conditions can be mortal. An indicator of this situation is that only half of the population is now inoculation for such diseases as infantile paralysis and measles.<br />
Attempts on the part of the South Korea, the United Nations, and the United States, the major giver, to provide food aid has not worked well. In 2002 food aid was 62 percent under its target, but even if the target was reached, it would not substantial improve on the food available to the average Korean, even were it equally distributed. But it is not. The regime will not guarantee that food reaches those who need it most, it does not allow aid givers to carefully monitor who gets the food, and in some cases, it has redirected the food to its favorite classes or to the military.<br />
Aside from the daily accumulation of dead, the effects on the living have been disastrous. Long-term malnutrition has effected about half the living, and caused excessive underdevelopment in children--they have stunted in growth and excessively thin. There is wide-scale dwarfishness and, most important from any humanitarian point of view, their brain development has been retarded. Moreover, malnutrition has fostered rickets, scurvy, nyctalopia, hepatitis, and tuberculosis, among other diseases. North Korea is one of the few countries in which population mortality rates have been increasing. The life expectancy has fallen to 66.8 years from 73.2; newborn mortality rate has increased from 14 to 22.5; and the rate for those under five years of age has increased from 27 to 48 per thousand.<br />
And so on.<br />
And all this without even recounting the regime's terror, repression, executions, and absolute violations of what those living in liberal democracies take for granted, such as the freedom of religion and speech, of opportunity and association, fair trials, rule of law, sanctity of the person, and freedom from fear. <br />
What is to be done? There is a vast complicity in Kim's despicable treatment of his people and their continuing starvation. Oh, aid is being given, as mentioned, although hardly enough. But this has to be given each year forever as long as the regime survives. The complicity lies in the political failure to recognize the cost of appeasing this regime in human lives, health, security, and welfare. And appeasement it is. <br />
The North Korean communist regime should be forced to reform itself as least as much as has Chinese Communist Party over China, and better, to begin to democratize as has South Korea. Ultimately, democratic unification between North and South Korea is the goal. And forced not by sanctions, which not only rarely work, and punish the people rather than a regime, but by the threat of force, and if ultimately need be, by force itself. Diplomacy does not work. It did not on Hitler, it did not on Stalin, and it did not on Mao, just to mention a long line of failures of diplomacy to alter the domestic terror of totalitarian regimes. For one, Kim and his henchmen should be recognized as a megamurdering gang. They should be made pariahs among nations. Absolute diplomatic chill. Second, there are many ways of using force overtly and covertly that can be employed, such as attempt at destabilization of the regime, assassinations (yes, I'm in favor of assassinating these thugs who are responsible for murdering millions); and at the extreme, the threat of military action. To those who may have gasped, taken a step back, and covered their mouths with their hands, consider the human toll: There is the day-by-day, year-by-year, decade-by-decade lose of human lives and extreme suffering of 22 million people, versus the one time cost of military action, if it comes to that. How many would die is such action against North Korea, and the war that might result? Take a very high number--a million. Since there can be no doubt that the North Korean regime would lose, this cost would be once and only once, and much less than the three million estimated to have already died at the hands of the regime just by famine, and the millions more to come. But, surely, it would not come to that. The United States, among others, now has the military power to make fast work of the North's defensive and offensive capabilities. That has been shown in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br />
I know, I know, I am saying that war is good in this case, and willing to suffer the death of so many human lives. I started my career as a pacifist about war, but my studies of democide and other horrors that people suffer under such regimes as Kim's, have changed my views. My morality is the same, but I come to recognize the moral stupidity of not arming the police, refusal to attack terrorist because some hostages may die, or refusal to defend freedom when it is under attack because of the deaths inevitable in war. To those who say that war is wrong I can only ask, &quot;What is right about the deaths, murders, miserable slavery, and total loss of human rights that 22 million people are suffering under Kim? What is wrong about risking the lives of, at the extreme, a million people, to save the lives and promote human rights and security for 22 million? Can there be a greater case for a just war, if it comes to that? Does not the sheer human cost of letting Kim to continue to enslave North Koreas as he does far exceed the cost of war?<br />

War with China is not inevitable − their rise will be peaceful<br />
Bijian 5 − Chair of the China Reform Forum (Zheng, “China's &quot;Peaceful Rise&quot; to Great-Power Status,” Sep/Oct, Lexis) Crowe<br />
For the next few decades, the Chinese nation will be preoccupied with securing a more comfortable and decent life for its people. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, held in 1978, the Chinese leadership has concentrated on economic development. Through its achievements so far, China has blazed a new strategic path that suits its national conditions while conforming to the tides of history. This path toward modernization can be called &quot;the development path to a peaceful rise.&quot; Some emerging powers in modern history have plundered other countries' resources through invasion, colonization, expansion, or even large-scale wars of aggression. China's emergence thus far has been driven by capital, technology, and resources acquired through peaceful means.<br />
The most significant strategic choice the Chinese have made was to embrace economic globalization rather than detach themselves from it. In the late 1970s, when the new technological revolution and a new wave of economic globalization were unfolding with great momentum, Beijing grasped the trend and reversed the erroneous practices of the Cultural Revolution. On the basis of the judgment that China's development would depend on its place in an open world, Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders decided to seize the historic opportunity and shift the focus of their work to economic development. They carried out reforms meant to open up and foster domestic markets and tap into international ones. They implemented the household contracting system in rural areas and opened up 14 coastal cities, thus ushering in a period of economic takeoff.<br />
In the 1990s, China once again confronted a strategic choice, due to the Asian financial crisis and the subsequent struggle between the forces for and against globalization. China's decision to participate in economic globalization was facing a serious challenge. But by carefully weighing the advantages and disadvantages of economic openness and drawing lessons from recent history, Beijing decided to open up China even more, by joining the World Trade Organization and deepening economic reform at home.<br />
China has based its modernization process mainly on its domestic resources. It has relied on ideological and institutional innovations and on industrial restructuring. By exploring the growing domestic market and transferring the huge personal savings of its citizens into investment, China has infused its economy with new momentum. Its citizens' capacities are being upgraded and its technological progress expedited. Even while attempting to learn from and absorb useful products from other societies, including those of the advanced capitalist countries, China has maintained its independence and self-reliance.<br />
In pursuing the goal of rising in peace, the Chinese leadership has strived for improving China's relations with all the nations of the world. Despite the ups and downs in U.S.-Chinese relations over the years, as well as other dramatic changes in international politics, such as the collapse of the Soviet Union, Beijing has stuck to the belief that there are more opportunities than challenges for China in today's international environment.<br />
According to China's strategic plans, it will take another 45 years -- until 2050 -- before it can be called a modernized, medium-level developed country. China will face three big challenges before it gets there. As described above, China's shortage of resources poses the first problem. The second is environmental: pollution, waste, and a low rate of recycling together present a major obstacle to sustainable development. The third is a lack of coordination between economic and social development.<br />
This last challenge is reflected in a series of tensions Beijing must confront: between high GDP growth and social progress, between upgrading technology and increasing job opportunities, between keeping development momentum in the coastal areas and speeding up development in the interior, between fostering urbanization and nurturing agricultural areas, between narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and maintaining economic vitality and efficiency, between attracting more foreign investment and enhancing the competitiveness of indigenous enterprises, between deepening reform and preserving social stability, between opening domestic markets and solidifying independence, between promoting market-oriented competition and taking care of disadvantaged people. To cope with these dilemmas successfully, a number of well-coordinated policies are needed to foster development that is both faster and more balanced.<br />
The policies the Chinese government has been carrying out, and will continue to carry out, in the face of these three great challenges can be summarized as three grand strategies -- or &quot;three transcendences.&quot;<br />
The first strategy is to transcend the old model of industrialization and to advance a new one. The old industrialization was characterized by rivalry for resources in bloody wars and by high investment, high consumption of energy, and high pollution. Were China to follow this path, it would harm both others and itself. China is instead determined to forge a new path of industrialization based on technology, economic efficiency, low consumption of natural resources relative to the size of its population, low environmental pollution, and the optimal allocation of human resources. The Chinese government is trying to find new ways to reduce the percentage of the country's imported energy sources and to rely more on China's own. The objective is to build a &quot;society of thrift.&quot;<br />
The second strategy is to transcend the traditional ways for great powers to emerge, as well as the Cold War mentality that defined international relations along ideological lines. China will not follow the path of Germany leading up to World War I or those of <br />
Germany and Japan leading up to World War II, when these countries violently plundered resources and pursued hegemony. Neither will China follow the path of the great powers vying for global domination during the Cold War. Instead, China will transcend ideological differences to strive for peace, development, and cooperation with all countries of the world.<br />
The third strategy is to transcend outdated modes of social control and to construct a harmonious socialist society. The functions of the Chinese government have been gradually transformed, with self-governance supplementing state administration. China is strengthening its democratic institutions and the rule of law and trying to build a stable society based on a spiritual civilization. A great number of ideological and moral-education programs have been launched.<br />
Several dynamic forces are noticeable in the carrying out of the three strategies. For example, there are numerous clusters of vigorously developing cities in the coastal areas of eastern and southern China, and similar clusters are emerging in the central and western regions. They constitute the main engines of growth, are the major manufacturing and trading centers, and absorb surplus rural labor. They also have high productivity, advanced culture, and accumulated international experience that the rest of China can emulate and learn from. The expansion of China's middle-income strata and the growing need for international markets come mainly from these regions.<br />
China's surplus of rural workers, who have strong aspirations to escape poverty, is another force that is pushing Chinese society into industrial civilization. About ten million rural Chinese migrate to urban areas each year in an orderly and protected way. They both provide Chinese cities with new productivity and new markets and help end the backwardness of rural areas. Innovations in science and technology and culture are also driving China toward modernization and prosperity in the twenty-first century.<br />
The Chinese government has set up targets for development for the next 50 years. This period is divided into three stages. In the first stage -- 2000 to 2010 -- total GDP is to be doubled. In the second stage, ending in 2020, total GDP is to be doubled again, at which point China's per capita GDP is expected to reach $3,000. In the third, from 2020 to 2050, China will continue to advance until it becomes a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist country. By that time, China will have shaken off underdevelopment and will be on a par with the middle rung of advanced nations. It can then claim to have succeeded in achieving a &quot;peaceful rise.&quot;<br />
China's peaceful rise will further open its economy so that its population can serve as a growing market for the rest of the world, thus providing increased opportunities for -- rather than posing a threat to -- the international community. A few figures illustrate China's current contribution to global trade: in 2004, China's imports from members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations increased by 33.1 percent, from Japan by 27.3 percent, from India by 80 percent, from the European Union by 28 percent, and from the United States by 31.9 percent.<br />
China is not the only power that seeks a peaceful rise. China's economic integration into East Asia has contributed to the shaping of an East Asian community that may rise in peace as a whole. And it would not be in China's interest to exclude the United States from the process. In fact, Beijing wants Washington to play a positive role in the region's security as well as economic affairs. The beginning of the twenty-first century is seeing a number of countries rising through different means, while following different models, and at different paces. At the same time, the developed countries are further developing themselves. This is a trend to be welcomed.<br />
China does not seek hegemony or predominance in world affairs. It advocates a new international political and economic order, one that can be achieved through incremental reforms and the democratization of international relations. China's development depends on world peace -- a peace that its development will in turn reinforce.<br />

Japan rearm is a prerequisite to Asian stability<br />
White 8 − Visiting Fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy and Professor of Strategic Studies at the Australian National University (Hugh, “Why Japan might have to go nuclear,” July 16, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2224:http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2008/07/Why-Japan-might-have-to-go-nuclear.aspx --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2008/07/Why-Japan-might-have-to-go-nuclear.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2008/07/Why-Japan-might-have-to-go-nuclear.aspx</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2224 -->)<br />
I should have known Sam would not let me get away with the rather provocative comment in my post last week about Japan and nuclear weapons without a more detailed explanation. So here it is. The idea I touched on is that the establishment of a stable new order in Asia that accommodates China’s growing power may require Japan to become more strategically independent of the US, and that this may require Japan to develop its own nuclear capability. In other words, I am exploring the idea that we may find that a nuclear-armed Japan is the price we have to pay for a stable new order in Asia.       <br />
To see why this might be so, we have to look at Japan’s situation.  For decades, Japan has accepted its place as America’s strategic client. That has paid big dividends for Japan and for the rest of us, but it has also entailed some costs and risks for Japan. Those risks have been acceptable as long as Japan has been confident that the US would put Japan ahead of any potential adversary if it came to a crunch. But it has meant that Japan has always been anxious that a shift in US priorities could raise the risks that, if forced to choose, the US would not back Japan against an adversary. Hence Japan’s nervousness whenever US-China relations have seemed likely to eclipse US-Japan relations.<br />
China’s rise sharpens these concerns. Japan has good reason to fear that as China’s influence in Asia grows, it will use that influence to marginalise and eventually try to dominate Japan. As long as Japan depends on the US for its security, its only defence against China’s growing power is to rely on, and encourage, the US to contest and contain China’s growing influence. Behind the diplomacy, that is what we have been seeing in recent years. The problem for all of us, including Japan, is that a peaceful future in Asia is going to depend on the US and China getting on well. That will mean, among other things, as China’s power grows the US will have to accord China a greater place in Asia’s power structure – in other words, it will have to treat China as an equal.<br />
So Japan faces a really tough dilemma. As long as it relies on the US for its security, Japan will understandably feel threatened if the US accords more weight to China. But if the US does not do this, US-China relations will deteriorate, which would likewise be a disaster for Japan, as well as for the rest of us. The only way out seems to be for Japan to cease to rely on the US for its security, and to become itself an equal partner in a concert of great powers in Asia. Only in such a structure can Japan feel comfortable with a closer US-China relationship in which the US concedes strategic space to China’s growing power. And only if that happens can we look forward to a peaceful future in Asia.<br />
<br />
The impact is global nuclear war<br />
Landay 2k − Knight Ridder Washington Bureau (Jonathan, “Top administration officials warn stakes for U.S. are high in Asian conflicts,” March 10, Lexis)<br />
Few if any experts think China and Taiwan, North Korea and South Korea, or India and Pakistan are spoiling to fight. But even a minor miscalculation by any of them could destabilize Asia, jolt the global economy and even start a nuclear war. India, Pakistan and China all have nuclear weapons, and North Korea may have a few, too. Asia lacks the kinds of organizations, negotiations and diplomatic relationships that helped keep an uneasy peace for five decades in Cold War Europe.<br />
&quot;Nowhere else on Earth are the stakes as high and relationships so fragile,&quot; said Bates Gill, director of northeast Asian policy studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. &quot;We see the convergence of great power interest overlaid with lingering confrontations with no institutionalized security mechanism in place. There are elements for potential disaster.&quot;<br />
In an effort to cool the region's tempers, President Clinton, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger all will hopscotch Asia's capitals this month.<br />
For America, the stakes could hardly be higher.<br />
There are 100,000 U.S. troops in Asia committed to defending Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, and the United States would instantly become embroiled if Beijing moved against Taiwan or North Korea attacked South Korea. While Washington has no defense commitments to either India or Pakistan, a conflict between the two could end the global taboo against using nuclear weapons and demolish the already shaky international nonproliferation regime. <br />
2AC Japan Rearm Good − South China Sea<br />
<br />
Japan rearm key to deterring Chinese aggression in the South China Sea<br />
Lam 95 − Former general in the Republic of South Vietnam (Thi, “Why a Remilitarized Japan is Crucial for Asia-Pacific Stability,” October 27, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2225:http://www.pacificnews.org/jinn/stories/columns/pacific-pulse/951027-japan.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pacificnews.org/jinn/stories/columns/pacific-pulse/951027-japan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pacificnews.org/jinn/stories/columns/pacific-pulse/951027-japan.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2225 -->)<br />
Public outrage over the rape of an Okinawa school girl by a United States serviceman may finally push the Japanese towards remilitarization, ending 50 years of &quot;splendid isolation&quot; under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Despite nascent Asian fears of renewed Japanese expansionism, Japan's remilitarization would greatly enhance the security prospects of the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
For decades Japan, like Germany, has basked in the generosity of its American conqueror, rising from the ashes of World War II to become an economic superpower. But whereas Germany finally broke free of the victor-vanquished complex, actively helping to contain the former Soviet Union as a NATO member, and ultimately integrating itself into the European Union, Japan clung to its post-war insular mentality. Recently, it has remained conspicuously silent in the face of Chinese aggression in the South China Sea through which pass some of the world's most vital shipping lanes. Even when the 1992 Gulf War threatened its Mideast oil supplies, Japan refused to send ground troops to aid the U.S.-led coalition, despite repeated requests from Washington. Instead, it sent money.<br />
But money alone cannot buy security in the Asia Pacific, particularly in an era of U.S. disengagement and new Chinese assertiveness. A growing chorus of domestic critics -- notably New Frontier Party chief and long-time Diet member Ichiro Ozawa -- have warned that Japan risks following the path of ancient Carthage, whose &quot;belief that wealth alone could sustain a nation ultimately caused its demise.&quot;<br />
There are signs that more and more Japanese are heeding the warning. Well before the Okinawa outrage, Japanese voters rejected anti-rearmament left-wing party candidates in elections for parliamentary seats in the Diet. Their loss paved the way for new legislation authorizing deployment of Japan's Self Defense Forces on non-combat UN missions. (Two years earlier, Japan sent engineer army units to Cambodia to help rebuild the country's road network under UN supervision.)<br />
Meanwhile, Japan and the United States have been working on an agreement to standardize military equipment similar to those of NATO allies. Even more significant, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the man many consider destined to become the country's next prime minister, actively favors revising the restrictive U.S. imposed constitution so that Japan can play a more active role in regional security.<br />
If there is any single factor goading Japan to finally assume its global responsibilities it is China's growing military power. Only a remilitarized Japan can offer a strategic counter-weight to help stabilize the economically booming region. But the new rearmament of Japan is not intended as a show of hostility towards Beijing. Rather, the aim is to bring about a cooperation between the two East Asian giants. The model is the cooperation between France and Germany that became the foundation for a peaceful and prosperous European community.<br />
<br />
That escalates to World War 3<br />
Waldron 97 – professor of strategy and policy at the U.S. Naval War College and an associate of the Fairbank Center for East Asian Research at Harvard (Arthur, “How Not to Deal with China,” March, EBSCO)<br />
MAKING THESE flash-points all the more volatile has been a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of China's weapons acquisitions. An Asian arms race of sorts was already gathering steam in the post-cold-war era, driven by national rivalries and the understandable desire of newly rich nation-states to upgrade their capacities; but the Chinese build-up has intensified it. In part a payoff to the military for its role at Tiananmen Square in 1989, China's current build-up is part and parcel of the regime's major shift since that time away from domestic liberalization and international openness toward repression and irredentism. <br />
Today China buys weapons from European states and Israel, but most importantly from Russia. The latest multibillion-dollar deal includes two Sovremenny-class destroyers equipped with the much-feared SS-N-22 cruise missile, capable of defeating the Aegis anti-missile defenses of the U.S. Navy and thus sinking American aircraft carriers. This is in addition to the Su-27 fighter aircraft, quiet Kilo-class submarines, and other force-projection and deterrent technologies. In turn, the Asian states are buying or developing their own advanced aircraft, missiles, and submarines--and considering nuclear options. <br />
The sort of unintended escalation which started two world wars could arise from any of the conflicts around China's periphery. It nearly did so in March 1996, when China, in a blatant act of intimidation, fired ballistic missiles in the Taiwan Straits. It could arise from a Chinese-Vietnamese confrontation, particularly if the Vietnamese should score some unexpected military successes against the Chinese, as they did in 1979, and if the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which they are now a member, should tip in the direction of Hanoi. It could flare up from the smoldering insurgencies among Tibetans, Muslims, or Mongolians living inside China. Chains of alliance or interest, perhaps not clearly understood until the moment of crisis itself, could easily draw in neighboring states--Russia, or India, or Japan--or the United States. <br />

Japan rearm key to its relations with China<br />

Japanese rearmament should not be considered a threat against China. The same people who work for an increased Japanese military option are also those who have been keeping close contacts with the Chinese military on the solution of the North Korean issue and admit that in recent months the Chinese have been very friendly. The Chinese may understand Japan's need to take a more active role in its own security. This understanding could serve as a catalyst for China and Japan to foster trust and forge stronger ties - and ultimately achieve greater regional stability.<br />

The idea of a major new war, seen as unthinkable in Europe, is far from outlandish in Asia. Academics now compare the growing Sino-Japanese competition for natural resources and economic dominance to the contest between Germany and Britain at the start of the war-blighted 20th century.<br />
North Korea test-fired ballistic missiles over Japanese territory in 1998. Three years later, the Japanese coastguard chased and sank a North Korean spy ship. Last year Japanese ships and planes tracked a Chinese submarine snooping in territorial waters.<br />
As China devotes much of its new wealth to modernising its armed forces, the likeliest flashpoint is Taiwan, a former Japanese colony. China has made no secret of its readiness to resort to force to stop the island from seceding formally, and the US is committed to defending Taiwan. It is unlikely that Japan could escape involvement. Indeed, one scenario is that China could emulate Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor with a pre-emptive strike on US forces in Okinawa.<br />

Japan rearm solves its economy<br />

Tokyo is extremely concerned about the North Korean threat, but Washington decided that Baghdad came before Pyongyang. This signaled that US priorities might be different from Japanese priorities, therefore Japan can't entrust all of its security to the United States. It must be able to take things into its own hands when necessary. This is an argument for Japanese rearmament, which could also have an economic value, as military expenditures could help ease the present Japanese economic doldrums. Besides, Tokyo has noticed that among the younger generation in South Korea, the North is not perceived as a threat, but rather as the object of pity and concern. Consequently a North Korean nuclear program is not a threat against the South but possibly a source of Korean pride on either side of the 38th parallel, notwithstanding the Japanese concern.<br />
<br />
Japanese economic collapse causes Chinese economic collapse<br />
Auslin 9 − American Enterprise Institute (Michael, “Japan’s Downturn is Bad for the World,” February 17)<br />
If Japan's economy collapses, supply chains across the globe will be affected and numerous economies will face severe disruptions, most notably China's. China is currently Japan's largest import provider, and the Japanese slowdown is creating tremendous pressure on Chinese factories. Just last week, the Chinese government announced that 20 million rural migrants had lost their jobs. Closer to home, Japan may also start running out of surplus cash, which it has used to purchase U.S. securities for years. For the first time in a generation, Tokyo is running trade deficits -- five months in a row so far. The political and social fallout from a Japanese depression also would be devastating. In the face of economic instability, other Asian nations may feel forced to turn to more centralized -- even authoritarian -- control to try to limit the damage. Free-trade agreements may be rolled back and political freedom curtailed. Social stability in emerging, middle-class societies will be severely tested, and newly democratized states may find it impossible to maintain power. Progress toward a more open, integrated Asia is at risk, with the potential for increased political tension in the world's most heavily armed region.<br />

But imagine a China disintegrating -- on its own, without neo-con or CIA prompting, much less outright military invasion -- because the economy (against all predictions) suddenly collapses. That would knock Asia into chaos. Refugees by the gazillions would head for Indonesia and other poorly border-patrolled places, which don't want them and can't handle them; some in Japan might lick their chops for World War II Redux and look to annex a slice of China. That would send small but successful Singapore and Malaysia -- once Japanese colonies -- into absolute nervous breakdowns.

Of course the position I am exploring here remains counter-intuitive. There are very powerful and compelling arguments that a nuclear-armed Japan would be bad for regional stability. I understand and accept many of those arguments. But they need to be set against the depth and danger of the dilemma I have outlined above. Those who dismiss the idea of a Japanese nuclear capability out of hand need to explain either why the dilemma I have identified is illusory, or how it can be resolved in some other way. I would be delighted to hear a persuasive counter-argument. <br />
Perhaps the most important lesson to draw from all this is how fundamentally China’s rise changes the strategic order in Asia. We have lived for the past thirty-five years through the most peaceful and harmonious era in Asia’s long history. But the resulting economic growth has undermined the foundations of that order, and we will risk its collapse of we continue to assume that Asia can stay peaceful for the next thirty-five years on the same basis. The disconcerting proposition I am exploring here provides an indication of how differently we might have to think about Asia’s security in future. If big changes are needed, the sooner we start thinking about them the easier they will be to manage.<br />

Clearly, most of the concerns about proliferation that maximalists hold are inapplicable to Japan. Japan is not a rogue state, but a highly stable political system with a firm pattern of civil-military relations in which civilian primacy is unchallenged. On the technical side, Japan has both the technology and the resources to build an invulnerable, second strike deterrent force, thus contributing to crisis stability by muting a potential adversary's incentives to pre-empt in crisis. No one seriously doubts that Japan could develop command-and-control systems at least as sophisticated as our own to ensure against accidents, unauthorized use, or terrorism. And while the dangers of japanese proliferation are more modest than commonly supposed, the risks to the United States of maintaining its nuclear umbrella are greater.<br />

Of course an essential element of this argument is a judgement that Japan can be trusted with nuclear weapons. Some will argue that its conduct before 1945 permanently disqualifies it from being able to exercise independent strategic power on that scale. I do not agree. I think that after sixty years of highly responsible behaviour Japan deserves to be trusted again as a normal power. And I would ask, how attractive are the alternatives?<br />

Peter Hart gets at a key point. Some believe that political capital is finite, that it can be used up. To an extent that's true. But it's important to note, too, that political capital can be regenerated -- and, specifically, that when a President expends a great deal of capital on a measure that was difficult to enact and then succeeds, he can build up more capital. Indeed, that appears to be what is happening with Barack Obama, who went to the mat to pass the stimulus package out of the gate, got it passed despite near-unanimous opposition of the Republicans on Capitol Hill, and is being rewarded by the American public as a result.<br />

6. Make a major effort, in coordination with China, to ease tensions between North Korea and South Korea. One step that would help - and reduce the U.S. budget deficit and debt - would be to withdraw the 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea, a remnant of the Korean War that ended in 1953. Both Koreas need to know that if they go to war with each other, neither the United States nor China will intervene.<br />

&quot;The widely held sentiment among Tea Party Patriot members is that every item in the budget, including military spending and foreign aid, must be on the table,&quot; said Mark Meckler, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots. &quot;It is time to get serious about preserving the country for our posterity. The mentality that certain programs are 'off the table' must be taken off the table.&quot;<br />
Former House Majority Leader Dick Armey and Matt Kibbe, leaders of the group FreedomWorks, which has backed the tea partiers, recently wrote in a Wall Street Journal editorial that &quot;defense spending should not be exempt from scrutiny.&quot; On Gates' proposed savings of $145 billion over five years, they said, &quot;That's a start.&quot; <br />
Just about all Republicans - and plenty of Democrats, too - favor paring back spending. But when it comes to specific cuts - eliminating money for schools, parks, hospitals, highways and everything else - the decisions get difficult. Every government expenditure has its advocates and no one wants his or her program cut.<br />

What is of more interest to me, however, is what her selection reveals about the basis of presidential power.  Political scientists, like baseball writers evaluating hitters, have devised numerous means of measuring a president’s influence in Congress.  I will devote a separate post to discussing these, but in brief, they often center on the creation of legislative “box scores” designed to measure how many times a president’s preferred piece of legislation, or nominee to the executive branch or the courts, is approved by Congress.  That is, how many pieces of legislation that the president supports actually pass Congress? How often do members of Congress vote with the president’s preferences?  How often is a president’s policy position supported by roll call outcomes?  These measures, however, are a misleading gauge of presidential power – they are a better indicator of congressional power.  This is because how members of Congress vote on a nominee or legislative item is rarely influenced by anything a president does.  Although journalists (and political scientists) often focus on the legislative “endgame” to gauge presidential influence – will the President swing enough votes to get his preferred legislation enacted? – this mistakes an outcome with actual evidence of presidential influence.  Once we control for other factors – a member of Congress’ ideological and partisan leanings, the political leanings of her constituency, whether she’s up for reelection or not – we can usually predict how she will vote without needing to know much of anything about what the president wants.  (I am ignoring the importance of a president’s veto power for the moment.)<br />

While the administration indicated the offer derives from the perception that South Koreans are increasingly angry with Washington for failing to promote detente with the North and, in the words of one official, &quot;we don't go where we're not wanted&quot;, others noted the move was designed to &quot;raise the stakes&quot; for incoming President Roh Moo-hyun, whose softer line toward Pyongyang has irritated some in the administration.<br />

And Washington no longer can afford to play at empire, subsidizing rich allies and remaking failed states.  Military spending must be cut. Substantially.<br />
Real, inflation-adjusted outlays on “defense” nearly doubled over the last decade. President Barack Obama has continued to increase military expenditures. Even if Congress adopts Defense Secretary William Gates’ proposed five-year “cut” of $78 billion, military spending will increase. Secretary Gates only wants to slow the rise.<br />

But John McCreay, a former Defense Intelligence Agency who writes the blog NightWatch, says the North Koreans are not preparing for war:<br />
A review of diplomacy, international relations and leadership activities confirms that North Korea is not preparing for war. Its volleyball team just advanced to the quarterfinals at the Asian Games in Beijing. Senior officials are receiving foreign diplomats as usual. Kim Jong il and his son were reported on 23 November visiting a plant together and Kim visited two others without his son. The number and detail of the activities show that the North does not expect the shelling incident to escalate. There also are no reports of increased civilian or military alerts in North Korea, which would be mandatory precautions if the North expected or intended an escalation.<br />

Since then the world has changed. The Republic of Korea has rushed past its northern antagonist economically. With the thirteenth-largest economy in the world, the ROK now has about forty times the GDP of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. South Korea also has twice the DPRK’s population, as well as a vast technological edge.<br />
Moreover, Seoul has detached North Korea’s traditional allies. The Soviet Union went AWOL under Mikhail Gorbachev. Although Vladimir Putin’s Moscow has somewhat repaired its relationship with Pyongyang, Russia still has a far more important economic relationship with the ROK. So does China, which trades fifty times as much with the South as with the North.<br />
Only in military strength does the DPRK retain a numerical edge over Seoul. North Korea has 1.1 million men under arms, an impressive number, but individual conscripts tend to be malnourished and of uncertain quality. Their weapons are antiquated. A prime fighting force the North Korean military is not. The South only has about seven hundred thousand men under arms, but they are better trained and deploy better weapons.<br />

What is truly shocking is the ROK's continuing dependence on America.<br />
The Korean War ended in 1953. Since then the South has won the intra-Korea contest. The ROK raced past the North economically and now has upwards of 40 times the latter's GDP. South Korea has succeeded in hi-tech production, benefits from twice the population, and possesses global diplomatic clout. In fact, Seoul even has stolen away North Korea's allies, trading far more with China and Russia. In contrast to 1950, the latter two countries would not likely back Pyongyang in a fight.<br />
Yet the DPRK possesses a bigger military. Although the North's soldiers are ill-trained and its equipment is antiquated, the Kim government obviously still is capable of striking with deadly effect. Why hasn't the South put its resources to better military effect? Because it doesn't have to.<br />

U.S. strategic flexibility on the Korean peninsula has been hampered by two things: the presence of some 30,000 U.S. military personnel in South Korea, a remnant of the Korean War some 60 years ago; and the deep concern of our ally, South Korea, that a firm response to the North’s provocations would result in heavy damage and loss of life in Seoul.  Our troops in South Korea were once needed to hold back North Korea, likely history’s most militarized society since the Spartans. Today, however, the North simply doesn’t have the economic muscle to field a modern, capable army.  If it ever came to blows, the Republic of Korea’s (ROK) army would crush the North’s in days – but Seoul, a prosperous city of 10 million within artillery range of the North, would lie in ruins.  Further, U.S. casualties could end up exceeding that of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan combined within a week.  In short, confronting North Korea would be a bloody, ugly mess.<br />

Casualties kill heg<br />
Eichenburg 5 − Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at Tufts University (Richard, “Victory has Many Friends,” International Security 30.1, pages 140-177, MUSE)<br />
The second reason to reevaluate the sensitivity of the public to casualties is that decisionmakers in other countries have apparently come to believe that the American public will not tolerate the loss of life in foreign military interventions, a fact that obviously affects their calculations of U.S. credibility. Three studies of the failure (or potential failure) of deterrence or coercive diplomacy are strikingly similar on this point. Janet Gross Stein argues that the inability to deter Saddam Hussein from invading Kuwait in 1990 can be traced in part to Hussein's &quot;estimate that the United States, given its aversion to high numbers of casualties, might not retaliate for the invasion of Kuwait with large-scale military force.&quot;30 Barry Posen notes that in the Kosovo war, the Serbian strategy of threatening to inflict pain on more powerful adversaries in fact worked: the United States and NATO essentially declared that they would not accept the costs of a ground attack, and in the event they could not coerce Serbia into signing the Rambouillet agreement with the threat of air strikes alone.31 The result was a near disaster. Finally, Thomas Christensen argues that one important factor that may impel the People's Republic of China to challenge U.S. power in the Far East (perhaps over Taiwan) is the belief among the Chinese elite that the United States would not accept the casualties that might occur in such a conflict. Christensen reached this conclusion based on interviews conducted before the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001; but given the erosion of public support as casualties have mounted in Iraq, one wonders if views in Beijing have changed.32 [End Page 152]<br />

Reps don’t matter − focusing on them is zero sum with real world action<br />

There can be little doubt that matters of linguistic appropriateness and precision are of serious and legitimate concern. By the same token, however, it must be conceded that such preoccupations arrive at a point of diminishing return. After that, they degenerate rapidly into liabilities rather than benefits to comprehension. By now, it should be evident that much of what is mentioned in this article falls under the latter category; it is, by and large, inept, esoteric, and semantically silly, bearing no more relevance in the real world than the question of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. Ultimately, it is a means to stultify and divide people rather than stimulate and unite them.   Nonetheless, such “issues” of word choice have come to dominate dialogue in a significant and apparently growing segment of the Left. Speakers, writers, and organizers of all persuasions are drawn, with increasing vociferousness and persistence, into heated confrontations, not about what they’ve said, but about how they’ve said it. Decisions on whether to enter into alliances, or even to work with other parties, seem more and more contingent not upon the prospect of a common agenda, but upon mutual adherence to certain elements of a prescribed vernacular. Mounting quantities of progressive time, energy, and attention are squandered in perversions of Mao’s principle of criticism/self-criticism – now variously called “process,” “line sharpening,” or even “struggle” – in which there occurs a virtually endless stream of talk about how to talk about “the issues.” All of this happens at the direct expense of actually understanding the issues themselves, much less doing something about them.  It is impossible to escape the conclusion that the dynamic at hand adds up to a pronounced avoidance syndrome, a masturbatory ritual through which an opposition nearly paralyzed by its own deeply felt sense of impotence pretends to be engaged in something “meaningful.” In the end, it reduces to a tragic delusion at best, cynical game playing or intentional disruption at worst. With this said, it is only fair to observe that it’s high time to get off this nonsense, and on with the real work of effecting positive social change.<br />

Discourse doesn’t shape reality - translation proves it’s the other way around<br />
Fram-Cohen 85 − freelance translator and interpreter between Hebrew and English that has published articles on literature, translation theory, and philosophy (Michelle, “Reality, Language, Translation: What Makes Translation Possible”)<br />
The idea that language is created inside one's mind independently of outside experience eliminates the possibility that the external world is the common source of all languages. But a common source of all languages underlies any attempt to explain the possibility of translation. Chomsky suggests that the common basis of all languages is universal phonetics and semantics, with the result that &quot;certain objects of human thoughts and mentality are essentially invariable across languages.&quot; (13) To the best of my knowledge Chomsky did not develop this idea in the direction of explaining the possibility of translation. In contrast, linguist Eugene Nida insists that outside experience is the common basis of all languages when he writes that &quot;each language is different from all other languages in the ways in which the sets of verbal symbol classify the various elements of experience.&quot; (14)  Nida did not provide the philosophical basis of the view that the external world is the common source of all languages. Such a basis can be found in the philosophy of Objectivism, originated by Ayn Rand. Objectivism, as its name implies, upholds the objectivity of reality. This means that reality is independent of consciousness, consciousness being the means of perceiving reality, not of creating it. Rand defines language as &quot;a code of visual-auditory symbols that denote concepts.&quot; (15) These symbols are the written or spoken words of any language. Concepts are defined as the &quot;mental integration of two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurements omitted.&quot; (16) This means that concepts are abstractions of units perceived in reality. Since words denote concepts, words are the symbols of such abstractions; words are the means of representing concepts in a language. Since reality provides the data from which we abstract and form concepts, reality is the source of all words--and of all languages. The very existence of translation demonstrates this fact. If there was no objective reality, there could be no similar concepts expressed in different verbal symbols. There could be no similarity between the content of different languages, and so, no translation.  Translation is the transfer of conceptual knowledge from one language into another. It is the transfer of one set of symbols denoting concepts into another set of symbols denoting the same concepts. This process is possible because concepts have specific referents in reality. Even if a certain word and the concept it designates exist in one language but not in another, the referent this word and concept stand for nevertheless exists in reality, and can be referred to in translation by a descriptive phrase or neologism. Language is a means describing reality, and as such can and should expand to include newly discovered or innovated objects in reality. The revival of the ancient Hebrew language in the late 19th Century demonstrated the dependence of language on outward reality. Those who wanted to use Hebrew had to innovate an enormous number of words in order to describe the new objects that did not confront the ancient Hebrew speakers. On the other hand, those objects that existed 2000 years ago could be referred to by the same words. Ancient Hebrew could not by itself provide a sufficient image of modern reality for modern users.<br />

Thayer 4 − Fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, taught at Dartmouth College and the University of Minnesota (Darwin and International Relations: On the Evolutionary Origins of War and Ethnic Conflict, pages 75-76)<br />
The central issue here is what causes states to behave as offensive realists predict. Mearsheimer advances a powerful argument that anarchy is the fundamental cause of such behavior. The fact that there is no world government compels the leaders of states to take steps to ensure their security, such as striving to have a powerful military, aggressing when forced to do so, and forging and maintaining alliances. This is what neorealists call a self-help system: leaders of states are forced to take these steps because nothing else can guarantee their security in the anarchic world of international relations. I argue that evolutionary theory also offers a fundamental cause for offensive realist behavior. Evolutionary theory explains why individuals are motivated to act as offensive realism expects, whether an individual is a captain of industry or a conquistador. My argument is that anarchy is even more important than most scholars of international relations recognize. The human environment of evolutionary adaptation was anarchic; our ancestors lived in a state of nature in which resources were poor and dangers from other humans and the environment were great—so great that it is truly remarkable that a mammal standing three feet high—without claws or strong teeth, not particularly strong or swift—survived and evolved to become what we consider human. Humans endured because natural selection gave them the right behaviors to last in those conditions. This environment produced the behaviors examined here: egoism, domination, and the in-group/out-group distinction. These specific traits are sufficient to explain why leaders will behave, in the proper circumstances, as offensive realists expect them to behave. That is, even if they must hurt other humans or risk injury to themselves, they will strive to maximize their power, defined as either control over others (for example, through wealth or leadership) or control over ecological circumstances (such as meeting their own and their family's or tribes need for food, shelter, or other resources).<br />

Perm − Do both − solves the K − realism is the best strategy<br />
Murray 97 − Professor of Politics at the University of Wales (Alastair, Reconstructing Realism: Between Power Politics and Cosmopolitan Ethics, pages 193-196)<br />
For realism, man remains, in the final analysis, limited by himself.  As such, it emphasizes caution, and focuses not merely upon the achievement of long-term objectives, but also upon the resolution of more immediate difficulties. Given that, in the absence of a resolution of such difficulties, longer-term objectives are liable to be unachievable, realism would seem to offer a more effective strategy of transition than reflectivism itself.  Whereas, in constructivism, such strategies are divorced from the current realities of international politics altogether, realism’s emphasis on first addressing the immediate obstacles to development ensures that in at least generates strategies which offer us a tangible path to follow. If these strategies perhaps lack the visionary appeal of reflectivist proposals, emphasizing simply the necessity of a restrained, moderate diplomacy in order to ameliorate conflicts between states, to foster a degree of mutual understanding in international relations, and, ultimately, to develop a sense of community which might underlie a more comprehensive international society, they at least seek to take advantage of the possibilities of reform in the current international system without jeopardizing the possibilities of order.  Realism’s gradualist reformism, the careful tending of what it regards as an essentially organic process, ultimately suggests the basis for a more sustainable strategy for reform than reflectivist perspectives, however dramatic, can offer.  For the realist, then, if rationalist theories prove so conservative as to make their adoption problematic, critical theories prove so progressive as to make their adoption unattractive.  If the former can justifiably be criticized for seeking to make a far from ideal order work more efficiently, thus perpetuating its existence and legitimating its errors, reflectivist theory can equally be criticized for searching for a tomorrow which may never exist, thereby endangering the possibility of establishing any form of stable order in the here and now.  Realism’s distinctive contribution thus lies in its attempt to drive a path between the two, a path which, in the process, suggests the basis on which some form of synthesis between rationalism and reflectivism might be achieved.  Oriented in its genesis towards addressing the shortcomings in an idealist transformatory project, it is centrally motivated by concern to reconcile vision with practicality, to relate utopia and reality. Unifying technical and a practical stance, it combines aspects of the positivist methodology employed by problem-solving theory with the interpretative stance adopted by critical theory, avoiding the monism of perspective which leads to the self-destructive conflict between the two. Ultimately, it can simultaneously acknowledge the possibility of change in the structure of the international system and the need to probe the limits of the possible, and yet also question the proximity of any international transformation, emphasize the persistence of problems after such a transformation, and serve as a reminder of the need to grasp whatever semblance of order can be obtained in the mean time.. Indeed, it is possible to say that realism is uniquely suited to serve as such an orientation. Simultaneously to critique contemporary resolutions of the problem of political authority as unsatisfactory and yet to support them as an attainable measure of order in an unstable world involves one in a contradiction which is difficult to accept. Yet, because it grasps the essential ambiguity of the political, and adopts imperfectionism as its dominant motif, realism can relate these two tasks in a way which allows neither to predominate, achieving, if not a reconciliation, that at least a viable synthesis. Perhaps the most famous realist refrain is that all politics are power politics. It is the all that is important here. Realism lays claim to a relevance across systems, and because it relies on a conception of human nature, rather than a historically specific structure of world politics, it can make good on this claim. If its observations about human nature are even remotely accurate, the problems that it addresses will transcend contingent formulations of the problem of political order.  Even in a genuine cosmopolis, conflict might become technical, but it would not be eliminated altogether.67 The primary manifestations of power might become more economic or institutional rather than (para)military but, where disagreements occur and power exists, the employment of the one to ensure the satisfactory resolution of the other is inevitable short of a wholesale transformation of human behaviour. Power is ultimately of the essence of politics; it is not something which can be banished, only tamed and restrained. As a result, realism achieves a universal relevance to the problem of political action which allows it to relate the reformist zeal of critical theory, without which advance would be impossible, with the problem-solver’s sensible caution that, before reform is attempted, whatever measure of security is possible under contemporary conditions must first be ensured.<br />

No impact<br />
O’Kane 97 − Professor of Comparative Political Theory, U Keele (Rosemary, “Modernity the Holocaust, and Politics,” Economy and Society 26:1, pages 58-9)<br />
Modern bureaucracy is not 'intrinsically capable of genocidal action' (Bauman 1989: 106). Centralized state coercion has no natural move to terror. In the explanation of modern genocides it is chosen policies which play the greatest part, whether in effecting bureaucratic secrecy, organizing forced labour, implementing a system of terror, harnessing science and technology or introducing extermination policies, as means and as ends. As Nazi Germany and Stalin's USSR have shown, furthermore, those chosen policies of genocidal government turned away from and not towards modernity. The choosing of policies, however, is not independent of circumstances. An analysis of the history of each case plays an important part in explaining where and how genocidal governments come to power and analysis of political institutions and structures also helps towards an understanding of the factors which act as obstacles to modern genocide. But it is not just political factors which stand in the way of another Holocaust in modern society. Modern societies have not only pluralist democratic political systems but also economic pluralism where workers are free to change jobs and bargain wages and where independent firms, each with their own independent bureaucracies, exist in competition with state-controlled enterprises. In modern societies this economic pluralism both promotes and is served by the open scientific method. By ignoring competition and the capacity for people to move between organizations whether economic, political, scientific or social, Bauman overlooks crucial but also very 'ordinary and common' attributes of truly modern societies. It is these very ordinary and common attributes of modernity which stand in the way of modern genocides.<br />

Turn − Nuclear war reps are key to survival<br />
Lenz 90 − Assistant Professor of Science and Policy at SUNY (Millicent, Nuclear Age Literature for Youth, pages 9-10)<br />
A summary of Frank’s thought in “Psychological Determinants of the Nuclear Arms Race” notes how all people have difficulty grasping the magnitude and immediacy of the threat of nuclear arms and this psychological unreality is a basic obstacle to eliminating that threat. Only events that people have actually experienced can have true emotional impact. Since Americans have escaped the devastation of nuclear weapons on their own soil and “nuclear weapons poised for annihilation in distant countries cannot be seen, heard, smelled, tasted, or touched,” we find it easy to imagine ourselves immune to the threat. Albert Camus had the same phenomenon in mind when he wrote in his essay Neither Victims nor Executioners of the inability of most people really to imagine other people’s death (he might have added “or their own”). Commenting on Camus, David P. Barash and Judith Eve Lipton observed that this distancing from death’s reality is yet another aspect of our insulation from life’s most basic realities. “We make love by telephone, we work not on matter but on machines, and we kill and are killed by proxy. We gain in cleanliness, but lose in understanding.” If we are to heed Camus’s call to refuse to be either the victims of violence like the Jews of the Holocaust, or the perpetrators of it like the Nazi executioners of the death camps, we must revivify the imagination of what violence really entails. It is here, of course, that the literature of nuclear holocaust can play a significant role. Without either firsthand experience or vivid imagining, it is natural, as Frank points out, to deny the existence of death machines and their consequences. In psychiatric usage denial means to exclude from awareness, because “letting [the instruments of destruction] enter consciousness would create too strong a level of anxiety or other painful emotions.” In most life-threatening situations, an organism’s adaptation increases chances of survival, but ironically, adapting ourselves to nuclear fear is counterproductive. We only seal our doom more certainly. The repressed fear, moreover, takes a psychic toll.<br />

No solvency − Security can’t be deconstructed<br />
Weaver 2k (Ole, International relations theory and the politics of European integration, pages 284-285)<br />
The other main possibility is to stress' responsibility. Particularly in a field like security one has to make choices a nd deal with the challenges and risks that one confronts – and not shy away into long-range or principled trans-formations. The meta political line risks (despite the theoretical commit¬ment to the concrete other) implying that politics can be contained within large 'systemic questions. In line with he classical revolutionary tradition, after the change (now no longer the revolution but the meta-physical trans-formation), there will be no more problems whereas in our situation (until the change) we should not deal with the 'small questions' of politics, only with the large one (cf. Rorty 1996). However, the ethical demand in post-structuralism (e.g. Derrida's 'justice') is of a kind that can never be instan¬tiated in any concrete political order – It is an experience of the undecidable that exceeds any concrete solution and reinserts politics. Therefore, politics can never be reduced to meta-questions there is no way to erase the small, particular, banal conflicts and controversies.  In contrast to the quasi-institutionalist formula of radical democracy which one finds in the 'opening' oriented version of deconstruction, we could with Derrida stress the singularity of the event. To take a position, take part, and 'produce events' (Derrida 1994: 89) means to get involved in specific struggles. Politics takes place 'in the singular event of engage¬ment' (Derrida 1996: 83). Derrida's politics is focused on the calls that demand response/responsi¬bility contained in words like justice, Europe and emancipation. Should we treat security in this manner? No, security is not that kind of call. 'Security' is not a way to open (or keep open) an ethical horizon. Security is a much more situational concept oriented to the handling of specifics. It belongs to the sphere of how to handle challenges – and avoid 'the worst' (Derrida 1991). Here enters again the possible pessimism which for the security analyst might be occupational or structural. The infinitude of responsibility (Derrida 1996: 86) or the tragic nature of politics (Morgenthau 1946, Chapter 7) means that one can never feel reassured that by some 'good deed', 'I have assumed my responsibilities ' (Derrida 1996: 86). If I conduct myself particularly well with regard to someone, I know that it is to the detriment of an other; of one nation to the detriment of my friends to the detriment of other friends or non-friends, etc. This is the infinitude that inscribes itself within responsibility; otherwise there would he no ethical problems or decisions. (ibid.; and parallel argumentation in Morgenthau 1946; Chapters 6 and 7) Because of this there will remain conflicts and risks - and the question of how to handle them. Should developments be securitized (and if so, in what terms)? Often, our reply will be to aim for de-securitization and then politics meet meta-politics; but occasionally the underlying pessimism regarding the prospects for orderliness and compatibility among human aspirations will point to scenarios sufficiently worrisome that responsibility will entail securitization in order to block the worst. As a security/securitization analyst, this means accepting the task of trying to manage and avoid spirals and accelerating security concerns, to try to assist in shaping the continent in a way that creates the least insecurity and violence - even if this occasionally means invoking/producing `structures' or even using the dubious instrument of securitization. In the case of the current European configuration, the above analysis suggests the use of securitization at the level of European scenarios with the aim of pre¬empting and avoiding numerous instances of local securitization that could lead to security dilemmas and escalations, violence and mutual vilification.<br />

CMR high now − Obama and Afghanistan<br />

This article by Jonathan Alter in Newsweek on how Obama tamed his generals is great and worth reading -- although not necessarily for the reasons the author intended. I'm going to offer up my bottom line conclusion up front and then use the article as a starting point to consider some other issues. BLUF: President Obama has brought civil-military relations back into line in a way that would have made Samuel Huntington proud. There are problems with this, as I will note later on in this post, but overall, this is a really good thing. Alter: Deputy national-security adviser Tom Donilon had commissioned research that backed up an astonishing historical truth: neither the Vietnam War nor the Iraq War featured any key meetings where all the issues and assumptions were discussed by policymakers. In both cases the United States was sucked into war inch by inch. I have spent a little time recently with Paul Pillar, a man whose intellect and record of service I really respect. Paul has made a point similar to Tom Donilon's regarding the Iraq war -- that there never really was a coherent governmental decision-making process. Obama's decision-making process on Afghanistan, by contrast, is to be applauded for the way in which it differed from the &quot;decision-making process&quot; (if you can even call it that) of 2002 and 2003. Why? First, do what Dick Betts does when writing about Huntington's so-called &quot;normal theory&quot; for civil-military relations and draw a big triangle on a sheet of paper. Now draw three horizontal lines on the triangle, dividing it into four levels -- political, strategic, operational and tactical. In the normal model, civilians have responsibility for the top section. They decide the policy aims. Then civilians and the military decide on strategic goals and resources. (Betts adds a fifth layer, actually, for ROE.) The military has responsibility for everything else under Huntington's model. If you look at the decision-making process in 2009 on the war in Afghanistan, things more or less proceeded according to the normal theory. The president commissioned a review of policy and strategic goals in the winter of 2009, which resulted in this white paper. Gen. McChrystal then thought about how to operationalize the president's policy and strategic goals and submitted his own assessment along with a request for more resources. That assessment, combined with a corrupt Afghan presidential election, caused the administration to re-think its assumptions and prompted another strategic review. This was, on balance, a good thing that made me feel good about the president. The president then re-affirmed his policy aims, articulated new strategic goals, and committed more resources to the war in Afghanistan. (I write more about this process here.) The good news in all of this is that whether or not you agree with the decisions made by the president and his team in 2009, the national security decision-making process more or less worked, and the civilians were in charge every step of the way. This is as both Sam Huntington and the U.S. Constitution intended.<br />

Reducing foreign military presence leads to massive backlash, destroying civil-military relations<br />

Yet imagine the outcry any one of these proposals would provoke, and the resistance it would generate from the services, agencies, and congressional committees whose ox was being gored. The delegation or defense company about to lose a base or a weapons contract would certainly howl—and mobilize. Organizational change in any bureaucracy provokes enormous and almost always successful resistance. In the Pentagon, the battles have been epic. The world has a say in all this, too. The next administration will take office nearly twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Yet the American military establishment is essentially the same one created in the 1940s and 1950s to deter the Soviet Union. The United States today boasts four independent armed services with the same weapons, upgraded and more capable to be sure, as those known to George Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower, Chester Nimitz, and Curtis LeMay. Not only are the ships, planes, tanks, vehicles, and guns similar, but they are organized similarly, performing virtually the same roles and missions assigned them in the late 1940s. The United States after 1989 did not demobilize. It “downsized.” Successive administrations cut the budget by ten percent and the size of the force by about 25 percent, while the Pentagon substituted regional threats for the Soviet menace in its planning. Even in the midst of a “Global War on Terrorism,” neither the generals nor their bosses in the White House and Congress have been able to rethink the purpose, organization, command and control, or even operation of the armed forces. Two decades is a long time. The decades between 1895 and 1915, 1935 and 1955, and 1975 and 1995 all involved paradigm shifts in America’s role in the world and in its national security requirements. Today’s security situation differs no less radically from the Cold War for which today’s military establishment was devised. Are these the armed forces we really need? Bitter fights over strategy, budgets, weapons, and roles and missions dating back sixty-plus years suggest the question may not be answerable in any practical sense. To understand fully just how difficult it will be to raise fundamental concerns about defense policies, consider the recent confusion over what exactly the role and purpose of the National Guard and reserves ought to be. A week before 9/11, I participated in a roundtable discussion of the subject for the Reserve Forces Policy Board. There was general agreement that reserve forces should concentrate more on homeland defense and less on backstopping active duty forces on the battlefield. Yet the former head of the National Guard Bureau insisted, without evidence and in the face of great skepticism, that the Guard and reserves could do both. The past five years have proved him wrong; reserve forces are underequipped and stretched thinner than the active duty army and Marine Corps. Today, a congressionally chartered commission on the National Guard and reserves still struggles with how to shape and organize the reserves (particularly the National Guard, which reports to each state governor unless summoned for federal service). Admittedly, the National Guard and reserves possess unusual political power and since 1789 have been more resistant to rational military policy than any other part of the national security community. Robert McNamara, who transformed American defense more than any other Pentagon leader, failed utterly to budge the Guard and reserve. None of his successors possessed the nerve even to try. But the problem cannot be avoided. As the commission wrote in bureaucratic understatement, in March 2007, “the current posture and utilization of the National Guard and Reserve as an ‘operational reserve’ is not sustainable over time, and if not corrected with significant changes to law and policy, the reserve component’s ability to serve our nation will diminish.” All the more so because Iraq and Afghanistan compose the first substantial, extended military conflicts the United States has fought with a volunteer force in more than a century. Today’s typical combat tour of fifteen months is the longest since World War II. Expensive procurement programs are underway, but sooner or later they will be robbed to pay for other costs, such as war operations, the expansion of ground forces, or medical and veterans costs. Already, the Project on Defense Alternatives has proposed cutting two Air Force wings, two Navy wings, and two aircraft carriers for a total savings of more than $60 billion over the next five years. Eventually, the bill comes due, either in blood, defeat, or political crisis. As the old Fram oil filter advertisement put it, “Pay me now, or pay me later.”<br />

CMR key to prevent Pakistan collapse<br />

The security rationale for stability and development in poor and fragile states is based on the understanding that strengthening the economy of states and ensuring social equity are in the short and long term interests of the United States. Stable states pose the United States with far fewer security challenges than their weak and fragile counterparts. Indeed, stable states with healthy economies offer the United States opportunities for trade and represent potential partners in the fields of security and development. In contrast, weak and failing states pose serious challenges to the security of United States, including terrorism, drug production, money laundering and people smuggling. In addition, state weakness has frequently proven to have the propensity to spread to neighboring states, which in time can destabilize entire regions. While the group acknowledged that the cases of Iraq and Afghanistan are particular in scope and complexity (and may not be repeated in the near future by the U.S.), participants broadly concurred that the lessons of these challenges are that the United States must improve and expand its stabilization and development capabilities. In particular, cases such as Pakistan and Nigeria, huge countries with strategic importance, make clear that a military response to many internal conflicts will be severely limited. As such, increased emphasis on civilian capacity within the U.S. government and civil-military relations in general, will greatly improve the United States’ ability to respond to such crises in the future. <br />

Pakistan instability draws in India and leads to global nuclear war<br />
Ricks 1 [Thomas E., Pulizter Prize winner, member of Harvard’s Senior Advisory Council on the Project on US Civil-Military Relations.  Worries Over War’s Costs, Consequences Some Fear Regional Destabilization, Retribution Against US.  The Washington Post.  October 21, 2001]<br />
The prospect of Pakistan being taken over by Islamic extremists is especially worrisome because it possesses nuclear weapons. The betting among military strategists is that India, another nuclear power, would not stand idly by, if it appeared that the Pakistani nuclear arsenal were about to fall into the hands of extremists. A preemptive action by India to destroy Pakistan's nuclear stockpile could provoke a new war on the subcontinent. The U.S. military has conducted more than 25 war games involving a confrontation between a nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, and each has resulted in nuclear war, said retired Air Force Col. Sam Gardiner, an expert on strategic games. Having both the United States and India fighting Muslims would play into the hands of bin Laden, warned Mackubin Owens, a strategist at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I. &quot;He could point out once again that this is the new crusade,&quot; Owens said. The next step that worries experts is the regional effect of turmoil in Pakistan. If its government fell, the experts fear, other Muslim governments friendly to the United States, such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, might follow suit. &quot;The ultimate nightmare is a pan-Islamic regime that possesses both oil and nuclear weapons,&quot; said Harlan Ullman, a defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Ullman argued that the arrival of U.S. troops in Pakistan to fight the anti-terrorism war in Afghanistan could inadvertently help bin Laden achieve his goal of sparking an anti-American revolt in the country. Andrew Bacevich, a professor of international relations at Boston University, said it is possible &quot;that we are sliding toward a summer-of-1914 sequence of events&quot; -- when a cascading series of international incidents spun out of control and led to World War I. Eliot Cohen, a professor of strategy at Johns Hopkins University, agreed. &quot;We could find ourselves engaged in a whole range of conflicts, from events you can't anticipate now,&quot; he said. <br />

The foreign policy of the United States in South Asia should move from the lackadaisical and distant (with India crowned with a unilateral veto power) to aggressive involvement at the vortex. The most dangerous place on the planet is Kashmir, a disputed territory convulsed and illegally occupied for more than 53 years and sandwiched between nuclear-capable India and Pakistan. It has ignited two wars between the estranged South Asian rivals in 1948 and 1965, and a third could trigger nuclear volleys and a nuclear winter threatening the entire globe. The United States would enjoy no sanctuary. This apocalyptic vision is no idiosyncratic view. The Director of Central Intelligence, the Department of Defense, and world experts generally place Kashmir at the peak of their nuclear worries. Both India and Pakistan are racing like thoroughbreds to bolster their nuclear arsenals and advanced delivery vehicles. Their defense budgets are climbing despite widespread misery amongst their populations. Neither country has initialed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or indicated an inclination to ratify an impending Fissile Material/Cut-off Convention.<br />

Now let me turn to the real issue under debate today to the Defense provisions that will cause the precipitous withdrawal of our forces from Iraq and take from the President, his Constitutional powers of Commander-in-Chief. There is a very good reason why our Founding Fathers gave the Executive Branch the responsibility to conduct war. The House of Representatives is made up of 435 individuals -- lawyers, doctors, teachers, farmers -- some with military experience, some without. It is not, however, made up of 435 military commanders who possess the ability to manage a war. We have military professionals to do that.<br />

The plan causes Republicans to sabotage Obama’s agenda<br />
The Times 11 (“No Time for Gridlock; The world needs President Obama's leadership to face challenges abroad. His first challenge at home is to rebuild his country's belief in itself,” January 4, Lexis) Crowe<br />
Mr Obama would be wise to heed Republican warnings that by starting to pull out of Afghanistan he may be inviting the Taleban to bide its time for a comeback. If he satisfies Senator John McCain and others that the US is doing everything it can to train the Afghan police and army, he can call on the Republican establishment for help on the home front. He will certainly need it.<br />

The plan causes Republicans to undermine Obama’s agenda<br />

There were discussions about the review of the US strategy. In fact, the defeat suffered by the Democrats in mid-term elections forced Obama to seek Republican cooperation for the implementation of his policies. He had no choice but to take into account views of his opposition party especially on the war in Afghanistan where the two powerful parties differ significantly. The Republicans said that they will not cooperate with Obama unless the timetable for the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan is withdrawn. They described setting timetables as dangerous and against US interests. Democrats, however, emphasized troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in July 2011. The result of the most recent review was finally announced on Thursday. Following are the key points that have emerged during the review:<br />
- The strategy has been effective and it has succeeded in weakening the Taleban and Al-Qa'idah.<br />
- The July 2011 withdrawal deadline is not final and any decision in this respect will depend on conditions on the ground.<br />
- In addition to military operations inside Afghanistan, there is a need to destroy Al-Qa'idah sanctuaries in tribal areas of Pakistan.<br />
- Pakistan should do more in the war against terrorism.<br />
These issues show that Obama has retreated in favour of the Republicans and has withdrawn the July 2011 deadline with the aim of attracting Republican support.<br />

The problem then becomes sustaining support for such a strategy from the American public and Congress. A policymaker who expressed unqualified support for Pakistan and then later withdrew the support would be excoriated by his or her political opponents. Yet the only alternative seems to be pouring endless money into Pakistan with little influence over how it is spent. <br />
Clearly the United States and its allies would have a difficult time sustaining the current counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan without transit through Pakistan. So if America felt that it had no other option than to end support for Pakistan, it would have to revamp the counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. But, I believe, it would still be possible to prevent an outright Taliban victory with a much smaller U.S. footprint in Afghanistan.<br />

Obama has rejected the plan − you jack his cred<br />
Pletka 11 − vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at AEI (Danielle, “Where Is Obama's Public Support for Afghanistan?” January 28, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2304:http://www.aei.org/article/103072 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/article/103072" rel="nofollow">http://www.aei.org/article/103072</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2304 -->) Crowe<br />
Since taking office, Obama has remained true to his 2008 campaign pledge that his &quot;first order as commander in chief will be to end the war in Iraq and refocus our efforts on Afghanistan.&quot; After a lengthy review in 2009, the president ordered a surge of 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. He set a deadline of July 31, 2011, to begin drawing down the troops-distressing Afghans, Pakistanis, allies worldwide and many in the United States-but even that deadline fell by the wayside at last year's NATO summit in Lisbon.<br />
To be fair, the president has reportedly rejected recommendations by the vice president, his national security adviser and countless others to surge fewer troops, move to a counterterrorism strategy or make a negotiated peace with the Taliban-all wrong moves.<br />

Perception of Obama’s power is vital to stop miscalc and war − Afghanistan is the key issue<br />

Yet presidential weakness — even an inkling of weakness — can have international as well as domestic implications. This is notably the case in matters related to national security. If the occupant of the Oval Office appears less than fully in command, friend and foe alike will wonder who exactly is in charge.<br />
Confusion about American priorities and intentions can thereby result. Out of confusion can come miscalculation, as allies revise downward their estimate of American reliability and adversaries persuade themselves that they can get away with mischief. In other words, the implications of weakness extend beyond the who’s up, who’s down preoccupations of garden-variety politics. This confusion describes where we find ourselves today. There is no doubting that President Obama is smart, talented, well intentioned, and smooth as they come. Yet whether he possesses the temperament to govern is fast becoming an open question. Put simply, the question is this: Does Obama have sufficient backbone?<br />
The release of Bob Woodward's new book Obama’s Wars has raised this question to new heights. It depicts a president who not only gets rolled but who knows when he is getting rolled and still allows it to happen. With regard to how to proceed on Afghanistan — the most important foreign policy decision to cross Obama’s desk thus far — the president last year demanded that the Pentagon present him with distinctive policy options. The king didn’t want to be handed the solution; he wanted to choose.<br />

It turns heg<br />
Bolton 9 − former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. (John, “Dangerous Dithering,” October 18, Lexis)<br />
Weakness in American foreign policy in one region often invites challenges elsewhere, because our adversaries carefully follow diminished American resolve. Similarly, presidential indecisiveness, whether because of uncertainty or internal political struggles, signals that the United States may not respond to international challenges in clear and coherent ways.<br />
Taken together, weakness and indecisiveness have proved historically to be a toxic combination for America's global interests. That is exactly the combination we now see under President Obama.<br />
If anything, his receiving the Nobel Peace Prize only underlines the problem. All of Obama's campaign and inaugural talk about &quot;extending an open hand&quot; and &quot;engagement,&quot; especially the multilateral variety, isn't exactly unfolding according to plan. Entirely predictably, we see more clearly every day that diplomacy is not a policy but only a technique. Absent presidential leadership, which at a minimum means clear policy direction and persistence in the face of criticism and adversity, engagement simply embodies weakness and indecision.<br />
<br />
Obama’s power is key to sustainable peace worldwide<br />
Zakaria 8 − Editor of Newsweek International (Fareed, “Wanted: A New Grand Strategy,” December 8, Lexis)<br />
President-elect Obama has powers of his own, too. I will not exaggerate the importance of a single personality, but Obama has become a global symbol like none I can recall in my lifetime. Were he to go to Tehran, for example, he would probably draw a crowd of millions, far larger than any mullah could dream of. Were his administration to demonstrate in its day-to-day conduct a genuine understanding of other countries' perspectives and an empathy for the aspirations of people around the world, it could change America's reputation in lasting ways.<br />
This is a rare moment in history. A more responsive America, better attuned to the rest of the world, could help create a new set of ideas and institutions--an architecture of peace for the 21st century that would bring stability, prosperity and dignity to the lives of billions of people. Ten years from now, the world will have moved on; the rising powers will have become unwilling to accept an agenda conceived in Washington or London or Brussels. But at this time and for this man, there is a unique opportunity to use American power to reshape the world. This is his moment. He should seize it.<br />

The plan removes U.S. presence along the Durand Line − the impact is terrorism and Indo-Pak nuclear war<br />

This strategy, like any good counter-insurgency strategy, is not partible. Separating direct strikes against terrorist and insurgent leaders from efforts to reduce popular support and tolerance for their presence will lead to failure. A balanced approach to these challenges, as we are pursuing, is by far the most likely to succeed.<br />
The U.S. presence in Afghanistan is driven also by our struggle with al-Qaeda senior leadership and the future of Pakistan. International forces stationed along the Durand Line are about 30 miles from many of the most dangerous centers of Islamist terrorism in Pakistan. From those positions, we can understand what is happening in Pakistan and, occasionally, take action. We should never underestimate the importance of this positional advantage. It cannot be replaced by technology, discussion with Islamabad or anything else. From the Afghan border we have a unique vantage point on the groups that most directly threaten the American homeland and the stability of the entire nuclear-armed subcontinent.<br />
The ultimate goal of American strategy in the region must be ensuring that Afghanistan is sufficiently stable and friendly so that we can make the best use of that vantage point. The president's strategy gives us the best chance of doing that.<br />

What would be the consequences of a nuclear attack by terrorists? Even if it fails, it would further exacerbate the negative features of the new and frightening world in which we are now living. Societies would close in on themselves, police measures would be stepped up at the expense of human rights, tensions between civilisations and religions would rise and ethnic conflicts would proliferate. It would also speed up the arms race and develop the awareness that a different type of world order is imperative if humankind is to survive.<br />
But the still more critical scenario is if the attack succeeds. This could lead to a third world war, from which no one will emerge victorious. Unlike a conventional war which ends when one side triumphs over another, this war will be without winners and losers. When nuclear pollution infects the whole planet, we will all be losers.<br />

We can expect similar results if Obama’s Afghan strategy fails and he opts to cut and run. Most forget that throwing South Vietnam to the wolves made the world a far more dangerous place.<br />
The Soviets saw it as an unmistakable sign that America was in decline. They abetted military incursions in Africa, the Middle East, southern Asia and Latin America. They went on a conventional- and nuclear-arms spending spree. They stockpiled enough smallpox and anthrax to kill the world several times over. State-sponsorship of terrorism came into fashion.<br />
Osama bin Laden called America a “paper tiger.” If we live down to that moniker in Afghanistan, odds are the world will get a lot less safe. Al-Qaida would be back in the game. Regional terrorists would go after both Pakistan and India—potentially triggering a nuclear war between the two countries.<br />
Sensing a Washington in retreat, Iran and North Korea could shift their nuclear programs into overdrive, hoping to save their failing economies by selling their nuclear weapons and technologies to all comers. Their nervous neighbors would want nuclear arms of their own.<br />
The resulting nuclear arms race could be far more dangerous than the Cold War’s two-bloc standoff. With multiple, independent, nuclear powers cautiously eyeing one another, the world would look a lot more like Europe in 1914, when precarious shifting alliances snowballed into a very big, tragic war.<br />
The list goes on. There is no question that countries such as Russia, China and Venezuela would rethink their strategic calculus as well. That could produce all kinds of serious regional challenges for the United States.<br />
Our allies might rethink things as well. Australia has already hiked its defense spending because it can’t be sure the United States will remain a responsible security partner. NATO might well fall apart. Europe could be left with only a puny EU military force incapable of defending the interests of its nations.<br />

The impact is extinction<br />

EDITED FOR GENDERED LANGUAGE<br />
In 2004, the secretary-general of the UN created a panel to review future threats to international peace and security. It identified nuclear Armageddon as the prime threat, warning, &quot;We are approaching a point at which the erosion of the nonproliferation regime could become irreversible and result in a cascade of proliferation.&quot; Developments since 2004 have only magnified the risks of an irreversible cascade. The current global nuclear order is extremely fragile, and the three most urgent challenges to it are North Korea, Iran, and Pakistan. If North Korea and Iran become established nuclear weapons states over the next several years, the nonproliferation regime will have been hollowed out. If Pakistan were to lose control of even one nuclear weapon that was ultimately used by terrorists, that would change the world. It would transform life in cities, shrink what are now regarded as essential civil liberties, and alter conceptions of a viable nuclear order. Henry Kissinger has noted that the defining challenge for statesmen is to recognize &quot;a change in the international environment so likely to undermine a nation's security that it must be resisted no matter what form the threat takes or how ostensibly legitimate it appears.&quot; The collapse of the existing nuclear order would constitute just such a change -- and the consequences would make nuclear terrorism and nuclear war so imminent that prudent states[people] must do everything feasible to prevent it.<br />

Much is at stake in Eurasia for the U.S. and its allies. Attempts to restore its empire will doom Russia's transition to a democracy and free-market economy. The ongoing war in Chechnya alone has cost Russia $6 billion to date (equal to Russia's IMF and World Bank loans for 1995). Moreover, it has extracted a tremendous price from Russian society. The wars which would be required to restore the Russian empire would prove much more costly not just for Russia and the region, but for peace, world stability, and security.<br />
As the former Soviet arsenals are spread throughout the NIS, these conflicts may escalate to include the use of weapons of mass destruction. Scenarios including unauthorized missile launches are especially threatening. Moreover, if successful, a reconstituted Russian empire would become a major destabilizing influence both in Eurasia and throughout the world. It would endanger not only Russia's neighbors, but also the U.S. and its allies in Europe and the Middle East. And, of course, a neo-imperialist Russia could imperil the oil reserves of the Persian Gulf. 15<br />

NATO collapse causes superpower nuclear war<br />
O'Sullivan 98 − editor of the National Review and founder of the New Atlantic (John, American Spectator, June)<br />
Some of those ideas--notably, dissolution and &quot;standing pat&quot;--were never likely to be implemented. Quite apart from the sociological law that says organizations never go out of business even if their main aim has been achieved (the only exception being a slightly ominous one, the Committee for the Free World, which Midge Decter closed down after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact), NATO's essential aim has not been permanently achieved. True, the Soviet threat is gone; but a nuclear-armed and potentially unstable Russia is still in the game; a major conflict has just been fought in the very Balkans which sparked the First World War; and there are a number of potential wars and civil wars lurking in such regions as the Tyrol, the Basque country, Northern Ireland (not yet finally settled), Corsica, Belgium, Kosovo, and Eastern Europe and the Balkans generally where, it is said, &quot; every England has its Ireland, and every Ireland its Ulster.&quot; If none of these seems to threaten the European peace very urgently at present, that is in part because the existence of NATO makes any such threat futile and even counter-productive. No nation or would-be nation wants to take NATO on.  And if not NATO, what? There are international bodies which could mediate some of the lesser conflicts: the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe is explicitly given that responsibility, and the European Union is always itching to show it can play a Big Power role. But neither body has the military heft or the prestige to deter or repress serious strife. The OSCE is a collective security organization, and as Henry Kissinger said of a similar body: &quot;When all participants agree, there is no need for it; when they split, it is useless.&quot; And the EU only made itself look ridiculous when it attempted to halt the Bosnian conflict in its relatively early stages when a decisive intervention might have succeeded.  As for dealing with a revived Russian threat, there is no military alliance in sight other than NATO that could do the job. In a sense, NATO today is Europe's defense. Except for the American forces, Western armies can no longer play an independent military role. They are wedded to NATO structures and dependent on NATO, especially American, technology. (As a French general admitted in the Gulf War: &quot;The Americans are our eyes and ears.&quot;) If NATO were to dissolve--even if it were to be replaced by some European collective defense organization such as a beefed-up Western European Union--it would invite chaos as every irredentist faction sought to profit from the sudden absence of the main guarantor of European stability.<br />

Reaffirming commitment to COIN solves Karzai credibility and results in the plan<br />

Now he and his boss, the president, need to take the next step: they should negotiate a long-term agreement with President Karzai to cement a permanent American-Afghan alliance. That would help to further assure Karzai and other Afghan leaders that we will not abandon them, thus increasing their incentive to take the sort of hard steps we are asking for in the fight against corruption and other ills that plague Afghanistan.<br />
Interestingly, while Prime Minister Maliki in Iraq is deeply reluctant to enter into any kind of long-term agreement with the U.S. that would keep U.S. troops on his soil indefinitely, President Karzai is said to be much more open to such an arrangement. He knows, after all, that he doesn’t have oil riches to support his country; Afghanistan will be much more dependent on the U.S. than Iraq will be. Senator Lindsey Graham has suggested that the U.S. establish permanent air bases in Afghanistan. The administration should follow up on his suggestion and open negotiations with Karzai. If it does, it may well be discovered that nothing will speed the end of America’s combat mission in Afghanistan faster than expressing our willingness to say forever. That may sound paradoxical, but the more commitment we signal to enemies and waverers alike, the easier our troops will find it to drive out the Taliban.<br />

No right-thinking strategist would sign up for an open ended commitment to keep troops in Afghanistan—but timelines need to be set based on the situation on the ground, not the political calendar in Washington. You don’t get your allies to stand shoulder to shoulder with you by threatening to abandon them.<br />
If the President really wants to help Gen. Petraeus win the war, he can publicly state “forget the timeline, we will start to bring the troops home when conditions are right.” He could also pledge to give Gen. Petraeus whatever he needs to get the job done.<br />

Recruiting, equipping, and training the ANSF defeats the insurgency and results in the plan<br />

Thus the question naturally arises: How exactly is Washington supposed to extricate itself smoothly from the Afghan theater?<br />
The answer: By recruiting, equipping, training, and eventually molding the ANSF into an effective force capable of taking over full security responsibility throughout the country.<br />
In Vietnam this policy was known as “Vietnamization”. In Iraq the rebuilding of a post-Saddam Hussein security force has resulted in the recruitment and training of some 410,000 police and 245,000 military personnel, allowing the U.S. to proceed with its planned year-end withdrawal from that country.<br />
The American approach is founded on the tenet that indigenous forces can better earn the long-lasting trust and goodwill of the local population than American troops, resulting in the accumulation of on-the-ground human intelligence necessary to defeat insurgents in “wars amongst the people”. As these forces grow in size and capability, U.S. forces cede responsibility to them, eventually clearing the path to a smooth exit from the operating theater. <br />

More dialogue will not solve this problem. The Pakistanis know what we want them to do and why, and they are choosing not to do it despite long conversations and enormous amounts of financial aid. Only increased pressure on Pakistan's proxies in Afghanistan can fundamentally alter Islamabad's strategic calculus. Simply put, the United States and its allies must persuade the Taliban, Pakistan and Afghanistan that we will win. The president's renewed commitment to long-term engagement, including a long-term military presence in Afghanistan, is important. But it is more important to make good on his words to American soldiers in Afghanistan last month: &quot;We will prevail.&quot;<br />
We can continue to make progress in Afghanistan while the insurgents retain their Pakistani sanctuaries so as long as our comprehensive counterinsurgency efforts continue. Gen. James E. Cartwright noted Thursday that &quot;we have the advantage in Afghanistan of having boots on the ground&quot; so that we can &quot;defeat&quot; rather than &quot;disrupt&quot; our most dangerous enemies there-a sharp contrast to our situation in Pakistan. As our strategy evolves we must avoid becoming so focused on problems we cannot readily solve, such as Pakistan's policies, that we lose sight of the tools we can use in Afghanistan to change the overall situation to our advantage.<br />
The administration has been clear about its desire to avoid expanding our goals and mission in Afghanistan beyond what our vital national interests require. We must also avoid focusing too narrowly on conducting a smooth transition of security responsibilities from U.S. to Afghan forces. President Obama must make clear that our objective in Afghanistan is success and not just transition and withdrawal. &quot;Durable and sustainable&quot; success requires more than simply expanding the size and capabilities of the Afghan National Security Forces while reducing the enemy's capabilities. We must consider the stability and legitimacy of the political order in any province or district, too, when handing over security responsibilities to Afghans. Premature transitions risk our long-term goals.<br />

It is remarkable to us that in the past year the army grew by approx 50K soldiers and the police grew by nearly 20K. At the same time the ANSF is growing, the Afghan people value and respect their security forces. A November 2010 Asia Foundation poll found that 92 percent of Afghans agreed or strongly agreed that the army is honest and fair, while 84 percent thought the same about the police. The Afghan people's appreciation and respect for their security forces remains steady as we begin to achieve major milestones in our mission for a stable, independent Afghan Security Force.<br />
To be sure, there are significant challenges facing the ANSF. These include: illiteracy, attrition, and leader development. NTM-A is committed to assisting the ANSF overcome these challenges and instill a culture of stewardship. The attached papers offer an assessment of the change that has taken place in MOI and MOD over the past year. The highlights are:<br />
1. Interior Minister Mohammadi and Defense Minister Wardak have instituted significant leadership changes, reformed policy, and laid a solid foundation to assume responsibility for Afghanistan's security in 2014. Both ministers are committed to building a professional force that is ethnically-balanced.<br />
2. Change is supported by new laws such as the Inherent Law on Officers and NCOs to improve personnel policies and new regulations to improve retention, information sharing, and cooperation.<br />
3. Interior Minister Mohammadi is attempting to decentralize the Interior Ministry by empowering his deputies and ensuring local commanders have the authority and resources they need.<br />
4. Defense Minister Wardak is undertaking significant organizational change by creating the Ground Force Command and holding his commanders responsible for their unit's attrition, training, and operational effectiveness.<br />
5. Outside of individual ministry reform, there are several initiatives to improve cooperation between Interior and Defense. This includes MOD transferring small arms to MOI, formalizing joint training, and improving information sharing. The ministers increasingly recognize the importance of approaching common problems such as attrition, pay, and training as an ANSF problem.<br />
The international community has much to be proud of in Afghanistan, but as the NATO Summit in Lisbon made clear, progress requires commitment to training and equipping the ANSF through 2014 and sustaining an enduring partnership beyond 2014; and the Afghan people agree. In the same Asia Foundation poll that found high levels of Afghan public support for the ANSF, Afghans recognized there is much work to be done and international assistance is essential to training the force.<br />

Finel 10 − Senior Fellow and Director of Research at the American Security Project (Bernard, “A Substitute for Victory,” April 8, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2316:http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66189/bernard-finel/a-substitute-for-victory?page=show --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66189/bernard-finel/a-substitute-for-victory?page=show" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66189/bernard-finel/a-substitute-for-victory?page=show</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2316 -->) Crowe<br />
Although many COIN experts see enemy-centric campaigns as the second-best option, the truth is that such efforts are both more likely to succeed and to showcase the U.S. Army's strengths. Successful counterinsurgency campaigns are usually explicitly enemy-centric, focused on seeking out and destroying insurgent organizations. These campaigns can work in one of two ways. A counterinsurgent force can gradually steamroll an insurgency if it can also significantly restrict population movements. This is precisely how the Sri Lankan government recently wiped out the Tamil Tigers. These sorts of campaigns require a willingness to treat the population harshly, however. For both ethical and practical reasons, the United States is unwilling to pursue this course of action. Attempting to influence the decision-making calculus of insurgent leaders is more promising. By systematically attacking insurgents' strongholds, an army can erode insurgent combat power, overturn the narrative that the insurgency is winning, and ultimately compel the insurgents to compromise. Military force in this case becomes instrumental.<br />
This approach is appropriate for Afghanistan because the conflict there is much messier than a typical two-sided battle. The Afghan government itself is loosely cobbled together, and the insurgency is composed of three major groups and perhaps a dozen minor factions. But even more fundamentally, the insurgent-counterinsurgent divide is itself mapped onto hundreds of purely local and historical conflicts among villages, local elites, families, and tribes. In the final analysis, regardless of who &quot;wins,&quot; the resulting government will be composed of individuals and groups from both sides of the current divide. This is truly an Afghan civil war, and the goal of the United States should be to encourage reconciliation among Afghans while excluding foreigners, be they al Qaeda terrorists or government officials from India, Iran, Pakistan, or the United States.<br />
The Obama-mandated timeline -- combined with the inherent difficulties of promoting economic development and good governance in one of the poorest and most war-torn countries on the planet -- makes a U.S. &quot;victory&quot; along the lines envisaged by population-centric COIN advocates essentially impossible. On the other hand, a robust enemy-centric COIN campaign to eliminate insurgent strongholds and reduce their combat power would make an insurgent victory unlikely. Once both the insurgents and NATO forces acknowledge this reality, they will be left to haggle over the details of what comes next. From the U.S. perspective, the requirements are minimal: a commitment to banishing al Qaeda from the country and a willingness to accept minimal Saudi Arabian-style human rights standards.<br />
Using military force to encourage a negotiated solution is consistent with the vast majority of conflicts in history. The reality is that a substitute for victory exists. Indeed, in most wars, the outcome resides in the zone between outright victory and defeat. Such talk-and-fight conflicts can be frustrating. But when victory for either side is impossible -- or simply too costly to achieve -- the key impediment to peace is precisely the refusal of either or both sides to accept that the only possible peace is a compromised one.<br />
Fortunately, the United States holds the high cards in Afghanistan. To convince senior insurgent leaders to compromise, Washington will have to keep consistent pressure on insurgent strongholds. This may seem reminiscent of the search-and-destroy missions of the Vietnam era, but there is a fundamental difference: In search-and-destroy missions a counterinsurgent force hoping to hold territory deliberately tries to tempt the insurgents to attack. (It is akin to using a decoy in a high-crime area to draw out muggers.) The logic of an enemy-centric COIN campaign is not to hold territory but to demonstrate that the insurgents cannot hold territory either. <br />
There is now a clear path to ending the war in Afghanistan; the question is whether political leaders can take advantage of McChrystal's battlefield success. If Washington can turn the changing balance of power on the battlefield into a negotiating strategy that acknowledges the need to offer insurgent leaders more than just the opportunity to lay down their arms, the United States could succeed in Afghanistan in a way that neither proponents nor opponents of the Afghan surge imagined last fall. For the first time since the United States intervened in Afghanistan in 2001, it is possible to outline a coherent political-military plan that would yield, if not a clear-cut victory, at least an outcome that enhances U.S. security.<br />

Khalilzad 11 − counselor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (Zalmay, “Follow the Leader,” February 2, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2317:http://nationalinterest.org/letters/follow-the-leader-4817 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nationalinterest.org/letters/follow-the-leader-4817" rel="nofollow">http://nationalinterest.org/letters/follow-the-leader-4817</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2317 -->)<br />
Part of the problem with Mearsheimer’s argument is that he attacks a straw man. In early 1993, the Defense Department issued the Regional Defense Strategy, which outlined American strategy for the new international system. I was deeply involved in that effort. The document did not call for global dominance. It clearly prioritized U.S. interests and advanced a sustainable strategy for pursuing them. It argued that America should use its post-Cold War preeminence to preclude the rise of a multipolar or bipolar world. The way to achieve this objective, it maintained, was to prevent hostile states from dominating critical regions based on the logic that a single hostile power could pose a global challenge if it achieved regional hegemony. Spreading democracy was one component of this strategy. Every subsequent administration followed a variant of this outline of American global leadership. <br />
Mearsheimer criticizes previous administrations for failing to appreciate certain realities: military interventions, nation building, and counterinsurgencies are often costly; missions outside the realm of our vital national interests distract from paramount priorities; overextension is a distinct possibility without selectivity; unilateralism decreases burden sharing; and too much focus on foreign policy risks undermining the domestic foundations of our international stature. But the original 1993 strategy and subsequent iterations recognized these points as important. The charge that administrations did not give them sufficient weight in making certain decisions does not undermine the overall merits of the strategy. <br />
Mearsheimer ignores positive outcomes arising from American global leadership in Europe and Asia. Successive administrations since the Cold War have sought to preclude hostile regional hegemony and expand the zone of democracy. On both continents, the United States maintained a permanent military presence, upheld its security commitments, and supported the expansion of alliances—notably NATO and EU enlargement into Eastern Europe. These policies have helped avoid resurgences of nationalism, proliferation, and arms races among major powers. They have enabled democracy and free markets to expand in Europe and Asia. <br />

The plan kills heg<br />

Russia appears to be quietly reveling in the prospect that NATO, which appeared so threatening to Russian eyes during its multiple rounds of enlargement during the 1990s, could be defeated in its first real out-of-area operation. A NATO defeat in Afghanistan would call into question the future of the alliance and the credibility of American leadership with it, possibly creating a new and lasting transatlantic breach and intensifying concerns about the alliance's ability to protect weak European states against a resurgent Russia. China has no interest in Afghanistan's collapse into a sanctuary for Islamist extremists, including Uighers who militate against China's rule in Xinjiang. But a Western defeat in Afghanistan, which if historical precedent holds would be followed by a bout of U.S. isolationism, would only create more space for China to pursue its (for now) peaceful rise.<br />
And that is the point: the debate over whether to prevail in Afghanistan is about so much more. An American recommitment to a sustained counterinsurgency strategy that turned around the conflict would demonstrate that the United States and its democratic allies remain the principal providers of public goods -- in this case, the security and stability of a strategically vital region that threatens the global export of violent extremism -- in the international system. A new and sustained victory strategy for Afghanistan would show that Washington is singularly positioned to convene effective coalitions and deliver solutions to intractable international problems in ways that shore up the stability of an international economic and political order that has provided greater degrees of human freedom and prosperity than any other. <br />
By contrast, a U.S. decision to wash its hands of Afghanistan would send a different message to friends and competitors alike. It would hasten the emergence of a different kind of international order, one in which history no longer appeared to be on the side of the United States and its friends. Islamic extremism, rather than continuing to lose ground to the universal promise of democratic modernity, would gain new legs -- after all, Afghan Islamists would have defeated their second superpower in a generation. Rival states that contest Western leadership of the international order and reject the principles of open society would increase their influence at America's expense. Just as most Afghans are not prepared to live under a new Taliban regime, so most Americans are surely not prepared to live in a world in which the United States voluntarily cedes its influence, power, and moral example to others who share neither our interests nor our values.<br />

Gen Amos: No, combat operations in Afghanistan are not adversely affecting readiness and retention of active duty and reserve Marines. We are meeting our retention goals across the Marine Corps, and some of our highest retention rates come from units that have deployed. Marine Corps units, both active and reserve, are deploying for all our global mission demands (e.g. theater security cooperation initiatives, Marine expeditionary unit operations, combat operations etc.) at the highest states of readiness. As long as we maintain a deployment to dwell ratio of about 1:2, I do not foresee adverse impacts on retention.<br />

But imperial overstretch is not the real issue here. The combined cost of the two wars accounts for only 10-15 percent of the country's annual deficit and much less than that of its cumulative debt, and the principal reasons for questioning the Iraq war several years ago and for questioning the war in Afghanistan today are more strategic than economic. It is fiscal, economic, and political failures at home that are threatening the ability of the United States to exert the global influence that it could and should. In other words, it is not reckless American activity in the world that jeopardizes American solvency but American profligacy at home that threatens American power and security. The American people and their elected representatives postpone solving the country's debt addiction at their great peril.<br />

None of this is to suggest that staying in Afghanistan is an easy option. Wars never are. They require good men and women to put their lives on the line every day for our security. We should put them at risk only for an issue of vital national interest. Afghanistan is one such issue.<br />
And that—not cost—is the real bottom line. The war won’t bankrupt America. Multitrillion dollar proposals like “cap and trade” environmental schemes or government-managed health systems might well kill our economy. But the $30 billion required for the Afghanistan surge represents about 0.20 percent of our GDP.<br />

The nature of the risk becomes plain when one considers the nature of the cuts that would have to be made to have even a marginal effect on the U.S. fiscal crisis. Many are under the illusion, for instance, that if the United States simply withdrew from Iraq and Afghanistan and didn’t intervene anywhere else for a while, this would have a significant impact on future deficits. But, in fact, projections of future massive deficits already assume the winding down of these interventions. Withdrawal from the two wars would scarcely make a dent in the fiscal crisis. Nor can meaningful reductions be achieved by cutting back on waste at the Pentagon—which Secretary of Defense Gates has already begun to do and which has also been factored into deficit projections. If the United States withdrew from Iran and Afghanistan tomorrow, cut all the waste Gates can find, and even eliminated a few weapons programs—all this together would still not produce a 10 percent decrease in overall defense spending. <br />
<br />
Cutting defense spending by withdrawing troops kills heg<br />
Kagan 11 − senior fellow at the Brookings Institution (Robert, “The Price of Power,” January 24, Vol. 16, No. 18, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2322:http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/price-power_533696.html?page=2 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/price-power_533696.html?page=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/price-power_533696.html?page=2</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2322 -->)<br />
In fact, the only way to get significant savings from the defense budget—and by “significant,” we are still talking about a tiny fraction of the cuts needed to bring down future deficits—is to cut force structure: fewer troops on the ground; fewer airplanes in the skies; fewer ships in the water; fewer soldiers, pilots, and sailors to feed and clothe and provide benefits for. To cut the size of the force, however, requires reducing or eliminating the missions those forces have been performing. Of course, there are any number of think tank experts who insist U.S. forces can be cut by a quarter or third or even by half and still perform those missions. But this is snake oil. Over the past two decades, the force has already been cut by a third. Yet no administration has reduced the missions that the larger force structures of the past were designed to meet. To fulfill existing security commitments, to remain the “world’s power balancer of choice,” as Leslie Gelb puts it, to act as “the only regional balancer against China in Asia, Russia in eastern Europe, and Iran in the Middle East” requires at least the current force structure, and almost certainly more than current force levels. Those who recommend doing the same with less are only proposing a policy of insufficiency, where the United States makes commitments it cannot meet except at high risk of failure.<br />

Winning the war for multiple reasons − their authors overestimate the insurgency, political progress doesn’t matter, and shortfalls simply protract the war − they will not make us lose<br />
Kagan and Kagan 11 (Frederick, director of the Critical Threats Project at AEI, Kimberly, president of the Institute for the Study of War, “Defining Success in Afghanistan,” January 7, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2323:http://www.aei.org/paper/100184 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/paper/100184" rel="nofollow">http://www.aei.org/paper/100184</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2323 -->) Crowe<br />
Success in Afghanistan is the establishment of a political order, security situation, and indigenous security force that is stable, viable, enduring, and able--with greatly reduced international support--to prevent Afghanistan from being a safe haven for international terrorists. The current American and Coalition strategy is making progress and should be continued. Since President Obama, NATO allies, and the Afghans have agreed that troops will be present in Afghanistan through 2014, the policy does not require substantial modifications at this point. This paper is thus primarily a report on the current situation in Afghanistan and a consideration of some of the prospects and challenges ahead. Our principal recommendation is that the U.S. and its allies should continue to resource and sustain the strategy now being executed, which is the only approach that can secure their vital national security interests in Afghanistan.<br />
The New Year finds the situation in southern Afghanistan fundamentally different from what it was at the start of 2010.<br />
The Taliban has lost almost all of its principal safe havens in this area.<br />
Its ability to acquire, transport, and use IED materials and other weapons and equipment has been disrupted.<br />
Local populations have stepped forward to fight the Taliban with ISAF support for the first time in some important areas.<br />
The momentum of the insurgency in the south has unquestionably been arrested and probably reversed.<br />
The insurgents do not have momentum anywhere in RC(East). Coalition operations continue to disrupt them in Greater Paktia and are increasingly pushing into their safe havens and support zones in Ghazni, Logar, and Wardak. Insurgents have not been able to conduct a coordinated campaign in Nangarhar or Konar or to make much use of isolated safe havens they retain in Nuristan.<br />
Despite alarmist reports from the Intelligence Community and elsewhere, the insurgency is not gaining strength in northern Afghanistan and is extremely unlikely to do so.<br />
Direct action operations against terrorists, insurgent leaders and facilitators, narcotics labs, and other key nodes of the various networks that support unrest in Afghanistan have increased both in pace and in effectiveness.<br />
From a military standpoint, the counterinsurgency is going reasonably well, insofar as it is possible to judge over the winter. Challenges remain in the areas that have been or are being cleared, and the requirements for the next series of operations are becoming apparent.<br />
The theater remains inadequately resourced. The shortfalls, however, are considerably more likely to protract an otherwise successful campaign than they are to make it fail.<br />
Political progress has been much more limited, but that is to be expected this early into the implementation of the new strategy. It is too soon to judge the effectiveness of the current approach in this area.<br />

But on the issue of a disintegrating Pakistan. There is no question that would be a immense disaster in many ways. Yet Pakistan has been teetering on the precipice of disintegration for its entire history but has somehow held together. I really believe that it is more resilient than Americans give it credit for. A more likely problem is the emergence of an Islamist government in Pakistan, possibly through the democratic process. While that would certainly be damaging to U.S. policy, I don’t think it would automatically be disastrous. I find the assertion that any Islamist regime will provide nuclear weapons to terrorists absurd. The United States should have a stated policy that if terrorists use nuclear weapons and the source of them can be identified (which is likely), it will be treated exactly the same as a direct nuclear strike from the source country. <br />
Of course an Islamist government would be more hospitable to a Taliban or al Qaeda presence. But I’m not sure that would be markedly different than the current state of affairs. The emergence of an Islamist government, though, could increase pressure on Karzai to bring the Taliban into his government. We don’t know whether a coalition government that included the Taliban would provide sanctuary for al Qaeda. I suspect not. I think the Taliban’s relationship with al Qaeda pre-September 11 was based on ignorance. It was simply not aware of the immense costs of harboring al Qaeda. Now it is. Hence I don’t think it would make that mistake again. The Taliban’s leaders are not stupid.<br />
Another Pakistan scenario, though, might be “semi-disintegration” where Islamabad loses even the pretense of control over some regions. That would not be much different than today where the central government has little or no influence in the tribal areas and even parts of Karachi. So long as the government controls Punjab, though, Pakistan can teeter along.<br />

This advantage makes no sense − terrorists wouldn’t give up once we admit defeat<br />

Those who assert that the Afghan Taliban may no longer have sympathy for these other extremists base their hopes on a thin reed. Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden continue to work together to send terrorists to the United States, as illustrated by the foiled 2009 New York metro attack planned for the eighth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The three U.S. citizens led by Najibullah Zazi, who have pleaded guilty to the plot, were referred to al Qaeda after initially approaching the Taliban to fight in Afghanistan. The Taliban were active recruiters for an al Qaeda attack on the U.S. homeland, and it is not clear why the Afghan Taliban would become more moderate at the very moment it defeated NATO and reclaimed control of its historical heartland.8 Moreover with Plan B, the die would be cast for civil war in Afghanistan, as the Tajik-  dominated northern state and the Taliban-run Pashtun belt would likely wind up  fighting furiously, over Kabul in particular. Plan B may wind up as the only option, if all else fails, but it is more likely to lead to a defeat of NATO and its Afghan allies than to be a sound strategic choice for the United States.<br />

COIN is a prerequisite to solve terrorism<br />
Kagan and Kagan 11 (Frederick, director of the Critical Threats Project at AEI, Kimberly, president of the Institute for the Study of War, “Defining Success in Afghanistan,” January 7, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2326:http://www.aei.org/paper/100184 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/paper/100184" rel="nofollow">http://www.aei.org/paper/100184</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2326 -->) Crowe<br />
It is not possible to deny safe haven to terrorists in Afghanistan without also pursuing a counterinsurgency strategy. The neutralization and ultimate defeat of the insurgency is a necessary prerequisite for preventing the return of al Qaeda and other transnational terrorist groups that thrive in the political vacuum that the insurgency creates. As long as local networks willing to support extremists exist and can operate freely in Afghanistan, terrorists will be able to use those networks however intense our direct-action operations might be. The current counterinsurgency strategy is the only approach that can disrupt and ultimately eliminate those local networks, thereby preventing the terrorists from returning to Afghanistan and ensuring that America achieves its vital national security objectives.<br />
<br />
No terrorism and no impact<br />
Dalmia 11 − senior analyst at Reason Foundation and a columnist at The Daily, America’s first iPad newspaper (Shikha, “What Islamist Terrorism Threat?” February 15, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2327:http://reason.com/archives/2011/02/15/what-islamist-terrorist-threat --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://reason.com/archives/2011/02/15/what-islamist-terrorist-threat" rel="nofollow">http://reason.com/archives/2011/02/15/what-islamist-terrorist-threat</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2327 -->) Crowe<br />
Know thy enemy is an ancient principle of warfare. And if America had heeded it, it might have refrained from a full-scale “war” on terrorism whose price tag is touching $2 trillion. That’s because the Islamist enemy it is confronting is not some hyper-power capable of inflicting existential—or even grave—harm. It is, rather, a rag-tag band of peasants whose malevolent ambitions are far beyond the capacity of their shallow talent pool to deliver.<br />
The shock and awe of 9-11 was so great that Americans came to think of Islamist jihadists as a low-tech version of Dr. Strangelove, an evil genius constantly looking for ingenious ways of spreading death and destruction. America is so open and vulnerable and the Islamists so crafty and motivated that it was just a matter of time, everyone thought, before they got us again.<br />
But this year marks the 10th anniversary of 9-11 and none of the horrible scenarios conjured then have materialized. Islamic terrorists have not flown more planes into buildings. They haven’t detonated “loose nukes” or dirty bombs. They haven’t released nerve gas into subway stations. They haven’t poisoned the water supply. They haven’t even strolled into one of America’s hundreds of malls or farmer’s markets and blown themselves up.<br />
Maybe this is because enhanced post-9/11 security has made America invulnerable. Or maybe the Islamists never posed that a big threat to begin with.<br />
Most intelligence experts interviewed by The Washington Post for a series on nuclear, biological, and chemical attacks (the easiest of the three) three years after 9/11 agreed that anything requiring scientific expertise is virtually impossible to pull off for Al Qaeda—the only group in the so-called global jihadist movement with any ambition to strike on American soil. If anything, Al Qaeda’s capacity has shrunk not grown since then. But even campaigns of conventional, low-tech terrorism that the Palestinian intifada unleashed in Israel or the Islamist insurgency has fomented in Kashmir is difficult to export across borders. They can’t be planned from overseas. They need people on the ground. And Al Qaeda has two ways to put them there. It can either recruit from within America or smuggle them in, as it did with the 9-11 hijackers.<br />
The problem with the first option is that open societies are not good breeding grounds for radicals willing to die for the sake of 72 virgins in the other world. It is no coincidence that a decade-long FBI search has failed to find a single genuine Al Qaeda cell in the United States. Forget the U.S. where the local Muslim population is fairly assimilated: Glenn Carle, an operations officer or spy with the CIA for 23 years, notes that Al Qaeda has failed to do meaningful recruitment even in Europe, where Muslims are much more disaffected, attracting no more than a few hundred to training camps in Afghanistan over the years.<br />
As for smuggling people in, that wouldn’t be a problem for Al Qaeda—no matter how many fences we build or how many visas we deny. Its main obstacle is finding individuals worth smuggling in given the skill set needed for the job. They would have to be: radicalized enough to die for their cause; Westernized enough to move around without raising red flags; ingenious enough to exploit loopholes in the security apparatus; meticulous enough to attend to the myriad logistical details that could torpedo the operation; self-sufficient enough to make all the preparations without enlisting outsiders who might give them away; disciplined enough to maintain complete secrecy, and—above all—psychologically tough enough to keep functioning at a high level without cracking in the face of their own impending death.<br />
That emphatically is not the profile of an average Al Qaeda foot solider who is a semi-literate peasant with barely any experience of the world outside his province. According to Carle, at its height, Al Qaeda had maybe a couple of dozen individuals who could be regarded as officer material. Out of them, only a very small subset would even come close to fitting the bill for a trans-national terrorist. One big disadvantage inherent in the terrorist enterprise of course is that it expends its best people in every successful attack, something that is not conducive to building a deep bench of terrorist talent overtime.<br />
It is hardly any surprise then that Al Qaeda can scrape together a team to stage something spectacular only every decade or so. There has been talk lately about it turning to a new strategy of small attacks or microterrorism such as the bomb packages from Yemen. But such attacks are probably not worth its while given that the international backlash they would generate would be far more enduring than the fear they engender in America. In any case, this is hardly the kind of thing that would justify a “war.”<br />
An attack that kills 3,000 citizens—even if only once every 10 years—is nothing to ignore of course, and some limited effort to clean out Al Qaeda in Afghanistan might have been justified. But is it worth spending $1 trillion on two ongoing wars and $1 trillion on enhanced homeland security—America’s post-9-11 terrorism expenditure? America spends more on intelligence than the rest of the world put together.<br />
John Mueller, a political science professor at Ohio State University, points out that chances of an American being killed by international terrorism during his or her lifetime is about one in 80,000. More people drown in bathtubs every year. “Even if there were a 9/11 scale attack every three months for the next five years, the likelihood that an individual American would be among the dead would be two hundredths of a percent or one in 5,000,” he notes.<br />

We’re not losing the war, but the plan causes us to lose<br />
Joffe 11 − the Marc and Anita Abramowitz Fellow in International Relations at the Hoover Institution (Josef, “Great Game without End,” January 12, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2328:http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/62731 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/62731" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/62731</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2328 -->) Crowe<br />
This is no way to win. It’s like a trainer announcing in round three that he will throw in the towel in round six. His man will take no more risks, while the other boxer will wait it out or go for the knockout punch.<br />
Already, President Hamid Karzai seems to be preparing for our departure by catering to the Taliban. And with every platoon that heads home, our wards will increase their bets on whoever they think will step into the vacuum—the Taliban, the warlords, the Iranians, or the Pakistani ISI (the intelligence service that practically invented the Taliban in the days of Charlie Wilson and the Soviets).<br />
This problem is built into any counterinsurgency strategy. Whose commitment is more sustainable, hence more credible: the insurgents’ or the intruders’? The “bad guys” fight where they live, and so they have nowhere else to go. But we, who fight for abstract reasons only remotely related to our core security, can always ship out. The locals—be they wards or warriors of God—know it.<br />
They know that democracies fight wars of choice only if victory is swift, bloodless, and reasonably priced. They don’t like operations that are indecisive, and this one has lasted even longer than the war in Vietnam. The asymmetry has become crueler over time. Thirty-five years after the fall of Saigon, postmodern Western society is horrified even by blood we shed on the other side. This our enemies have learned as well, hence the tactics of Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Taliban, which lure our forces into killing (either real or make-believe) civilians. Nothing has soured Germans more on the war in Afghanistan than the scores of Afghans killed near Kunduz in a German-ordered bombing run by U.S. aircraft in 2009. How many were civilians? We’ll never know.<br />
Democracies will fight as fiercely as totalitarians when their own lands are at stake. But they won’t fight to the end in a difficult war of choice, as Afghanistan surely is. Yet the willingness to stay as long as it takes is the alpha and omega of any counterinsurgency strategy. If we go in, we have to be willing to stay sine die. We must not think like a traditional army that knocks out the enemy and then goes home. We have to think like a police force. The police stay on the beat forever. Only then can they tell the good guys from the bad guys. Only then can they gain vital intelligence from the locals. Only because they reliably serve and protect can they conquer “hearts and minds.”<br />
But why would we stay where interests (remote) and costs (high) are so unbalanced? There are lots of good reasons. Our interests may be abstract, but they are not unreal. The greater Middle East, from the Levant to Kashmir, will be in the twenty-first century what Europe was in the twentieth: the arena where endless vicious conflict—strategic as well as ideological, within as well as between states—will come home to haunt us if it remains unchecked. Indeed, the Taliban pale against a failing, deeply anti-Western nuclear state like Pakistan or a revolutionary regime like Iran’s that believes it is on a mission from God.<br />
<br />
We’re winning the war − every single claim your authors make is false<br />
Miller 11 − Assistant Professor of International Security Studies at the National Defense University, former Director for Afghanistan in the U.S. National Security Council under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama (Paul, “Finish the Job: How the War in Afghanistan Can Be Won,” Foreign Affairs, Vol. 90, No. 1, Jan/Feb, ProQuest) Crowe<br />
Yet the stabilization and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan has gone better than is widely believed. The pessimists fail to understand how badly the Afghan state had failed in 2001 and thus are blind to how much it has improved in many areas-particularly in economic and political reconstruction. The pessimists are right to be worried about the rise of the Taliban insurgency and the weak rule of law, but they also tend to overstate the competence and scale of the insurgency. <br />
Many analysts critical of the war effort have drawn misguided lessons from cartoonish and caricatured versions of Afghan history-comparing isaf to the armies of Alexander the Great, William Elphinstone, or Boris Gromov-to conclude that the laws of history bar foreign militaries from accomplishing anything in the land of the Hindu Kush. They sound dire warnings about U.S. and nato staying power after a nineyear- old war. But they are wrong on all counts. The insurgency did not pick up steam until late 2005, and isaf, which started changing its posture and strategy in late 2006, arguably did not implement a coherent counterinsurgency campaign until 2009. It would be myopic and irresponsible to conclude that the international community should walk away from the mission due to a lack of adequate progress. <br />
<br />
Their authors misunderstand the war, overestimate the costs, and reduce it to a political concept − we’re winning, and withdrawal causes terrorism<br />
Pletka 11 − vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at AEI (Danielle, “A War We Can And Must Win,” January 7, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2329:http://blog.american.com/?p=24669 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blog.american.com/?p=24669" rel="nofollow">http://blog.american.com/?p=24669</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2329 -->) Crowe<br />
The vast mass of Americans—inside Washington and in the heartland—don’t understand the war in Afghanistan. It’s as simple as that. They’re not fools, nor ignorant. It’s a complex war, remote in too many ways. And because it feels distant, it feels that at once the costs in blood and treasure are too high and the risks of losing are low. People have grasped at that which they do understand to simplify the battle, and to reduce it to a manageable political concept. The Cliff Notes version of the war is that we went in 2001 for good reasons, we have fought for almost 10 years, we have gained little and been plagued by feckless allies (Afghans, Karzai, NATO, Pakistan) and we are still fighting. Afghanistan is unmanageable, has been for centuries, its people are tribal at best, thieves and terrorists at worst, and the best option is to reduce to a rearguard counterterrorism force that can kill bin Laden et al when we find them.<br />
This is wrong, and the fact that so many Americans believe the litany above is a testament to a terrible failure of leadership from Washington. That failure belongs first and foremost to the president, who has been courageous in his commitment to the war, but gutless in standing by the war, in his public command, and in his unwillingness to explain the stakes and share with his people why we fight. But it is also a failure by those of us who believe this war must be won, can be won, and is vital to the security of the American people.<br />
When AEI’s Fred Kagan wrote Choosing Victory, the architectural basis of the surge in Iraq, he was answering a crying need to wrest victory from the jaws of defeat. That is not the case in Afghanistan. We are winning, slowly, but surely. Despite that fact, public support for the war continues to diminish. Today, Fred and Kim Kagan, who leads the Institute for the Study of War and who together spent 150 days of the last year in Afghanistan working with General Petraeus, have released a report defining success in Afghanistan. The report is an important read, a compelling explanation of what is at stake, how and why we are fighting, how we can win, who the Afghans are, how governance matters, and much more. Read it as I did, and you will understand better the country in which we are fighting and the war which must be fought.<br />
And stay tuned. We’ll have an event with the Kagans, General Jack Keane, and Andrew Exum on Monday at 8 a.m. to lay out the report, there will be a livestream here if you can’t attend in person, and we’ll be doing a variety of podcasts and videos to follow up.<br />
Three thousand people died on 9/11 because we thought it didn’t matter who controlled Afghanistan. We were wrong then, and those who argue we can walk away are wrong now. The first step to building support for the battle is to help policy makers, opinion leaders, and the public understand the fight. Fred and Kim’s report is a must-read.<br />

Plan A has produced some good results: the Afghan economy is improving, there are many committed reformers in the government−especially in a number of key ministerial positions and key governorships−and the Afghan people strongly prefer to avoid a return of Taliban rule or civil war.3 Kabul is reasonably safe and, as General David Petraeus has emphasized, is  under Afghan lead control rather than the control of  NATO and the International Security Assistance  Force (ISAF). The country’s north and west are somewhat less secure than before, but hardly seem vulnerable to takeover by an extremist Pashtun movement.4<br />

The New York Times’s Chris Chivers reports from Ghazni province on the structure of the Taliban’s shadow government. The whole article is interesting, but I found one point in particular to be important: the fact that “the Taliban fighters of eastern Ghazni appear to be entirely local men.” There has been much focus on the importance of Pakistan sanctuaries for the Taliban, and rightly so. But Chivers’s report squares with everything else I have heard and read: namely that the Taliban fighters tend to operate in their own neighborhoods. That suggests that the Pakistan sanctuaries, important as they are, are not an insuperable obstacle to defeating the insurgency, which is fueled primarily by local grievances. The key is to improve Afghan governance and make it more accountable. Of vital importance is to avoid further warping the governance dynamics as the Afghan Local Police program could do if not skillfully handled.<br />
