**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Debt Deal fiscal framework will succeed now and create a compromise of spending cuts– multiple structural factors guarantee it </span>**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ragusa, ’9-8</span>** [9/8/11, <span style="text-decoration: none;">[[http://rule22.wordpress.com/author/jordanragusa/|Jordan Ragusa]]</span>, “Reasons to be Optimistic about the Super Committee” ,<span style="text-decoration: none;">[[http://rule22.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/reasons-to-be-optimistic-about-the-super-committee/]]</span>, SM]
The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction—a.k.a. the “super committee”—…… So those are some of my optimistic thoughts on the super committee.

**The plan breaks that framework – creates huge spending that strains the deficit**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hsu 9</span>**[Feng, Ph.D. and Senior Fellow – Aerospace Technology Working Group, and Ken Cox, Ph.D. and Founder & Director – Aerospace Technology Working Group, “Sustainable Space Exploration and Space Development - A Unified Strategic Vision”, 2-20,[[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=30702]]]
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">There arelimited financial resources from the U.S. government, which is now struggling with unprecedented high budget deficit and</span> is confronted with extremely <span style="font-size: 10pt;">costly ongoing wars</span>. So <span style="font-size: 10pt;">it is</span> nearly <span style="font-size: 10pt;">irresponsible to impose on the nation</span> and its people <span style="font-size: 10pt;">an Apollo-like, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">huge spending</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> lunar-based space exploration program</span>. There is neither significant (or short-term) science value nor space exploration and operation value in revisiting an earth-orbit destination that was explored by mankind four decades ago. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Given today's</span> decimated American<span style="font-size: 10pt;">economic condition</span>, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">we must adapt a</span> concurrent and comprehensive <span style="font-size: 10pt;">space exploration</span> and space development <span style="font-size: 10pt;">strategy that is</span> not only<span style="font-size: 10pt;">affordable</span> but can be mutually supported.

**The signal of a fiscal discipline framework has appeased Moody’s but they are watching to whether or not it will succeed – failure to curtail spending and maintain status quo plans for cuts triggers a downgrade**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Panchuk, ‘8-3</span>** [8-3-11, Kerri Panchuk, “Moody's affirms US triple-A rating, but risks remain”,[[http://www.housingwire.com/2011/08/03/moodys-affirms-us-triple-a-rating-but-risks-remain]], SM]
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Moody's</span> Investors Service (<span style="text-decoration: none;">[[@http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MCO|MCO]]</span>: 27.04 -3.19%) <span style="font-size: 10pt;">confirmed the U.S. government's triple-A bond rating …… </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">this could affect the rating negatively</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">," Moody's said.</span>

**Further downgrades risks a spiral in interest rates that collapses investor confidence**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">**Goldwein 8-11-2011** [</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Marc, senior policy analyst for the fiscal policy program at the New America Foundation and former Associate Director of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, The Atlantic, Drawing a AAA-Road Map for Post-Downgrade America,[[http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/08/drawing-a-aaa-road-map-for-post-downgrade-america/243463/]]]</span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">What are the consequences of further downgrades? ……. except with no one available to bail out the U.S. government</span>.

**That specifically collapses US economic leadership**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">**Raman 8-3-11** [</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Manikandan, International Business Times, U.S. Reaches Debt Deal: Is it Enough to Sustain AAA Rating?,[[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/191564/20110803/us-debt-ceiling-spending-cuts-debt-deal-aaa-rating-barack-obama-president-s-p-fitch-moodys-treasury.htm]]]</span>
But <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the key question is whether the raising of the debt ceiling is enough to keep the country's AAA rating…… </span>further fiscal consolidation measures are not adopted in 2013 and the economic outlook deteriorates significantly.

**Economic leadership prevents nuclear war from economic collapse—leadership key to resilience**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mandelbaum 2005</span>** – Professor and Director of the American Foreign Policy Program at Johns Hopkins – 2005
[Michael, The Case for Goliath: How America Acts As the World’s Government in the Twenty-First Century, p. 192-195]
Although <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the spread of nuclear weapons, with the corresponding increase in the likelihood …… </span>A <span style="font-size: 10pt;">world without the United States would in this way resemble a fleet of cars without gasoline.</span>

**Broad statistical models prove – unmanaged economic declines lead to global conflict**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Royal, Director of cooperative threat reduction, ‘10</span>**<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> [</span>Jedediah, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction – U.S. Department of Defense, “Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises”, Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, Ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215]
Less intuitive is how periods of <span style="font-size: 10pt;">economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict.</span> ……. This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.
