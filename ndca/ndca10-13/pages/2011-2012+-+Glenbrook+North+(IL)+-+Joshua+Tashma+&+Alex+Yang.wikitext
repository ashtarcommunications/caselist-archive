**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Deterrence is not neutral or an effective means of avoiding conflict – it results in the automation of war that makes conflict inevitable</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">And deterrence theory isn’t a logical explanation for conflict resolution – it relies on nuclear fetisihism and ahistorical theories of human behavior – means they can’t solve</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Your choice is between a flawed educational model which naturalizes the logic of deterrence and a reflexive one which explicitly engages it as a topic for debate - making method a point of stasis is critical to debate's educational potential</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Deterrence logic can only produce conflict, not prevent it.
