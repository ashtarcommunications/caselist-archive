**No system exists now that can counter threats posed by Ballistic missiles**
**Independent Working Group 2007** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The Independent Working Group is co-chaired by Dr. Robert Pfaltzgraff, President of the Institute of Foreign Policy Analysis (IFPA) at Tufts University, and by Dr. William R. Van Cleave, Professor Emeritus of the Department of Defense and Strategic Studies at Missouri State University, and a member of the original U.S. delegation which drafted the 1972 ABM Treaty. Ambassador Henry F. Cooper, who in former roles oversaw both development of missile defense for the U.S. and was chief negotiator to the Geneva Defense and Space Talks, Dr. Robert Jastrow, founding director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and Dr. Lowell Wood, a Physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Commissioner on the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) were among the numerous missile defense, space, and security experts from the scientific, technical, and national security policy communities around the country who are members of the Independent Working Group. Members of the Working Group also include Brian T. Kennedy, president of the Claremont Institute, and Thomas Karako, Director of Programs at the Claremont Institute and editor of Missilethreat.com. Sponsors and authors of the IWG report include eight think-tanks headquartered in Washington D.C., California, Alaska, Missouri, Massachusetts, and around the country.2007(Collective report/study) “missile defense and the space relationship and the 21st century”2007 [[http://www.missilethreat.com/repository/doclib/IWGreport.pdf]] (Pitman)</span>
__<span style="color: black;">So far, however, the United States has stopped short of put­ting these principles into practice. Rather, the missile defense system that has emerged since President Bush’s historic De­cember 2002 announcement of an “initial set” of missile de­fense capabilities provides extremely limited coverage, and no global capability. Instead, by the administration’s own ad­mission, it is intended as a limited defense against a small, rogue state threat scenario. Left unaddressed are the evolv­ing missile arsenals of – and potential missile threats from – strategic competitors such as Russia and China as well as terrorists launching short-range missiles such as //Scuds// from off-shore vessels.</span>__
