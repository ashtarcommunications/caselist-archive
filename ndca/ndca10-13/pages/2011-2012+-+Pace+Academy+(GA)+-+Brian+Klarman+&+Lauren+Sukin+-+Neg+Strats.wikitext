Ziegler, 1AC Author, 7 (Dustin P. Ziegler, Major, USAF April 2007 “PERSISTENT SPACE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS: DISTRIBUTED REAL-TIME AWARENESS GLOBAL NETWORK IN SPACE (DRAGNETS)” http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/bh_ziegler.pdf)
Constellations of femtosats will operate with a degree of self-awareness supported by the 11 nanotechnology-enabled processing power and networking technologies projected to evolve over the next two decades. Without intervention from the ground, the system will continuously monitor its own state of health, identifying failing femtosat elements. The constellation will then perform corrective measures itself, signal to ground for instructions, or deactivate and remove the faulty elements. Similarly, the architecture will respond to external events by adapting to focus more attention on the event while passing along all relevant information to different regions of the constellation, other satellites on the network, and the ground C 2 nodes. An architecture this complex would quickly overwhelm today’s C 2 capabilities, but our 2025 ground segment will be reaping the nanotechnology rewards too.

Nanotech causes arms race, unstable proliferation of the tech, economic upheaval, environmental damage, and abusive restrictions.
CRN, 2/7/2008, The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology, is a non-profit research and advocacy think tank concerned with the major societal and environmental implications of advanced nanotechnology.
Molecular manufacturing (MM) will be a significant breakthrough, comparable perhaps to the Industrial Revolution—but compressed into a few years. This has the potential to disrupt many aspects of society and politics. The power of the technology may cause two competing nations to enter a disruptive and unstable arms race. Weapons and surveillance devices could be made small, cheap, powerful, and very numerous. Cheap manufacturing and duplication of designs could lead to economic upheaval. Overuse of inexpensive products could cause widespread environmental damage. Attempts to control these and other risks may lead to abusive restrictions, or create demand for a black market that would be very risky and almost impossible to stop; small nanofactories will be very easy to smuggle, and fully dangerous. There are numerous severe risks—including several different kinds of risk—that cannot all be prevented with the same approach. Simple, one-track solutions cannot work. The right answer is unlikely to evolve without careful planning.

it outweighs nuclear war.
Bailey in ‘8 (Ronald, science editor for Reason magazine, “The End of Humanity,” July 22, http://www.reason.com/news/show/127676.html)
While nuclear war and nuclear terrorism would be catastrophic, the presenters acknowledged that neither constituted existential risks; that is, a risk that they could cause the extinction of humanity. But the next two risks, self-improving artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, would.


4. The plan is a competing program – leads to tech leaks and reduces the accountability and credibility of the CP
Treder And Phoenix, 1AC Author, 8 Mike , Executive Director of CRN, BS Biology, University of Washington, Research Fellow with the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, a consultant to the Millennium Project of the American Council for the United Nations University AND Chris Phoenix, CRN’s Director of Research, has studied nanotechnology for more than 15 years. BS, Symbolic Systems, MS, Computer Science, Stanford University. Center For Responsible Nanotechnology, “Finding a Solution that Balances Many Interests” http://www.crnano.org/everyone.htm
A key to our proposal is the use of a flexible, carefully controlled manufacturing system. As described in our Technical Restrictions page, self-contained molecular manufacturing systems (personal nanofactories) can have restrictions built in to prevent many kinds of misuse, by allowing only approved products or classes of products to be built. This allows a fine degree of control over the whole technology—as long as the restrictions are not broken, and as long as no competing development programs exist. Competing programs are a bad idea for at least two reasons. First, they multiply the chance of a technology leak. Second, they reduce accountability and trackability, which increases uncertainty and decreases security.

5. Individual nations making tech destroys the program and causes a Nano-race
Treder And Phoenix, 1AC Author, 8 Mike , Executive Director of CRN, BS Biology, University of Washington, Research Fellow with the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, a consultant to the Millennium Project of the American Council for the United Nations University AND Chris Phoenix, CRN’s Director of Research, has studied nanotechnology for more than 15 years.

As long as all MNT capability is administered by an international body, with product designs being reported and tracked, it will be possible to verify the offensive and defensive capabilities of each nation. This approach depends on individual nations not developing independent MNT capabilities. Some designs will need to be kept secret. A small, diverse, trustworthy, collectively disinterested board of technology evaluators could assess the capabilities of each secret design: lethality, destructiveness, size, etc. The manufacture of each design could be tracked, allowing approximate knowledge of capabilities and intentions to be published without giving away secret details. If numerous countries do develop independent capabilities, it is hard to see how any country could be secure; even a massive (and wasteful) deployment of defensive MNT would not guarantee protection against new and unexpected kinds of weapons. As discussed in this essay by Thomas McCarthy, MNT's effect of cutting economic ties between countries greatly reduces their economic incentive to avoid war. And as discussed here by Mark Gubrud, and on CRN's Dangers page, an arms race interrupted by a preemptive strike is likely. Faced with such a scenario, all countries should be willing to accept mutual inspections to verify that there is no independent MNT development. However, the United States recently refused to allow biological inspections. Even if an international approach is the best hope for international security, it may be difficult to get it accepted. It is questionable, though, whether any one country such as the United States can successfully take on the role of international administrator.
