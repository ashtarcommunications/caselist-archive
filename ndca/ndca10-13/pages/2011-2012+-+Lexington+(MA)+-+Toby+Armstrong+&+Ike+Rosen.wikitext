<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As Dr. Lowell Wood told the House Armed Services Commission: </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The ability of North Korea to attack the continental United States in the very near term with small nuclear weapons thrown with advanced variants of the current Taepo Dong missiles is well known to the Washington national security community . ………….</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">terrorist information warfare [includes] using the technology of directed energy weapons (DEW) or electromagnetic pulse</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (EMP).” 6</span>





We’ll provide four interdependent ways to access deterrence and defensive capabilities



The first is space situational awareness -

Enhanced surveillance capability for SSA bolsters deterrence through cooperation- data sharing reduces the risk of attack

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To address these challenges, we must continue to focus attention on enhanced space situational awareness. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">…………</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These partnerships can be political, financial, material, or all of the above. There are numerous options to be discovered with international engagement and partnerships in space.</span>



The third is redundancy and spreading mission focus between multiple satellites – that lessens the impact of singular missiles and dissuades countries from attacking

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Morgan 10</span> (Forrest E., Senior Political Scientist at the RAND Corporation, 2010, “Deterrence and First-Strike Stability in Space,” http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2010/RAND_MG916.pdf)



<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Even </span><span class="UnderlineChar">a multifaceted, punishment-based deterrence strategy may not be sufficiently potent or credible to discourage an adversary facing the prospect of war with the United States</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Therefore…………., </span><span class="UnderlineChar">rapid replenishment and terrestrial backup are probably the best near-term avenues for denying the benefits of an attack on U.S. space assets.</span>



The fourth is hardening – that deters adversaries and prevents EMP even if deterrence fails

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Armstrong 10</span>—Major, IDE Student (Mekesha, March, “Strategic Implications of Satellite Constellation Size and Mission Set”, http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=11&ved=0CBgQFjAAOAo&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.afresearch.org%2Fskins%2Frims%2Fq_mod_be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153%2Fq_act_downloadpaper%2Fq_obj_c2f524ef-9deb-491f-8abf-0ce381d9dc5d%2FdisPLAy.aspx%3Frs%3Denginespage&ei=OMQ1TvX1K4nRsgb9t9G5Ag&usg=AFQjCNF1MqKRwuTrfUoH3sEur02-NNNYVw, ZBurdette)



<span class="UnderlineChar">The US’s increasing economic and military reliance on space creates a vulnerability that is an attractive target for foreign adversaries. …………..</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.
