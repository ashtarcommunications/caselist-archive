=Affirmative= 

The narrative in the 1AC explains my relationship and perspective in regards to Transportation Infrastructure, which allows, and encourages, an examination of the self in regards to privilege, so one who does not know what it’s like to be segregated from those in positions of privilege, in the buses and in school and in the world in general, can understand the violence that exists without their knowledge, and how they contribute to that violence in the first place.
It is with this in mind that we listen to the story of

Robert D. Bullard, Dean of the Jordan-Leland School of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University and former Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, in 2004, Ph.D. Highway Robbery: Transportation Racism and New Routes to Equity, p. 8

In my fifty-five years as a black male....

The development of transportation infrastructure created the physical barriers that separate communities according to race and created the conditions for rampant poverty. However, we cannot turn to the same institutions that created these conditions. We must embrace our individual responsibility by acknowleding the role of privilege while integrating the voices forgotten by politicians and the resolution…

Given the nation’s ongoing economic crises, equity is a critical lens through which we should plan and examine decision-making.

And thus, this debate is about who best performatively and methodologically challenges structural violence in this debate space.

The affirmative integrates the perspectives of the oppressed with our own in order to challenge the privilege and violence rendered invisible in the status quo.

Only by recognizing the ways in which we are negatively affected by transportation infrastructure while simultaneously acknowledging the ways in which our advancement in such spaces are at the expense of others can we purposefully and effectively challenge the systems that have created and allows structural violence both in the past and the status quo.

Though I argue against efforts to speak for those otherwise able to produce and enact liberatory agendas for themselves,“starting off thought” from the lives of the oppressed...


Choosing to ignore these inequalities pertaining to accessibility is choosing to reify the invisibility that allows them to exist in the first place, thus, condoning not only structural violence pertaining to transportation infrastructure but structural violence that exists within every facet of the world around us. Mumia Abu Jamal explains the harsh realities of being on the other side of this privilege...of being pushed to the bottom of political and social institutions...of being invisible...when he said:

Mumia Abu-Jamal 1998 [“A QUIET AND DEADLY VIOLENCE,” 9/19/98, http://www.mumia.nl/TCCDMAJ/quietdv.htm]
It has often been observed that America is a truly violent nation, as shown by the thousands of
cases of social and communal violence that occurs daily in the nation.

Our appeal to the concept of structural violence forces attention to everyday instances of oppression that render life manageable. Calling attention to structural violence fosters critical engagement & illuminates interconnections of oppression often taken for granted. Voting affirmative would be to passively accept systemic inequality.
