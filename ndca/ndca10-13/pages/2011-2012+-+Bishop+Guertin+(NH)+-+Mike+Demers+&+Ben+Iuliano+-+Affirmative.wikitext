[No nation has … than ground-based telescopes]


**Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its efforts to survey and track near-Earth objects using space-based measures.**

**Contention 2 is Large Asteroid Armageddon**

**It’s not a question of if, but when an asteroid will collide with Earth --- the affirmative prevents a tidal wave of environmental catastrophes that would kill billions**

==UFO TABOO 1AC---LAKELAND== 

**<span class="Underline">Contention One is Anthropocentric Sovereignty:</span>**

**<span class="Underline">The extraterrestrial has been posited as a non-object in the mind of modern governmentality that must be actively ignored to protect the legitimacy of anthropocentric sovereignty. This is due to a UFO taboo that marginalizes ET discourse in an attempt to avoid the question of their existence.</span>**

<span class="Underline">[On March 30-31, 1990, two … ask the question.]</span>


**<span class="Underline">Our most basic understanding of humanity is derived from an anthropological machine which constructs understandings of humanity against understandings of animality to produce and maintain a hierarchal categorization of humanity. The very act of definition necessarily submits a third phantom category of life – bare life, which connects and sustains the categories of human and animal. Only by understanding this construction can we hope to stop this form of violence by the sovereign. </span>**

<span class="Underline">[In The Open, … to stop it.]</span>

**<span class="Underline">Under anthropocentric sovereignty, the concentration camp and the slaughterhouse become indistinguishable, two states of exception that operate based on the ability of individuals to render others as bare life – deserving nothing short of extermination. The fundamental instability of the human as a category of life, and subsequently its dependence on the animal as a stable category of existence naturalizes a form of biopolitical control that authorizes insidious violence. And, these forms of violence are inevitable unless the fundamental cracks within the assumed coherence of anthropocentric sovereignty are problematized.</span>**

<span class="Underline">[There is a … à la Stalin" (Singer in Patterson, 2002: 199).]</span>

**<span class="Underline">When the legitimacy and existence of an entire population is in question, politics become murderous—the entirety of the world is reduced to bare life in an attempt to rid the public sphere of all risk. The only option becomes the extermination of all life. </span>**

<span class="Underline">[These historic transformations … solidarity towards others.]</span>

**<span class="Underline">Therefore, Ben and I advocate that Unidentified Flying Objects are worthy of scientific inquiry.</span>**

**<span class="Underline">Contention Two is Jamming the Anthropological Machine: </span>**

**<span class="Underline">The conceptualization of the UFO presents a triple threat to the legitimacy of anthropocentric sovereignty—physical, ontological, and metaphysical. For this reason modern governmentality chooses to actively ignore the UFO instead of interrogate it. The ability of sovereignty to deny the UFO as worthy of scientific inquiry is precisely the foundation upon which the legitimacy and coherence of anthropocentric sovereignty is based.</span>**
<span class="Underline">**Wendt and Duvall 2008** (Alexander Wendt and Raymond Duvall, Duvall is a professor of political science at U. of Minnesota, Wendt is a constructivist IR Professor at Ohio State U., June 11 2008, Political Theory, Vol. 36, No. 4, “Sovereignty and the UFO,” [[http://ptx.sagepub.com/content/36/4/607]])</span>

<span class="Underline">[If the limits … one must look first.]</span>

**<span class="Underline">Our Call for a Realist Moment reverses the traditional antagonism between science and critical theory by invoking scientific skepticism in response to the UFO taboo.</span>**

<span class="Underline">[Although we draw … exceed human grasp. ]</span>

**<span class="Underline">Finally, extraterrestrials represent the Achilles’ heel of anthropocentrism. Our framework is one of militant agnosticism – we recognize it is impossible to objectively verify or deny the validity of UFO as reality, but at the same time modern regimes of truth deny the UFO’s existence without scientific basis. Agnosticism is an attempt to “see” the UFO within debate, rather than ignore it. We need to lay bare the foundations of anthropocentric sovereignty and affirm a tactical stance to problematize them.</span>**
**<span class="Underline">You have an obligation as an epistemic authority in this round to recognize the scientific merits of the UFO.</span>**
