The United States collects SSA … debris before maneuvering to a target.


**Plan -** The United States federal government should deploy an integrated Space Situational Awareness sensor network utilizing evolutionary acquisition practices.


**__CONTENTION 2 IS HEGEMONY__**

**Countries closing the gap on space capabilities—SSA’s key to prevent parity**
**Bowen and Spier ’08** – *Director Surveillance and Intelligence Systems at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company and **Director Strategic C4ISR Capabilities Unit Lockheed Martin Information Systems and Global Services (Phillip D and Clifton, “Space Situational Awareness Architecture Assessment,” November, The High Frontier Journal, Vol. 5, N0. 1, http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-081117-032.pdf, RBW)**

Social science proves that the alternative to hegemony is great power war—no peaceful transition

**The upshot is a near scholarly … <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">tend to be zero sum</span>.9**



__CONTENTION 3 IS COOPERATION__

Countries are weaponizing space now
Redifer, 11 **- LtCol, USMC, paper submitted in fulfillment of a degree from the Air War College at Air University (Stephen, “TAKING THE INITIATIVE – PROTECTING US INTERESTS IN SPACE ,” 2/16, <span style="color: black;">https://www.afresearch.org/skins/rims/display.aspx?moduleid=be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153&mode=user&action=downloadpaper&objectid=be97b3ea-7800-44ee-b6ff-76dcdb7c2960&rs=PublishedSearch</span>**

__Two internal links__
First, **the plan provides verifiability for space weapons**
Baines ’05 **– Senior Advisor, Science and Technology, Non-Proliferation, Arms Control and Disarmament Division, Department of Foreign Affairs, United Nations Institute of Disarmament Research (Philip J, “Safeguarding Space Security: Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space,” March 21-22, kms1.isn.ethz.ch/.../Files/.../2005_SafeguardingSpaceSecurity-full.pdf)**

**At first, space-based weapons … military assets on the Earth.**


That triggers support for weapons bans
Baines ’05 **– Senior Advisor, Science and Technology, Non-Proliferation, Arms Control and Disarmament Division, Department of Foreign Affairs, United Nations Institute of Disarmament Research (Philip J, “Safeguarding Space Security: Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space,” March 21-22, kms1.isn.ethz.ch/.../Files/.../2005_SafeguardingSpaceSecurity-full.pdf)**

**The search for solutions is the source of the problem – every effort brings about new crises in an escalating cycle of serial policy failure. What needs to be re-thought is the search for solutions itself, doing nothing gives us a way to break free.**
**McWhorter 92**, Professor of Philosophy at … __the Earth__, ed: McWhorter, p. vii-viii)

Thinking today must concern itself … new paths and new possibilities.

===Recommend CP=== 

**Text – The United States Congress should establish an independent agency empowered by the executive to submit to Congress recommendations for space policy as per Newton and Atkins. Congress and the executive will delegate authority to the agency to create recommendations and allow 90 days to pass legislation maintaining existing legislative baselines. If Congress does not pass legislation revising the Commission’s recommendations within the specified period, those recommendations will enter into legal force. After making adjustments to the plan based on input from the Commission, the Commission should recommend to Congress that The United States federal government should <<do the plan>>**

**The CP solves --- avoids policy churn that tanks solvency**
