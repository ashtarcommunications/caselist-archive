 <br />
Eight million have died in what started as a popular set of wars. Two Hundred Thousand women have been raped in what started as a popular conquest against Communism. Realpolitiks have guaranteed global conflict to the glee of the people – there is no true rejection.<br />
<br />
Why have these things happened? Because we were unsafe, because we had to do what was “right”, because it is the destiny of this earth? It all made sense to me even a year ago, why doesn’t it now? What has changed? Why can’t I seem to find truth?<br />
<br />
About five years ago, I was appalled at 9/11 conspiracies - How could anyone possibly have the ineptitude, the emotional ignorance, to suggest such an enormous crime could have been the fault of the state? I protested it. I detested it. I took every opportunity I had to denounce it.<br />
<br />
The population agreed – we went to war – everyone marched idealistically as our state marched literally.<br />
<br />
Was I right? How could I confirm it? Emotional fury blinded me. Why was it I had to reject the ideas of the conspirator, the revolutionary? Is it because the information was truly that questionable? Was it because I couldn’t understand thinking outside of the the governess I had identified with my entire life?<br />
<br />
We are able, to be sure, to comprehend the failures of the state – but only to scapegoats, not the entity – I associated Vietnam with Nixon, with Johnson, not the State. I associated 9/11 with Bin Laden, with Al Queda – Not the state. Even with these comprehensions, our discussion or investigation of these ideas are squandered – we can’t act or create change on these bizarre investigations.<br />
<br />
We can’t think, talk, or discuss it. We are isolated from freedom of the mind.<br />
<br />
My high school is a prison. There are bars on every window, on every door, cameras towering over the population. It is interesting – seeing as I live in a relatively middle class neighborhood. We are prisoners of war, prisoners of the state, of its ideas of education and its ideas of right and wrong. We are trapped perpetually in this mind state – we are subtly prevented from understanding faults of the hegemon, not from external understanding, but from mere investigation.<br />
<br />
We had zero intellectual discussions in debate last year. We were shunned – people refused to talk about what we said, refused to even acknowledge our theories, our philosophies. People said we couldn’t fit into a topic, that we were too crazy, that we were being lazy.<br />
<br />
I want to have a discussion. I want to have an intellectual traversal – of the fantasy, if you wish. Debate holds enormous power, yet we choose to ignore it. We are a short 4 months away from the last topic – what has changed? Few have expanded their viewpoints of poverty, fewer have made any change, and little to none have done anything to try and expand the activity.<br />
<br />
We are militarized in debate. We are tools who use a set of rules to expand false and hollow ideologies that then inhibit every original thought. We use philosophical movements, ideologies as tools to win a game, rather than to create change. We eliminate actual change in exchange for status quo of debate – a hollow, shallow excuse for actual free discussion. We exclude people on the basis of the conservativeness of their arguments. We critique people on their aptitude to memorize pointless debate strategy, to silly theoretical justifications. How does this create anything new, move anything forward?<br />
<br />
Debate is shaped in the mind of the military, of militarization. In the opportunity in which we can truly problematize our individual connections to military, to international relations, we exclude and insist on objectivity and tick marks. Why can<span style="font-family: 궁서체;">’</span>t I have discussions.<br />
<br />
I want to have a discussion.<br />
<br />
How can I know what I am even missing?<br />

<strong><span class="cite">The creation of Fascism is organized in the social field, determined by each individual. It is not purely the fault of the state, or the individual, but the cooperative drive for neurotic control that creates this. In this sense, the ways fascism resonates in the social field is the most important determinate of war. It is not about the destination, but the journey. How we come to the conclusion of war and fascism is only as important as why any given individual would want to murder and plunder in a faraway land. Ignoring the desire for war causes fascism to continue unabated, creating an imperialism within all of us that replicates destructive tendencies - a form of self-denying desire that seeks to abolish itself, whether through incremental repression or, once it resonates into the totalitarian state, mass suicide and butchery – not only of humans, but of their knowledge itself </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="cite">Deleuze and Guattari 1980</span></strong> (A Thousand Plateaus 214-215)<br />
<br />
<br />
It is not...personal and collective.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>What does Fascism mean for us, more importantly, how does this relate to miliatristic debate? What is our advocacy?</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Instead of devoting ourselves to meaningless political statements that we will never actualize, we seek to do something absent in traditional policy debates. We intend to open up this debate space for an open discussion of the ways in which military occupation and fascism manifest themselves, and WHY it is that our neurotic desire for homogenous power has the capability to determine the outcome of all of our political and academic conquests. More importantly, we seek to deconstruct this manner of education at the place where subversion can occur: Debate.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span class="cite">We are interested in the ethical problematization of debating military occupation and demands for war and at the same time the militarization of debate. We open up the space to question why we allowed ourselves to become entrenched in fascist global capital and demand the obliteration of others. </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span class="cite">We would like to problematize military presence and occupation. We believe the journey which represents how we come to conclusions is paramount. </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span class="cite">Our advocacy is meaningful in that it challenges the dominant hegemonic order of the state and its ability to control both thought and action. We criticize a capital-S State – not necessarily the USFG, but the ideology of imperialism which seeks to expand centralized power at the expense of free spaces. Our affirmation of the minority identity of the Nomad is an echo of a larger struggle against the mechanisms of State Fascism. We are against divisions and articulations of place and order. We affirm instead a politics of continuation – of constantly seeking new political outlets and investigating their potential. In this sense, our affirmation is one which cannot be tied down or controlled – we move beyond the simple binary of beginning and ends and seek to explore the vast middle ground of infinite possibilities </span></strong><br />

<br />
<br />
In their dialogues....identity is undone.<br />
<br />
<strong><span class="cite">We must remove ourselves from institutions of power and the little desire inside to beg for its control. We should use this site of contestation as a beginning to struggle against fascism. Fascism is organized in the social field, determined by each individual. There is no transcendent point or monolithic being with eyes and a mouth and a chainsaw that single-handedly calls for us to destroy the oceans - at a very real level the state, energy, and the breath in my lungs all co-exist on a flat plane – in this sense political resistance can look any way at all. In this sense we cannot be dismissed as &quot;merely&quot; speaking, that the way we engage in debate has very real implications: even if we don't know what they are, even if only for us. Even if there is no one around to hear it, even if there are no Oil Barrens in this room, even if we are not actually making policy, even if this is JUST a debate round, it still has effects on us and on our life-world that have potential to be negative or blissfully joyous. </span></strong><br />

The 1ac is an appeal rooted in necessity and certainty. The affirmative engages this necessity for action through the lens of “Lack.” The Affirmative represents this process as a natural occurrence. The harms and solvency of the 1ac are not benevolent attempts at creating a better world. They are wounds inflicted in a reactionary drive for stasis. Lack is nothing but a product of the human intellect, it is produced and organized in order to maintain a certain political order. The truth is that existence knows nothing of lack and the goals that we choose to pursue are always just that: a far from innocent choice with political implications.<br />

<em>Time Narrative</em><br />
<br />
<em>Recently, a young woman named Aisha heard a knock on her door. When she answered, several men dragged her out of her home, out of town, and onto a nearby mountain. Her life was already going downhill – her family in law constantly abused her, beating her often to the point of near death. She had to make plans to leave – she pleaded to the Taliban for her life – she would have died otherwise. Flashlights trained on her, the men beat her to an inch of her life. They pulled out implements of horror, and began to forge their punishment for her. Aisha blacked out on the mountainside from a combination of blood loss and pain. She awoke several minutes later, no one around, completely alone. When she reached for her face, she felt bloody, unfamiliar ridges and creases woven with pain.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Aisha’s nose and ears had been severed by Taliban forces for attempting to escape pain.</em><br />
<br />
<em>It was Time Magazine who stumbled upon Aisha in July of last year – her eyes hollow, dead, personality absent.</em><br />
<br />
<em>When confronted with these images, however, Time magazine did not choose to respect her life, what had happened, and recount her story in reverence. Instead, her face became plastered on magazine after magazine, exposed on news outlets all over the world. The shock of her mangled face captivated American audiences all over the country. Time talked about the abusive Burqa, the veil, and lumped Aisha’s struggle with every other women in the Middle east together.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Even more devastating, this article wasn’t an expose for the Taliban or their actions – instead, inches below poor Aisha, a simple headline followed: “What Happens if We Leave Afghanistan”. – The article’s purpose was to convince Americans of our necessity – of not to give in to any Taliban concession. Obama almost immediately ordered troops surges in the region.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Time echoed this year what American policy makers such as George, Laura, Hillary, Barack, have been echoing for two decade: Look at how these women are being treated, this is why we need to invade, kill terrorists, drop bombs, and save this endangered population.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Inherency</em><br />
<br />
<em>1. Aisha’s story is horrifying, and probably proves the necessity of some balancing force in Afghanistan – but The United States has empirically justified its occupation of Afghanistan with the protection of Islamic women in primary view – this seemingly benevolent view is nothing more than a scapegoat in order to justify occupation and colonialization of countries – reinforcing to our government that these kind of actions are permissible. It not only does this, but hopelessly devalues and subjects unimaginable violence – making women tools for politics rather than actual human beings.</em><br />

<em><span class="underline">The infliction of violence against women’s bodies, in the form of assault, rape, and murder, is clearly the most visible manifestation of misogyny.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> To the extent that physical brutality ultimately threatens the very existence of the subjects on which it is imposed, we might plausibly say that physical violence against women is the most significant concern out of the various types of violence discussed in this article. <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Yet </span></span></span><span class="underline">the obviousness of physical violence should not lead us to think that violence against women is a theoretically or historically simplistic phenomenon</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Women in Afghanistan were most certainly the victims of terrible physical violence at the hands of the Taliban.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> At the same time, </span></em><em>we must take seriously the call from feminist international relations scholars to examine “the ways in which governments and the military use, and alter, prevail- ing discourses about gender to their own ends” (Whitworth 1994, 26). While U.S. expressions of concern for the well-being of Afghan women were indeed valuable for raising the profile of efforts to address the conditions for women in Afghanistan, we must turn a critical eye toward the appropriation of feminism to justify U.S. military intervention.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Tickner has observed that </span>military violence between nation-states is always legitimized by some instantiation of “[t]he concept of the ‘protected’” (2001, 57). In other words, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the military pursuit of geopolitical security necessarily involves a specification</span> and definition of the object, persons, or ideas that are being secured.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Following the incredible devastation caused by the attacks on 9/11, one might logically expect that the physical safety of U.S. bodies would be the primary security concern in U.S. public discourse, and in fact it was. </span>The sudden <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">upsurge in</span> public <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">discourse about the gendered oppression of Afghan women</span> after 9/11, however, reveals that an enormous amount of governmental and media effort was <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">expended in reframing U.S. military intervention as the securing of Afghan women from the ravages of the Taliban</span>. It is not enough to argue that these representations of Afghan women were simply part of a propaganda campaign to justify U.S. military action, as the oppression of and violence against Afghan women was a demonstrable material fact. The more important question to ask is: how does one trace the ideological and material consequences of such representations? The oppression of women in foreign lands has often been a discursive tool of statecraft seeking to justify military intervention. As Moghissi notes, issues of women’s rights have long been “used ideologically to isolate and contain adversaries of great powers”<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (1999, 4). Representations of women’s oppression have fit particularly well into patriarchal social mythologies whose own devaluation of women has been cloaked in terms of a need to “protect” women from the harshness of certain jobs or political responsibilities. </span>In such social myths, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">women are characterized</span> primarily <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">as victims in need of saving</span> by the paternalistic masculinity of patriarchal social or governmental institutions. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This formula extends to the realm of international relations,</span> where “the heroic, just warrior is sometimes contrasted with a malignant, often racialized, masculinity attributed to the enemy”<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (Tickner 2001, 57</span>). Following 9/11, it was not only the Taliban as supporters of terrorism, but also the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Taliban as oppressors of women, that defined our enemy in the “war on terrorism</span>.” In the U.S. government’s appropriation of the feminist concern with women’s oppression, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">U.S. military action became “just” in part as the agency of Afghan women’s liberation</span>. The U.S. government and media made substantial use of “the maltreatment of women and their exotic attire” to represent the “moral, cultural and political deficiencies of the Islamic world”<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> as part of the warrant behind the 1991 Gulf War (Moghissi 1999, 37). </span>More recently, gender oppression under the Taliban became a justification for U.S. military intervention to topple the oppressive regime.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> In a televised address to Congress on 20 September 2001, George W. Bush identified the Taliban prohibition on education for women as part of the background for his demand that the Taliban give up the al Qaeda members hiding in Afghanistan G. Bush 2001). Significantly, the succor of Afghan women was not going to be achieved in any way by the fulfillment of Bush’s demands; at that moment of history, the Taliban’s compliance would have left gendered oppression in Afghanistan intact because surrendering bin Laden would have kept the same regime in power<span style="border: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0in;">. </span></span>The representation of women’s oppression was employed partly to demonize the Taliban and to prepare the U.S. public (and the world) for the air strikes that began on 7 October 2001.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> It is beyond the scope of this article to evaluate comprehensively the justification for air strikes against Taliban targets, and it cannot be claimed that representations of burqa-clad Afghan women were responsible for the U.S. decision to attack the Taliban, since the air strikes began before the majority of discourse about the burqa appeared in U.S. media. However, the epistemic violence done by eliding the agency of Afghan women in their representation only as passive victims played a crucial role in justifying the particular forms of military action taken, even after the fact. </span>Because U.S. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">discourses about Afghan women suggested that they could not “save” themselves</span>, “liberation” had to come from the outside.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> While the sheer number of these portrayals makes an exhaustive analysis impractical, one particularly well-publicized event provides an explicit illustration of the appropriation of feminist struggles against gender oppression in the service of the war on terrorism. Laura Bush’s delivery of the president’s “Weekly Radio Address” on 17 November 2001 was the first time that entire address had been delivered by a first lady. The forum of this particular speech is, of course, itself significant; speaking what is normally the president’s address, Laura Bush effectively became the voice of the U.S. government on the subject of women’s oppression in Afghanistan, far beyond the authority she already carried as first lady. Moreover, the fact that she is a woman was undoubtedly the reason that she, rather than President Bush, delivered this speech on this topic; White House strategists likely assumed that audiences would be more apt to identify with a woman speaking on “women’s issues.” Although President Bush also routinely referenced Afghan women’s oppression, Laura Bush’s position as a woman implies that her discourse should be the discourse of every woman concerned about sexist oppression (and every man interested in “saving” women in need of rescue). Finally, Laura Bush’s delivery of this address makes convenient use of the stereotype of women as nonviolent in contrast to male aggressiveness; the call for military action becomes more persuasive because, when a woman advocates violence, supposedly there must be no other recourse. This radio address is peculiar, however, in that it locates the cause of Afghan women’s oppression not only in the rule of the Taliban, but more specifically in the threat of terrorism, and al Qaeda in particular. According to Laura Bush, “[t]he fight against terrorism is also a fight for the rights and dignity of women” (L. Bush 2001). Although the Taliban regime codified in law the obligatory burqa as well as the vast array of brutal punishments inflicted upon women, Laura Bush repeatedly attributed the oppression of women directly to “terrorists” and al Qaeda. For example, she described “the brutality against women and children by the al Qaeda terrorist network and the regime it supports in Afghanistan, the Taliban” (L. Bush 2001). In this instance, not only is al Qaeda the agent of Afghan women’s oppression, but al Qaeda is also cast as the agency behind the Taliban’s political rule. Although the Taliban clearly provided shelter and aid to the terrorist organization, to imply that al Qaeda was the primary force behind the Taliban’s rule would be a gross misinterpretation of avail- able evidence. Furthermore, if responsibility for the oppression of women in Afghanistan can be laid at the feet of al Qaeda because of the mutually supportive relationship between al Qaeda and the Taliban, surely the past U.S. support for the Taliban during its proposed pipeline deal with Unocal and cold war assistance to the Mujahadeen (from which both al Qaeda and the Taliban sprang) makes the United States partly culpable as well (Abu-Lughod 2002, 787). </span>The historical amnesia regarding U.S. complicity with the Taliban prior to 9/11 reveals the <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">ideological work pursued in Laura Bush’s radio address and the </span>need for feminist international rela- tions criticism attentive to neocolonial ambitions as a component of the oppression of third-world women. Laura Bush’s location of the source of Afghan women’s oppression in “the terrorists” provides ample evidence that the strategic goal behind this address was the legitimization of U.S. military intervention in Afghanistan, not the protection of Afghan women.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Laura Bush repeatedly identi- fied “the terrorists and the Taliban” as the oppressors of Afghan women. Even the grammar of her discourse placed “the terrorists” before the Taliban, as if to imply that the conditions imposed upon Afghan women were primarily designed by al Qaeda. At one point in the address, Laura Bush’s desire to attribute gender oppression to al Qaeda reached almost absurd proportions, when she claimed that “[t]he brutal oppression of women is a central goal of the terrorists” (L. Bush 2001). While such an assertion begs the question, “Then why attack the World Trade Center?,” </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">t</span>he falsehood provides a convenient scapegoat whose “sacrifice” by the U.S. military is thus legitimized.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> The determination to emphasize terrorist misogyny was certainly not limited to Laura Bush. Barbara Walters, in a 20/20 story on the oppression of Afghan women, closed with a non sequitur reminding the audience that “the lead hijacker in the World Trade Center attack” had penned a will in which he disallowed women from attending his funeral (“Revolutionary Afghan Women’s Association Explains” 2001). While the hijackers clearly were of like minds with the Taliban regarding the status of women in society, the equation of al Qaeda and misogyny seems to have more to do with the rhetorical vilification of the terrorists than it does with analytical perspicuity. </span></em><br />

<br />
<em>Thus Harry and I advocate the following: That The United States Federal Government should withdraw and end all discourse concerning the rights of Afghan women in respect to its justification for military presence in Afghanistan, especially in the context of framing any enemies of the state.</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>It is essential that we realize that the ending of this discourse does not mean the end of recognizing or fixing the obvious feminine disaster in Afghanistan, but instead recognize that framing it in the context of a militaristic, realist perspective only dooms these catastrophes to be used as bait for realpolitiks.</em><br />
<br />
<em>In addition to this, it is necessary to understand that our discourse matters the most – the battle for an equal understanding and recognition of all women begins here.</em><br />

<em><span style="margin-left: .5in;"><span class="underline">Postcolonial feminists have long recognized that paternalistic Western representations of third world women in need of saving by white Europeans are not benign</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (Mohanty 1991b, 72). Although the West’s appropriation and construction of the third-world Muslim woman is not a new phenomenon</span></span>, in the aftermath of 9/11 the circulation of images of veiled females reached epic proportions.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> U.S. media quickly capitalized on the veil as a visual and linguistic signifier of Afghan women’s oppression</span>. Burqa-clad figures, potent political symbols of the “evil” of the Taliban, were suddenly everywhere<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. </span>Our intent is neither to support nor repudiate Islamic covering practices. Rather, we argue that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">U.S. discourses homogenize an extraordinarily diverse population of Muslim women</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Noticeably rare in the U.S. construction of the Afghan woman is an explication of the origins, variety, and underlying meanings of these practices that have shifted across historically specific cultural contexts (Mohanty 1991b, 67; Mojab 1998, 21). Although an exhaustive description of covering practices would be impossible, a brief foray into their variety will help to highlight the false homogeneity of U.S. representations. Contrary to popular misconcep- tions, these cultural practices originated prior to the rise of Islam (Ahmed 1992, 5).4 </span>The monolithic image of the Taliban-imposed burqa is also just one among many covering “styles,” a phrase that seems oxymoronic in light of the often homogenous portrayal of Islam in Western media<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (Abu-Lughod 2002, 786). </span>Meanings of oppression are certainly not intrinsic to Islamic covering practices but are socially constructed through discourse. <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Covering has functioned in a multiplicity of ways throughout time. For example, its use as an expression of agency (e.g., in the resistance movements against secular governments in Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, and Iran) has been elided by Western media (Mojab 1998, 20). In some Middle Eastern countries, covering signifies the initiation of women into fundamentalist resistance movements (Franks 2000, 919). During the 1979 revolution, middle-class Iranian women “veiled themselves” as a symbol of protest against the Shah and “Western cultural colonization,” or as a means of expressing their solidarity with working-class women (Mohanty 1991b, 67). </span>Post-9/11 archetypal representations of oppressed burqa-clad women often ignore its utilization by Afghan feminists. The burqa provided an effective cover for smuggling books and supplies to a network of under- ground schools, cameras for documenting Taliban abuses, and women fleeing persecution<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (Kensinger 2003, 7).5 Some feminists have vehemently challenged the idea that these practices can be “empowering” (e.g., Moghissi 1999, 42–7). However, as Mohanty remarks, </span>“[t]o assume that the mere practice of veiling women in a number of Muslim countries indicates the universal oppression of women through sexual segregation not only is analytically reductive, but also proves quite useless when it comes to the elaboration of oppositional political strategy”<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (1991b, 67). The consequences of such analytical reductionism are not merely theo- retical; </span>homogenization of Muslim covering practices partakes in exactly the paternalistic logic that underlies the neocolonial politics of U.S. efforts to “liberate” Afghan women according to an explicitly Western model of liberal feminism.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> The U.S. appropriation of the burqa after 9/11 is reminiscent of depictions of women in colonial territories, and colonial discourses provide helpful analogues for the present analysis. For example, Spivak provides a rigorous critique of the paternalistic feminism that informed the British colonial ban on sati in India (1999, 285–7). In British accounts of this prac- tice, in which a widow would immolate herself on her husband’s funeral pyre, the voice of women who practiced sati was always absent (287). As Spivak remarks, </span>“[t]he agency was always male; the woman was always the victim”<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (298). In other cases, </span>Western discourses displayed a sexualized Orientalism without any explicit interest in alleviating women’s oppres- sion <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(see Said 1979). French colonial postcards of Algerian women during the early 1900s, for instance, systematically distorted Muslim women, producing rather than reflecting reality in a bizarre amalgam of “eroticism and exoticism” for their European audience (Schick 1990, 350). French and British colonists focused on veiling in particular as the over- arching symbol of the “degradation of women” and “the backwardness of Islam” (Ahmed 1992, 152). It was against this historical context that Ahmed coined the term “colonial feminism” to describe feminism “used against other cultures in the service of colonialism” (151). For example, in Egypt, Lord Cromer championed the cause of unveiling women, claiming the veil was constraining their “mental and moral development” (153). The colonial impulse behind Cromer’s concern for Egyptian women becomes more obvious when his “feminist” sentiments are juxtaposed to the hypocrisy of his position as a founding member and president of the Men’s League for Opposing Women’s Suffrage. In Algeria, French generals bused village women into Algiers for a carefully choreographed unveil- ing by French women as evidence of indigenous support for the French occupation (Lazreg 1994, 135). </span>Whether in the context of covering or uncovering, collapsing differences among Muslim women<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> through the use of the burqa as a generalized symbol of female oppression </span>performs a colonizing <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">function</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Under such assignment, women’s status as objects remains fixed since they are denied the power to speak of differences, their placement in the existing first/third-world imperialistic order secured <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(Mohanty 1991b, 73</span>). In contemporary U.S., as in European colonial, discourses, “[t]<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">he domesticated, subjugated, unenlightened Other as opposed to the liberated, independent and enlightened Western self was used as a moral prop to legitimize colonial power relations</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">” (Moghissi 1999, 15; see also Mohanty 1991b, 74). According to Mavis Leno, chair of the Feminist Majority Foundation campaign for women in Afghanistan, before the rise of the Taliban, women “lived an Islamic version of a contemporary American woman’s life” and “[t]hey dressed as they wished” (“Mavis Leno” 2001<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">). </span></span>The U.S. woman was thus cast as an ideal to which Afghan women could aspire as a result of their “liberation.”<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Although the variations in the plethora of news reports flooding print, broadcast, and internet media make an exhaustive catalogue impossible, </span>three rhetorical patterns can be discerned in the following examples that are illustrative of the epistemic violence inflicted by certain U.S. discourses about Islam, Afghan women<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">, and the burqa. These rhetorical patterns include the demonization of the burqa, the homogenization of Islam, and the fetishization of “unveiling.” First, many U.S. discourses demonize or deride the burqa itself, rather than the garment’s imposition by the Taliban, and in so doing unwittingly obliterate vital aspects of feminist agency for Afghan women. For example, a Time magazine article entitled “About Face” featured photographs of nameless women wearing the ubiquitous burqa, “to Western eyes a kind of body bag for the living” (Lacayo 2001, 36). In an exposé on refugee camps in Pakistan sponsored by the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), Barbara Walters contrasted the freedom in the camp with the “dehumanizing veil” mandated by the Taliban (“Revolu- tionary Afghan Women’s Association Explains” 2001). While the Taliban’s enforcement of the burqa and the punishments for noncompliance were clearly destructive of Afghan women’s agency, the phrasing of the above excerpts makes clear that it is the burqa itself that is to be considered sub-human. By vilifying the burqa, such representations offer no possibil- ity for women to choose to wear it out of personal preference or cultural tradition. In some cases, the dehumanization of Afghan women was quite explicit as journalists referred to burqa-clad women as “ghosts” (Ozernoy 2001, 30; Roane and Ozernoy 2001, 22). Significantly, the term “ghost” defines Afghan women wearing the burqa, not the Taliban’s abuses. To the extent that this representation is accepted as valid by reading audiences, </span>Afghan women could never exercise agency in the form of a choice to adopt the burqa and remain human. <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Another article in Time, laudably providing brief descriptions of the diversity of Muslim covering practices (e.g., chador, niqab, hijab, burqa), carried the title “Headgear 101” (Song 2001, 31). The problem lies in the derisive simplification of the complex cultural dynamics of covering practices as “headgear.” </span>The neocolonial assumptions underlying this seemingly innocuous language choice in the title become more obvious when one compares the apparent acceptability of the title when applied to Muslim covering practices to the unlikelihood that widows’ veils or the Papal miter would be dubbed “headgear” <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">by U.S. journalists. A similar tone of derision can be discerned in the description of the burqa, worn by choice by a woman in Kabul after the fall of the Taliban, as a “costume” (Gibbs 2001, 39). In all of the examples above, the overt vilification or subtle mockery of the burqa becomes a rhetorical technique whereby U.S. discourses inflict epistemic violence on Afghan women by denying the very possibility for agency through the choice of dress, ostensibly the cause at issue with these representations in the first place. Second, </span>the distinction between “liberated” U.S. women and “unenlightened” Afghan women is often amplified by ethnocentric criticisms of a homogenized Islam<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. For example, one Time article entitled “The Women of Islam” implied that the oppressions it described in some countries are intrinsic to Islam, a notion emphasized by the subtitle “nowhere in the Muslim world are women treated as equals” (Beyer 2001, 50). Here, despite the article’s overt attempt to describe the diversity of Islamic practices among Malaysia, Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Kashmir, there is still a discursive commitment to the religious and geographic homogeneity of Islam in the language of a “Muslim world.” The infinite differences among these countries melt away as they become fixed in the space of a separate Islamic “world” to which they are assigned</span>.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> At the same time, the religious diversity within each of the countries named in the article vanishes as the label of Islam comes to exhaust the meaning of religion under those signifiers.6 </span>The ethnocentrism inherent in the idea of a “Muslim world” can be discerned when one contemplates the likely outcry that would follow the identification of Euro-America as a “Christian world.” The neocolonial notion of Islam as a marginal Other to the West is particularly evident in the fact that “the women of Islam” are all portrayed as Middle Eastern or Asian, despite the enormous and growing Muslim population in North America and Europe.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Once again, the signifier “Islam” undergoes an Orientalist transformation into one pole of a binary opposition, the signified “non-Western.” Third, the</span> fetishization<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> of “unveiling” </span>so pervades many U.S. accounts of Afghan women’s oppression that it has come to serve as its own complex rhetorical trope<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Loretta Kensinger notes how a wide range of news media in the United States not only used the image of the burqa when representing Afghanistan, but also “celebrated the veil’s lifting as the U.S. bombs fell” (2003, 15). The cover of the 3 December 2001 issue of Time featured the picture of a woman wearing a simple headscarf; the headline reads, “Lifting the Veil.” An article in Newsweek acknowledged that many Afghan women were still wearing the burqa after the fall of the Taliban but suggested they were “waiting [to unveil]” to see whether victorious Northern Alliance forces were “serious about women’s libera- tion” (Liu 2001, 46). While freedom from imposed covering is obviously an imperative right for Afghan women, these representations once again vilify the burqa itself and thereby elide the agency of women who might choose various forms of covering practices. Worse, the Newsweek article attributes the agency for liberation solely to the (male) Northern Alliance fighters while Afghan women await their approval. Other accounts of “unveiling” objectify Afghan women with less than subtle sexual figurations. In a story on women living under the Taliban regime, Tom Brokaw enticed viewers by explaining that this story would provide “a rare look behind the veil” (“Life of Women” 2001). The 60 Minutes II segment entitled “Unveiled” promised that the viewer would meet young Afghan women who “unveil more than just their faces” (“Unveiled” 2001). This last instance is particularly noteworthy as an example of how many of these seeming celebrations of the liberation of Afghan women from the burqa implicitly rely on the voyeuristic Orientalism of a promise to uncover women’s bodies. </span>The common theme running throughout this trope of “unveiling” is the reduction of Afghan women’s agency to their conformity to popular U.S. notions of feminist liberation. To erase the diverse and contextually specific experience of Afghan women regarding covering practices inflicts epistemic violence by devaluing them as subjects<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;"> (</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Spivak 1999, 291; Mohanty 1991b, 71<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">). </span></span>U.S. representations of Afghan women only or primarily as objects victimized by (even the Taliban’s) male agency ineluctably reduce knowledge of these women to their status as victims. This discursive elision of varied indigenous practices and the knowledge regarding their contextual values can only be described as a “violent” imposition on Afghan women’s subjectivity. As demonstrated above, the subjectivity of Afghan women—and third-world women in general—is not exhausted by their victimization in patriarchal and misogynist contexts. <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Some discourses about the burqa, however, ironically parallel the violence of sati by performing a metaphorical burning of the subaltern subject in neocolonialist expressions of U.S. feminism. The violence wrought by the rhetoric of the veil is not, however, limited to epistemological registers.</span></em><br />

<em>2. Resisting this form of hidden domination is a Decision Rule: It’s Role in the Death and Destruction of the Vast Majority of the Planet Requires its Rejections.</em><br />
<em><span class="Author-Date">Shaikh</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">, </span>200<span class="Author-Date">7<span style="font-weight: normal;">,</span></span> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; font-weight: normal;">(Nermeen, Asia Source, </span></em>Development<em><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; font-weight: normal;"> 50, “Interrogating Charity and the Benevolence of Empire,” palgrave-journals) </span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">It would probably be incorrect to assume that the principal impulse behind the imperial conquests of the 18th and 19th centuries was charity. Having conquered large parts of Africa and Asia for reasons other than goodwill, however, countries like England and France eventually did evince more benevolent aspirations; the civilizing mission itself was an act of goodwill. As Anatol Lieven (2007) points out<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, </span></span></em><em>even 'the most ghastly<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> European </span>colonial project <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">of all, King Leopold of Belgium's conquest of the Congo, </span>professed benevolent goals<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">:</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Belgian propaganda was all about bringing progress, railways and peace, and of course, ending slavery'. Whether or not there was a general agreement about what exactly it meant to be civilized, </span>it is likely that there was a<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> unanimous </span>belief that being civilized was better than being uncivilized<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> – morally, of course, but also in <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">terms of what would enable the most in human life </span></span>and potential. But what did the teaching of this civility entail, and what were some of the consequences of changes brought about by this benevolent intervention? In the realm of education, the spread of reason and the hierarchies created between different ways of knowing had at least one (no doubt unintended) effect. As Thomas Macaulay (1935) wrote in his famous Minute on Indian Education, We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population. This meant, minimally, that English (and other colonial languages elsewhere) became the language of instruction, explicitly creating a hierarchy between the vernacular languages and the colonial one. More than that, it meant instructing an elite class to learn and internalize the culture – in the most expansive sense of the term – of the colonizing country, the methodical acculturation of the local population through education. As Macaulay makes it clear, not only did the hierarchy exist at the level of language, it also affected 'taste, opinions, morals and intellect' – all essential ingredients of the civilizing process. </span>Although<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">, as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak points out, </span>colonialism can always be interpreted as an 'enabling violation', it remains a violation: the systematic eradication of ways of <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">thinking, speaking, </span>and being<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Pursuing this line of thought, </span>Spivak has <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">elsewhere </span>drawn a parallel to a healthy child born of rape. The child is born<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">, the English language disseminated (the enablement</span>), and yet the rape, colonialism <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(the violation), </span>remains reprehensible. <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">And, like the child, </span>its effects linger. The enablement cannot be advanced, therefore, as a justification of the violation<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Even as vernacular languages, and all habits of mind and being associated with them, were denigrated or eradicated, some of the native population was taught a hegemonic – and foreign – language (English) (Spivak, 1999). Is it important to consider whether we will ever be able to hear – whether we should not hear – from the peoples whose languages and cultures were lost? The colonial legacy At the political and administrative levels, the governing structures colonial imperialists established in the colonies, many of which survive more or less intact, continue, in numerous cases, to have devastating consequences – even if largely unintended (though by no means always, given the venerable place of divide et impera in the arcana imperii). Mahmood Mamdani cites the banalization of political violence (between native and settler) in colonial Rwanda, together with the consolidation of ethnic identities in the wake of decolonization with the institution and maintenance of colonial forms of law and government. Belgian colonial administrators created extensive political and juridical distinctions between the Hutu and the Tutsi, whom they divided and named as two separate ethnic groups. These distinctions had concrete economic and legal implications: at the most basic level, ethnicity was marked on the identity cards the colonial authorities introduced and was used to distribute state resources. The violence of colonialism, Mamdani suggests, thus operated on two levels: on the one hand, there was the violence (determined by race) between the colonizer and the colonized; then, with the introduction of ethnic distinctions among the colonized population, with one group being designated indigenous (Hutu) and the other alien (Tutsi), the </span>violence between native and settler was institutionalized within the colonized population itself. The Rwandan genocide of 1994, which Mamdani suggests was a 'metaphor for postcolonial political violence' (2001: 11; 2007), needs therefore to be understood as a natives' genocide – akin to and enabled by colonial violence against the native, and by the new institutionalized forms of ethnic differentiation among the colonized population introduced by the colonial state. It is not necessary to elaborate this point; for present purposes, it is sufficient to mark the significance (and persistence) of the colonial antecedents to contemporary political violence<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> The genocide in Rwanda need not exclusively have been the consequence of colonial identity formation, but does appear less opaque when presented in the historical context of colonial violence and administrative practices. </span>Given the scale of the colonial intervention, good intentions should not become an excuse to overlook the unintended consequences<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> In this particular instance, rather than indulging fatuous theories about 'primordial' loyalties, the 'backwardness' of 'premodern' peoples, the African state as an aberration standing outside modernity, and so forth, </span>it makes more sense to situate the Rwandan genocide within the logic of colonialism,<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> which is of course not to advance reductive explanations but simply to historicize and contextualize contemporary events in the wake of such massive intervention. Comparable arguments have been made about the consolidation of Hindu and Muslim identities in colonial India, where the corresponding terms were 'native' Hindu and 'alien' Muslim (with particular focus on the nature and extent of the violence during the Partition) (Pandey, 1998), or the consolidation of Jewish and Arab identities in Palestine and the Mediterranean generally (Anidjar, 2003, 2007). </span></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">In addition to the vilification of al Qaeda, Laura Bush also sought to justify U.S. military action by explicitly identifying the U.S. invasion with the liberation of Afghan women. In the radio address, she declared that “[b]ecause of our recent military gains in much of Afghanistan, women are no longer imprisoned in their homes” (L. Bush 2001). </span>This assertion regarding the success of the U.S. military in increasing the security of Afghan women is especially pernicious. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Conditions for women in Afghanistan are little better, and in some cases have deteriorate</span>d, since the beginning of U.S. air strikes<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (Human Rights Watch 2003). </span>A recent report by RAWA states that suicide by Afghan women is much more frequent than under the Taliban’s rule<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (Rawi 2004). </span>The failure of military intervention to bring about security for Afghan women will likely come as little surprise to feminist international relations scholars. <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">The lack of public debate regarding civilian casualties following </span>the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan offers a telling example of the material consequences <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that follow from the realist emphasis on state security in contrast to feminist notions of individual security from physical, structural, and epistemic violence</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Some 1,300 Afghan civilians may have been killed directly by U.S. bombs and missiles. Even more significantly, estimates of “indirect victims” of U.S. military action who died as a consequence of the rigors of forced migration from their homes, the interruption of drought relief, and the upsurge in fighting between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance range from 3,000 to 7,000 (Conetta 2002). Of course, various media outlets and the U.S. government dispute these numbers. The U.S. government does not even track civilian casualties resulting from U.S. military action, ostensibly for reasons ranging from practicality to concerns about public opposition to “collateral damage.” </span>In fact, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the disinterest regarding civilian casualties reflects the philosophical framework of realpolitik under which U.S. foreign policy is conducted. Within political realism, civilian casualties do not need to be counted because they do not figure as variables in a geopolitical equation that privileges the security of the nation-state over individual security from violence.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> In stark contrast to Laura Bush’s sanguine confidence in the liberatory success of U.S. military intervention, a damning report by Human Rights Watch concluded that “[t]he situation today—widespread insecurity and human rights abuse—was not inevitable, nor was it the result of natural or unstoppable social or political forces in Afghanistan. It is, in large part, the result of decisions, acts, and omissions of the . . . [U.S.] government, the governments of other coalition members, and parts of the transitional Afghan government” (2003, 11). </span>To the extent <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that Western representations of</span> the burqa and oppressed <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Afghan women were successful in persuading public audiences to support uncritically U.S. intervention in Afghanistan</span>, the epistemic violence of such discourse wreaked physical violence on the bodies of Afghan women as well.</em><br />

<em>2. This sort of usage of women for politics means that the occupational interest is focused solely on using the image of women being saved – not the actual elevation of their rights.

<em>One of the most important advances in the history of feminism was the recognition of structural violence against women as a significant aspect of gender oppression. Structural violence includes the myriad material harms done to women through inadequate education and health care, exploitative employment conditions, endemic poverty, and other conditions that inflict damage on lives without the brute immediacy of physical violence<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. </span>The analysis of structural violence is vital because it accounts for disadvantages that shorten or degrade women’s lives and traces the sometimes convoluted causes to social, political, and economic structures. Rather than allowing these conditions to remain unexamined as a neutral part of the landscape, attention to <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">structural violence imputes agency, and hence responsibility, to social, political, and economic actors for the maintenance of structural conditions</span> that harm women. Women in Afghanistan were subjected to structural violence long before, as well as during, the Taliban regime<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Although the U.S. government certainly made use of representations of structural violence against Afghan women, </span>the epistemic violence done to Afghan women by the homogenized, neocolonial, and paternalistic rhetoric of the veil short- circuited any reflexive recognition of U.S. contributions to that self-same structural violence<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. As Abu-Lughod puts it, </span>framing the oppression of women in Afghanistan as a problem caused solely by the Taliban’s ruthless twisting of religion and culture “prevented the serious exploration of the roots and nature of human suffering in this part of the world” while “recreating an imaginative geography of West versus East, us versus Muslims”<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (2002, 784). Although argu<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a</span>bly performed by every decontextualized image of a burqa-shrouded Afghan woman, Laura Bush’s radio address exemplifies the erasure of history with the reduction of women’s struc- tural oppression in Afghanistan to “the central goal of the terrorists.” </span>To the extent that the Taliban, and even bin Laden himself, sprang from the U.S.-supported Mujahadeen, the absence of such history makes it possible to identify structural violence against Afghan women without achieving the reflexive recognition of U.S. complicity in maintaining those very structures<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. RAWA has noted, for instance, that in 2000 the United States gave $43 million to the Taliban for reducing opium production as part of the “war on drugs” (Rawi 2004). </span>The identification of U.S. complicity in structural violence against Afghan women does not deny the viciousness of the Taliban. As even reports critical of U.S. intervention in Afghanistan admit, there is a significant consensus among women in Afghanistan that life is better now than under the Taliban<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (Human Rights Watch 2003, 12). </span>To say that life is “better,” however, does not excuse one from pointing out that the actions of the new Afghan government, and especially the warlords and elements of the Northern Alliance supported by the United States, promise continued structural violence against women<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (11). Despite a few putative legal protections for women, the material experience of Afghan women continues to be one of profound insecurity (Rawi 2004). Ultimately, </span>U.S. discourses that associate gender oppression with covering practices while imputing all responsibility to the actions of the Taliban or al Qaeda mask the role of U.S. national security policies in perpetuating the insecurity of structural violence against women in Afghanistan.</em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">We close this essay by offering an alternative representation of cover- ing practices in Afghan society. </span>In contrast to the epistemic violence wrought by representations of burqa-clad Afghan women<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> on the Feminist Majority Foundation website, Kensinger describes the image of Meena Keshwar Kamal, founder of RAWA, on the latter organization’s website. Kamal’s image accompanies </span>a counter-hegemonic discourse that requires viewers to confront Afghanistan’s neocolonial cold war history with both the Soviet Union and the United States<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (Kensinger 2003, 8). The RAWA website also represents a far more effective call for the elimination of imposed covering. The RAWA argument contextualizes covering practices within and across cultures, noting that they are not unique to Afghanistan, Islam, or the third world. “[F]undamentalists” are identified as the root cause of the oppression of women. Through the use of inclusive language to explicate their position on “[t]he Islamic hejab (veil),” RAWA avoids the myopic fixation on the burqa, a particular regime, or geographic locale, as is characteristic of many U.S. representations of Afghan women (Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan n.d.). RAWA’s discourse thus opens up possibilities for transnational solidarity with women subjugated by diverse forms of “fundamentalism” independent of covering practices. </span>The criticism in this article should therefore not be read as a condemnation of U.S. interest in gender equality in Afghanistan, but as a call for support of the experience and knowledge of indigenous activists working toward this goal. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This reflexive alternative to uncritically speaking for others will be more productive when conducted as a collective enterprise with those others, “by which aspects of our location less obvious to us might be revealed”</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (Alcoff 1995, 112). Against the portrayal of Islamic women in the United States post- 9/11, RAWA’s website also accurately presents covering as a cultural, rather than religious, issue. When forcibly imposed, the burqa becomes a misogynistic instrument of terror designed to objectify women, relegating their social status to that of “chattel” by making them literally invisible in the Afghan public sphere. </span>Although a call is issued for “rejection of the veil as a symbolic form of resistance,” by recognizing and respecting the personal nature of individual women’s decisions regarding covering, the social meaning of such practices is acknowledged in a fashion that preserves the agency of Afghan women while challenging the structural power at work through imposed covering<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan n.d.). RAWA thus seeks to empower women through advocacy shaped by their shared experience of gender relations in Afghanistan (Brodsky 2003). The RAWA website also emphasizes the gendered Taliban policies that target men, “a subtlety that disrupts any inclination to see the situation as simply one of Afghan men against Afghan women” (Kensinger 2003, 12). Although men cannot become members, male supporters play a vital role in RAWA, recognizing that it is “not only a woman’s organization” (Brodsky 2003, 203). Philosophically and strategically, RAWA’s vision and ongoing practice are consciously grounded in the struggle for democracy for all Afghans (194). Because of the cultural constraints on Afghan wom- en’s mobility and participation in activities outside the home, the support of men is vital. As one RAWA member explains, “[w]e are not anti-male. We also can’t work without men” (193). Perhaps even more important than the elimination of the Taliban, raising the consciousness of Afghan men is one of the organization’s greatest achievements and essential to their long-term goals (218). RAWA’s activism, on multiple levels, thus avoids Spivak’s concern about Western discourses that position white men as “saving brown women from brown men” (1999, 284). </span>The reductive representations of burqa-clad <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Afghan women in U.S</span>. media and U.S. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">governmental discourse have inflicted their own sorts of violence—epistemic, physical, and structural—on the bodies of Afghan women</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">.</span> In addition to shedding light on the consequences of certain U.S. discourses that purport to rescue Afghan women from gender oppression, the analysis herein also demonstrates the need for a synthesis of materialist and poststructuralist approaches to feminist international relations theory. Critical attention to the material conditions experienced by women is necessary not only to identify the physical and structural violence inflicted on the bodies of women, but also to trace the diversity of women’s experience that is flattened <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">by</span> many <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Western fem</span>inist discourses about third-world women. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The insights of poststructuralism also demonstrate that the categories so often attributed to women are not essentially fixed</span>, yet are frequently positioned as such by the very language we use with the most altruistic intentions. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Both theoretical “poles” contribute to this analysis, and it is only by the refusal of both for the critical space in between that a more reflexive feminist praxis becomes possible</span></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">The insecurity of Afghan women, discursive and material, also reflects and inflects some rather long-running theoretical debates within feminism. </span>Disputes about the representation of race and class<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (or lack thereof) </span>in feminist politics, for example, fragmented numerous organizations and movements over the past several decades, just as theoretical debates about difference and essentialism have splintered feminist intellectuals<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. </span>The case of the U.S. appropriation of Afghan women<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> and the burqa </span>demonstrates the unsustainability of these theoretical divides.

<strong>Our Framework:</strong><br />
<br />
<em><strong>1. Our discourse not only needs to be evaluated first, but also defined as military presence – Material change and objects are defined by the way in which we speak about them – as such, our rhetorical framework for discourse is evaluated above any claims of physical presence can only be solidified by the discourse surrounding it</strong></em><br />

<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">This study begins with the premise that representation is an inherent and important aspect of global political life and therefore a critical and legitimate area of inquiry. International relations are inextricably bound up with discursive practices that put into circulation representations that are taken as &quot;truth.&quot; The goal of analyzing these practices is not to reveal essential truths that have been obscured, but rather to examine </span></em>how <em>certain representations underlie the production of knowledge and, identities and how these representations make various courses of action possible<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. As Said (1979: 21) notes, there is no such thing as a delivered presence, but there is </span></em>a re-presence, <em>or representation.</em> <em>Such an assertion does not deny the existence of the material world, but rather suggests that <strong>material objects and subjects are constituted as such within discourse</strong> .<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> So, for example, </span>when U.S. troops march into Grenada, this is certainly &quot;real,<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">&quot; though the march of troops across a piece of geographic space is in itself singularly uninteresting and socially irrelevant outside of the representations that produce meaning</span>. It is only when &quot;American&quot; is attached to the troops and &quot;Grenada&quot; to the geographic space that meaning is created. What the physical behavior itself is, though, is still far from certain until discursive practices constitute it as<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> an &quot;invasion,&quot; </span>a &quot;show of force<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">,&quot; a &quot;training exercise,&quot; a &quot;rescue,&quot; and so on. </span> <strong>What is &quot;really&quot; going on in such a situation is inextricably linked to the discourse within which it is located</strong> . To attempt a neat separation between discursive and nondiscursive practices, understanding the former as purely linguistic, assumes a series of dichotomies—thought/reality,<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> appearance/essence, mind/matter, word/world, </span>subjective/objective—that a critical genealogy calls into question<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Against this, the perspective taken here affirms the material and' performative character of discourse. 'In suggesting that global politics, and specifically the aspect that has to do with relations between the North and the South, is linked to representational practices I am suggesting that </span> <strong>the issues and concerns that constitute</strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; font-weight: normal;"> these </span> <strong>relations occur within a &quot;reality&quot; whose content has</strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; font-weight: normal;"> for the most part </span> <strong>been defined by</strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; font-weight: normal;"> the </span> <strong>representational practices</strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; font-weight: normal;"> of the “first world”. </span> <strong>Focusing on discursive practices enables one to examine how the processes that produce &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot; work and how they are articulated with the exercise of political, military, and economic power.</strong></em><br />

<em>2. You have an ethical obligation to evaluate women in this round – not only is it necessary to end our complicity in their struggle but also to prevent their doom and the doom of human rights under every abusive society</em><br />

<em>When the United States-led coalition invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, one of the myriad of justifications for the war<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (in addition to the de facto activation of the self-defense provisions of the UN Charter) </span>was the rationalization that it would liberate women from “the misogynistic rule of the Taliban<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">.”15 At least on its face, this rationale was carried through to the Bonn Process of December 2001, where an accord was signed by represen- tatives of the militia forces who fought with the United States-led coalition against the Taliban, representatives of the former King of Afghanistan, and representatives of various other exiled Afghani groups, as well as in the Afghan Constitution of 2004, which contains specific guarantees to protect women’s rights. </span>However, the litany of formal guarantees hides a far more depressing and sober reality. Key to understanding the fundamental lack of change and experience in the lives of women in Afghanistan is the measurement of what constitutes “security” in the new Afghanistan and the lack of accountability for previous violations experienced by women during the Taliban regime<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. While </span>the Taliban<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> have been replaced, </span>their internal successors are in part regional military factions (often with histories of systemic human rights violations and engagement in widespread criminal activity) and conservative religious leaders who fundamentally share similar illiberal views on the status and role of women in Afghani society.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> They have little political appetite for social reform</span>. In strategically supporting these elites, the external actors (specifically the United States and its allies) have in practice been prepared to accept widespread under-enforcement or non-enforcement of women’s rights (and their security)<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">16 because of the calculation that the maintenance of these key alliances outweighs the interests of any particular group in Afghani society, even those who offered a compelling text for inter- vention. Moreover, international actors are unable to acknowledge their own patriarchy as it informs their response to the marked gender discrimination and violence that they confront on the ground. </span>The Afghan example potently illustrates how the shape of transition for women is tremendously influenced by the role and stance of the international community. It also demonstrates the extent to which human rights violations experienced by women (in this case during a prior oppressive regime) can remain a continuous experience despite the claims of transition to the public political spaces in society. This suggests that we need to think more carefully about the interface between the broader international processes focused on naming human rights violations in conflicted and authoritarian societies, as they operate to frame the manner in which transitional account- ability is sought, and in particular to expand our concepts of violent action and social change within transitional societies.</em><br />

Reason to Prefer: Politics is skewed by the political insistence that Academia has no knowledge of political ideologies and praxis – because of this, Academics are almost always ignored. This has empirically led to disasterous political mistakes and the alienation of academia. In order to restore politics to a practice of making strategic enlightened decisions, the rejection of isolated policymakers is an obligation<br />
Logan, 2010 <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; font-weight: normal;">(Justin, Associate Director of Foreign Policy Studies at the Cato Institute and blogs for the Skeptics at The National Interest, Quoting Michael W. Mosser, Paul Bracken, Ronald Krebs, and Paul Yingling, “The Gap can’t be Bridged Unless Those in Power Want It to Be Bridged”, The National Interest, Published December 28, 2010, Accessed January 6, 2011) </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Skeptics readers may have interest in a symposium in the current issue of Perspectives on Politics on Michael W. Mosser’s article [paywalled] addressing “the alleged disconnect between academics and military practitioners.” Mosser writes that </span>The conventional wisdom is powerful and the idea, if not the reality, of a gap [between scholars and policy practitioners] is pervasive<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Scholars and practitioners—more the former than the latter—have long decried the growing fissure between theory (the academic world) and praxis (the policy world), but it seems to have taken on a new sense of urgency in recent years. […] In the halls of both academic and government buildings, the stories of the gap are legion. </span> Practitioners speak of misguided academics and armchair generals criticizing the creation of strategy and the conduct of operations from the safety of their universities.<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;"> Moreover, and at a more fundamental level, </span> practitioners are frustrated that academics just don’t seem to “get” the policy world. Conversely, academics bemoan the fact that practitioners often fail to fully think through the problems they claim need to be solved<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. If they did, many scholars argue, they would understand that the “solution” to a “problem” either becomes a part of the problem itself, or creates a whole new set of problems. His conclusion is one that has been voiced frequently before<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">: </span></span> the academic community should not punish scholars who choose to pursue fellowship or short-term research opportunities with the military or government service. Such work<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">, especially in disciplines such as political science, international relations, or the other social sciences</span>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">provides invaluable real-world empirical</span> (dis)confirmation of academic theories, and gives the scholar a large body of work to draw from upon returning to the academy. Works published in journals that appeal more to practitioners than to the academic community should be given greater credence in tenure decisions, and ideas that actually get translated into policy should not be the academic equivalent of a scarlet letter. Finally, the entire academic community needs to understand that the relationship between theory and praxis is not automatically a detrimental one<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. While the value of establishing a bridge should not be underestimated, and the effort wholly encouraged, the bridge-building needs to take place beyond policy schools. To have lasting value, the university system needs to value the interaction. The editors of the journal solicited a number of responses, but I wanted to highlight a few points from a few of them that I thought particularly pointed. First, Paul Bracken predicts that the threat environment facing the United States is likely to get worse in the coming years, and this will bring scholars back into vogue in Washington. In the future, Bracken writes, [t]he contributions of academics may even be decisive, as they have been in the past. It should be noted that unlike the World War II and the Cold War periods, </span>the academy had little or no role in the debate about America’s response to 9/11. The decision to invade and occupy two Muslim countries, and to declare a “global war on terror,”<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> came from inside the beltway, the loose association of the Pentagon, the intelligence community, Washington think tanks, Congressional staffers, and contractors</span>. This suggests an important aspect of academic involvement in the security debate. Staying out of it doesn’t lead to improvement<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. It doesn’t, in particular, lead to a sweeping rejection of the whole national security ethos, as many academic critics wish. What academics often forget is that there is a competitive market of ideas. There’s an idea market, just like there is for everything else. You can pick and choose your own “content providers,” on the Washington idea circuit, just as you can in a media company. What’s taken place in recent years is an increased concentration of the idea market for foreign and defense affairs to the Washington, DC area. Bracken worries about the low median quality of the thinking that comes out of the Washington foreign-policy elite, but thinks its days are numbered: My view is that several factors are now converging to increase the academic contribution to national security and international order. While there should be concerns about how close academia gets to power, there are other, equally valid concerns as outlined in the cases already discussed. Pulling out of the debate, drawing up the moat, isn’t going to make things better. </span>A <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“withdrawal strategy” for academia will only make things worse. It leaves the field open to others who are only too happy to shape the public debate. There is already too much content that comes unfiltered from inside the Washington beltway. A kind of auto-stimulation occurs.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Yes, there are sharp political and policy differences among those inside the beltway. I’m not saying that there is homogeneity. But the basic frameworks used in the debate are pretty much the same. The debate is self-referential, as people square off each other in one conference after another, oblivious to larger considerations. I’ve attended meetings where panelists advocate attacking Iran to disarm her, and in the next breath say that we also might have to move in to Pakistan to protect the nuclear weapons if things fall apart there. When I point out that this means the US Army occupying four Islamic countries simultaneously, I get a quizzical look as if I don’t understand how the policy process works. Perhaps I don’t. But to quote David Brooks, there’s not much thinking going on in the think tanks nowadays. There are myriad reasons for this. But the point I emphasize here is that this creates an opportunity for academia to enter the debate. If we don’t, others will… Finally, the responses from Ronald Krebs and Paul Yingling do what I think has been needed for a long time: They pin the blame on </span>an insular, narcissistic, and self-serving foreign policy elite in Washington who have failed to heed the warnings that have been offered by an academic elite that has perennially tried to intervene in policy discussions without getting a hearing.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Krebs: It is revealing that the changes Mosser calls for rest largely, if not entirely, with the academy. “Ideas that actually get translated into policy should not be the academic equivalent of a scarlet letter,” he writes; “the academic community should not punish scholars who choose to pursue fellowship or short-term research opportunities with the military or government service.” At least in the field of international relations, however, the charge has little validity. Just look at the list of past Council on Foreign Relations International Affairs Fellows; many former fellows are at the top of the discipline, in the very best departments. More importantly, some of Mosser’s proposals would degrade the quality of scholarship. He suggests that “works published in journals that appeal more to practitioners than to the academic community should be given greater credence in tenure decisions.” </span> This is hardly objectionable—except for the fact that I cannot think of a single journal of international affairs or security or even strategic studies that has a substantial policy-community readership that operates on the basis of peer review<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Peer review certainly has its problems, but it is, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, the worst of all systems for ensuring scholarly quality—except for all the others. […] Michael Mosser and many others are deeply concerned that the modern academy has rendered itself irrelevant to the concerns of the state<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. </span></span> They presume that the fault lies with scholars. There is some truth to that. But it is also true that an often short-sighted policymaking apparatus sees itself as having little interest in hearing alternative voices. In the wake of the series of disastrous foreign policy decisions of the last ten years, in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world since September 2001, perhaps it is the state—not the academy—that needs to change.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Yingling really sticks the knife in, and twists: America’s elites are indeed thinking critically, using the same thought processes, and pursuing the same end—personal or parochial advantage. The question they are concerned with is how to gain tenure, promotion, power, or wealth, and their actions are optimally designed to achieve these ends. Those elites who mismanage their institutions and betray their obligations do so for much the same reason that Willie Sutton robbed banks. America’s institutions too often reward elite behaviors that are contrary to the public interest, so it’s little surprise that such behaviors are so prevalent. It’s not that American elites are somehow uniquely evil, but rather that they are all too human. They are merely responding to the incentive structures under which they live. Given incentives that reward self-seeking behavior, examples of social responsibility among elites are all the more impressive. Nonetheless, every major institutional failure in recent memory has been accompanied by a corresponding warning from a handful of elites acting in the public interest. Prior to the war in Iraq, 33 international relations scholars published an advertisement in the New York Times arguing that “war with Iraq is not in America’s national interest.” [.pdf] Many of their warnings proved prophetic, including the absence of an exit strategy and the diversion of resources away from the struggle against al-Qaeda. Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Army Chief of Staff General Eric Shinsecki [sic] predicted that stabilizing Iraq would require “several hundred thousand” troops. However, the scholars were ignored and the general was pilloried; their outspokenness was as impressive as it was futile. </span> Society benefits when elites ask hard questions, think critically about important issues, speak truth to power, and accept responsibility for the results they produce. The challenge, then, is to create institutional arrangements that reward such behavior<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Great enterprises require ordinary people to take risks and make sacrifices that benefit not only themselves, but society as a whole. Doing so is an act of faith and an expression of trust in the institutions intended to safeguard society and its members. No society can achieve anything of consequence in the absence of such trust. Trust cannot be earned by words alone; only those who place something of themselves at risk have the credibility to ask others to do likewise. People will not trust empty suits, whether those suits have patches on their elbows or medals on their chests. Therefore, restoring and maintaining popular trust in important institutions is a challenge worthy of our best minds—in academia, the military, politics, and business. Stephen Walt, Joseph Nye, and other</span> academics have been quick to turn the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">blame on the academy for being too insular, too theoretical, and too methodologically challenging to be of any interest to policymakers</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">. As a self-hating Washingtonian, let me say that </span> this is backward. First off, the idea that academic work is just too hard for busy DC policymakers to understand is a bizarre defense of the Beltway<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. We expect, rightly, Timothy Geithner to be up to speed on important work being published in the economics journals, and Antonin Scalia to be able to make his way through law review articles. I challenge the reader to leaf through the most prominent economics journals without finding challenging methodologies or the leading law reviews without finding elaborate theories. So why should the DC foreign policy establishment get a pass on IR scholarship because it’s too hard? Second, from talking to staffers on Capitol Hill and elsewhere</span>, policymakers are aware that academics differ significantly with their policy prescriptions—they simply don’t care. They believe that their insights are better, their stewardship of American power more responsible, and on and on. They know where they could find informed but differing voices. They simply don’t want to hear them.<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Accordingly, I was refreshed to see Krebs and Yingling, in particular, push back against the idea that the academy is to blame and the poor DC policy establishment is broad-minded and desiring outside advice. They aren’t.</span><br />

<u><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>Life as we know it is nothing more than expenditure of resources or knowledge constantly on the path towards nothing. We are always gaining knowledge, but its how we expend it that shapes reality in the future. Knowing the edges of expenditure is key to a sustainability; Bataille refers to this as good duality. Like Hitler did in World War II and what the United States is doing in the Middle East we have the tendency to engage in bad duality which is an overexceeding of expenditure. This culminates in the decision of the affirmative to try and save themselves in the name of good duality by “withdrawing” their military.</strong></span></u><br />

But he then goes on to add, about himself: “but he is no less foreign to all the presuppositions of vari- ous mysticisms, to which he opposes only the lucidity of self-consciousness” (italics Bataille’s).</u> <strong><span style="text-underline: thick;">So there is, then, what we might call a <span style="border: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0in;">good duality</span> in Bataille. In fact, the “accursed share” is itself, for want of a better term, doubled: it entails and <span style="border: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0in;">presupposes limits, dread, self-consciousness</span>, language (OC, 7: 596– 98), along with madness, “pure loss,” death</span></strong><u>. The accursed share, in other words, entails the duality of transgression, in anguish (l’angoisse), of the recognized and ultimately affirmed limits of self, body, and world. But the same thing could be said, again for want of a better term, of the various ways this “part” is diluted or betrayed: what we might call, to differentiate it,</u> <strong><span style="text-underline: thick;"> “<span style="border: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0in;">bad duality</span>” (in contradistinction to the “good” duality of the transgression, in angoisse, of the recognized limits of self, body, and world). “Bad duality,” as I crudely put it, <span style="border: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0in;">is the indulgence in expenditure</span> out of personal motives: to gain something for oneself (glory, social status) or for one’s social group or <span style="border: solid windowtext .75pt; padding: 0in;">nation (booty, territory, security</span>). From the chief who engages in potlatch, all the way to the modern military planners of nuclear war—all conceive of a brilliant, radical destruction of things as a useful contribution: to one’s own social standing, to the position or long- term survival of one’s own society</span></strong><u>.</u><br />
<br />
<u><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>Bataille realizes the distinction between the old heroic wars of the past and modern warefare of today. In places like Afghanistan and Korea we no longer go to war to gain knowledge to expend, but rather to go to war for divine political realization; inevitably exceeding our limits into bad duality. If our modern political frameworks do not realize this, international relations is doomed to end with destruction.</strong></span></u><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>Stoekl 07(</strong>Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University,</span> “<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”,2007,pg 54-55)</span></u><br />
<u>And yet, for all that,</u> <strong><span style="text-underline: thick;">Bataille recognizes a kind of devolution in war- fare: earlier (sacrificial) war and destructive gift-giving still placed the em- phasis on a spectacular and spectacularly useless destruction carried out on a human scale. Later warfare, culminating in nuclear war, heightens the intensity of destructiveness while at the same time reducing it to the status of simple implement: one carries out destructive acts (e.g., Hiroshima) to carry out certain useful policy goals</span></strong><u>. “</u> <strong><span style="text-underline: thick;">Primitive” war, then, was closer to what I have dubbed “good” duality. Implicit in Bataille’s discussion of war, from the Aztecs to the Ameri- cans, is the loss of intimacy. Aztec war was thoroughly subordinated, both on the part of victor and vanquished, to the exigencies of passion; as time went on, it seems that martial glory came to be associated more and more with mere rank. Self-interest replaced the “intimate,” exciting destruction of goods and life. Modern nuclear war is completely devoid of any ele- ment of transgression or dread; it is simply mechanized murder, linked to some vague political or economic conception of necessity. Ultimately, for this reason, war in Bataille’s view must be replaced by a modern version of potlatch in which one nation-state (the United States) gives without count- ing to others (the Europeans, primarily). Modern war remains, for all that, an example of mankind’s tendency to expend.</span></strong> <u>It is merely an extreme example of an inability to recognize dépense for what it is. It thereby constitutes a massive failure of self-consciousness: “</u> <strong><span style="text-underline: thick;">bad duality” as the melding of the “tendency to expend” with the demand for utility and self-interest. Something, however, is missing in Bataille’s analysis. This steady pro- gression in types of warfare, while signaling the difference between what we might call “intimate” war (the Aztecs) and utilitarian war (the World Wars), nevertheless does tend to conflate them, in a very specific way. They are all seen as moments in which humanity plays the role of the most effi- cient destroyer, the being at the top of the food chain that consumes — in both senses of the word—the greatest concentrations and the greatest quantities of energy. Ultimately the difference between Aztec war and American war is exclusively one of self-consciousness; ironically, it was the Aztecs who, in their sacrificial/militaristic orgies, were in closer touch with and had greater awareness of the nature of war. The Americans, quantita- tively, might be the greater consumers, but their knowledge of what they are doing is minimal (only the Marshall Plan, augmented through a read- ing of Bataille, would solve that problem).26</span></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>The ability to devastate the earth comes from what we see as the energy of our society. The ancient Aztecs viewed their power at the basis of their religious purposes and their highly advanced intellect. However, Modern governments view it not of such indispensable factors but of mere expendable technology and energy. Our alternative is to vote negative to align ourselves against the disposability of current energy expenditure. The aff in the name of what our military machine’s production is based upon mere wasteful knowledge reproduction. Our alternative is a prerequisite to the affirmative ; Realizing this distinction allows us to question the motivation of military presence in the first place and discovers the true basis of our production.</strong> </span><br />

The answer, I think, is to be found in the nature of the consumption itself. Bataille in effect makes the same mistake that traditional econo- mists make concerning the origin of value: that it is to be found primarily in human labor. If, however, we see the skyrocketing of the creation of value in the last two centuries to be attributable not solely to inputs of human labor (muscle and brain power) but above all to the energy derived from fossil fuels (as Beaudreau [1999] claims), we will come to understand that the massive increase in mankind’s capacity to waste is attributable not only to, say, technical innovation, the more efficient application of human labor, genius, and so on, but to the very energy source itself. The Aztecs, like many other traditional societies, derived their energy from muscle power: that of animals, slaves, and, in warfare, nobles. Destruction, like production, entailed an expenditure of energy derived from very modest sources: calories derived from food (solar energy), transformed by muscle, and applied to a task. We might call this energy (to modify a Bataillean usage) and its destruction intimate: that is, its production and expenditure are on a human scale, and are directly tied to a close bodily relation with things. This relation implies a corporeal engagement with and through an energy that cannot be put to use, that fundamentally defies all appropria- tion. Just as intimacy for Bataille implies a passionate involvement with the thing — primarily its consumation, its burn-off, the intense relation with a thing that is not a thing (as opposed to consommation, in the sense of everyday purchase, use, and wastage)—so in this case, having to do with the production and destruction of value, my muscle power assures that my relation to what I make or destroy will be passionate. A hand tool’s use will entail physical effort, pain, pleasure, satisfaction, or anguish. It will be up close and personal. The same will go for the destruction of the utility of that tool; there will be a profound connection between “me” and the destruction of the thing-ness of the tool.27 By extension, the utility, “per- manence,” and thus the servility of my self will be put in question through an intimate connection (“communication”) with the universe via the de- stroyed or perverted object or tool. Just as there are two energetic sources of economic value, then — muscle power and inanimate fuel power—so too there are two kinds of expenditure. The stored and available energy derived from fossil or inanimate fuel expenditure, for production or destruction, is different in quality, not merely in quantity, from muscular energy. The latter is profoundly more and other than the mere “power to do work.” No intimacy (in the Batail- lean sense) can be envisaged through the mechanized expenditure of fossil fuels. The very use of fossil and nonorganic fuels—coal, oil, nuclear— implies the effort to maximize production through quantification, the augmentation of the sheer quantity of things. Raw material becomes, as Heidegger put it, a standing reserve, a measurable mass whose sole function is to be processed, used, and ultimately discarded.28 It is useful, nothing more (or less), at least for the moment before it is discarded; it is related to the self only as a way of aggrandizing the latter’s stability and position. There is no internal limit, no angoisse or pain before which we shudder; we deplete the earth’s energy reserves as blandly and indifferently as the French revolutionaries (according to Hegel) chopped off heads: as if one were cutting off a head of cabbage. “Good” duality has completely given way to “bad.” As energy sources become more efficiently usable — oil produces a lot more energy than does coal, in relation to the amount of energy needed to extract it, transport it, and dispose of waste (ash and slag) — more material can be treated, more people and things produced, handled, and dumped. Consequently more food can be produced, more humans will be born to eat it, and so on (the carrying capacity of the earth temporarily rises). And yet, under this inanimate fuels regime, the very nature of pro- duction and above all destruction changes. Even when things today are expended, they are wasted under the sign of efficiency, utility. This very abstract quantification is inseparable from the demand of an efficiency that bolsters the position of a closed and demanding subjectivity. We “need” cars and SUVs, we “need” to use up gas, waste landscapes, forests, and so on: it is all done in the name of the personal lifestyle we cannot live without, which is clearly the best ever developed in human history, the one everyone necessarily wants, the one we will fight for and use our products (weapons) to protect. We no longer destroy objects, render them intimate, in a very personal, confrontational potlatch; we simply leave items out for the trash haulers to pick up or have them hauled to the junkyard. Con- sumption (la consommation) in the era of the standing reserve, the frame- work (Ge-Stell), entails, in and through the stockpiling of energy, the stockpiling of the human: the self itself becomes an element of the stand- ing reserve, a thing among other things. There can hardly be any intimacy in the contemporary cycle of production-consumption-destruction, the modern and degraded version of expenditure. As Bataille put it, concern- ing intimacy: Intimacy is expressed only under one condition by the thing [la chose]: that this thing fundamentally be the opposite of a thing, the opposite of a product, of merchandise: a burn-off [consumation] and a sacrifice. Since intimate feeling is a burn-off, it is burning-off that expresses it, not the thing, which is its negation. (OC, 7: 126; AS 132: italics Bataille’s) War, too, reflects this nonintimacy of the thing: fossil fuel and nuclear- powered explosives and delivery systems make possible the impersonal de- struction of lives in great numbers and at a great distance. Human beings are now simply quantities of material to be processed and destroyed in wars (whose purpose is to assure the continued availability of fossil fuel resources). Killing in modern warfare is different in kind from that carried out by the Aztecs. All the sacrificial elements, the elements by which the person has been transformed in and through death, have disappeared.<br />

But </span></strong>Upton said a big House vote for repeal could sway votes in the Senate &quot;to perhaps do the same thing.<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> But then, after that, we're going to go after this bill piece by piece,&quot; he said, by trying to block various parts of the law including an individual mandate for insurance coverage. &quot;We will look at these individual pieces to see if we can't have the thing crumble,&quot; Upton said. But Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, said on CBS' &quot;Face the Nation&quot; people are learning more about benefits of the healthcare law, diminishing chances it will be defeated. &quot;A constituent in my district came up to me a few weeks ago and thanked me for saving her $3,000 a year because she could put her two adult children back on her insurance.

Yet, more than 41 million Americans have no health insurance of any kind, public or private. The uninsured rate was 14.6 percent in 2001--up 13 percent since 1987. The rate is on the rise with increased healthcare costs, unemployment and cutbacks in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). One in four people with household incomes less than $25,000 is uninsured. One in six full-time workers is uninsured, including half the full-time workers with incomes below the official poverty line. The share of workers covered by employment health plans drops from 81 percent in the top fifth of wage earners to 68 percent in the middle fifth to 33 percent in the lowest fifth, according to the Economic Policy Institute. As reports by the American College of Physicians, Kaiser Family Foundation and many others have shown, lack of health insurance is associated with lack of preventive care and substandard treatment inside and outside the hospital. The uninsured are at much higher risk for chronic disease and disability, and have a 25 percent greater chance of dying (adjusting for physical, economic and behavioral factors). To make matters worse, a health crisis is often an economic crisis. &quot;Medical bills are a factor in nearly half of all personal bankruptcy filings,&quot; reports the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine. The U.S. is No. 1 in healthcare spending per capita, but No. 34--tied with Malaysia--when it comes to child mortality rates under age five. The U.S. is No. 1 in healthcare spending, but the only major industrialized nation not to provide some form of universal coverage. We squander billions of dollars in the red tape of myriad healthcare eligibility regulations, forms and procedures, and second-guessing of doctors by insurance gatekeepers trained in cost cutting, not medicine. Americans go to Canada for cheaper prices on prescription drugs made by U.S. pharmaceutical companies with U.S. taxpayer subsidies. While millions go without healthcare, top health company executives rake in the dough. A report by Families USA found that the highest-paid health plan executives in ten companies received average compensation of $11.7 million in 2000, not counting unexercised stock options worth tens of millions more. The saying, &quot;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,&quot; couldn't be truer when it comes to healthcare. Yet, we provide universal coverage for seniors through Medicare, but not for children. We have economic disincentives for timely diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Universal healthcare is a humane and cost-effective solution to the growing healthcare crisis. Universal coverage won't come easy, but neither did Social Security or Medicare, which now serves one in seven Americans. Many proposals for universal healthcare build on the foundation of &quot;Medicare for All,&quot; albeit an improved Medicare adequately serving seniors and younger people alike. Healthcare is as essential to equal opportunity as public education and as essential to public safety as police and fire protection. If your neighbor's house were burning, would you want 911 operators to ask for their fire insurance card number before sending--or not sending--fire trucks? Healthcare ranked second behind terrorism and national security as the most critical issue for the nation in the 2002 Health Confidence Survey released by the Employee Benefit Research Institute<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">The government thinks the smallpox threat is serious enough to start inoculating military and medical personnel with a highly risky vaccine</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">It's time to stop delaying universal healthcare, which will save lives everyday while boosting our readiness for any bioterror attack</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. </span></strong> </span><br />

This winter, the Air Force is set to deploy to Afghanistan what it says is a revolutionary airborne surveillance system called Gorgon Stare, which will be able to transmit live video images of physical movement across an entire town. The system, made up of nine video cameras mounted on a remotely piloted aircraft, can transmit live images to soldiers on the ground or to analysts tracking enemy movements. It can send up to 65 different images to different users; by contrast, Air Force drones today shoot video from a single camera over a &quot;soda straw&quot; area the size of a building or two. With the new tool, analysts will no longer have to guess where to point the camera, said Maj. Gen. James O. Poss, the Air Force's assistant deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. &quot;Gorgon Stare will be looking at a whole city, so there will be no way for the adversary to know what we're looking at, and we can see everything.&quot; Questions persist, however, about whether the military has the capability to sift through huge quantities of imagery quickly enough to convey useful data to troops in the field. Officials also acknowledge that Gorgon Stare is of limited value unless they can match it with improved human intelligence - eyewitness reports of who is doing what on the ground. The Air Force is exponentially increasing surveillance across Afghanistan. The monthly number of unmanned and manned aircraft surveillance sorties has more than doubled since last January, and quadrupled since the beginning of 2009. Indeed, officials say, they cannot keep pace with the demand. &quot;I have yet to go a week in my job here without having a request for more Air Force surveillance out there,&quot; Poss said. But adding Gorgon Stare will also generate oceans of more data to process. &quot;Today an analyst sits there and stares at Death TV for hours on end, trying to find the single target or see something move,&quot; Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a conference in New Orleans in November. &quot;It's just a waste of manpower.&quot; The hunger for these high-tech tools was evident at the conference, where officials told several thousand industry and intelligence officials they had to move &quot;at the speed of war.&quot; Cartwright pressed for solutions, even partial ones, in a year or less. The development of Gorgon Stare began about 18 months ago. It is based on the work of Air Force scientists who came up with the idea of stitching together views from multiple cameras shooting two frames per second at half-meter resolution. Currently full-motion video is shot at 30 frames per second from one camera mounted on a Predator or the larger Reaper drone. That makes for more fluid video, but also more difficulty in assembling frames quickly to get the wide-area view.<br />

Technological advances now make it possible for a soldier on the ground to receive any portion of a panoramic view in real time, streamed to a portable device about the size of an iPad, Poss said. At the same time, nine other soldiers can get the same or a different view. The images will be stored so analysts can study them to determine, for instance, who planted an improvised bomb or what the patterns of life in a village are. The Air Force has also taken tips from the purveyors of pop culture. It is working with Harris Corp. to adapt ESPN’s technique of tagging key moments in National Football League videotape to the war zone. Just as a sportscaster can call up a series of archived quarterback blitzes as soon as a player is sacked on the field, an analyst in Afghanistan can retrieve the last month’s worth of bombings in a particular stretch of road with the push of a button, officials said. The Air Force placed a contractor on the set of a reality TV show to learn how to pick out the interesting scenes shot from cameras simultaneously recording the action in a house. And taking a page from high-tech companies such as Google, the Air Force will store its reams of video on servers placed in used shipping containers in Iowa. The Air Force is looking to mount wide-area surveillance cameras on airships that can stay aloft for up to two weeks. “This is all cutting-edge technology that is being fielded in a short period of time,” said retired Lt. Gen. David A. Deptula, who served as deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. “If you look into the not-too-distant future, what these technologies will allow us to do is remove more and more ground forces and replace them with sensors where we normally would have to rely on people going somewhere to find something out,” he said. But other military officials caution that a counterinsurgency requires an understanding of the local population__.</strong><br />

<span style="color: black;">A revolutionary new American Air Force drone will be able to track movement of insurgents in Afghanistan across entire towns. Named Gordon Stare, it is set to be used in the country within the next few months and will be able to transmit live video of movement. The new system will use a series of nine cameras on the remote controlled aircraft and will be able to send up to 65 images at any one time. Ground staff will be able to receive real-time broadcasts of the clips, and able to transfer and store data for further analysis at a later date. The system will be deployed on board the MQ-9 Reaper drone that currently undertakes surveillance using a single mounted camera that relays information to analysts on the ground. Major General James O. Poss, the American Air Force's assistant deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance said the new tool will have benefits in the search for terrorists in the country. Major General Poss told the Washington Post: 'Gorgon Stare will be looking at a whole city, so there will be no way for the adversary to know what we're looking at, and we can see everything.' 'With the new tool, analysts will no longer have to guess where to point the camera.' However critics of the system say that the huge amount of information the new drone will receive will be of limited value if they cannot match it with ground intelligence. They also add that the military does not have the manpower to go through imagery the drones will provide. Gorgon Stare has been in development for around 18 months and its release coincides with a huge increase in aerial surveillance in Afghanistan, which has doubled since January 2010. </span><br />

<br />
Using electro-optic and infrared cameras, the system will be able to scan the battlefield at any time of day or night. To transmit the large amounts of video data produced by the multiple cameras, Gorgon Stare pushes the imagery out at two frames per second, rather than the 30 frames per second full-motion video used by the Reaper’s other sensor, the Multispectral Targeting System, which is mounted on the aircraft’s chin and is the primary real-time tracking tool for direct targeting, Popular Science reported. Despite the low frame rate, program scientists told Popular Science that this was more than adequate to alert operators to any changes in the environment. One operational strategy is to station a UAV over an area and monitor any movement in a two-and-a-half mile (four km) zone. The aircraft's full-video MTS can then focus on any activity that is considered unusual or of interest.In the future, the Air Force has even bigger plans for airborne surveillance. Defense Systems has reported that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is developing a system called Autonomous Real-time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance—Imaging System, which will move the Gorgon Stare concept up to another level. ARGUS-IS will use a 1.8 gigapixel camera running at 15 frames per second to provide a 27-gigapixel-per-second video. The system is scheduled to be integrated into the A160 Hummingbird unmanned helicopter for flight testing and demonstration.<br />

Even if they win a solvency advacate to taking steps to solving where you do not let the inner mind adjust itself to the astrocities of war making it possible.<br />

<strong>Excess of desire and knowledge forces us to change the representations of the what the world is to us. We tell ourselves we must change the factors that make reality possible within our mind to make it adhere to our realizations of the world. When we do this reality becomes even more destructed, the principle of reality instead dies and allows us to concept representations, ie Objective Reality, without an end purpose. This realization allowed the development of the Virtual Reality to continue with no limits until it killed the principle of reality. We can no longer view or imagine the real.</strong><br />

<strong>The simulation has resulted in the complete submersion of death – we have insisted so long and layering representations, creating survival, and ensuring in some respect that a piece of us lives into eternity that we have killed any trace of humanity beneath these desires. Every moment of our lives, emotion, data, intelligence, is actively translated into the sign-value system. Nothing escapes this ultra-modern death, connecting every term in the sequence of existing.</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>So architecture and town planning, even if they are transfigured by the imagination, cannot change anything, since they are mass-media themselves and, even in their most daring conception, they reproduce masssocial relations, which is to say that collectively they allow people no response. All they can do is enliven, and participate in urban recycling, design in the largest sense: the simulation of exchange and collective values, the simulation of play and non-functional spaces. Hence the adventure parks for the children, the green spaces, the houses of culture; hence the City Walls and the protest walls, the green spaces of language [parole]. The graffitists themselves care little for architecture; they defile it, forget about it and cross the street. The mural artist respects the wall as he used to respect the limitations of his easel. Graffiti runs from one house to the next, from one wall of a building to the next, from the wall onto the window or the door, or windows on subway trains, or the pavements. Graffiti overlaps, is thrown up, superimposes (superimposition amounting to the abolition of the support as a framework, just as it is abolished as frame when its limits are not respected). Its graphics resemble the child's polymorphous perversity, ignoring the boundaries between the sexes and the delimitation of erogenous zones. Curiously, moreover, graffiti turns the city's walls and corners, the subway's cars and the buses, into a body, a body without beginning or end, made erotogenic in its entirety by writing just as the body may be in the primitive inscription (tattooing). Tattooing takes place on the body. In primitive societies, along with other ritual signs, it makes the body what it is -- material for symbolic exchange: without tattooing, as without masks, the body is only what it is, naked and expressionless. By tattooing walls, SUPERSEX and SUPERKOOL free them from architecture and turn them once again into living, social matter, into the moving body of the city before it has been branded with functions and institutions. The end of the `four walls' when they are tattooed like archaic effigies. End of the repressive space-time of urban transport systems where the subway cars fly past like missiles or living hydras tattooed up to the eyes. Something about the city has become tribal, parietal, before writing, with these powerful emblems stripped of meaning. An incision into the flesh of empty signs that do not signify personal identity, but group initiation and affiliation: `A biocybernetic self-fulfilling prophecy world orgy I.'</strong></span><br />

<strong>Hawke, Michael, Sam, God, you all think you know what is around you. Everything falls into place, is perfect, there are forms of fixing our world. The CIA, sneaky stealth suits and all, are sneaking around too often and need to be stopped. I’m here to tell you that this is all bullhonky. Have you ever seen a CIA agent, have you ever known that the government or military even exists? These representations have been programmed into us, abstractions and ideals and objectivities stacked on top of us to layers so high we can’t ever know what is truth and what is falsity – what is truth? What is representation. I need some time to think about this, to reflect off some surface…</strong><br />

<strong>HOLD THE PHONE, I NEED TO TAKE A BREAK FROM TALKING ABOUT BIG “B” FOR A SECOND. I just realized how hungry I am – at least, I’m pretty sure I’m hungry. This is the worst feeling in the world! I need a burrito or something ASAP, maybe some horchata! This must how the simulation must feel, never knowing what to feel or do when you are trapped. Imagine how the people in Reno must feel, no delilicacies in their immediate area, they must perpetually feel lost in hunger and simulation… Now that I think about it, I am pretty thirsty too. I have an idea, something that could solve this lack of hunger and understanding.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Thus Hawke and Michael and I favor: That Café Rio should open a franchise in the city of Reno, Nevada, and give free drinks to any high school student with the purchase of a combo meal.</strong><br />

<strong>We reserve the right not to clarify, and if Sam feels excluded, we can give him an employee application and maybe he can join into our venture as well.</strong><br />
