<span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">Politicians, pundits, and the press corps are turning their attention to the so-called "fiscal cliff," the host of expiring tax provisions and scheduled spending cuts that will collectively push the U.S. economy into a double-dip recession in the first half of 2013 if they all materialize.</span>

<span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">However, panic over this scenario (which nobody thinks will come to pass) should not be allowed to be exploited politically to maintain tax policies that provide only minimal support to the economy while turning a blind eye to the real threats to economic and employment growth over the coming year.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">IN THE aftermath of the G-20 summit, most observers seem to have missed perhaps the most crucial statement of the entire event, made by United States President Barack Obama at his pre-conference meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown: 'The world has become accustomed to the US being a voracious consumer market, the engine that drives a lot of economic growth worldwide,' he said. 'If there is going to be renewed growth, it just can't be the US as the engine.' </span>
AND
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Given all this, </span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">the US will remain the engine of global economic recovery</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> for the foreseeable future, even though other countries must certainly help. This crisis began in the US - and it is going to have to be solved there too.

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Less intuitive is how periods of </span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">economic decline</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> may </span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">increase the likelihood of external conflict</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">AND</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">In summary, recent economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels.5 This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention. </span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">If correctly structured, </span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">an NIB may introduce a federal investment process that requires and rewards performance, with clear accountability from</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> both </span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">recipients and the federal government. </span>
AND

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Generally bonds get investment grade ratings, and have ready market access, only if they are senior obligations with secure repayment sources. For more complicated project financings that go beyond senior debt, there is a need for additional capital, such as equity capital or subordinated debt.</span>


NIB solves—centralized source of financing

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">The logic behind the bank isn’t hard to grasp. In recent years, reams of white papers have come out describing how much of </span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">the nation’s transportation, water and energy infrastructure is in shambles</span>
AND
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">That would, in theory, boost the overall size and impact of its jobs bill, which nominally costs $447 billion</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">NIB is vital to rebuilding infrastructure and spurring job market growth</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">After the Labor Department announced last week that trims in government jobs meant the economy produced zero -- count 'em zero -- jobs in August, Wall Street and Main Street are looking for some reassurance from Washington things will get better</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">But</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"> if an I-Bank can get Americans working again, Congress will be hard pressed to close it down. </span>
