<span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">The U.S. Defense Department's fast-fading opportunity to piggyback a military mission aboard</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Iridium Communications‘ next-generation satellite constellation underscores the need for a formal mechanism and procedures by which government agencies, the Pentagon in particular, can identify and capitalize on brewing hosted payload opportunities</span>. Perhaps the biggest challenge associated with hosted payloads is that government and commercial entities operate on different time scales. Commercial satellite operators, for whom time is money, set and largely adhere to tight schedules for deploying new capabilities. Large government bureaucracies, on the other hand, barring a genuine emergency can rarely muster a relatively simple investment decision within the narrow opening that a commercial development program offers. Since few commercial satellite operators can afford to put manufacturing programs on hold while awaiting a government commitment to get on board never mind the arrival of an integration-ready payload — it's likely that most such opportunities will be missed. Iridium, for example, must replace a constellation of some 66 low-orbiting satellites that were launched mainly in the late l990s. An independent analysis has determined that the current Iridium ﬂeet should last until 2017 or so, which puts the company on a relatively tight schedule forgetting the Iridium Next replacement constellation built, launched aboard multiple rockets and then checked out on orbit. Iridium has long made clear that hosting government payloads is part of the Iridium Next business plan. The company even reserved space and power aboard each of the satellites for hosted payloads, assigning the rights to market that real estate — for a price — to Orbital Sciences Corp. which is under contract to perform ﬁnal assembly and integration of the spacecraft. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The fact that the Pentagon hasn't jumped at the opportunity is not due to a lack of interest</span>, according to Iridium Chief Executive Matt Desch, who noted there were ideas for applications that would have taken up a significant portion if not all of the Iridium Next hosted payload capacity. He wasn't specific, but <span style="font-size: 11pt;">one could easily envision leveraging the constellation to deploy orbital surveillance or space weather monitoring capabilities with global coverage</span> for a very modest price. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The problem</span>, he said, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">is</span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">the Pentagon's massive procurement bureaucracy has yet to adapt to doing business this way</span>. &quot;l am afraid <span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">this is going to be a very big thing </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in the next I0 years —and not, as it should be, in the next two or three years</span>,&quot; he said at a recent conference. It would be easy to criticize the Pentagon for fumbling such a big and rare opportunity — another commercial satellite program of this scale isn't likely to come along for another TD to l5 years, if at all — but it also would be unfair; this was going to be a tough train to catch under any circumstances. Although lridium's plans for hosting govemment payloads have been known for years, it was not until mid-2010 that the company secured the financing to build the satellites and awarded the prime contract to Thales Alenia Space. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Given Iridium's end-of-2012 deadline for securing hosted payload commitments, the Pentagon effectively had some two-and-a-half years to design a program utilizing all or at least a signiﬁcant portion of Iridium Next's capacity, marshal the necessary resources and win approvals across the chain of command and from Congress</span>. That's probably asking too much; big govemment bureaucracies simply don't move that quickly. Nr. Desch remains hopeful of selling most of the Iridium Next hosted payload space to other U.S. government customers, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and even the Pentagon could still ﬁnd a way to utilize at least some of the capacity, albeit on a much smaller scale than Iridium originally envisioned. But if Iridium represents an elusive, once-in-a-decade opportunity, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">there are literally dozens of far more accessible opportunities to place payloads aboard commercial geostationary orbiting satellites, 20 or more of which are launched every year</span>. Geostationary satellite owners have been pitching the hosted payload concept for years but to date have gotten only a handful of takers. Established ﬁxed satellite services providers have steady and predictable fleet replacement cycles and there are enough of them such that the government can count on multiple opportunities with similar characteristics each year. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Pentagon faces signiﬁcant declines in its space budget in the coming years even as its demand for space-based services continues to grow. The White House. meanwhile, has made it ofﬁcial policy to leverage commercial space capabilities wherever possible. It is time to move beyond the lip service Pentagon officials have paid to the hosted payload concept and set up a programspecifically designed to identify military needs — bothexperimental and operational</span><span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> —</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">that could be met with payloads compatible with multiple commercial platforms that go into assembly in any given year</span>. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Industry could help the cause by </span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">developing standard interfaces that government piggyback payloads could be designed to</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. That way, if a payload misses its targeted flight opportunity, another suitable ride will come along sooner rather than later</span>. The Hosted Payload Alliance. an industry group created to educate prospective government customers on the topic, could play an important role in getting government and manufacturers to agree on common interface standards. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The current ﬂeet replenishment cycle of the major geostationary satellite operators is winding down, but there still should be plenty of opportunities to exploit in the next few years. Certainly there will be no excuse for missing the next big fleet replenishment wave</span>. The lridium experience, by virtue of its high profile, is <span style="font-size: 11pt;">a wake-up call for the Defense Department to finally get serious about leveraging what to date has been an underutilized commercial space resource</span>.<br />

As major government programs have struggled, the Defense Department’s <span style="font-size: 11pt;">demand for </span><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">sat</span></em>ellite <em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">com</span></em>munications <span style="font-size: 11pt;">has grown dramatically.</span> A few years ago, two relatively small companies, Ryan Aeronautics and General Atomics, working with comparatively modest government support, developed the technologies that became the Global Hawk and Predator UAVs. These UAVs, with their capability for precision targeting and real-time battlefield intelligence, have literally revolutionized warfare. Strategic capabilities that once required billion dollar space assets could now be delivered with relatively low-cost aeronautical platforms. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The UAV revolution is not without</span> its <span style="font-size: 11pt;">complications.</span> Once a UAV flies beyond the radio range of its base, it must rely on satellite communications for its command, control and data transfer. As a result, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">UAVs are extremely bandwidth intensive.</span> The rapid growth of UAV applications occurred during a time when military-owned bandwidth was already at a premium. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Existing satellite fleets</span>, DSCS and Milstar, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">were stretched thin with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and could not begin to meet the new demand imposed by UAVs. Lacking military-owned capacity, the DoD turned tothe commercial satellite industry for assistance.</span> Thus was born a unique marriage of convenience. The military began to rely heavily on the global commercial satellite industry to meet its evolving and expanding requirements and the industry, in turn, found a ready outlet for its then underutilized capacity. The military also began buying and deploying commercial antennas and equipment to its troops and on its UAVs. DoD reliance on commercial satcom would continue to grow until the commercial sector was supplying more than 90 percent of its satellite communications capacity in Afghanistan and Iraq. In some ways, the relationship has never been a completely comfortable one. By and large, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">major DoD satellite users</span> tend to <span style="font-size: 11pt;">prefer military satcom over commercial, because</span>, at least from the users perspective, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">it is “free.”</span> Commercial capacity, however cost-effective or convenient, must be paid for with increasingly scarce budget dollars. To this day, with the partial exception of the Navy, the services — even though they rely on commercial satcom for critical services — do not routinely budget for these services but prefer, instead, to buy them with so-called supplemental funds appropriated by Congress for the war effort. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The success of early UAVs drove the demand for more UAV flights and more and better onboard sensors suites, which, in turn, drove the need for more satellite capacity.</span> Once the data is collected, it must be dispersed for action. The quickest way to do this in theater is via satellite. Again, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the overall demand for satellite capacity is growing at a rate that far outstrips the DoD’s ability to meet it with current and planned military satellite capacity. This raises a </span><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">fundamental question</span></em><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> for the future:Should DoD create an enduring role for commercial industry in meeting long-term UAV requirements, or should it mount a multibillion-dollar campaign to replace existing commercial</span> terminals and satellite <span style="font-size: 11pt;">capacity with new military</span> satellites and <span style="font-size: 11pt;">antennas?</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Military officials have lamented the rising cost of satellite services offered under new FCSA contracts. Prices are higher</span>, industry officials said, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">because there is far less available satellite communications capacity where it is needed most, above U.S. theaters of operationsin Afghanistan and Iraq</span>. Still, industry officials expect FCSA prices to decrease as additional contracts are negotiated and more vendors join the program. “Everyone wants to win a task order under FCSA so we can call news organizations like yours to announce our success,” one industry official said. To cut communications costs, for example, military officials might consider easing some satellite communications performance requirements, this official said. The FCSA contract calls on all providers to offer satellite communications featuring 99.999 percent performance. If there are certain jobs that do not require that level of performance, the government could save money by agreeing to accept lower standards. For example, a contract could lay out varied requirements, such as 99.999 percent performance for high-priority communications, but a lower standard for something like logistics data. For that type of contract, service providers could make more efficient use of transponders and offer lower costs by allowing less essential data to move across capacity shared by multiple users. In addition, the armed services could save money by making multiyear commitments to pay for a certain minimum amount of satellite bandwidth. If government agencies can enter a five-year agreement to buy bandwidth, the price would be significantly lower than the current costs of satellite capacity purchased one year at a time, said retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Craig Weston, chief executive for satellite service provider U.S. Space. Once you consider multiyear commitments, it makes sense for government officials to consider long-term leases or the outright purchase of dedicated commercial satellites, he added. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Industry officialsalso suggest the armed services take advantage of the plethora of commercial launches by sending their own communications payloads into orbit as hosted payloads</span>. To promote the idea, the Hosted Payload Alliance was established in March by Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems, Intelsat General Corp., Iridium Communications Inc., Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Orbital Sciences Corp., SES World Skies U.S. Government Solutions and Space Systems/Loral. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The U.S. Army’s 2010 test of an Internet router in orbit is likely to pave the way for more hosted payloads</span>, industry officials said. The Cisco-supplied Internet Routing in Space device, called ISIS, was launched as a payload on the Intelsat 14 satellite. “We think <span style="font-size: 11pt;">that’s a great model</span>,” said Philip Harlow, president and chief operating officer of satellite service provider Xtar LLC of Rockville, Md. If the primary payload does not tap out the satellite’s weight and power requirements, a secondary payload can benefit by paying a fraction of the cost of a dedicated spacecraft, Harlow added. Demand and supply <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Officials on all sides are certain there is no going back to a situation in which the military satisfies its own demand</span>. Before the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the U.S. military’s own satellites supplied 80 percent of the bandwidth used by U.S. forces. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Now, 80 percent of the communications are supplied by commercial satellites</span>. In 2009, the U.S. communications director in Iraq told attendees at a satellite conference that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">96 percent of the communications requirements of U.S. Central Command</span> were being handled by commercial satellites. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The U.S. government’s current demand for an estimated 20 gigabytes per second of bandwidth is approximately twice the amount currently available</span>, said Craig Cooning, chairman of Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems, at the Satellite 2011 conference in Washington. “<span style="font-size: 11pt;">By 2019, the demand will reach 50 gigabytes per second, and only 60 percent of that will be met</span>,” he added. “<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The military appetite for bandwidth will never decrease, even after we draw down in the Middle East</span>,” Weston said. Industry already is responding to consumer and government demand by launching new satellites and offering new services. London-based Inmarsat, Hughes Communications, Yahsat of the United Arab Emirates, Iridium Communications, Paris-based Eutelsat and ViaSat Inc. are investing billions of dollars in new Ka-band satellites that promise lightning-quick data transmission rates. Competitors warn that Ka-band service can be degraded by dust and rain, but government and industry officials said the benefits of high data throughput combined with smaller antenna sizes will make both military and commercial Ka-band an important component of any future satellite communications network. Planning would be required for U.S. forces to make seamless use of military and commercial Ka-band because private companies and the military rely on different Ka-band ranges. The military uses 20.2 gigahertz to 21.2 gigahertz as the downlink frequency for Ka-band communications, and 30 to 31 gigahertz as the uplink frequencies bands. Commercial satellites use 17.7 to 20.2 gigahertz for the downlink and 27.5 to 30 gigahertz for the uplink. The Defense Department’s Wideband Global Satcom, which provides services to military users for free, transmits data in the military Ka-band and also X-band frequencies. Right now, military agencies do not have any ground terminals designed to operate in both the commercial and military Ka-band frequencies, but service officials are considering purchasing or leasing that type of equipment because it would offer greater flexibility, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center’s Military Satellite Communications Systems Directorate. To meet requirements to encrypt all military signals prior to broadcast, service officials also may need to obtain additional equipment to enhance security for new ground terminals. There will be no silver bullet, some officials warn. It will take a combination of satellites operating in different frequency bands to satisfy military demand. Much of the military’s existing satellite infrastructure operates in X-band frequencies. “Traditionally, terminal and network investments account for over 75 percent of the overall satellite communications enterprise costs,” the Air Force said in a written response to questions. “Transitioning off X-band terminals to Ka-band will be costly, and take time. In addition, X-band offers signal properties, such as better resistance to weather effects, which are attractive to some customers.”<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The status quo doesn’t cut it – even though the US is showing interest in hosted payloads, the military insists on upgrading its own SATCOM capabilities</span><br />

Fifteen years ago, when U.S. military leaders were trying to anticipate future communications demands, they knew U.S. forces could be called upon at any time to fight or offer humanitarian assistance anywhere in the world. They knew voice, video and data traffic would continue to grow. What they didn’t foresee was widespread use of unmanned aircraft. Today, hundreds of unmanned planes are streaming videos and relaying sensor data over satellites, said Army Col. Patrick Rayermann, director of satellite communications integration at the U.S. Defense Department’s National Space Security Office. “It’s the killer app.” The drone war is the best known driver for the skyrocketing communications demand, but it is far from the only one. Increasingly, military forces want to maintain communications while traveling in aircraft, ships, ground vehicles and even on foot. “Our customers are constantly striving to have a service that is more mobile,” said Andrew Beegan, vice president and chief technology officer for global communications provider Segovia Inc. of Herndon, Va., a subsidiary of Inmarsat. Even the push for smartphones could factor in. Those phones will be used primarily to send information over local wireless networks, but some photographs or videos will need to be transmitted between tactical enclaves, which means sending the data over future aerial or satellite networks, Rayermann said. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">This combination of growing demand, tightening defense budgets and rising commercial prices has defense officials searching for better ways to obtain satellite services. Commercial satellite leaders are</span> rushing in to make suggestions, while defending their pricing and <span style="font-size: 11pt;">pushingthe idea of hosting more government payloads on their satellites</span>, or perhaps leasing entire satellites. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The U.S. military has begun laying the groundwork for closer cooperation with the industry and allies. It is making plans to build communications networks that integrate the government’s own satellites with commercial spacecraft and those used by U.S. coalition partners. The U.S. already has agreements in place to share satellites with the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 11pt;">K</span>ingdom <span style="font-size: 11pt;">and Australia</span>. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The</span> U.S. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">National Security Space Strategy</span> released in February <span style="font-size: 11pt;">underscores the need for allies and coalition partners to share satellites for</span> surveillance and <span style="font-size: 11pt;">communications</span>, said Gregory Schulte, U.S. deputy undersecretary of defense for space policy, in a briefing for reporters. Wanted: Detailed requirements <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Even as the U.S. military embraces commercial services as part of the answer, defense strategists show no signs of backing away from their plans to spend billions upgrading their own satellites</span>. In February 2012, the U.S. Navy plans to launch the first satellite in a constellation of Mobile User Objective System spacecraft to serve forces in the most remote locations. In August, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">theU.S. Air Force launched the first spacecraft in a planned constellation of</span> Advanced Extremely High Frequency (<span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span>) <span style="font-size: 11pt;">satellites, which provide highly protected, secure communications for the national leadership</span>. The Air Force plans to keep launching Wideband Global Satcom spacecraft to provide less protected broadband communications for U.S. forces on ships and on bases.<br />
Not only does this take forever, but even the satellites the military <u>does</u> manage to produce on its own will suck – utilizing commercial capabilities instead is key to every level of military operations<br />

Now more than ever before, the military’s use of <span style="font-size: 11pt;">commercial</span> satellite communications (<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Satcom</span>) <span style="font-size: 11pt;">plays a vital role in</span> the military Satcom (<span style="font-size: 11pt;">MilSatcom</span>) <span style="font-size: 11pt;">architecture</span> as the Defense Department looks to more efficiently manage its resources. With today’s fiscal environment of constrained military budgets and reduced spending, defense planners are giving unprecedented consideration to commercial Satcom, and with good reason. Designing, building, launching, and maintaining satellites is an expensive undertaking, and <span style="font-size: 11pt;">DOD has long had difficulties in</span> developing and <span style="font-size: 11pt;">delivering</span> space <span style="font-size: 11pt;">systems </span><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">on time</span></em><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> and </span><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">within budget.</span></em> Therefore, it's no surprise that many of the new Milsatcom systems that DOD is deploying and planning are adopting commercial business practices and technologies to improve cost, schedule, and performance. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Overall, the commercial satellite sector delivers satellites faster than DOD and typically in cost estimates, while</span> most of <span style="font-size: 11pt;">DOD’s</span> space acquisition <span style="font-size: 11pt;">programs have resulted inbillions of dollars of cost and schedule overrun,and been </span><em><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">fraught with technical and design problems.</span></strong></em> Commercial Satcom services are readily available and provide a critical gap filler for DOD military communications satellites that don’t have enough capacity to support all of the Pentagon’s missions. The First Gulf War accelerated DOD’s use of commercial Satcom services and this trend continues to the present day with Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Commercial Satcom has the flexibility to respond effectively in </span><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">contingency operations</span></em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, when demand for bandwidth surges beyond routine operations.</span> Current estimates are that more than 80 percent of DOD’s satellite bandwidth is purchased from commercial Satcom companies. With increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets in theatre, as well as high-definition video, that bandwidth allocation is expected to very quickly grow to more than 90 percent. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">UAVs, in particular, require long-distance, high bandwidth communications</span> to fly the platforms and <span style="font-size: 11pt;">to receive live video imagery. Satcom provides the critical link to conduct this type of operation.</span> DOD’s demand for long-haul, wideband military communications has grown exponentially in the last 10 years with the capacity provided by DOD assets falling woefully short of demand. This gap will continue to be significant, making it necessary to continue to leverage commercial Satcom to fill these gaps in coverage and capacity by augmenting DOD-owned assets. Current Milsatcom architecture consists of UHF, SHF, and EHF frequency spectrums. The Navy, DOD’s largest consumer of commercial Satcom services, continues to lease supplemental UHF resources from Paradigm Secure Communications, bridging the gap between requirements and capabilities. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">“Technical advances in the commercial sector can provide opportunities for rapid capability implementation, and are potential </span><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">‘game-changers’</span></em> in the National Security Space Strategy,” Vice Adm. David Dorsett, deputy chief of Naval Operations for Information Dominance, and Gary Federici, deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for C4I and Space, jointly testified in April 2010 before the Senate Armed Services Committee. X-band also is used in the naval environment and in certain climatic zone and high latitude regions where high frequency bands are far less efficient and more susceptible to day-to-day signal fade. Paradigm is leading the way with commercial initiatives for Milsatcom. One such example is the hosted X-band payload on Telesat's ANIK-G1 satellite that will provide valuable commercial X-band capacity and anchoring services over the continental United States and the Pacific Ocean Region. Although DOD will grow capacity with planned next-generation space systems, capacity will remain substantially below the projected demand for wideband communications. According to a study by Northern Sky Research (NSR), DOD by as early as 2014 should have close to 30 gigabytes per second of capacity based on its next-generation satellite program deployments. But according to NSR, “as developments around the globe continue to put strains on internal capabilities, the need for commercial capacity would appear to continue unabated, if only to achieve some sort of flexibility for military bandwidth planners.” <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The bottom line is that DOD can't meet ever-growing Satcom bandwidth requirements with its own organic assets.</span> Whether used for routine day-to-day communications or to meet contingency operations, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">commercial Satcom provides warfighters with a service that is critical to mission success at every level of military operations: strategic, operational and tactical.</span> Therefore, the <span style="font-size: 11pt;">partnership between</span> the <span style="font-size: 11pt;">military and commercial Satcom providers is one of necessity</span>, not luxury.<br />
This is already happening – new satellites the military is planning make itself will be so out-dated they’ll endanger life-or-death missions.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Narrowband to the Foxhole</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Even with</span> the recent launches of three Wideband Global Satcom satellites, colloquially known as the <span style="font-size: 11pt;">gap filler satellites, DOD’s system of satellites is made up mostly of aged and degrading ultra-high-frequency satellites,operated under</span> a variety of military satellite communications (<span style="font-size: 11pt;">milsatcom</span>) <span style="font-size: 11pt;">programs</span>, such as the UHF Follow-On (UFO) satellite network. Although the WGS satellites close some of the gap between warfighter needs and deficiencies, they are designed mostly to be the big pipes through which combatant commanders bring forth ISR capabilities. However, they don’t play much of a role in providing situational awareness to warfighters in the field. As a result, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the shortfall in bandwidth is feltmost urgentlyby troops who are highly mobile and don’t have the luxury to access a fiber-optic network or large, stationary satellite terminals. The requirement for narrowband to the foxhole outstrips the capabilities</span> and available throughput <span style="font-size: 11pt;">of DOD’s</span> UHF <span style="font-size: 11pt;">satellite network. / “Tactical communications in narrowband is one of the areas that is so significantly brokenright now,” said</span> Rebecca <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Cowen-Hirsch</span>, president of Inmarsat Government Services, who, before joining Inmarsat in late 2008, was program executive officer for DISA’s PEO-Satcom, Teleport and Services (PEO-STS). / <span style="font-size: 11pt;">For every one request for UHF capacity [that's accepted], five are denied,</span>” she said. <span class="Cite"><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">“Milsatcom is 500 percent oversubscribed. </span></em></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Communications on these narrowband frequencies are crucial to life or death, but the DOD is having significant difficulties maintaining this capacity because the UHF constellation on orbit today is fading.”</span>”/<span style="font-size: 11pt;">DOD is building the MUOS network of satellites to address that need</span> for delivering narrowband, beyond-line-of-site connectivity at speeds of 64 kilobits/sec or slower to the foxhole through devices such as the handheld radios in development under the Joint Tactical Radio System program. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">But</span> the first of four MUOS satellites — plus one on-orbit spare — is not scheduled for launch until later this year, and <span style="font-size: 11pt;">DOD does not expect to reach full operational capability until 2014. Meanwhile</span>, the <span style="font-size: 11pt;">growing need for narrowband communications — especially as operations in Afghanistan continue to escalate — will go largely unfilled.</span> / <span style="font-size: 11pt;">And even then</span>, “not to take away from what MUOS will provide — because it is a fantastic capability when it comes on orbit — but <span style="font-size: 11pt;">when it does go on orbit, its third-generation capability will not yet be able to be accessed because the terminals are behind&quot; schedule</span>, Cowen-Hirsh said.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The military’s recently released blueprint for satellite communications, the Joint Space Communications Layer Initial Capabilities Document, lays out the military’s goal of developing a flexible architecture that will allow the armed services to maintain communications in any environment. Communications has become such an essential component of military operations that senior military planners want to ensure that no adversary can halt it</span><u>.</u> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">In terms of adversaries</span>, Schulte said, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">it’s not just China that has proven its ability to jam satellite signals. “Iran has used counter-space capabilities and Ethiopia has</span>,” Shulte told reporters. “<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Now it’s not anti-satellite weapons, but they have jammed commercial satellites</span> that have been used to carry the British Broadcasting Corp. and the Voice of America. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">If Ethiopia can jam a commercial satellite, you have to worry about what others can do</span>.” <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Still, military officials do not envision creating a communications network that is immune to interference</span>. The Joint Space Communications Layer describes plans for communications in a benign environment, a contested environment and a nuclear environment. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">When U.S. military communications are not being degraded by attacks or jamming, U.S. forces can rely heavily on commercial</span>, military and coalition <span style="font-size: 11pt;">satellites to keep traffic flowing at high data rates</span>. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">U.S. forces also must be prepared to operate in a contested environment when some of those high data-rate communications links are likely to be degraded. At those times, the military will be forced to rely more heavily on its own satellites, which are designed to resist jamming and interference</span>. Even the Wideband Global Satcom constellation, which will be less sophisticated than the AEHF constellation in terms of security, gives users the ability to monitor spectrum and power to limit interference of signals, the Air Force said. In a contested environment, data transmission speeds may be lower, but military communications traffic will continue to flow. In the event of a nuclear war, “we need to be able to operate and to communicate, but not at the tactical and operational levels as much as at the national nuclear force level,” Rayermann said. While the military wants the ability to maintain communications in any environment, that doesn’t mean it would be wise to pay for all the capacity the Defense Department could possibly need. “One of the challenges is we know we need to be ready but we don’t know when and where,” Rayermann said. Given that uncertainty, military planners envision paying for moderate global capability and establishing the contracts and agreements with commercial providers that would allow the department to cope with a sudden surge in demand.<br />

Satellite operators and service providers have spun-off government entities specifically to serve military and government customers more efficiently, and these divisions account for a growing revenue stream with little sign of slowing down. Increased military bandwidth requirements over the long term lead to a question of deploying more satellite capacity in order to support a relatively stable business, yet satellite operators have not taken risks even when the Pentagon has indicated that it cannot be selfreliant until at least the year 2020. The move is understandable given that longer term military contracts are hard to come by, unlike the video markets where transponder capacity is signed over the long term. On the military side, a seemingly growing bandwidth crunch has led to plans to increase deployment of proprietary satellite assets, which cost in the $billions. Programs such as Wideband Gapfiller Satellite (WGS), Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and the Transformational Satellite Communications System (TSAT) have been slated as budget line items to specifically address the growing bandwidth needs of the U.S. Military. However, budget processes are oftentimes arduous and protracted in justifying procurement of such assets, particularly during times when governments are faced with other seemingly more pressing issues such as financial bailouts in order to restore the health of their economy, if not the entire global financial system. Budget Considerations in Light of the Current State of the Global Economy Consequences of budget processes inherent in government procurement often lead to delays of programs, reduction of the original capability of programs, or the outright cancellation of such programs. However, as requirements for war fighting that inherently incorporate next-generation systems like communications-on-the-move (COTM) capabilities need to become more integrated in a defense network umbrella, delays, cutbacks or cancellations impede or even handicap a nation’s ability to project power. The current state of the global economy certainly puts into question many priorities in terms of civil needs and military needs. On balance, as a new administration takes the reigns of power in the United States, it puts priorities in serving America’s needs while protecting the safety and interests of its citizens at home and abroad. Spending for civil priorities at home such as a jobs creation program that address immediate needs will likely take precedence over next-generation military programs. Bandwidth requirements for the U.S. Military may seem a minor consideration as funds for bank and auto industry bailouts among others are debated in the U.S. Congress. The scale as well as the priority by which other industries is put ahead of programs including military resource build-up leads to alternative thinking that should address both budget savings and resource improvement in light of the current economic turmoil the U.S. and the globe has to undergo within the next year or two. An idea that has been regularly discussed in light of budget considerations is to host a government or military payload on a commercial satellite. Dual-use programs for use by both commercial and government clients have actually been in existence and have worked quite well for other governments like Australia and South Korea. Will hosted payloads or dual-use satellite systems work just as well for the U.S. Military, the largest government entity that uses commercial satellite bandwidth? And will other nations continue to practice hosted payload arrangements or will their own technical requirements lead to proprietary satellite program deployment as well? Military and Government demand for Commercial Satellite Services</span> <span class="Underline"><strong>Reliance on commercial satellite assets is now a foregone conclusion</strong> and will remain a key component of U.S. and international government/military strategies for the foreseeable future</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Commercial satellite operators, specifically Intelsat, Eutelsat and SES Global, have accounted for a large percentage of U.S. Military leases and their government arms see continued growth in both transponder uptake and revenue streams for services over the near term. But as mentioned earlier, even with admission from the Pentagon that a bandwidth gap exists and is likely growing, Intelsat, Eutelsat and SES have not disclosed plans to launch satellites over the globe’s hotspots like Iraq and Afghanistan. Once again, government procurement as seen historically is unlike video customers that sign leases over the long term. Interviews by NSR with these operators point to the fact that</span><span class="Underline"><strong>the U.S. Government seems to be more open to a closer partnership. Whether these discussions lead to long term leases</strong> capacity on<strong>or to</strong><strong>put payloads on commercial satellites will depend on contract vehicles over the next few years</strong></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It is quite apparent from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) itself that</span> <span class="Underline"><strong>even with the launch of its own proprietary assets, net-centric warfare will require bandwidth that is at least twice the capability of the WGS constellation</strong>. An inflection point in 2010</span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(see curve above)</span> <span class="Underline">is foreseen by the Pentagon where<strong>a sudden surge of demand from less than 20 [gigabytes per second]</strong>Gbps<strong>of capacity surges to over 30</strong>Gbps of demand<strong>by 2012, jumping</strong>further<strong>to</strong>approach<strong>50</strong>Gbps<strong>by 2019</strong></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span> <span class="Underline"><strong>Currently, the Pentagon’s answer to its bandwidth shortfall is to outsource what it needs to commercial satellite operators</strong></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The DoD has outlined commercial bandwidth needs by frequency and by region of the globe until 2019 [2]. Historically,</span> <span class="Underline">the largest cost of commercial outsourcing</span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">as seen in Figure 3</span> <span class="Underline">to the U.S. Military has been bandwidth, accounting for 87% of all spending</span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">form 2000-2005. The next line item,</span> <span class="Underline">equipment purchases, account for a mere 4% of total spending</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In its own projections, NSR adheres to the U.S. Military’s view that indeed, the Pentagon will have little choice but to outsource capacity to commercial operators [1]. However, the launch of new internal capacity should have some effect on commercial demand such that developments in equipment and frequency will have to move form commercial to proprietary developments. Moreover, the call for withdrawal of troops in Iraq as well as the budget crunch in the U.S. should further lead to decreasing commercial bandwidth demand in the near term. Commercial capacity demand by the U.S. Military should diminish but not disappear. The commercial market in terms of bandwidth demand has likely peaked in 2008 and will likely begin to decline until 2014 before growing at positive levels once again beginning in 2015. Militaries and civil government agencies have outsourced bandwidth requirements on traditional commercial C-band and Ku-band transponders, as well as X-band that fall under the exclusive use of non-commercial customers. In the future, commercial Ka-band transponders are expected to be used more extensively by government customers as well. The growth of commercially outsourced bandwidth has been steady since 2003 for both U.S. and non-U.S. government users. As applications and communications requirements grow over time and commercially outsourced bandwidth begin to be integrated more fully in Netcentric warfare, security requirements that may not be at the level that the U.S. Military may be used to have to be addressed. And therein lies one of the challenges of incorporating commercial capacity that puts into question whether it is indeed compelling to dual-use or hosted payload solutions as a sound and/or viable option for the U.S. and other military entities around the globe. Issues with Hosted Payloads Militaries have invested on highly expensive systems and paid very high premiums due to requirements that are oftentimes not met by commercial bandwidth resources. Uppermost in the minds of military users are the following requirements. • Security • Reliability • Availability • Cost The current and planned resources of the U.S. Military have the following attributes: • Defense Satellite Communications System DSCS satellites use super-high frequencies for secure, jam-proof voice and data communications among defense officials, battlefield commanders, ground troops, aircraft, ships, the White House and the State Department. They also carry space operations communications and early warning data. • Wideband Gapfiller Satellite (WGS), the replacement to DSCS, provides greater capability and bandwidth than all the DSCS satellites combined while keeping security and other features intact for X-band and Ka-band. • The constellation of Milstar satellites provide secure, jam resistant, worldwide communications in EHF, linking command authorities with ships, submarines, aircraft and ground stations. Milstars are the most secure of the various communications satellites. They resist jamming and are hardened against nuclear attack. Milstars can operate in any combat environment with a low probability of detection or interception. • The AEHF constellation is the successor to Milstar. The physics of the AEHF waveform make the satellites well suited for strategic communications in a nuclear stressed environment. The tight beam is an enormous benefit to tactical and special operations units due to the low probability of detection and interception. • Mobile User Operational Satellite (MUOS), a next-generation constellation will not be affected by weather, environmental constraints or foliage in UHF. Under the new system, even troops in the most remote locations or buildings with no satellite access would see a big increase in communications capabilities. • Finally, TSAT, which has an Advanced Polar System (APS), will support strategic and national users in the polar region in EHF. The APS is designed to withstand nuclear attacks and support the strategic mission with uninterrupted service. These satellites introduce the use of jam-resistant laser crosslinks for interconnection. Of all the issues that are paramount in the military’s mind, cost is the one component that provides a distinct disadvantage when proprietary military systems are assessed against commercial services. The next-generation satellites planned for the U.S. Military as noted above – WGS, AEHF, MUOS and TSAT – have had cost overruns as well as delays in delivery. And here, the case for hosted payloads is perhaps the most compelling when cost considerations become increasingly important as government budgets, due to economic turmoil, are stressed. Military Proprietary Satellites Programs: An update</span> <span class="Underline"><strong>The current generation of military satellite systems</strong></span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">for the U.S. Department of Defense</span> <span class="Underline"><strong>is about to reach their end of life</strong></span>.<span class="Underline"><strong>Next-generation systems such as</strong></span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">the WGS,</span> <span class="Underline"><strong>AEHF</strong></span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">and MUOS are likely to be deployed within the next several years. In fact, the first WGS satellite was launched in October 2007 and is currently operational for use by the U.S. Pacific Command. Other governments are likewise deploying proprietary military assets that add to the resources of allied militaries around the globe. However,</span> <span class="Underline">there are two issues that have haunted military procurement that</span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">once again</span> <span class="Underline">favor the case for hosted payloads</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. -</span> <span class="Underline">Speed to Deployment: The schedule for deploying next-generation assets<strong>has been delayed, which led to commercial outsourcing</strong></span>in terms<span class="Underline"><strong>of bandwidth</strong>needs for Iraq and Afghanistan. Continued activities in these countries will likely put pressure on commercially available capacity covering these two countries. More importantly,<strong>another flashpoint</strong>around the globe such as a new hotspot <strong>in the Middle East, South Asia or the Horn of Africa will strain available commercial bandwidth sources further</strong></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. -</span> <span class="Underline">Cost and Funding issues: As mentioned earlier,<strong>cost and funding issues</strong>continue to haunt next-generation satellite deployment</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. TSAT has been a victim of budget cuts where the constellation was originally planned or scheduled to be launched around the 2012-2014 period but has now been postponed for 2019. It is thus easy to speculate that the program may ultimately be cancelled due to funding shortfalls. In a more recent development, it was announced earlier this year that</span> <span class="Underline">technical issues encountered during testing</span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">and the need to swap out some faulty components</span> <span class="Underline"><strong>have delayed</strong> the U.S. Air Force's first<strong>AEHF</strong>satellite and added some $259 million to the program's overall cost</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The AEHF program's cost grew significantly in 2008 after Congress, concerned about the Air Force's ability to deliver TSAT on schedule, directed the service to buy a fourth satellite in the series. Although the third AEHF satellite was expected to cost $939 million, restarting production to build the fourth will cost $2.6 billion, according to a Sept. 30, 2008 Pentagon acquisition cost summary [3]. The addition of the fourth satellite brought the total estimated cost of the AEHF program to $9.9 billion, triggering a mandatory recertification of the program by the Pentagon. The Figure 5 above and 6 below shows the aggregate total capacity from programs such as WGS, MUOS, AEHF and TSAT, among many more that are currently expected to enter into service in the next six years [1]. This information comes from various official and historical data sources and U.S. and international programs manufacturer contacted by NSR. The figures above show a large addition of capacity for proprietary systems around the globe. This is dominated by the U.S. Military with the launch of WGS, MUOS, and AEHF and included in the chart is TSAT as well, although the TSAT program may be rescheduled or cancelled. Host government/military payloads on commercial satellites – a recap In 2003, the Optus and Defense C1 satellite was launched, carrying a mixed payload that now serves the needs of Singtel Optus Pty Limited and the Australian Department of Defense for Australia, New Zealand and East Asia. The satellite operates in four frequency bands: • Commercial services in Ku-band for Singtel Optus • Military communications at UHF, X-band and Ka-band for the Australian Department of Defense. Optus uses C1's Ku-band payload to distribute video, DTH, telephony and Internet connections to remote areas. For the Australian Department of Defense, the satellite's Kaband payload provides high-data rate broadcast coverage for video, voice and data communications. The satellite’s X-band provides medium-to-high data rate voice and data for land and maritime applications. And finally, the UHF payload provides secure low-rate voice and data communications to mobile platforms. In Asia, South Korea launched its first civil-military dual-use communication satellite in August 2006, a move that introduced cutting-edge warfare systems in its overall capability. The dual-use satellite carries 12 military relay terminals and 24 commercial terminals, whereby the 12 military relays are capable of covering troop communications from the Malacca Strait to the Central Pacific sea areas. Prior to the satellite’s launch, the South Korean military relied on ground-based communication systems; however, the system using underground military cables or microwave relay towers was vulnerable to enemy attack. The dual-use satellite system has been successful thus far such that South Korea plans to deploy a total of 20 satellites, including eight multipurpose satellites, by 2015 [Koreasat]. One of the key benefits of dual use systems include reduced costs compared to internal asset build-up. A case in point is the recent budget challenges faced by the U.S. Military’s TSAT program, which took a serious hit in FY2009. This will have a dramatic impact on U.S. Military capabilities as the bandwidth the U.S. had planned on owning internally will be drastically reduced within the time frame set forth in the original schedule of the program. Dual-use systems or</span> <span class="Underline"><strong>hosted payloads</strong> that also draw on commercial customers<strong>cost a fraction of proprietary assets</strong></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. To illustrate, U.S. Military procurement of military satellites costs run in the billions of US dollars, while hosted payloads or dual-use satellites such as Australia’s Optus and Defense C1 cost $500 million. Even with payload and bus enhancements, where the costs of which are shared with the commercial operator or partner, the total price tag is far below deploying and owning a proprietary military system.</span> <span class="Underline">The other benefit of dual use or hosted payloads is the speed by which assets are deployed. Even if TSAT were to be deployed based on the original scope of five satellites, the delays that are now expected to take place, where first launch has been moved from 2013 to 2016 at the earliest, means that bandwidth planning and systems capability will have to likewise be delayed. Barring other available alternatives, commercial outsourcing will once again have to take up the slack</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. These considerations appear to be in full view of the U.S. Military’s system planners. In July 2008, AGS (the U.S. government services affiliate of SES Global) announced that it was awarded a contract by the U.S. Air Force to host an experimental sensor on board a commercial spacecraft. The three-year $65 million firm fixed price contract will host the experimental sensor on board an SES AMERICOM spacecraft scheduled to be launched in 2010 and will operate over the United States. The program, known as the Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload (CHIRP) Flight Demonstration Program, will have the primary purpose of testing a new type of infrared sensor from geo-synchronous altitude. The passive infrared sensor will be integrated onto a commercial satellite so that it can be launched into orbit, and the data can then be transmitted to the ground for analysis. Although the CHIRP program is for experimental purposes only and also not designed to address the communications mission and bandwidth shortfall faced by the U.S. Military,</span> <span class="Underline">one cannot help but ponder whether the next line of contracts coming from the U.S. Government will be for dual use satellites</span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">similar to the Australia and South Korean models</span> <span class="Underline">or for hosted payloads</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It seems that the move is catching on as the 2009 Budget Request of the US. Navy included $42M over the next two years for a UHF satcom hosted payload to serve as an interim while the transition from the Ultra High Frequency Operational satellite (UFO) to the MUOS constellations take place. This would be a small prototype UHF payload to be outfitted as a secondary payload on an existing commercial spacecraft design. The Request for Proposal has been issued and the launch is expected in 2011 after a selection in late 2009. The impetus is there, having granted a contract to SES and discussions are more prevalent from both the military side as well as the commercial operator side. For the military, cost and speed provide compelling arguments to deploy a dual-use or hosted payload satellite system. For commercial satellite operators, cost-sharing, long-term contracting and an anchored tenant provide invaluable benefits in a business that is inherently risky given the 15-year life of the asset. This may mean that new and innovative procurements to provide capacity to bridge military customers needs is becoming a recognized acquisition procedure. However, technical concerns will still have to be addressed in order to ensure full reliability of the system. These issues and concerns include: Technical Attributes • Frequency coordination issues • Interference issues • Performance issues Technical Concerns • On the commercial operator side, will the hosted payload interfere with the operation of the satellite? • On the military side, will the commercial payload limit the performance of the military hosted payload? • Will the military customer accept that a commercial operator, with a larger stake in-orbit on the same platform take precedence and control over the satellite, hence its payload? Easy Retrofit or Large-scale Re-engineering • From a satellite manufacturer’s point of view, is a hosted payload system where the U.S. Military will have high technical requirements lead to wide-scale system’s development? • Will delivery time be impacted by the military payload? The Bottom Line In 2008,</span> <span class="Underline">Pentagon leaders disclosed that non-traditional conflicts such as the insurgents and terrorists facing coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan will be the main military battlefields for years to come. The classified Pentagon assessment likewise concluded that<strong>the U.S. Military in</strong></span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">many respects including</span> <span class="Underline"><strong>its</strong> <strong>bandwidth resources</strong><strong>is prevented from improving its ability to respond to any new crisis such as potential outbreaks in North Korea, Iran, Lebanon or China</strong></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span> <span class="Underline"><strong>Hosted payloads provide</strong> a vehicle by which<strong>cost savings and speed of deployment</strong>are enabled by the commercial sector.

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as “No. 1” and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">slow to withdraw</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">jostling for status and influence </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">among these ambitious nations and would-be nations </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">is a</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">second </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">defining feature of the new post-Cold War</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> international </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">system. Nationalism in all</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> its </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">forms is back</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, if it ever went away, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> — its regional as well as its global predominance. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Were the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">to diminish its influence</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">other nations would settle disputes as</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> great and lesser </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">powers have done in the past</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">often through confrontation and wars</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">It is easy but</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> also </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">dangerous to underestimate the role the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">plays in providing</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> a measure of </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">is</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited States </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">engages in</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> a </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> genuinely </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">multipolar world</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, however, it would not. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Nations would compete for naval dominance</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Conflict</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> between nations </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">would involve</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> struggles on </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the oceans</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> as well as on land. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Armed embargos</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">would disrupt trade flows</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in a way that is now impossible. Such </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">order</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> as exists </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in the world rests</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> not merely on the goodwill of peoples but </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">on</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> a foundation provided by </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">American power.</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">even today Europe’s stability depends on the guarantee, however distant</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and one hopes unnecessary, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">that the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> genuinely </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">multipolar world, that would</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> not be possible without </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">renew</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">ing </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">among nations </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">would be preferable</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> to the present American predominance often </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">succumb to a basic</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> logical </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">fallacy</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that’s not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and institutions. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">It is shaped by</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> configurations of </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">a multipolar world</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">would produce its own kind of order</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world’s great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">weakens or withdraws</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in East Asia</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, where </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">most nations agree</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> that a reliable </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">American power has a stabilizing</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and pacific </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">effect</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> on the region. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">That is certainly the view of</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> most of </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">China’s neighbors</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. But </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">even China,</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, independent, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">nationalist Japan. In Europe</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, too, the </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">departure of the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates from the scene — even if it remained the world’s most powerful nation — could be destabilizing. It </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">potentially </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">forceful approach to</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> unruly </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">nations on its periphery</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates withdrew from Europe — if it </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">adopted</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> what some call a strategy of </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">“offshore balancing” — this could</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in time </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> near </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">neighbors, which could in turn draw the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">back in under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> that a retrenchment of the American position </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in the Middle East</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> assumption of a more passive, “</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">offshore” role would lead to</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> greater </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">stability</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> there. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The vital interest the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">has in</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> access to </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">oil and the role it plays in keeping access</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> open </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more “even-handed” policy toward Israel</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">obviate the need to come to Israel’s aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the American </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">commitment to protect</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> strategic </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">oil supplies for most of the world</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, practically </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">ensures a heavy American military presence</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> both inside and outside the region </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">has raged for at least two centuries</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn’t change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The alternative to American predominance</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in the region </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">deeper involvement by both </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">China and Russia</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, if only to secure their interests. 18 </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">And</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum.</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn’t changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to “normal” or to a new kind of stability in the region</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements.</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.</span><br />

<span class="SmalltextChar">Perceptions of change in the relative power of nations are of critical importance to understanding the relationship between decline and war. One of </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the oldest generalization</span><span class="SmalltextChar">s </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">about international politics attributes the onset of major wars to shifts in power among the leading nations</span><span class="SmalltextChar">.

<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">U.S. space policy</span> in the two decades since the end of the Cold War <span style="font-size: 11pt;">has been evolving against a backdrop of uncertainty. Technological developments shape and redistribute power resources relevant to space security activities, and game-changing advances in space technologies </span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">could emerge at any time</span>. Also, space activities involve an increasing number and variety of actors. Whereas states have been dominant in the past, recent trends suggest an increasing trend toward privatization of space activities, with private launches and space tourism on the horizon. While the same context influences many other countries as well, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the central role of U.S. space activities on the global stage generates particular attention. This is especially true of U.S. policies and activities regarding military security in space. The U.S. space security position is widely understood to be world dominant, and so U.S. behavior naturally overshadows and shapes the behavior of others. U.S. behavior, however, does not necessarily “set the tone.” Rather, the reactions of other countries and non-state actors to the directions of U.S. policies and activities are inevitably filtered through their own outlooks. Although cooperative and multilateral tacks in U.S. government policies generally have a palliative effect on the global atmosphere,U.S. policy-makers do not characteristically assume that cooperative gestures will routinely elicit quid pro quo responses. </span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">That </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">additional uncertainty</span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">underliesthe </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">ongoing tension between “nationalist” and “internationalist” impulses in U.S. policy-making on space</span> (as on many other issues) <span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">and </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in turn magnifies global uncertainties concerning the future of space governance</span>. During the Cold War, national security concerns dominated U.S. space activities. While manned missions and commercial opportunities occupied prominent positions in the public image, with NASA becoming the “face” of the U.S. space posture, activities from Sputnik onward were inspired by — and funding for them justified by — the underlying security competition with the Soviet Union. Importantly for current circumstances, this Cold War posture became entrenched in core attitudes and bureaucratic practices across much of the space community. As a result, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">even as Cold War ended, U.S. space policy could not easily diverge from its focus on national security</span>. For example, the 1996 National Space Policy issued by the Clinton administration, while envisioning greater “partnership and cooperation” internationally, aimed to maintain a U.S. “leadership role” across the full range of space activities. Guidelines for security activities in space were prominent, and while these guidelines included provisions for arms control as well as expressly military activities, the policy less effectively explained how tensions in these aims would be reconciled.1 Moreover, the overarching tone of the policy was to view U.S. space activities as derivative of broader national goals, rather than constituting national goals in themselves, continuing a trend since the end of the Apollo missions. As is well understood, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the space policies of the Bush administration were decidedly oriented toward military security concerns and independent action</span>. The 2006 National Space Policy unabashedly proclaimed the U.S. intention to maintain a dominant position in space indefinitely. This policy orientation dismissed multilateral cooperation as impinging on U.S. “freedom of action,” throwing weight instead behind a wide range of technology development initiatives founded on the assumption that deployment of weapons in space was, if not already factual, certainly inevitable.2 U.S. commercial and civil engagement was overshadowed by these security concerns, expressed through the tightening of export control restrictions inhibiting a broad range of technology sharing. Once again, U.S. space policy was subsumed by other national priorities, in this case dominated by military security concerns. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">This background is essential for appreciating how the space policies of the Obama administration are beginning to genuinely break new trails. The U.S. National Space Policy issued in June 2010 has been widely recognized for its cooperative and multilateral tone, including as explicit near-term goals the expansion of international cooperation on all activities and pursuing international as well as national measures to enhance space stability. Particularly notable are the document’s emphasis on orienting U.S. “leadership” toward fostering international cooperation</span>, and its references, in its concluding section, to cooperation with other states and non-state actors in the pursuit of national security space objectives.3 Less broadly noticed was this policy’s clarity and coherence in articulating a vision for U.S. space activities on its own terms. The document is organized around core principles, subsidiary goals and implementing guidelines that exceed its predecessors in delineating a longer-term direction for U.S. space policy that is integrated with, rather than derivative of, broader U.S. global aims.4 The policy also was generated and issued far earlier in the tenure of the administration than either of its predecessors, indicating an increased prioritization of attention to space policy at higher levels of policy-making. To some degree, a turn toward multilateral cooperation in U.S. space policy was to be expected. China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision increased awareness of the challenge of space debris and the need for better global information sharing on space situational awareness (SSA).5 Also, new budget realities and unpromising technological developments have scaled back ambitions in some quarters for solving U.S. space security concerns with new independent capabilities. Finally, the Obama administration has pursued a more cooperative disposition across a wide range of global policy challenges, from Iranian nuclear ambitions to global climate change. But the improved clarity of vision in the 2010 Space Policy suggests that the emphasis on fostering global cooperation on space-related activities is more grounded in deliberate foresight than sailing the prevailing political winds. The 2011 National Security Space Strategy, released February 4, is best interpreted against this background of the Obama administration’s turn toward both greater international space cooperation and greater attention to space policy in general. This first-of-its-kind strategic statement culminates a congressionally mandated space posture review.6 The initial section portraying the strategic environment to which U.S. security policy must be responsive highlights the growing problems of space debris, orbital congestion and coordination among a growing number of space actors — not state-based security threats per se. The Security Space Strategy features the objective of a “stable space environment in which nations exercise shared responsibility.”7 Specific provisions intended to implement this strategy, relevant to the preceding observations, include:8 • The strategy presents a full section on “Partnering with Responsible Nations, International Organizations, and Commercial Firms.” This category is not wholly multilateral in the traditional sense, displaying a symbiosis of alliance-building and collective cooperation not always carefully distinguished; i.e., “The United States will lead in building coalitions of like-minded space-faring nations and, where appropriate, work with international institutions to do so.” • The strategy intends to “encourage responsible behavior in space and lead by the power of example,” a significant observation given the tendency of U.S. policy-makers (as noted above) not to expect quid pro quo responses to cooperative gestures. Also, the strategy states the U.S. “will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, and norms of behavior for responsible space operations.” [italics added] In the context of the section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression,” the strategy similarly intends to “support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space” as well as “pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint,” along with other measures. This emphasis on norm-building and the role of example suggests a near-term endorsement of the development of “codes of conduct” for space activities (such as the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct, discussed below), whether or not such concord leads to more formal arms control arrangements in the longer-term. • The Department of Defense is directed to “foster cooperative SSA relationships,” and to “expand provision of safety of flight services to U.S. Government agencies, other nations, and commercial firms.” Greater SSA information sharing has been a key suggestion for fostering international cooperation; the U.S. possesses globally superior SSA capabilities, but restricts the sharing of this information on the basis of national security concerns.9 Hence, this nominal commitment is significant in its own right. • The strategy commits to reforming export controls. “In particular, as new opportunities arise for international collaboration, a revised export control system will better enable the domestic firms competing for these contracts.” As noted above, the oppressive impact of current U.S. export controls not only impinges on U.S. commercial space actors but also epitomizes the high degree to which U.S. policy has subsumed commercial and civil interests to national security concerns. The strategy appears to acknowledge this connection and commit to remedy it. • The most assertive passages of the statement are moderated with community-building intent. For example, the strategy’s section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression” concludes that the U.S. “will retain the right and capabilities to respond in self-defense, should deterrence fail,” but immediately adds that the U.S. “will use force in a manner that is consistent with longstanding principles of international law, treaties to which the United States is a party, and the inherent right of self defense.” • The concluding and most conflict-oriented section of the strategy opens by noting that “some actors may still believe counterspace actions could provide military advantage.” Counterspace capabilities, unarticulated in the document, include ASATs, ground-based directed energy weapons and satellite transmission jamming. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy Gregory Schulte explained at the strategy’s rollout that China is a principal concern in this regard, but so is the proliferation of these technologies: “If Ethiopia can jam a commercial satellite, you have to worry what others can do.”10 This section of the strategy does not, however, call for maintaining options to develop complementary space conflict capabilities. Rather, the strategy asserts that the U.S. “must be prepared to ‘fight through’ a degraded environment,” and identifies “resilience” and “space protection” as the key criteria. The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective, highlighting those elements expressing consistency with the 2010 National Space Policy’s bend toward fostering greater international collaboration. Perhaps as striking as the prevalence of such passages, however, is the absence of expressed intention — even couched in hedging language — to sustain or expand the kind of independent space-based military capabilities that were the centerpiece of the prior administration’s aims (if not its accomplishments). Again, to some extent this turn in tone is overdetermined by extenuating global circumstances. But one must still be struck by the degree to which developments such as the Chinese ASAT test have not ignited the kind of response one might have anticipated only a few short years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its sends concerning U.S. policy</span> toward the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct.12 The strategy did not explicitly endorse this EU initiative, but Mr. Schulte, at the February 4 presentation of the strategy, highlighted the initiative <span style="font-size: 11pt;">“as a potential way” to promote “transparency and confidence-building measures</span>, which tend to be voluntary as opposed to legally binding.” A week earlier, Rose Gottemoeller, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, stated at the Conference on Disarmament that the administration was nearing a decision on whether the U.S. would sign on to the code, and what modifications might be required in order to do so.13 As U.S. interest in the Code of Conduct has increased, debates over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">These policy movements toward multilateral engagementand commitment to behavioral standards (even if non-binding) mark a sharp departure from the stiff resistance to curtailing U.S. “freedom of action” in the previous administration,and have accordingly generated resistance from congressional opponents on just those terms</span>. Prior to the release of the National Security Space Strategy, a group of 37 Republican senators led by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl issued a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concern over a potential multilateral commitment that might limit development and/or deployment of space-based missile defense interceptors and ASAT-defeating systems.14 <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Critics also decried the strategy’s emphasis on “the old fallacious assumption that the power of example will prevent adversaries from doing the United States harm,” and endorsed maintaining the goal of U.S. retention of a “dominant position in military and intelligence space capabilities.”</span>15 In fact, the administration’s warming toward normative commitments in general — and the EU Code of Conduct in particular — are in part intended to forestall pressure for more formal and binding measures that would definitively cut off the “hedge” of unilateral U.S. weapons development options.16 <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The balance of U.S. debate may have shifted toward greater international cooperation, but the terms of the debate remain the same</span>. In sum, the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing in U.S. policy toward greater global engagement but also, and more importantly, a step toward greater long-term coherence in thinking concerning the core goals of U.S. space activities. Even supporters of the general directions of the strategy noted its more-than-expected breadth of thought.17 <span style="font-size: 11pt;">But if this reading is sound, the strategy is still but one step on a long road</span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and ongoing debates over the role of U.S. space policy vis-à-vis broader national security interests will insure that road is bumpy</span>. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">more specific guidelines for military implementation of the strategy remain to be developed</span>.18 <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Many devils may lurk in these details</span>.<br />

Last Friday, the U.S. Defense Department released the new National Security Space Strategy. The decade long policy is meant to help direct the U.S. Government in terms of Obama’s National Space Policy. Deputy Defense Secretary, Gregory Schulte said this policy is aimed at making the United States &quot;more resilient&quot; and capable of protecting its holdings in an increasingly trafficked and at times hostile setting. <span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">In the N</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">ational </span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">pace </span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">P</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">olicy</span>, announced in June 2010, <span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">an </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">emphasis was put on the “reliance on commercial space activities” including “hosting government payloads on commercial spacecraft</span> and purchasing of data products.” Schute also mentioned that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">U.S. Defense Department officials are working with Australia on sharing space situational awareness and are figuring out how the DoD can host payloads on their satellites. “And we’re looking for a whole range of activities to implement the new strategy in a budget-constrained environment</span>,” he said. In an article on MSNBC.com, it was mentioned that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">both the National Security Space Strategy and theNational Space Policy reflect a policy shift in response to space security. There is now a focus on the threats of anti-satellite weapons and the growing amount of space debris. We are also in a time where there are almost 60 different commercial companies or countries that own or operate assets in space</span>. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Both the Space Policy and the Security Strategy come at an important time in the space world. Given tight budgets, and possibly even tighter budgets in the future, international cooperation will be helpful</span>. In the MSNBC.com article, Schulte stated that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the D</span>epartment <span style="font-size: 11pt;">o</span>f <span style="font-size: 11pt;">D</span>efense <span style="font-size: 11pt;">has begun talking about hosting payloads on commercial satellitesin the &quot;budget-constrained environment</span>.&quot; <span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">The policy is not expected to be actually implemented for another ten years</span>. By then, will the threat of space debris become a crisis? Having multiple payloads on board a satellite would help decrease the amount of debris down the line, but the question remains:How soon till a policy is actually implemented?<br />

A. Option Set I: Leverage foreign launch providers <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Multinational alliances and globalization across the entire commercial space sector</span>, especially in the communications satellite segment, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">have increased tremendously, presenting both new challenges and opportunities for U.S. national security</span>.’ The March 12, 2010, Space Posture Review: Interim Report states, “Growing international and commercial interest and expertise in space presents opportunities for the United States for further collaboration and partnership in support of U.S. national security space activities, and the global community at large.” This option set explores two approaches to leveraging foreign launch providers—(l) <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the U.S. government may enter into explicit partnerships with foreign providers to assure launch forcommercial and government payloads</span>; or (2) the U.S. government may reevaluate, remove, or streamline certain export control policies and regulations. While the analysis and evaluation of this option set focuses on improving commercial launch customers‘ access to space, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the policies and actions regarding foreign launch providers have been in the past—and most likely will continue to be—used to leverage trade policy, technology control and innovation policy, geopolitics, and national security</span>. U.S. government interaction with foreign launch providers has a complex history, often following several avenues at once and often at cross purposes. A. l. Possible actions. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Recognizing the importance of commercial launch capabilities internationally and nationally, the U.S. government could explore avenues to leverage the world launch market by entering into strategic partnerships</span><span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. </span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Current U.S. government international cooperation—including DoD partnerships to conduct space operations—is a patchwork of agreements that vary according to the nations involved and make collaboration among multiple partners more difficult. This patchwork reﬂects the simple fact that there is no coherent. structured U.S. government strategy for commercial space access that can create synergies within international relationships. The Space Posture Review: Interim Report notes, “The long history of cooperation in civilian space programs and U.S. government partnerships with commercial space service providers can serve as a foundation for collaborative global action to shape the future space environment</span><span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.&quot; </span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">One example of such collaboration would be a U.S. government-Arianespace</span>, ILS, CGWIC, or ISRO‘ <span style="font-size: 11pt;">partnership to utilize foreign launch sitesand assure launch access prioritization. </span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">The U.S. government would enter into negotiations to assure mutual access to and sharing of industrial base</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> capacities and </span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">capabilities</span><span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.</span></strong></span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">Such arrangements could begin with</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> national security assets on commercial satellites with hosted payloads. The main goal would be to view the launch enterprise as a global one, with a global industrial base and global interests. One goal, from a U.S. perspective, would be to ensure it maintains access to space in the face of technical launch problems or natural or man-made disasters affecting U.S. launch sites</span>. To more effectively leverage foreign launch providers and improve access for commercial launch customers, the United States should consider using existing legal authority, such as detailed in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and I991, to issue export authorizations for commercial satellite launches, consistent with national security requirements, to all foreign launch providers. The United States should also seek to reform its complex system of U.S. export control laws and regulations. U.S. access to foreign space capabilities faces a signiﬁcant challenge because of this complex system, which fails to acknowledge the dynamics of global space commerce. Action to address this could consist of statutory and regulatory reform, including, but not limited to, possible changes to the ITAR that implement the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778). In the last several years, the Departments of State, Defense, and Commerce have undertaken numerous export control reviews with a push toward actionable recommendations. Most recently, President Obama formed an interagency task force in August 2009 to review export regulations. He announced initial results of his administration's efforts at a March 2010 U.S. Export-Import Bank conference, noting that the “reform program will enhance national security by focusing on the enforcement of strict controls around the export of the most critical technologies and products, while strengthening the competitiveness of key manufacturing industries in the U.S. by streamlining the regulations that apply to their exports“ Several options are under consideration for reforming this system: In Congress, efforts7 are under way to update the Export Administration Act, writ large, and several legislators have voiced strong support, in particular for moving satellites and related components from the State Department-administered U.S. Munitions List (USML) to the Commerce Department-administered Commercial Control List (CCL). These endeavors complement broader efforts in the executive branch to reform the “byzantine amalgam of authorities, roles, and missions scattered around different parts of the federal government&quot; and update antiquated Cold War restrictions found in the Arms Export Control Act and Export Administration Act, in part by creating a single export control list. ln April 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates outlined an export control reform plan that includes “a single export-control list, a single licensing agency, a single enforcement-coordination agency, and a single information-technology system,“ with possible changes enacted before the end of the year. Although implementation details remain undeﬁned, including the extent and likelihood of needed legislation, this plan has the potential to reform to a signiﬁcant degree U.S. export control policies and administration. A third approach would involve using a last-tracking system such as the one developed alter the launch of Operation Enduring Freedom: executive branch agencies could identify tiers of allies for which to speed up reviews while operating within existing legislation and using existing control lists. Reforming the “rule set“ for how ITAR is applied could also be valuable by offering a reassessment of which technologies need to be controlled for export and dealing with issues of timing. review. transparency. and cost in the export licensing process.” A.2. Potential beneﬁts. As the Space Posture Review: Interim Report states succinctly: “<span style="font-size: 11pt;">New opportunities for partnershipand collaboration with both international and commercial space actorshave the potential to support future national security space activities and enhance U.S. leadership</span>.&quot;&quot; <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Forming alliances</span><span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. </span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Encouraging cooperation with foreign entities could provide several beneﬁts to the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span>tates, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">including ensuring continued U.S. access to space after a technical failure or a launch facility calamity. strengthening the competitive position of the U.S. commercial satellite sector. enhancing the U.S. position in partnerships, and reinforcing collaboration among other space-faring nations</span>. As the Booz, Allen 8: Hamilton 2000 defense industry &quot;Viewpoint&quot; notes, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">strategic commercial alliances: (l) provide capabilities to expand quickly service offerings and markets in ways not possible under time and resource constraints; (2) earn a rate of return 50 percent higher than base businesses—&quot;retums more than double as ﬁrms gain experience in alliances&quot;; and (3) are a powerful altemative to acquiring other companies because they “avoid costly accumulation of debt and buildup of balance sheet goodwill.&quot; ‘Z In those respects. international commercial alliances could help U.S. ﬁrms access foreign funding, business systems. space expertise, technology, and intellectual capital and increase U.S. industry's market share overseas, thus providing economic beneﬁts to the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span>tates. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Moreover. U.S. experiences with foreign entities in foreign marketscould help those entities obtain the requisite approvals to operate U.S. govemment satellite systems in other countries, resolve satellite spectrum and coordination issues, and mitigate risks associated with catastrophic domestic launch failures by providing for contingency launch capabilities from foreign nations</span>. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Multinational alliances</span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;"> would also signal U.S. policymakers’ intent to ensure </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">U.S. commercial and military access to space within a cooperative, international domain</span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">help promoteinternational cooperation</span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and build support for U.S. positions within various govemmental and business forums</span>. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">First, </span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 11pt;">partnerships could allow the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 11pt;">to demonstrate greater leadership in mitigating those shared risks related to vulnerability of space assets through launch facility and data sharing, offering improved space situational awareness, establishing collective security agreements for space assets, exploring space deterrence and satellite security doctrines, and formulating and agreeing to rules of the road on the expected peaceful behavior in the space domain</span>.” <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Second, partnerships could also help the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 11pt;">build consensuson important space-related issues in bilateral or multilateral organizations such as the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 11pt;">N</span>ations, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the International Telecommunication Union, and the W</span>orld <span style="font-size: 11pt;">T</span>rade <span style="font-size: 11pt;">O</span>rganization; <span style="font-size: 11pt;">working with emerging spacefaring nations is particularly important because of their growing presence inthe marketplace and participation in international organizations</span>.&quot; <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Third, alliances could serve as a bridge to future collaborative etforts between U.S. national security forces and U.S. allies</span>. For example, civil multinational alliances such as the Intemational Space Station and the intemational search and rescue satellite consortium. Cospas-Sarsat. involve <span style="font-size: 11pt;">multiple countries partnering to use space for common public global purposes</span>.“ <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Finally. developing govemment. business, and professional relationships with people in other countries provides opportunities for the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 11pt;">to further the principles upon which U.S. national security relies—competition, economic stability, and democracy</span>.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">To respond to the proliferation of counterspace weapons, the U</span><span style="background-color: white;">nited</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="background-color: white;">tates</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">is employing new ways to prevent and deter aggressionagainst U.S. and allied space systems. In the contested space environment of today,we can no longer rely solely on the threat of retaliation to protect space systems from attack.We must expand our traditional concepts of deterrence</span><span style="background-color: white;">. Accordingly,</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the National Security Space Strategy outlines the multilayered approach we will take to deter aggression</span><span style="background-color: white;">. This approach includes several important initiatives.</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">First, we are assessingdiplomatic initiatives such as the EU Code of Conduct to promote international norms of responsible behavior</span><span style="background-color: white;">. These initiatives define how responsible space-faring nations are expected to conduct themselves</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">and should over time discourage destabilizing acts that threaten the overall stability of the space domain</span><span style="background-color: white;">. Nations willfully acting contrary to such norms can expect to be isolated as rogue actors.</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Second,we can utilizealliances in spacetoserve the same deterrent function as basing troopsin allied countries.They can ensure an attack on one is an attack on all</span><span style="background-color: white;">.</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">As with terrestrial defense alliances, partnerships in space also can add resilience and capabilities, without relinquishing the strategic advantage our systems provide</span><span style="background-color: white;">. At their fullest,</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">these partnerships could consist of completely interoperable systems in which costs, benefits, and risks are shared among trusted participants</span><span style="background-color: white;">. For instance, Australia recently became a full partner in the Wideband Global Satellite Communications System (WGS), which directly supports warfighters. The cost-savings from our partnership with Australia allowed the Pentagon to procure an additional satellite for the WGS constellation. By sharing the benefits and risks of developing this system, we enhanced our operational capability and raised the cost of aggression against it.</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Increasingly, we will want to operate in coalitions in space, just as we do in other domains</span><span style="background-color: white;">. To achieve this, the department will examine all mission areas to identify where shared interests open the door to greater levels of cooperation. One way to foster greater cooperation is to transform the Joint Space Operations Center, which provides command and control for our space forces, into a Combined Space Operations Center run in concert with international partners. Such an arrangement will allow our partners to work side-by-side with U.S. commanders, improving our situational awareness while integrating a multilateral approach to day-to-day operations. Networking our space operations center with those of our allies offers a further way to expand collaboration. But even as we increasingly work in partnerships, we will maintain some U.S.-only capabilities for our most sensitive national security missions.</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Third,we need to make our space systems more resilient, and our combat power less reliant on their full functioning. This will help deny adversaries the benefit from an attack in space</span><span style="background-color: white;">. Just as in the cyber domain,</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">denying the benefit of attack in space can join retaliatory deterrenceas a disincentive to adversaries</span><span style="background-color: white;">. To maintain our combat power, we are learning how to operate in a degraded information environment. Training exercises where we disrupt space-based capabilities help our forces become proficient at operating with interference. To improve resiliency, we are developing technology to help us mitigate the loss or degradation of on-orbit systems. For instance, we now have ground, air, and naval-based platforms which can increasingly augment or replace space assets. The U.S. military is one of the few militaries today with the capability to operate in all domains on a global basis, and this ability provides a strategic advantage when space capabilities come under threat. Responsive space capabilities which rapidly launch replacements can also play an important role in reconstituting functionality either during or after an attack. And broader partnerships with commercial firms which enable national security payloads to ride on commercial satellites will further improve our resiliency. Hosting military payloads on commercial spacecraft, as we are already doing with a missile warning sensor, is not only cost-effective, it also enables a more diverse, robust, and distributed set of space systems. Finally, the United States views free access to space as a vital national interest. Consistent with our inherent right of self-defense, we will respond accordingly to attacks on it, at a time and place of our choosingand not necessarily in space. Ultimately, deterrence must impact the decision-making of particular countries and leaders in specific scenarios.</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">A multilayered approach to deterrence offers the greatest likelihood of encouraging restraint, and thereby protecting our vital space capabilities from attack</span><span style="background-color: white;">.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">A buildup of space weapons might begin with noble intentions of 'peace through strength' deterrence,but this rationale glosses over the tendency that'…the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use'</span><span style="background-color: white;">.33 This drift toward usage is strengthened by a strategic fact elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, 'anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand'.34</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent 'dual capability' of spaceborne weapon components</span><span style="background-color: white;">. As Marc Vidricaire, Delegation of Canada to the UN Conference on Disarmament, explains: 'If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land'. 35 To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors can also be used as orbiting 'Death Stars', capable of sending munitions hurtling through the Earth's atmosphere.</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense 'use or lose' pressure into strategic calculations, with the spectre of split-second attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting Death Stars withautomated 'hair trigger' devices</span><span style="background-color: white;">. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However,</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidiousseeds of accidental conflict</span><span style="background-color: white;">. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">'complexly interactive, tightly coupled' industrial systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other's flawless performance</span><span style="background-color: white;">. According to Perrow,</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail</span><span style="background-color: white;">. As Perrow explains, '[t]he odd term &quot;normal accident&quot; is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics,</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable'</span><span style="background-color: white;">.36</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Deployment of space weapons with pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to 'normal accidents'</span><span style="background-color: white;">.</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war</span><span style="background-color: white;">. According to retired Lt. Col. Robert M. Bowman,</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;">'even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage — even more than would be done bya nuclear weapon</span><span style="background-color: white;"> of the same size!'. 37 In the same Star Wars technology touted as a quintessential tool of peace, defence analyst David Langford sees one of the most destabilizing offensive weapons ever conceived: 'One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people'.38</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine thatany nation subjected to space weapon attack would retaliate with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemicalweapons.An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen</span><span style="background-color: white;">.</span><br />

The factors that will drive multinational cooperation</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">—cost, limited direct influence over international players through military or economic action, international treaties and organizations, the proliferation of multinational companies and an overall desire by the U.S. to be perceived as a team player—</span></em><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">rely on international cooperation</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> and global interdependence</span></strong><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.</span> Before delving deeper into why America should follow multilateralism, it is best to look closely at the reasons it will not follow the other three models. The technological example set forward by the British Royal Navy during the latter half of the nineteenth century presents an interesting example for U.S. policymakers, but <span style="font-size: 11pt;">scientific knowledge is difficult to contain</span>. At the close of World War II, the U.S. was the only nuclear- capable nation. Despite the tight security placed upon America’s nuclear secrets, fifty-five years later nations from Iraq to North Korea, India and Pakistan have the ability to develop and deploy nuclear weapons. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">In 1960, only two nations were members of the elite space-faring club; today, that number has risen to at least seven</span>, plus the ESA, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">and could well double within the next generation, as technology proliferates across the globe. Furthermore, if technological development is an issue, </span><span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">any group willing to expend the funds </span></strong></span></em><strong>can purchase a satellite on orbit from numerous commercial or governmental agencies<em>.</em></strong><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> If funding is an issue,</span><span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> any number of services can be shared or directly purchased in such areas as communication or surveillance.</span></strong></span> As we have seen, commercial companies, such as SPOT, provide high-resolution imagery for public consumption at a nominal cost. Technological edges cannot be safeguarded or guaranteed in perpetuity, particularly in a global environment. Once the bottle is opened, it is impossible to get the genie back inside. A second alternative policy, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">unilateralism, does preserve freedom of action in the short term; the question, however, is whether U.S. policy should be based upon short-term gain over long-term benefits; whether independence trumps cooperative action which fosters adherence to the rule of law and strengthens international organizations. </span><span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Unilateral action</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> often</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">reinforces the view of an American “cowboy” approach to foreign policy, </span><span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">generat</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">ing </span></em><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">resentment that makes it more difficult for the U.S. to deal cooperatively with the international community</span></strong><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">on other issues of common interest</span> (e.g., U.S./European relations concerning Iraqi disarmament). This growing anti-American sentiment is represented by mass demonstrations in Europe and the Middle East in February 2003 against potential American military action against Iraq, and numerous public demonstrations in South Korea protesting the decades-old American military presence. <span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">While a multilateral approach takes more time</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> to implement, it provides benefits across the international spectrum, including trade, investment, intelligence sharing, and </span></strong></span></em><strong>space operations</strong><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. It does this by </span><span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">build</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">ing </span><span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">an atmosphere of trust</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> and a greater willingness to engage in dialogue and to cooperate on matters of mutual national interest</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. Stephen Miller, director of the International Security Program at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, states that</span> U.S. policy must change dramatically to accommodate the exigencies of the war against terrorism. He subscribes to the belief that the world did in fact change following the attack on 11 September 2001; above all else, he claims that<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> September 11 and its aftermath must spell the end of U.S. unilateralism.</span>2 He notes that while strong intelligence ties exist with allies and close friends, the U.S. may wish to point those collaborative efforts more directly at the growing terrorist threat and to use existing networks in different ways.3 Miller proposes that the</em> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">best hope U.S. policymakers have to influence the international community is to draw the major states into networks of cooperation and consultation</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> Compromise </span><span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">need not be seen as a sign of weakness,</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> but rather as </span><span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">a means of moving toward an objective with the cooperation of others</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, thus at a lower cost to the United States</span>.<br />

<span class="Underline">Although government agencies continue to launch hardened and high-security satellites, </span>tightening budgets are making it more difficult to invest<span style="font-size: 8pt;">the hundreds of millions that are typically required to support a DOD launch.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This </span>change in design strategies is occurring in conjunction with another shift that lets terminals communicate over different bands<span class="Underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> That </span><span class="Underline">makes </span>better use of available<span class="Underline"> satellite </span>bandwidth by making it easier for users to communicate<span class="Underline"> over the most effective data channel</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for their requirements. At the same time, it </span>lets warfighters and vehicle designers use a single antenna instead of multiple alt<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ernatives. “</span><span class="Underline">Our multiband terminals let you operate in many bands,</span>replacing<span style="font-size: 8pt;">three legacy terminals: </span><span class="Underline">protect EHF on wideband satcom, </span>super-high frequency<span class="Underline"> and global broadcast services,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” Squitieri said. “That’s </span><span class="Underline">important not just because it enhances a warfighter’s capabilities at reduced cost</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It reduces training and logistics, you only have to handle one terminal instead of three.” This </span>reduction helps give warfighters access to all the data<span class="Underline"> they want by creating more room for other equipment.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> On a ship, this savings comes both below deck, where a multirack system can be replaced with one rack of electronics, and above deck. </span><span class="Underline">Eliminating an antenna on a ship can bring significant savings because of all the protection that’s needed and because tracking systems on ships are often quite large</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “That’s </span><span class="Underline">critical with all the C4I people want. It’s a great challenge topside to install terminals.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The maritime environment is tough with heavy wash over the deck and the controls need to stay on track with the satellite during a storm,” Squitieri said. </span><br />
