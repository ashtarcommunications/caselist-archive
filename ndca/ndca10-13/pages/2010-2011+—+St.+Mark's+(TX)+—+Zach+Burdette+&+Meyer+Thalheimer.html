North Korea may stage another attack “in months and not years,” said Navy Admiral Robert Willard, the top U.S. commander in the Pacific. North Korean leader <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/kim-jong-il/" rel="nofollow">Kim Jong Il</a> appears to be training his son “on a compressed timeline” in “coercive measures” like the attacks last year that killed 46 sailors on the South Korean Cheonan warship and four people on the island of Yeonpyeong, Willard told a forum sponsored by the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/asia-society/" rel="nofollow">Asia Society</a> in Washington today. “We may very well be facing the next provocation in months and not years,” Willard said in remarks that also touched on China and <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/southeast-asia/" rel="nofollow">Southeast Asia</a>. The U.S. is working with <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/south-korea/" rel="nofollow">South Korea</a> on efforts to “be prepared for a next provocation should it occur,” said Willard, who leads the U.S. Pacific Command. “These provocations have raised the ire of the South Korean people in a way that we haven’t seen,” Willard said, echoing comments by Defense Secretary <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/robert-gates/" rel="nofollow">Robert Gates</a> on a trip to the region last month. “The South Korean level of tolerance for a next provocation is very low.” Another attack may prompt more severe retaliation from South Korea than the military exercises and exchange of artillery fire that occurred last year, especially after North Korea walked out of the first talks with South Korea in four months on Feb. 9. North Korea has resisted appeals from the U.S. and partners in the region to end missile tests and its nuclear program. <br />

<strong>U.S. deterrence in Korea fails and only provokes the North. The root cause of all prior attacks as well as North Korean prolif is U.S. hostile policy. Only troop withdrawal prevents war with North Korea and China.</strong><br />

The US-ROK joint military exercises not merely prepare for a possible invasion of North Korea but they also serve as weapons of attrition. They force North Korea to devote much more of its resources to the military than it would if there were no palpable threat. An important component of the exercise is their element of ambiguity. The Korean People’s Army (KPA) can never be sure when a feint might become the real thing, so every exercise has to be taken very seriously. The translation of this commentary from the Rodong Sinmun on the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises in 2009 may be fractured but the underling fear of attack is clear: The said largest-scale saber rattling kicked off by the U.S. imperialists against the DPRK at a time when their scenario for the second Korean war is at the final stage of completion is a very adventurous and dangerous military provocation that can be seen only on the eve of a war, and this is an undisguised military threat and a sort of declaration of war against the DPRK. No one can vouch that the U.S. imperialist bellicose elements will not ignite a war against the DPRK by surprise while reinforcing armed forces and staging war maneuvers in south Korea and its vicinity as they did in Iraq.[18] It is important to note that the clash at Yeonpyeong Island coincided with a substantial military exercise, the Hoguk (‘Safeguarding the Nation’): North Korea fired the artillery during South Korea’s military drill called the Hoguk Exercise on Nov. 22-30 that involves 70,000 South Korean military troops, 50 warships, 90 helicopters and 500 planes. The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) of U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Seventh Air Force will also participate in the exercise.[19] The scheduled participation of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is particularly significant.[20] The 31st MEU is based in Okinawa and it is America’s ‘forward deployed rapid-response’ unit in East Asia. It trains with the ROK marines practicing beach landings, but its major specialism appears to be urban warfare. [21] One of its possible functions is to mount a commando type raid on the DPRK. A Japanese scholar writing in the authoritative PACNET newsletter of Pacific Forum CSIS (the Honolulu branch of the Washington think tank Center for Strategic and International studies rather gave the game away about the ‘North Korean threat’ by putting it thus: As a collapse of North Korea -- rather than a North Korean invasion of South Korea -- has become a more likely scenario, the 31st MEU can search and seize the North Korean nuclear arsenal, and prevent proliferation of those weapons[22] It is not surprising therefore that the KPA was concerned about the Hoguk exercise and responded to the ROK live firing in line with the ‘zero tolerance’ strategy. However, concerns extend beyond specific military exercises, to the whole policy of building up of tension in preparation for a crisis that would lead to an invasion of the North. The KPA barrage can be seen as a message that an attack would be met by a devastating counteroffensive which would, at the very least, imperil Seoul; it was a reminder that ‘Seoul [is] not safe from artillery attacks’.[23] The DPRK’s ‘zero tolerance’ strategy The DPRK’s ‘zero tolerance’ policy long predates the Lee Myung-bak administration, let alone the present crisis. Basically this strategy is to reiterate than no infringement of DPRK territory will be tolerated, and any intrusion will be met by force. There has been flexibility and restraint in implementing this strategy, especially in respect of the NLL (see below), but the underlying strategic calculation is that any sign of weakness will lead to further US and ROK moves against the DPRK. The case of the US invasion of Iraq is often cited by the North Koreans of the dangers of an appeasement policy. This is often raised in respect of the nuclear deterrent. For instance, Alexander Frolov, writing recently in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs journal International Affairs on lessons from the Iraq war made the point: The leadership in N[orth]. Korea also realized that nothing less than a nuclear status can guarantee the country against US aggression. [24] However, the relevance of Iraq to the non-appeasement policy goes beyond developing a nuclear deterrent. For instance, in May 2003 after a breakdown in US-DPRK negotiations, the official Korea Central News Agency (KCNA) in a lengthy statement included a reference to Iraq: On March 20 this year the U.S. provoked a war of aggression against Iraq under the pretext of &quot;finding out weapons of mass destruction&quot; in a bid to topple the Saddam government. The Iraqi war taught the lesson that &quot;nuclear suspicion,&quot; &quot;suspected development of weapons of mass destruction&quot; and suspected &quot;sponsorship of terrorism&quot; touted by the U.S. were all aimed to find a pretext for war and one would fall victim to a war when one meekly responds to the IAEA's inspection for disarmament. Neither strong international public opinion nor big countries' opposition to war nor the UN Charter could prevent the U.S. from launching the Iraqi war. It is a serious lesson the world has drawn from the Iraqi war that a war can be averted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation can be protected only when a country has a physical deterrent force, a strong military deterrent force capable of decisively repelling any attack to be made by any types of sophisticated weapons. The reality indicates that building up a physical deterrent force is urgently required for preventing the outbreak of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring peace and security of the world, now that the U.S. does not show any political intention and will to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK. The DPRK will increase its self-defensive capacity strong enough to destroy aggressors at a single stroke. Any U.S. aerial attack will be decisively countered with aerial attack and its land strategy will be coped with land strategy. [25] In reality, a North Korean counter offensive would not match like with like - ‘aerial attack will be decisively countered with aerial attack and its land strategy will be coped with land strategy.’ The DPRK cannot hope to match US military power (especially in the air) so its offensive would be asymmetrical, drawing on its strengths.[26] It would probably utilise its special forces, submarines, and in particular its artillery[27] As noted, the frequent war exercises, the integration of the ROK military into the US command structure, and the associated operational plans, are seen by the DPRK as very threatening: [The United States] made public &quot;strategic guideline No. 1&quot; in November 1978 and thus officially announced the formation of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; in south Korea. It saw to it that the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; took over the &quot;UN Forces Command's&quot; Operation Control of the U.S. forces in south Korea and puppet army. The organization of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; deepened the military dependence of south Korea on the United States and increased the danger for an outbreak of a new war on the Korean Peninsula. The Team Spirit joint military exercises for invading the north had been escalated as a large-scale war exercises involving huge armed forces over100,000-200,000 strong from 1978. Such joint military exercises as the Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI), Ulji Focus Lens and Foal Eagle have been staged almost every day as planned and directed by the command. The aggressive and bellicose nature of the command has remained unchanged even after the June 15 era [the 2000 North-South summit], a new era of reconciliation and cooperation, was ushered in on the Korean Peninsula. Many war scenarios against the north including &quot;OPLAN 5030&quot;, &quot;New OPLAN 5026&quot; and &quot;OPLAN 8022-02&quot; have been worked out and war exercises to carry them into practice conducted in a more frenzied way. This year the command changed the codenames of the RSOI and Ulji Focus Lens with Key Resolve and Ulji Freedom Guardian and is holding actual maneuvers to hurl U.S. imperialist aggression forces in the mainland and abroad into Korean front. It goes without saying that such war exercises and arms buildup had have negative effect on the north-south relations and chilled the ardent desire for the Korean people for reunification. The south Korean people thus press for the dissolution of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; disturbing peace in Korea and obstructing her reunification. The south Korea-U.S. &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot;, a tool for war of aggression and a source of permanent atmosphere of war and tension on the Korean Peninsula, should be disbanded without delay. [28] The most famous example of the efficacy of the strategy is the reported argument between President Kim Young-sam and President Bill Clinton in 1994. According to Kim, Clinton wanted to bomb the North Korea nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. A 2003 BBC report recounted the tale: &quot;Clinton told me that he would launch an immediate bombardment on the Yongbyon area. Clinton was very determined about it, but I argued to him that such an attack should never take place,&quot; said Mr Kim. &quot;So there was quite an argument between him and me. Sometimes the phone conversations lasted more than 40 minutes,&quot; he said. Mr Clinton first revealed the 1994 plan to attack North Korea last month, but said nothing of the alleged dispute with the South. Mr Kim said that a US attack would have led to a tremendous loss of life, and would have turned Seoul into a &quot;sea of fire&quot;. &quot;Finally I told him that if the United States attacks North Korea, I cannot send one single member of South Korea's 650,000 armed forces into battle.&quot; [29] Kim’s version of events was contradicted by Tong Kim (Kim Dong-hyun) a Korean-American who worked as an interpreter for the State Department for over 30 years. According to him, It simply is not the case [...]. There was no discussion about a possible U.S. attack on North Korea between the two presidents via phone. Such discussions indeed took place between their defense ministers Kwon Young-hae and William Perry with the South Korean minister obviously opposed to the military action.[30] The consequences of a Northern counterattack, and specifically an artillery offense against Seoul, was not the only consideration, although it was the main one. A South Korean simulation exercise predicted that ‘bombing of North Korea’s nuclear facilities could in the worst case make the whole of Korea uninhabitable for a decade’.[31] The bombing of Yongbyon was but one variant of the ‘military option’ that the United States has been examining, albeit the favoured one.[32] The release of radioactivity aside, an US attack would mean war with immense devastation of the Korea peninsula, so it is to be expected that there has been, in the past, opposition across the political spectrum, from progressive President Roh Moo-hyun to conservative legislator Park Jin.[33] The exception to that have been those, such as Lee Myung-bak, who pin their hopes on a collapse that would prevent the North from making a counterattack. This is an ongoing issue but as long as the DPRK functions as a viable state, committed and able, to retaliate, then there will be no attack. Part of the reason for the vigorous response at Yeonpyeong was presumably to demonstrate that the KPA was still in business. The DPRK has been threatened, and blockaded, by the United States for decades, but unlike various other countries, it has not been invaded, or bombed. To that degree the zero-tolerance strategy can be said to work. But it has its disadvantages. It is a high-risk strategy. If there is a miscalculation or a misunderstanding, or ‘maverick’ action by soldiers on the front line, then the situation could rapidly whirl out of control. War would be disastrous for North Korea, despite the brave words. It would have grave consequences for the South, and Japan. If it spread to China the results are incalculable, but it might mean the end of the United States, that ‘fragile empire’ as Niall Ferguson recently termed it.[34] It is a variant of the mutually assured destruction of the Cold War period, a bluff that is effective because it is credible, but a bluff that if put into action would be catastrophic. In this case, the destruction would not be equivalent. The DPRK would suffer more than other countries, but the ROK and the US would suffer unacceptable damage and that could be considered sufficient to keep the peace. The strategy has other disadvantages. It allows the DPRK to be portrayed as belligerent, and certainly the coverage of the Yeonpyeong incident, within South Korea, and internationally has been virtually uniformly hostile. Not everyone has jumped on to the bandwagon and there are those, in particular Korean-Americans, who oppose the drift towards war and call for engagement.[35] But these are only a tiny minority. The strategy also runs counter to the main thrust of DPRK strategy which is to negotiate the United States into accepting peaceful coexistence. Recourse to confrontation, and military action, makes that more difficult to prosecute. Finally, it gives a hostage to fortune. The other side (here South Korea but in other circumstances it could be the US) can construct a provocation knowing that it will trigger a response that can be labelled as belligerent. The trick here is to do something which the DPRK regards as provocative but which can be disguised as normal and legitimate. The military exercises in general fall within this category. For the DPRK (and China) they are intimidating and provocative, but that is not how they are described in the Western media. No doubt if the tables were turned and it was a North Korean carrier stalking up the American coast, perceptions would be different. In the particular case of Yeonpyeong the ROK did something that was portrayed as legitimate and non-threatening but which the DPRK found intolerable. To understand why that was so we must turn to the curious case of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) Northern Limit Line The Northern Limit Line is a very strange beast, as a glance at the map shows (fig 1). Fig 1: Contested seas: The NLL and the MDL 1.Yeonpyeong Island (artillery clash) 2.Baengnyeong Island (Cheonan sinking) 3.Daecheong Island 4. Incheon Airport 5.Seoul 6.Incheon 7.Haeju 8.Kaesong 9.Ganghwa County 10.Bukdo Myeon 11.Deokjeok Myeon 12.Jawol Myeon 13.Yeongheung Myeon On this map #1 indicates Yeonpyeong Island where the artillery clash took place, and #2 Baengnyeong Island, off which the Cheonan sank. The upper(blue) line represents the Northern Limit Line (NLL) and the lower (red) one the West Sea Military Demarcation Line (MDL) claimed by the DPRK. The NLL was unilaterally established by the Americans (officially the United Nations Command) in August 1953.[36] The NLL, instead of striking out directly from the coast at the end of the land Military Demarcation Line (MDL), snakes up the west coast of North Korea, through rice crab fish grounds, and taking in various islands the main three of which are .Yeonpyeong (1) , Baengnyeong (2), and Daecheong (3). It has been argued that it was set up to prevent Southern incursions into Northern waters (Syngman Rhee had not signed the Armistice Agreement and wanted the war to continue), although it would be more plausible to see it also as affording bases for inserting intelligence and commando teams. Be that as it may, by the 1990s commando raids were a thing of the past, and yet the ROK refused to negotiate. This despite two major incidents in 1999 and 2002 which were a distinct threat to the ‘Sunshine Policy of then president Kim Dae-jung.[37] There was a further clash in November 2009 under the presidency of Lee Myung-bak.[38] This 2009 incident may have owed something to the more assertive North Korea policy of the Lee administration.[39] The NLL did not receive much international attention until the Cheonan incident of March 2010. There were a number of reasons for this. Most of the causalities in the past were Northern and so, in the eyes of most of the international media, perhaps warranted less attention. The Cheonan was the largest single disaster for the ROK navy. Many commentators were quick to point out what a dangerous situation the sinking of the Cheonan illustrated. Typical was Nicole Finnegan of the Washington-based Korea Economic Institute: Regardless of what we learn the true cause of the tragedy to be, the sinking of the Cheonan has revived fear and debates on how easily North and South Korea could lurch into war unexpectedly.[40] There is nothing new in these concerns. The NLL by its unilateral nature, its configuration close to the North Korean coast, and running through highly prized crab grounds, is a recipe for conflict. Fishing boats from both South and North sometimes ignore the NLL during the crab season and their respective navies tend to follow them. The NLL is also at variance with the now standard territorial sea limit of 12 nautical miles.[41] Writing in 2002, after the clash of June that year, John Barry Kotch and Michael Abbey, point out that: If the two Koreas are genuinely committed to reconciliation, these differences can be resolved through negotiation, thereby preventing future incidents. A line that was drawn more than a half-century ago for an entirely different purpose should no longer be allowed to fester as a source of conflict, thereby retarding the peace process.[42] The differences were not resolved, so the question is why? If this failure to negotiate a resolution had just occurred during the Lee Myung-bak administration it might not have been surprising. But this was during the time of Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun. It is clear that a resolution would have meant the South abandoning the NLL and agreeing to something approximating the North’s line. It seems extremely unlikely that anyone in the DPRK would have opposed that. Although the NLL was established by the UNC, it appears that it is not longer involved, officially at least. It may well be that unofficially it is very much involved; the relationship between the US and ROK military seems to be unexplored territory. Whatever the role of Americans behind the scenes it seems clear that resolution of the NLL was opposed, successfully, by the ROK military. This opposition presumably was partly due to natural inertia – nobody likes giving up territory – but it must have gone deeper than that. The logical conclusion is that there were strong forces in the ROK political elite, revolving around the military, who wanted to keep the NLL precisely because it would “to fester as a source of conflict, thereby retarding the peace process” Fig 2: measuring policy change: KCNA mentions of the NLL over two administrations All of the previous conflicts around the NLL had been at sea, and the artillery duel at Yeonpyeong was the first one on land. To understand how that came about we must return to the map. It appears that the DPRK acknowledges ROK control over the islands, but claims these are its territorial waters, except for the access channels shown on the map.[43] Whilst the NLL has long been a bone of contention, the situation has greatly worsened since the Lee Myung-bak administration came into office. One rough way of measuring that is to calculate the number of times the official KCNA news agency mentions the North Limit Line. Roh Moo-hyun was in office from 25 February 2003 to 25 February 2008 when Lee Myung-bak took over. Fig 2 shows the monthly average of NLL stories over those two administrations. This is admittedly an imperfect metric but the difference between the two administrations is compelling: under Lee Myung-bak the number of North Korean complaints rose nearly three-fold. In March 2008, for instance, the KPA navy warned: Combined firepower drills for &quot;striking and destroying&quot; warships of the Navy of the Korean People's Army and drills for tactical naval maneuvers are staged on Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong Islets and in waters around them almost everyday. A situation in which an armed conflict may break out any moment is prevailing in the frontline waters in the West Sea due to the reckless military provocations of the south Korean military warmongers. Any attempt on the part of the south Korean military authorities to &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;northern limit line&quot; at any cost would only spark off a clash in the said waters.[44] The following year, as the Lee administration moved to join the US-led Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) the KPA navy issued another warning: 3. For the present, we will not guarantee the legal status of the five islands under the south side's control (Paekryong, Taechong, Sochong, Yonphyong [ and U islands) in our side's territorial waters northwest of the extension of the Military Demarcation Line in the West Sea of Korea and safe sailing of warships of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the south Korean puppet navy and civilian ships operating in the waters around there.[45] The PSI is in many ways similar to the NLL. It is unilateral and illegal. The PSI claims that a set of nations – the US and its clients – are above international law and may stop and search ships on the high seas. Ostensibly this is to stop the shipping of weapons of mass destruction which given the United States pre-eminence in the international arms trade smacks of a certain degree of chutzpah.[46] Indeed, as Hazel Smith has documented, ‘There is little hard evidence that the government of North Korea is involved in the illicit shipping of WMD or components of WMD’.[47] The PSI seems to be really about harassing the DPRK and stoking tension, and that also holds for the NLL. The NLL seems to have been much more successful in attaining these objectives so far than the PSI. The NLL was perhaps only peripheral to the Cheonan incident. True the ship sank in disputed waters, and had the NLL not existed, but the two Koreas had been separated by a mutually agreed maritime border, the sinking would probably not have occurred. It appears that it ran aground in shallow waters and in an attempt to extricate itself was sunk by one of the South’s mines.[48] Nevertheless, the actual sinking of the Cheonan appears to have been an accident; it was the subsequent investigation that was deliberately fraudulent. The Yeonpyeong incident is different in that it occurred because of a deliberate provocation by the South. The artillery duel at Yeonpyeong As to be expected there is much that is uncertain and contested about this incident. But the essentials can be traced. The media tends to give the impression that the North Korean barrage against the marine base on Yeonpyeong island on 23 November came out of the blue, with nothing preceding it. The Chosun Ilbo specifically makes that claim: … the latest artillery bombardment on Yeonpyeong Island came completely out of the blue, and there is no way of telling when, where and how North Korea will strike next.[49] A rather more nuanced version is the Washington Post narrative, with the North launching a barrage and the South responding: North Korea launched a massive artillery barrage on a South Korean island Tuesday, killing two South Korean marines, wounding at least 19 other people and setting more than 60 buildings ablaze in the most serious confrontation since the North's sinking of a South Korean warship in March. South Korea immediately responded with its own artillery fire and put its fighter jets on high alert, bringing the two sides - which technically have remained in a state of war since the Korean armistice in 1953 - close to the brink of a major conflagration[50] No mention here of the South’s arms buildup on the island, the North’s warnings, the provocative nature of the Northern Limit Line, or the threatening military exercises. Back in 2008 the KPA complained about the ROK introducing new weaponry into the NLL islands: They also issued an order to batteries of 155 mm caliber howitzers and various type guided weapons deployed on the above-said five islets to be ready to go into action.[51] The KPA statement also claimed that: Combined firepower drills for &quot;striking and destroying&quot; warships of the Navy of the Korean People's Army and drills for tactical naval maneuvers are staged on Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong Islets and in waters around them [take place] almost everyday. A situation in which an armed conflict may break out any moment is prevailing in the frontline waters in the West Sea due to the reckless military provocations of the south Korean military warmongers. Any attempt on the part of the south Korean military authorities to &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;northern limit line&quot; at any cost would only spark off a clash in the said waters. [52] The live fire drills that the ROK conducted on 23 November were not just artillery practice; they were specifically focussed on possible combat against KPA ships in waters around the island. However, it was the specific contested status of those waters, in a tense situation exacerbated by the military exercises since the Cheonan incident, which sparked the North Korean response. It appears that the North warned the South against the drills, but the warnings were disregarded. The Seoul newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported on 24 November that: North Korea in a telegram on Tuesday morning [23 November] criticized an annual South Korean defense drill now underway. The same afternoon the North Korean military fired on Yeonpyeong Island. An official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, &quot;At around 8:20 am. on Tuesday, North Korea sent a telegram that said they would not sit idly by and watch if South Korea fire at North Korean waters during the military training.&quot; North Korea already criticized the drill on Nov. 17 on the website of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland and again on Monday when the drill began. But the military dismissed North Korea's claims, saying an artillery firing drill by the Marine Corps that took place in Yeonpyeong Island on Tuesday had nothing to do with the annual drill but was a part of monthly training there. Moreover, the drill the North cited as an excuse for the attack is an annual routine drill which has been conducted by the South Korean military since 1996. A spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, &quot;The training was directed at South Korean waters to the southwest of Yeonpyeong Island, and the training site had been announced already through the international network of communication of merchant ships.[53] To say that the marine artillery drills had nothing to do with the Hoguk exercise seems to be a sophism. Moreover, the warnings stretched further back. The information available on the English-language KCNA website is only a portion of the published Korean-language material, and on top of that there are the direct communications between North and South (such as the telegram mentioned above). However, there is enough English-language for us to get a certain picture of preceding events, even though often the English translation is of poor quality.’ Fig3: Smoke from rocket fire over Yeonpyeong island This picture taken on November 23, 2010 by a South Korean tourist shows huge plumes of smoke rising from Yeonpyeong island in the disputed waters of the Yellow Sea on November 23, 2010. North Korea fired dozens of artillery shells onto a South Korean island on November 23, 2010, killing four people, setting homes ablaze and triggering an exchange of fire as the South's military went on top alert. (STR/AFP/Getty Images) On the 4th of June 2010 a Rodong Sinmun editorial headed ‘S. Korean Accused of Dangerous Provocations’ warned that: The puppet military is massively amassing offensive forces in the waters off five islets of the West Sea including Paekryong and Yonphyong [Yeonpyeong] islets while vociferating about &quot;defence of the northern limit line&quot; and ceaselessly infiltrating its warships into the territorial waters of the DPRK for the purpose of sparking off a new armed conflict. It is needless to say that the large-scale &quot;demonstration of military muscle&quot; and war maneuvers taking place under this situation are as dangerous acts as playing with fire by the side of a powder magazine. These moves are, in fact, a prelude to an all-out war. The DPRK loves peace and does not want a war. But it is the DPRK's spirit and mettle to react to fire with fire and punish the provocateurs with a merciless retaliation of justice. If the puppet group finally opts for starting a war of aggression against the DPRK in league with foreign forces, defying its warnings, the group will not be able to escape a thousand-fold indiscriminate retaliatory blow, warns the article. [54] This is a generalised warning about retaliation ‘for starting a war of aggression’ rather than specifically threatening a response to military exercises at Yeonpyeong. ‘Indiscriminate’ in this context presumably means ‘all-out war’. This warning was followed by another on 3 August which specifically threatened retaliation for ‘naval firing maneuvers’ from Yeonpyeong and other islands in the area: The Command of Forces of the Korean People's Army in the western sector of the front issued on Tuesday the following notice in this connection: The naval firing maneuvers to be staged by the above-said warmongers in the waters near Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong islets in August with all ground, naval and submarine attack means involved are not simple drills but undisguised military intrusion into the inviolable territorial waters of the DPRK and reckless politically motivated provocation to preserve the illegal &quot;northern limit line&quot; to the last. …. In view of the prevailing situation, the Command of Forces of the Korean People's Army in the western sector of the front made a decisive resolution to counter the reckless naval firing projected by the group of traitors with strong physical retaliation. …. As regards the expected DPRK's counteraction for self-defence, the command warns in advance all the civilian ships including fishing boats not to enter the theatre of naval firing fixed by the group of traitors in the waters close to the five islets in the West Sea of Korea. It is the unshakable will and steadfast resolution of the army and people of the DPRK to return fire for fire. [55] Whether the ROK marines carried out any firing exercises after that warning is unknown. The Chosun Ilbo report quoted above says the drills were held ‘monthly’ but the [London] Telegraph talks about ‘monthly air raid drills’, so the exercises on 23 November may have been the first since the August threat. The island, lined with tank traps and trenches, and equipped with 19 fully-stocked bomb shelters in which residents conduct monthly air raid drills, is permanently ready for war.[56] The South Koreans admitted carrying live firing exercises on 23 November but justified these by saying they were fired into the sea, away from the direction of the North Korean mainland. There seems no doubt they were firing into the sea (on the technical level it was presumably an anti-ship exercise), though the actual direction of fire is unclear. One report says southward.[57] Another says to the west. [58] Yet another has it to the southwest.[59] In fact, as far as the North was concerned, the direction was irrelevant because in any case the shells landed in their territorial waters. And therein lies the rub. The DPRK argues that if it tolerated the exercise it would be relinquishing its claim to the waters. The enemy fired shells from the islet which is so close to the territory of the DPRK that it is within each other's eyeshot despite the fact that there are so many mountains and rivers, sea waters and islets in south Korea. This powder-reeking saber-rattling cannot be construed otherwise than a politically motivated provocation. The enemy is claiming that they fired shells southward from the islet in a bid not to get on the nerves of the DPRK but Yonphyong Islet is located deep inside the territorial waters of the DPRK away from the maritime military demarcation line. If live shells are fired from the islet, they are bound to drop inside the territorial waters of the DPRK side no matter in which direction they are fired because of such geographical features. The ulterior aim sought by the enemy is to create the impression that the DPRK side recognized the waters off the islet as their &quot;territorial waters&quot;, in case that there was no physical counter-action on the part of the former. Herein lies the crafty and vicious nature of the enemy's provocation. The army of the DPRK took such a self-defensive measure as making a prompt powerful strike at the artillery positions from which the enemy fired the shells as it does not make an empty talk. [emphasis added].[60] As can be seen from the map (fig 1), the DPRK seems to accept ROK control of the island (but not necessarily sovereignty) but it does not recognise any claim over the surrounding sea. It would appear that the DPRK claim to these waters has much to justify it; the Northern Limit Line is manifestly iniquitous; it is unilateral and provocative and should have been abolished years ago. But does that justify the DPRK artillery barrage? An important point here is the number of warnings that were given. We have already quoted the public statements, and mentioned a telegram, but the North also claims it made a telephone call to the South: The south Korean puppet warmongers' firing of shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side in the West Sea of Korea on Nov. 23 was a premeditated and deliberate military provocation from A to Z and a war action in fact. On Nov. 22, the south Korean puppet forces made no scruple of announcing that they would fire shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side with artillery pieces they deployed on Yonphyong Island while staging Hoguk exercises for a war of aggression against the DPRK, straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula. In this connection the DPRK side sent a telephone notice to the south Korean puppet military at 8 a.m. on Nov. 23, strongly urging it to immediately cancel the plan for firing shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side. In the notice the DPRK side seriously warned that if it paid no heed to this demand, it would face a resolute physical counter-strike and would be held fully responsible for all the ensuing consequences.[61] This telephone call, and the previous public warnings, have received very little coverage in the Western media, but there is no doubt that it took place, since it was reported by the Seoul newspaper Korea Herald: In the morning [of the clash], the North sent a telephone message to the South, saying “The North would not just sit back if the South fired shots into the North Korean territorial waters,” according to JCS [South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff] officials.[62] We do not know how explicit that warning was, but since it was a telephone call, the Southern officer could presumably have sought clarification. Moreover, we have other reports that the ROK military was aware that that DPRK had moved artillery into position. This was then followed by practice shooting: A senior military said several hours before the shelling began the North Korean military deployed one battery of six 122-mm MLRS shells and later two batteries of 12 112-mm MLRS shells. It also carried out preparatory shooting practice just before the attack. &quot;As far as I know the South Korean military was aware of this,&quot; he said.[63] It seems fair to assume that the local ROK military commander knew what would happen if the firing exercise went ahead. Whether he relayed this to higher levels and asked for confirmation to go ahead we do not know, but it seems likely. There was no great time pressure and taking action which would result in the first artillery exchange since the Korean War would surely have been referred up to higher levels. The warning/foreknowledge issue become even more convoluted with revelations on 1 December that South Korean intelligence had known since August that the North would respond. The Director of the National Intelligence Service [NIS] gave testimony to a closed-door session of a committee of the National Assembly. Members of the National Assembly Intelligence Committee quoted NIS Director Won Sei-hoon as saying the agency knew from wiretapping that the North Korean regime ordered the military to prepare to attack the five islands in the West Sea. He said the NIS submitted the intelligence report to President Lee Myung-bak.[emphasis added] [64] The phrase ‘prepare to attack’ implies, and is meant to imply, a Northern provocation, an unprovoked assault. In fact, we have from another story a much more plausible phrase: The[Asahi Shimbun]quoted the source, who is familiar with North Korea-China relations, as saying, &quot;Early last month, the North Korean military issued instructions in Kim Jong-un's name to senior military commanders to get ready to counter the enemy's provocations any time.&quot; The source quoted an unnamed North Korean Army officer as commenting on the artillery attack on Yeonpyeong. &quot;It had been planned. We had been preparing for that for a long time.&quot; [emphasis added][65] This countering of what the North regarded as a Southern provocation is consistent with the published and telephone warnings. It gives a quite different take on who was provoking whom. This did not prevent the Chosun Ilbo, which ran the story, from heading it ‘Kim Jong-un 'Ordered Attack in Early November'. Not the first time a newspaper has mendaciously given a headline which is contradicted by the actual story under it. In fact, the Chosun Ilbo, which has a very virulent ideological position, often does it. On 3 December it ran a story about an interview Russian Prime Minister Putin gave in the United States in which it was reported that ‘Putin said that he finds the situation in the Korean Peninsula &quot;very acute and disturbing&quot;’. The headline was ‘N.Korean Attack 'Acute and Disturbing,' Says Putin’. The assertion that the NIS submitted the intelligence report to President Lee Myung-bak has to be taken cautiously. From the public account we do not know whether he was given it personally, and the warning drawn to his attention. It may have just been passed to his office, and he never got to read it. That is a generous interpretation. Whether Lee was aware personally it is clear that the North Korean warning that they would retaliate if the exercises took place was known at the highest levels of the South Korean command. Events of the day The actual sequence of events is more complex than most press reports and commentaries suggest. According to the Korea Herald report the Northern shelling started at 2.34pm, but was perhaps not the ‘massive onslaught’ that it was often called: “As the North fired coastal artillery shells at around 2:34 p.m. into waters off the Yeonpyeong Island as well as on the island, we immediately fired back in full accordance with combat rules,” said Lee Hong-kee, chief director for joint operations at the JCS, in a press briefing. [emphasis added][66] Either the accuracy of the Northern artillery was poor, or firing into the water was deliberate. According to the report, here is the sequence of events After 8.00am and before 2.34 pm South fires into sea 2.34 pm North starts firing into sea (and land?) 2.47 pm South starts firing at Northern coastal batteries – ‘strong, concentrated’ counterattack causing ‘considerable damage’ 2.55 pm North ceases firing 3.11 pm North recommences firing 3.42 pm North ceases firing 3.48 pm South telephones North urging it to stop its ‘provocative acts’ By 9.30 pm 2 marines killed; while six others were seriously injured. Ten other soldiers and three civilians suffered minor injuries This raises some intriguing questions. • Did the North fire simultaneously at the island and into the sea, or did the land fire come later? • Did the North fire onto the island only after the Southern counterattack on its positions? • Why did the South make a telephone call asking the North to stop if it had already done so? • Did the North recommence firing sometime after 3.42 pm? • As of 9.30 pm we have three civilians reported with minor injuries but subsequent reports give two dead. Were the dead amongst these three, or were they discovered later? The ‘fog of war’ no doubt produces confusion but these discrepancies suggest that we have not had the full story by any means. The quite erroneous claim that this was an ‘unprovoked attack’ by the North has been repeated so many times by ROK officials, and by the media, that even liberals such as the American investigative journalist Tim Shorrock have been taken in.[67] The other main canard in the official narrative concerns civilians. The theme is set at the top with statements from Lee Myung-bak. On 29 November he gave a short address to the nation: During a seven-minute speech Lee expressed outrage over the North's ruthless attack on civilians, calling it an &quot;inhumane&quot; crime [emphasis added].[68] Others were more circumspect. A JCS spokesman called the firing ‘indiscriminate’: “This provocation is a premeditated, intentional illegal attack in violation of the U.N. Convention, the Armistice Agreement and the inter-Korean non-aggression accord. It is also an inhumane atrocity, in which it indiscriminately fired shells into unarmed civilian residential areas.”[69] Song Min-soon, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade and currently a Democratic Party (i.e. opposition) member of the National Assembly attacked what he called an: outrageous indiscriminate artillery attack against civilians and military alike.[70] The American liberal John Feffer wrote of a ‘disproportionate response’ which killed ‘two civilians and two soldiers’. [71] Early reports (such as the Korea Herald one above) mention only minor civilian injuries, though they talk of a ’civilian area’: ..killing two South Korean marines, wounding 16 soldiers and three civilians, and damaging homes and facilities. This was the first time since the Korean War that the North has fired artillery shells on a civilian area in South Korea.[72] ‘Civilian area’ is a rather elastic term. Most military bases have civilians living in the vicinity, some more than others. The giant US headquarters in South Korea, Yongsan Garrison occupies 2.5 sq km in the centre of this city of 10 million people; the site was originally developed by the Japanese Imperial Army. By 24 November the casualties changed to four – two military and two civilians. In addition to the two marines killed, the bodies of two men, believed in their 60s, were pulled from a destroyed construction site, the coast guard said. At least 18 people - most of them troops - were injured.[73] It was not stated where this construction site was in relation to the marine camp. If it were on the other side of the island, then that would indicate fire that was either indiscriminate or very inaccurate. If it were close by, or even on the camp, then this would put a different complexion on things. It is clear that the main target was the marine camp, as this quotation from the JCS indicates Many landed on a military camp but others on a civilian village on the island. Flames and thick columns of smoke were seen rising above the village and a nearby mountain. &quot;The North must have carefully premeditated the provocation against the camp,&quot; a JCS officer speculated. [74] Fig 4: Damage at the marine base A K-9 Marine artillery base on Yeonpyeong Island under attack by North Korea on Tuesday /Courtesy of the Ministry of Defense [&quot;N.Korean Shelling 'Aimed for Maximum Damage to Lives, Property'.&quot; Chosun Ilbo, 26 November 2010. The Washington Post went one step further and reported that: Most of the shells landed on a military base on Yeonpyeong island [emphasis added][75] However, most reports either did not mention the marine base, or gave no details. For instance, another Washington Post article talked of ‘civilian-inhabited Yeonpyeong Island’ without any reference to the marine base.[76] In fact the military installations were very significant as a New York Times article makes evident. … [Yeonpyeong Island] houses a garrison of about 1,000 South Korean marines, and the navy has deployed its newest class of “patrol killer” guided-missile ships in the Western Sea, as the Yellow Sea is also known. [77] This NY Times article gave the civilian population as 1,600 but this was later revised down to 1,350. [78] Most appear to be connected, as one might expect, to fishing (this area is especially famous for crabs); how many work on the base is unclear. The most detailed, technical, assessment of the artillery duel is given by the US ‘geopolitical intelligence’ company STRATFOR. It released a report, accompanied by a pdf file showing satellite images taken after what it called the ‘North Korean attack on Yeonpyeong Island’. The STRATFOR reports are interesting partly for what they reveal but also what they hide or obscure and for what might be considered a surprising lack of geopolitical intelligence in an organisation in the business of selling the stuff. It admits that: A [South Korean] battery of six K9 155 mm self-propelled howitzers, which was conducting live-fire drills on a Yeonpyeong Island military base, fired some 80 rounds. And then, a bit further down: Significantly, the South claims its Yeonpyeong Island drill was not part of the larger Hoguk exercises under way simultaneously throughout South Korea. North Korea has occasionally protested these drills — including recently — and claims dozens of shells fell in North Korean waters near the island, provoking it to fire. However, as the North does not recognize the Northern Limit Line and considers the entire island and its surrounding water to be North Korean territory, it does not seem to be clear that this particular incident was any more provocative than any other drill.[79] This is a curious argument. Hoguk and the other military exercises over the decades have taken place in South Korean territory or international waters. This one was being held in what the North considered to be DPRK territory. It was not merely provocative from a military point of view, but as they made clear in their statement of 24 November, from a legal one as well. That is a very important distinction which differentiated the Yeonpyeong exercise from others. Although the STRAFOR report mentions the military base in passing, it is absent from the satellite images document. We have satellite photos of destroyed houses, but nothing about the base, which is not even identified. Since the base was the main target of attack, and early reports focused on military dead and wounded, this is a rather suspicious omission. The STRATFOR report, and images, do however throw considerable light, albeit inadvertently, on the issue of the civilian casualties. It would appear from this, and other sources, that the North Korean fire was not very accurate. The North Koreans either exclusively, or mainly (it is not clear which) used Multiple Launch Rocket System [MLRS] artillery These are, as the name suggests, basically a bundle of tubes which can fire rockets. Interestingly it is said that they can be traced back to the 15th century Korean hwacha (‘fire vehicle’) which could fire a hundred or more projectiles in one salvo.[80] The most famous example in modern times was the Soviet Katyusha, used in the Second World War and nicknamed the ‘Stalin organ’.[81] The Americans used them in 1991 in the Gulf War, and the ROK military is equipped with them.[82] MLRS can deliver formidable devastation but are not very accurate, especially the older versions with which the KPA is equipped: The initial barrage consisted of 150 rounds, followed by 20 more intermittently — meaning that while a full battalion appeared to be in position, a fully armed single battery could have conducted the entire attack. Of these 170 rounds, 80 struck Yeonpyeong Island, though 20 failed to detonate….. With a few modern exceptions, artillery rockets are unguided and achieve results through massed fires rather than exceptional accuracy. Here, North Korea had no opportunity to register targets or adjust fire based on input from forward observers; South Korea has subsequently conjectured based on the targets that the North’s maps of military positions on the island may have been dated. The failure of so many rounds to reach the island and a dud rate of roughly a quarter of those that did suggest issues of quality control in manufacture and/or poorly controlled storage, as well as the potential for there to have been issues in the fire direction or on the gunline.[83] So it would appear that the reason that shells fell on the town was not so much that that the firing was indiscriminate, but that it was inaccurate. The North Koreans do not have a monopoly on this, and there was anger in the National Assembly Intelligence Committee when they were presented with the satellite photo (Fig 5) which showed that Southern shells fired from their much more accurate howitzers had missed their target, the North Korean artillery positions Committee members reportedly reacted angrily since they show impact points scattered mainly in paddy and dry fields.[84] Fig 5: Evidence of inaccurate fire In this satellite photo released by the U.S. private intelligence agency Stratfor, rice paddies and fields in North Korea bear traces of South Korean artillery shells [&quot;Spies Intercepted Plans for Yeonpyeong Attack in August &quot;. Chosun Ilbo, 2 December 2010. There was also much dispute about the damage suffered by the North. The DPRK has not released any statement about casualties. In the South, some pointed out that their military equipment was far superior and more deadly and hence there must have been many casualties, and others pointed to the various satellite photos showing hits off target.[85] Sometimes military action is intended primarily to terrorise and demoralise the civilian population – the London blitz, the firebombing of Tokyo, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the ‘shock and awe’ bombing of Bagdad prior to invasion – are just a few examples. If the DPRK fired on Seoul to unleash ‘a sea of fire’ it would be the civilian population that would be hit, and the military impact would be secondary. However, much military action is aimed primarily at the enemy military, and if this happens in a populated area, civilians become, in the US euphemism, ‘collateral damage’. Clearly the distinction between the two is often blurred in practice, and it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to be sure, but it appears from the available evidence that the target for the North Korean fire was the marine base and that civilian casualties and damage were accidental. There are several reasons for assuming this. Firstly, the inaccuracy of the MLRS. Secondly, if the intention had been to cause civilian causalities as a warning about the consequences of Lee Myung-bak’s confrontational policy – ‘today Yeonpyeong, tomorrow Seoul’ – we would expect that point to be made. There is little point in giving a warning unless it is reasonably explicit. I can find no indication that the DPRK has made any suggestion that the Yeonpyeong incident carried such a lesson for the people of the ROK. On the contrary, the public statement expressed regret for civilian casualties and laid the blame on the Southern side: The DPRK side warned several times against the enemy's plan for shelling in the sensitive areas around Yonphyong Island and sent a telephone notice on the morning of the very day the incident occurred as part of its superhuman efforts to prevent the clash to the last moment, but the south side preempted the firing of shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side. The enemy side, however, has kept silent about all these facts. Moreover, it is now working hard to dramatize &quot;civilian casualties&quot; as part of its propaganda campaign, creating the impression that the defenceless civilians were exposed to &quot;indiscriminate shelling&quot; all of a sudden from the DPRK side. If that is true, it is very regrettable but the enemy should be held responsible for the incident as it took such inhuman action as creating &quot;a human shield&quot; by deploying civilians around artillery positions and inside military facilities before the launch of the provocation. The fact that there were human casualties inside the military base clearly proves itself the ulterior intention of the enemy. The U.S. regarded the death of innocent civilians as a common practice in the past in a bid to serve its military purposes in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and other parts of the world. This inhuman atrocity of the US. repeated itself on the Korean Peninsula this time. While the incident occurred, the shells indiscriminately fired by the enemy dropped in the area close to civilian houses far from the artillery positions of the Korean People's Army.[emphasis added][86] This statement brings up a third factor. The claim about a ‘human shield’ doesn’t carry much weight. Civilians live on the island for historical and economic reasons and there is no reason to suppose that they were used to shield the military. However, the claim that civilian casualties occurred within the camp is not implausible. Civilians must have worked at the camp. Indeed, one report from the United States said of the shelling that ‘this resulted in the killing of two South Korean soldiers and two civilian contractors working on a military base’ [emphasis added].[87] As with the Cheonan incident we need a proper, impartial, investigation if we are to draw any firm conclusions, but as with the Cheonan no such investigation is likely. It is interesting to note that the DPRK statement does not claim that it suffered any civilian causalities, merely that enemy shells ‘dropped in the area close to civilian houses’. North Korean propaganda is frequently portrayed as dishonest and deceitful. Here is surely a case where it would have been to their advantage to fabricate civilian casualties, but they did not do so. Finally, it should be remembered that the ROK military on Yeonpyeong Island are not just ordinary soldiers, they are marines, an elite force trained for amphibious assault. Indeed, back in 2009 Rodong Sinmun commented on the buildup up in the area The puppet military reinforced warships and armed forces along and near the &quot;northern limit line in the West Sea&quot; and formed a &quot;task force to be ready to go into action in half an hour&quot; and deployed it on Yonphyong Islet[emphasis added][88] The road behind, the road ahead The fire fight at Yeonpyeong Island seems to have been a manufactured crisis. It appears to be the first time that South Korea, alone or in tandem with the United States, has carried out a military exercise in territory claimed by the North.[89] There have been frequent naval clashes around the Northern Limit Line and it is fairly certain that it has been preserved for that purpose. If’ Seoul’ had really been anxious to avoid incidents and preserve peace then the NLL would have gone long ago. President Roh moo-hyun and Chairman Kim Jong Il, at their summit on 4 October 2007 agreed to ‘special peace and cooperation zone in the West Sea’, but this peace initiative was overturned, as so many others, by incoming president Lee Myung-bak.[90] Preserving the NLL as an area where incidents were likely is one thing, but utilising the NLL deliberately to create an incident is another Warnings and intelligence reports aside, it must have been known that a military exercise within the NLL area would be provocative. On top of which, the legal implications made it intolerably provocative. This suggests that the crisis was planned, not necessarily in great detail, but with sufficient surety of outcome. This reading is quite consistent with Lee Myung-bak’s policy, which is one of building up tension through tension in order to precipitate a crisis on the peninsula, a collapse of the DRPK, and its absorption by the ROK. The DPRK is well aware of this, hence the reaffirmation of the zero tolerance policy at Yeonpyeong. On 23 November, in the aftermath of the clash, the KPA issued a communiqué which reiterated the policy: It is a traditional mode of counter-action of the army of the DPRK to counter the firing of the provocateurs with merciless strikes. Should the south Korean puppet group dare intrude into the territorial waters of the DPRK even 0.001 mm, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will unhesitatingly continue taking merciless military counter-actions against it.[91] This is a calculated policy of brinkmanship, designed to avert war, by threatening war. The danger is, of course, that the momentum of events will bring war about. That, unfortunately, is becoming ever more likely. Lee Myung-bak is a consummate politician. He has set things in motion to produce, and replicate crisis, while giving the appearance of being reluctant. His address to the nation on 29 November used the same rhetorical device as Antony’s speech about Julius Caesar, where he claims to be burying Caesar, not praising him, but of course is doing just that. Lee combined ‘humility’ with an aggressive stance in such a way as to suggest he was reluctant to exacerbate the situation but was being forced into it. President Lee Myung-bak’s address Monday is being summarized as consisting mainly of “humility toward the people of South Korea” and an “ultra-hardline response to North Korea.” Analysts say it shows the president’s perception of the current crisis facing him and its solution following the North Korean artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island. Although even North Korea acknowledged the attack to be a “provocation,” President Lee has faced harsh criticism domestically. Surveys show that more than 70 percent of South Koreans, conservative and progressive alike, feel that the military and Lee Myung-bak administration did not respond appropriately at the time of the attack. The fact that the president began his address Monday with what amounted to an apology to the people of South Korea reflected a consideration of this situation. [emphasis added] The performance so impressed the reporter from the liberal Hankyoreh that we get manifestly false statement that ‘North Korea acknowledged the attack to be a ‘provocation’. Throughout the crises of 2001, especially over Cheonan and then Yeonpyeong, Lee Myung-bak has been very adroit in fanning the flames while give the impression that he was attempting to put them out. In respect of the Cheonan incident President Obama was reported as saying &quot;I think President Lee has shown extraordinary restraint given these circumstances.’[92] It may be objected that this was a public statement and should not be taken too literally; politicians often say in public the opposite of what they think in private. However, there does seem to be a consensus among Western observers at least that Lee is a reluctant warrior being driven into taking steps by the provocative obduracy of the North.[93] Take, for instance, this STRATFOR interview where the interviewer comments: I talked to three former [US?] envoys to Seoul this week and all of them agreed that South Korea had handled this in a pretty cool and sensible fashion[94] The South Korea public is rather more sceptical. One of the WikiLeaks cables [09SEOUL59] illustrates the confusion in the minds of US officials: President Lee is determined not to give in to North Korean pressure. Our Blue House contacts have told us on several occasions that President Lee remained quite comfortable with his North Korea policy and that he is prepared leave the inter-Korean relations frozen until the end of his term in office, if necessary. It is also our assessment that Lee's more conservative advisors and supporters see the current standoff as a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the North, even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship.[95] On the one hand we have Lee facing up to North Korean pressure, but we also get the admission that the ‘current standoff’ ( this was in 2009) is seen as ‘ a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the North, even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship’. Lee’s brinkmanship is, in fact, far more profound and aggressive than the US diplomat realised. Both North and South are engaging in brinkmanship, but the nature of the two is very different. Pyongyang is far poorer and weaker than its adversaries, which include not merely South Korea but the United States, and Japan.[96] North Korea’s brinkmanship is therefore inherently defensive. It is designed to protect the country (or regime if you prefer that) from attack and conquest. That does not mean that it is wise, or will be successful, that is a matter of debate. But it is important to recognise its essential characteristic of defensiveness. South Korea’s brinkmanship, on the other hand, is offensive. It is designed to bring about the collapse of the DPRK and its takeover by the ROK. Lee Myung-bak does not have to do this. His immediate predecessors (Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun) had very different policies. Indeed, his aggressive brinkmanship is arguably a new development because even in the days of the military dictatorships while there was hostility towards the North because the balance of forces if anything favoured the North, there was not such an ambitious policy. However, Lee Myung-bak is reputedly pragmatic and opportunistic. Soon after he won the presidency he was described in the New York Times thus: Mr. Lee has a reputation as a pragmatist who, in contrast to President Roh Moo-hyun, holds few strong ideological positions. As mayor, he created parks and reformed the public transportation system. As president, he said, his main agenda would be to revive the country’s economy.[97] If that is correct, his brinkmanship has been a response to events and opportunities, rather than a considered strategy. In addition, we may discern three factors which may be propelling him to accelerate the buildup of tension on the peninsula. • A desire to renew the anti-North momentum after the relative failure of the Cheonan incident. His setback in the May elections, the widespread public scepticism about the investigation, and the failure to get the UN Security Council to condemn North Korea must rankle. The Yeonpyeong incident is seen as away to rekindle anti-North Korea sentiment In his address on 29 November he specifically made the point: There was a split in public opinion over the torpedoing of the Cheonan. Unlike that time, our people have united as one this time.[98] Despite the frequent assertions of implosion and crisis, the DPRK is not facing collapse. Whilst sanctions must have caused huge damage it appears that the economy is recovering. Certainly Pyongyang, from personal observation on a visit in November 2010, is manifestly economically improved over my last visit three years ago, with more motor vehicles, bicycles, and shops. The electricity supply is much better and there is a very noticeable increase in street lighting. These observations are broadly corroborated by series of recent American visitors.[99] If the South is to take over the North then something must be done to reverse this recovery. Time is not on Lee Myung-bak’s side. His term of office comes to an end on 25 February 2013 and under the present constitution he is ineligible to run again. Moreover, there are suggestions that because of demographic changes the conservative ascendancy represented by the Lee administration may not be sustainable and that South Korea will move to more progressive administrations.[100] Since the North’s brinkmanship is defensive, it is reactive and this leaves the initiative in the hands of the South. Seoul has reinforced its forces on the NLL island and has announced that there will be artillery exercises from Daecheong Island, and again on Yeonpyeong. [101] It seems inevitable that Pyongyang will feel compelled to respond. The new ROK Defence Minister, Kim Kwan-jin, has threatened what he calls ‘self-defense air raids’ in the event of another clash; ‘self defense’ being used in the Japanese sense.[102] It will be recalled that clause 9 of the Japanese constitution prohibits the establishment of armed forces, so the Japanese army, navy and air forces all have ‘self-defense’ in their titles thus solving the constitutional problem. Kim Kwan-jin’s air strike policy is all part of what the New York Times rather approvingly, and with a professional use of euphemism, called a new ‘muscular military posture’.[103] The implications of this new policy are obvious. Not merely has the South great superiority in aircraft, but the new rules allow great flexibility for escalation. However, there are limits to the ROK military’s freedom of action. There is the legal issue of operational control – when would war be deemed a war and thus trigger US control of the ROK military ? But before that stage is reached, the ROK air force is dependent on US intelligence to operate. Thus any serious escalation of the situation on the Korean peninsula would require US endorsement. Would this be forthcoming? Unfortunately it looks as if it would. The Obama administration has termed its policy towards Korea as one of ‘strategic patience’. [104] It might be better described as ‘strategic paralysis’. Not merely has it ignored that calls of a many Korea experts to engage with the DPRK, but it has effectively relinquished control of events to Lee Myung-bak.[105] It might be said that ‘strategic paralysis’ is not confined to US Korea policy but is the defining characteristic of Obama foreign policy, and that would be true, but nowhere is it more perilous than in Korea. Because ultimately Korea is China. A second Korean war would, like the first, soon become a Sino-American war.<br />

<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">North Korean provocations are likely—U.S. involvement risks rapid escalation and pre-emptive strikes—deterrence only enrages the North </span></strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">Stares 1/13</span></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt; text-decoration: none;">—General John W. Vessey Senior Fellow for Conflict Prevention and Director of the Center for Preventive Action @ CFR, Adjunct Professor, Georgetown University, PhD (Paul B., 13 January 2011, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://38north.org/2011/01/on-escalation-in-korea/" rel="nofollow">http://38north.org/2011/01/on-escalation-in-korea/</a>, RBatra) </span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">Despite intermittent crises and many deadly clashes, nearly six decades have passed since the armistice agreement “ending” the Korean War was signed without there being a serious resumption of military hostilities. Though the armed standoff in Korea is hardly a desirable state of affairs, this record can be taken as a reassuring sign of its underlying stability. But how sanguine should we be that the current crisis will recede in much the same way that earlier ones have and that the deterrent relationship will hold? In fact, recent events raise some troubling questions about the volatility of the situation in Korea today. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">First, the November 23, 2010 shelling of Yeongpyeong Island by North Korean artillery clearly caught many experts by surprise. North-South relations had been thawing after a summer of heightened tensions following the sinking of the ROK naval ship Cheonan in March. Even the revelation of new nuclear enrichment facilities immediately prior to the attack had seemed to accomplish its putative goal of convincing the outside world that North Korea could not be left to stew in its own juices and that engagement was now imperative. So why would North Korea set back its coercive diplomatic campaign by launching yet another deadly provocation that antagonized everyone—including its principal patron China—just when the wind was clearly beginning to blow in its favor? Did North Korea fail to see this or did it miscalculate the impact of its actions? Did other factors, notably the succession process underway in Pyongyang, affect the calculus or tip the scales in some decisive way? </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Second, the attack on Yeongpyeong Island was also surprising in that it targeted areas inhabited by civilians for the first time since the Korean War. This was no accident, but a carefully choreographed and well executed attack as Joe Bermudez’s excellent account of what happened indicates. Yes, the numbers killed were still less than previous incidents. And yes, one can infer that the choice of Yeongpyeong still signaled restraint by North Korea as the military base on the island had been the source of offending live fire drills and, moreover, represented an “off peninsula” target and thus less likely to trigger wider escalation. But why would North Korea decide to brazenly disregard such an established “red line,” to say nothing of a cardinal international norm, at this time? Can we infer from this a growing willingness to breach other red lines and engage in still more risky behavior? </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Third, the rapid change in South Korean public opinion from being largely pacifist and unwilling to countenance a forceful response against North Korea to the situation today where a majority now favor military retaliation if provoked has introduced a new element into the crisis. Tough statements by senior ROK officials—including President Lee Myung Bak—that South Korea will use force in the event of another aggressive act suggest that the days of Southern forbearance are over. This is completely understandable and, to many, a necessary prerequisite to deter future provocations. Yet, how confident can we be—especially in light of recent events—that North Korea will take the threat of South Korean retaliation seriously? Might it only goad them further? And should we worry that South Korea might take preemptive action if it had credible indications of another provocation? </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Remarkably, despite all the commentary on the current crisis, to say nothing of the obvious stakes involved, scant attention has been given to how tensions might actually escalate rather than dissipate contrary to past experience. Certainly plenty of commentators have warned about how “miscalculation,” “loss of control” and “unintended escalation” could trigger a new Korean war, but rarely beyond such broad generalizations and assertions. Conversely, those who discount the likelihood of significant escalation should the South retaliate militarily in the future have been no more forthcoming in explaining why the risk remains low other than repeating the broad conviction that it is in neither side’s interests to go to war. As we have seen in many cases, however, an expectation of rational behavior—especially for decision makers under conditions of stress and incomplete information­­—is not something that can be reliably assumed. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The propensity of another major clash on or around the peninsula to escalate militarily depends on numerous complex factors. Understanding them may seem like an arcane or academic exercise, but it is in fact critically important to considering how best to manage the current crisis and prevent the very outcome that everyone—including presumably the North Koreans—wishes to avoid. Four interrelated variables are likely to be the critical ingredients to how another deadly clash might escalate. These can be simplified as the “who, where, what and why” factors: </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Who’s Involved: In the most recent provocations, North Korea has evidently been careful to confine their operations to South Korean targets. A future incident that either intentionally or accidentally involves U.S. forces or citizens in Korea would clearly raise the stakes. It is has been some time since this has happened and one could infer that North Korea understands that the risks have grown too high and thus they will continue to refrain from any direct or harmful interactions with the United States. The decision to carry out joint U.S.-ROK naval exercises in the vicinity of the recent provocations presumably had this in mind to help deter further attacks. Yet, how sure can we really be that North Korea would not target U.S. forces in the future? Might they make the same calculation that the U.S. will be just as risk averse to taking retaliatory action as the ROK has been to date? And even if they do continue to avoid provocations that may involve the U.S., how confident are we that they would know when U.S. forces or citizens are not in harm’s way? Finally, while the involvement of the U.S. would clearly increase the risk of military escalation, we should also not overlook the potential role of Japan. It too has been the target of past provocations and its tolerance for aggressive North Korean behavior has lessened considerably in recent years while its capacity for military retaliation has manifestly increased. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Where the Interactions Take Place: As several analysts have pointed out, the Cheonan and Yeongpyeong incidents are the latest in a decade-long sequence of military clashes along the disputed Northern Limit Line (NLL)—all of which have stayed localized. Were additional incidents to occur in this same general area, the supposition is that South Korea would retaliate in the proximate vicinity and in a proportional way to reduce the risk of further escalation. This raises the question of whether North Korea would view South Korean retaliation against mainland, i.e. “on peninsular” targets—which are reportedly now being considered—as a qualitatively different and therefore disproportionate response regardless of how discrete or contained they were? There is no assurance, in any case, that North Korea would confine any future provocations to the NLL/Yellow Sea area. Meddling with the Kaesong Industrial Complex, including the detention of South Koreans who work there, has been mentioned as a possibility. Insertion of special forces into the South if only for reconnaissance purposes is also not out of the question. There have been plenty of precedents after all. Neither should Seoul be viewed as off limits as demonstrated by the failed assassination attempt in late 2009 by a North Korean “hit team” against their most senior defector Hwang Jang Yop. How South Korea would respond proportionately to these or similar types of activities are not immediately clear, though one can anticipate considerable public agitation to retaliate promptly. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">What Type of Interactions Take Place: The scale, intensity, and nature of any further military interactions clearly have a major bearing on how a crisis would subsequently escalate. Intermittent artillery duels across the NLL and even the DMZ would probably not precipitate a major outbreak of hostilities. The use of airpower, however, which has been raised as a possible retaliatory option by the new ROK Defense Minister, introduces a new, more uncertain element since it entails the direct incursion of sovereign territory and thus represents a clearer political affront to the North. (It also introduces the possibility of downed and captured pilots that could also complicate matters). Targeting major symbols of national power such as nuclear facilities and missile bases—however surgically undertaken—would undoubtedly represent a still greater challenge to the North which we can reliably assume would not go unanswered. The most important variable, however, will be the perceived operational status of each side’s main offensive capabilities. If either North or South Korea perceives that opposing forces are being readied to engage in large scale offensive operations, the incentives to strike first will inevitably increase. For the North the reason would be to avert the almost certain demise of the regime and for the South it would be to minimize the risk to Seoul. But, as has often been observed, precautionary defensive measures designed to bolster deterrence are not easily distinguishable from offensive preparations and thus the potential for miscalculation exists. Here changes to the size, disposition, and alert status of U.S. forces in and around Korea, including the potential activation of reinforcements and the evacuation of non-combatants from forward areas, will be absolutely critical to perceptions of intent. </span><br />

Beijing's record during 2010 was far more disconcerting. In March, North Korea sank a South Korean corvette, killing forty-six sailors. In November, it revealed the existence of a facility for enriching uranium, providing Pyongyang an additional prospective path for fissile material development apart from its existing plutonium capability. Later in the same month, it shelled a coastal island, killing South Korean soldiers and civilians. Yet China declined to call Pyongyang to account for these outrages, and sought to protect North Korea from international opprobrium.<br />
China's responses diverged sharply from those of the United States, South Korea and Japan. It talked the talk of major-power cooperation but it did not walk the walk, even in the face of direct threats to regional stability and security about which Beijing has professed repeated concern. Moreover, Beijing openly chastised Washington for undertaking enhanced defense cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo to inhibit additional provocations by Pyongyang.<br />
South Korea has stated that it will no longer tolerate future provocations by the North. It also voices open doubt that Beijing will restrain Pyongyang. South Korean retaliation for additional North Korean actions is no longer a question of if, but of when. Even if Seoul responds in a focused and proportionate manner, such retaliation creates the danger of a cycle of escalation. <br />

The United States government believes China needs to do more to contribute to stability on the Korean peninsula. According to this view, North Korea is highly dependent on Chinese support and Beijing should use its influence to moderate Pyongyang’s behavior. As some American and other Western observers have put it, it is time for China to start behaving like a responsible great power. But it is not likely that China will fundamentally alter its policies.<br />
The main reason for this is that geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States overshadows the situation on the Korean peninsula. Lately both Chinese and US actions have escalated this rivalry. As long as the two powers are more interested in keeping the other in check than in stabilising the peninsula no significant progress in terms of stabilising the region is possible.<br />
North Korea recently shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong after a period of escalating tensions, killing two soldiers and two civilians. North Korea claims that it opened fire after being provoked by a South Korean exercise. In response to the shelling incident the US and South Korea have conducted joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea. These involved a US aircraft carrier and are regarded as threatening not only by North Korea but also by China.<br />
China’s economic and diplomatic support for North Korea undermines efforts by other countries to affect the behavior of the regime in Pyongyang. Even China is troubled by North Korean behavior. The North Korean nuclear program, and the risks Pyongyang is running in escalating tensions with South Korea and the US, are counter to China’s security interests. Theoretically, the Chinese government could therefore decide to put pressure on Pyongyang by limiting its economic support and by ending the diplomatic support it often gives in the United Nations Security Council. It is very unlikely that China’s policy towards North Korea will change much. The US diplomatic reports revealed by WikiLeaks are a confirmation of uneasy Sino-North Korean relations rather than an indication that this relationship is about to change.<br />
China will probably continue to give more support than any other country because it is highly vulnerable to the consequences of political or economic collapse in North Korea. The longest and most accessible border of North Korea is the one it shares with China. Chaos in North Korea would harm stability in China’s northeast, the region formerly known as Manchuria.<br />
Moreover, Beijing is less motivated to put pressure on the North Korean regime than other countries are. The US is primarily interested in preventing the proliferation of nuclear technologies from North Korea. South Korea and Japan are mainly worried about the military threat from the north. Compared with these countries, China is less concerned about such issues.<br />
The most fundamental element in China’s policy towards North Korea is that Beijing regards the US as a greater security threat than the situation on the Korean peninsula. Since neither China nor the US is by itself the predominant great power in Korean affairs, Beijing can only assume responsibility for regional stability if it does so jointly with the US. However, this will not happen since China and the US each regard one another as their main potential military adversary. They also have contrary interests on the Korean peninsula.<br />
While China regards the US military presence in South Korea as a potential threat that should eventually be removed, the US intends to maintain this presence as it helps to limit Chinese regional influence. The relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang cannot be seen apart from this context of geopolitical rivalry. It is desirable for China that the regime in North Korea continues to exist and that the Chinese government retains a certain degree of influence in Pyongyang.<br />

<strong>The recent meeting changed nothing—military presence prevents Chinese pressure and risks regional arms races and war</strong><br />
<strong>Klein-Ahlbrandt 1/21</strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">—China Adviser and North East Asia Project Director at Crisis Group, supervises the work of a small team of analysts responsible for high quality research and analysis on North East Asia (Stephanie Klein-Ahlbrandt, 21 January 2011, Despite Reports, “China's North Korea Policy Stays the Same,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-t-kleineahlbrandt/post_1614_b_812407.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-t-kleineahlbrandt/post_1614_b_812407.html</a>, RBatra) </span><br />
<br />
During Hu Jintao's visit, he penned a joint statement with President Obama in which -- for the first time -- he voiced concern about North Korea's new uranium enrichment. Many in the U.S. and South Korea are hailing this as support for their position, but they should know better. Despite tactical moves to smooth Hu Jintao's visit, little about China's North Korea policy has changed over the last few weeks nor is it likely to anytime soon.<br />
In the past, a less strident Beijing's willingness to calibrate its responses to North Korean provocations was key to the West's strategy to moderate Pyongyang's behavior. But internal debates on North Korea policy have given way to traditionalist and conservative forces increasingly dictating the line, backed by nationalist public opinion. Over the past year and a half, China has strengthened its political, economic and military relationship with the North, refusing to hold Pyongyang to account for deadly attacks on the South which recently brought the peninsula the closest to war since 1953.<br />
China's top concern of instability on its border deepened in 2009 following reports of Kim Jong-Il's failing health, a disastrous currency reform, and uncertainties surrounding leadership transition. But Beijing's calculations are also increasingly shaped by rising concerns about a perceived U.S. strategic &quot;return to Asia&quot; and by opposition to American military and political presence in the region. China is using its close ties with Pyongyang as a bulwark against U.S. military dominance in the region, giving the rogue nation virtually unconditional diplomatic protection. The two presidents' joint statement this week glosses over all of these realities.<br />
When North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island on November 23 and after the sinking of the South Korean naval ship Cheonan on March 26, China's initial reaction was to dismiss international calls to pressure North Korea. Instead, it criticized U.S. and South Korea for military exercises held in response, which it viewed as more threatening to its security than North Korea's violent behavior. It felt the U.S. was using tensions on the Peninsula as a justification to expand its regional military presence. China also worried about the deepening military cooperation between the U.S., South Korea and Japan, seeing U.S. security assistance not only as an attempt to contain China but also as emboldening regional players against it. While weeks after the shelling, China toned down its criticism of the U.S. and sent an envoy to Pyongyang, it has made no changes to its fundamental economic, military and political support to Pyongyang. Beijing's tactical moves should not be confused with a broader shift in its approach towards North Korea.<br />
Beijing's solidarity with Pyongyang has significantly strained relations with South Korea and Japan, which are strengthening their security alliances with the U.S. Their rejection of China's call for emergency consultations after the Yeonpyeong Island shelling was more than a display of frustration at Beijing's unwillingness to take concrete action. It showed a widening gap between the two camps' perceptions of the North Korean threat and the appropriate ways to manage it. There is a real danger that the North will continue its asymmetric attacks in the Yellow Sea or elsewhere in the South. In response, Japan and South Korea are significantly boosting their military capabilities, intensifying the risk of a regional arms race or of a miscalculation leading to war.<br />
Beijing's stance on North Korea is only the latest example of its increasingly assertive foreign policy behavior. Over the past year, it has intensified sweeping claims to disputed territories in the South China Sea and Diaoyu Islands, escalated a minor incident at sea into a major confrontation with Japan, and showed off a new stealth fighter aircraft just as the U.S. and China were trying to restart their military relations. Beijing is more unwilling now to yield to external demands and increasingly expects quid pro quos from the West in return for cooperation on third country issues such as North Korea and Iran. A common question in Chinese policy circles is why continue to cooperate with the U.S. when it continues to sell arms to Taiwan.<br />
China needs to step up to the plate and assume the responsibilities that come with its rising power status. It has censured North Korea in the past after the 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. Its failure to do the same now -- for the Cheonan sinking, Yeonpyeong Island attack and Pyongyang's new uranium enrichment -- endangers not just the region but also its own security interests. Shielding Pyongyang and continuing unconditional engagement reduces all other countries' ability to deter North Korea. China's strategy leaves it vulnerable to accusation that it is responsible for enabling North Korea's next attack. Let's hope President Obama realizes the joint statement must be backed up with a stern message to President Hu that Beijing's increasingly cozy relationship with Pyongyang and insistence on backing the North's bad behavior only heightens the risk of regional conflict.<br />

<br />
The strategy of imposing tighter economic sanctions also faces major hurdles. Both Beijing and Moscow have consistently opposed vigorous sanctions in the UN Security Council, arguing that they will make Pyongyang less rather than more cooperative. The Russians and Chinese (particularly the latter) were successful in dramatically diluting the 2009 sanctions that the United States and Japan wanted. <br />
It is especially important to understand the reasons for China's reluctance to endorse truly robust sanctions. Although a few Sinophobes in the United States charge that China is in league with the North Koreans and would not mind a nuclear-armed North Korea, most evidence suggests that Beijing is not eager to see nuclear weapons introduced on the Korean Peninsula. Among other drawbacks, such a development may lead the Japanese to build nuclear deterrents of their own, which is the last thing China wants. <br />
Maintaining the non-nuclear status quo on the Korean Peninsula may be a significant Chinese objective, but it is not their most important one.5 Beijing's top priority is to preserve the North Korean state as a buffer between China and the US sphere of influence in Northeast Asia. Chinese leaders probably fear that rigorous sanctions would increase the danger of the North Korean state imploding, much as East Germany did in 1989. Such a development could lead to a unified Korea allied to the United States right on China's doorsteps-probably with the continued presence of American military bases on the Korean Peninsula. It might lead to a massive flow of North Korean refugees into China. Uneasiness over these scenarios limits the amount of pressure that Beijing is willing to exert on Pyongyang. <br />
In theory, China might be able to use its economic leverage as North Korea's principal source of energy, food, and other vital commodities to compel Kim Jong Il's regime to halt its nuclear weapons program. Without Chinese cooperation, coercive economic measures would have little impact on Pyongyang. And given Washington's dependence on Beijing's willingness to continue funding the soaring US Treasury debt, American officials are not in a good bargaining position to pressure China into endorsing robust sanctions.<br />

<strong>China is crucial to any solvency effort</strong><br />

<br />
China yesterday called for emergency direct diplomacy with North Korea in order to lower escalating tensions following last week's artillery attack on South Korea (see GSN, Nov. 24).<br />
However, the United States and its allies said now is not the time to address Pyongyang's demands for new six-party talks.<br />
North Korea's shelling of the inhabited South Korean island of Yeonpyeong resulted in the deaths of several soldiers and civilians and injuries to nearly 20 more. The incident directly followed news from Washington that Pyongyang revealed to visiting U.S. experts earlier this month that it had covertly built a large-scale advanced uranium enrichment facility at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, the Wall Street Journal reported.<br />
The two events have renewed international attention on the North Korean nuclear impasse. Beijing dispatched its senior foreign affairs official to lead a delegation to Seoul over the weekend for talks on the crisis. However, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak told the Chinese visitors that it was not the &quot;right time&quot; to relaunch long-stalled six-nation talks aimed at the permament denuclearization of North Korea, according to an administration official.<br />
The nuclear talks involve China, Japan, the two Koreas, Russia and the United States. They were last held almost two years ago. Pyongyang withdrew from the negotiations in April 2009 and one month later carried out its second nuclear weapons test, an action for which it was punished with heightened U.N. Security Council sanctions.<br />
The North for some time has declared its willingness to return to the nuclear talks. However, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo are leery of returning to a negotiating framework that has been used by the North in the past as a means to win international concessions only to later resume work on its nuclear weapons program. The three allies have called on Pyongyang to demonstrate its &quot;sincere&quot; commitment to nuclear disarmament before they will agree to resume negotiations. <br />
China is North Korea's strongest foreign ally and chief economic benefactor. Beijing's continued support of the Kim Jong Il regime is frequently cited in Washington as the only thing keeping the Stalinist government from collapsing. Because of this, China has come under growing criticism from the international community to do more to press North Korea over its belligerent behavior.<br />
&quot;It's hard to know why China doesn't push harder,&quot; Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a CNN interview aired yesterday. &quot;They clearly are interested in this -- in the region not spinning out of control -- so my sense is they try to control this guy, and I'm not sure he is controllable.&quot;<br />
Lee yesterday told Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo in blunt remarks that China must take a &quot;more fair and responsible position&quot; on peninsula affairs and leave Cold War-era considerations behind, according to presidential spokesman Hong Sang-pyo.<br />
In a television address today, Lee pledged North Korea &quot;would pay a price&quot; for any future hostilities and said that &quot;more endurance and forgiveness would only result in bigger provocations&quot; (Fairclough/Ramstad, Wall Street Journal I, Nov. 28).<br />
Japan today dismissed Beijing's call for direct talks with North Korea. Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said it would be &quot;unacceptable for us to hold six-party talks only because North Korea has gone amok,&quot; the Wall Street Journal reported (Yuka Hayashi, Wall Street Journal II, Nov. 29).<br />
The United States has yet to give a response to China's call for emergency talks, saying it would carry out discussions with the South Korean government first, Reuters reported.<br />
A high-ranking Pyongyang official voiced doubts about Beijing's initiative to engage in discussions. While the North has not responded to China's call, the unidentified official told Kyodo News that countries involved in the latest incident should meet for talks first (Laurence/Choonsik, Reuters, Nov. 29).<br />
While urging that the two Koreas to refrain from actions that would raise tensions on the peninsula, China has abstained from condemning Pyongyang's shelling of the South Korean island, indicating that Beijing will refuse the urging of Washington and other states to punish the North, the Los Angeles Times reported last Thursday.<br />
North Korea's presumed possession of the nuclear bomb, its large arsenal of chemical weapons and a massive standing army make a military assault on the isolated state an unattractive option, according to reports. The United States and much of the international community have already drastically curtailed trade relations with the Stalinist state. In the White House view, China remains the only nation to have sway over the North and the only hope of producing a change in the Korean nuclear impasse.<br />
&quot;China is pivotal to moving North Korea in a fundamentally different direction,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said.<br />
&quot;You can go [to] the U.N. Security Council or call for a five-party meeting (minus North Korea). But first you've got to go after China,&quot; said Victor Cha, point man for North Korean policy during the Bush administration. <br />

<strong>Korea war goes global and nuclear</strong><br />
<strong>STRATFOR 10</strong> <span style="font-size: 5.0pt;">(5/26/10, “North Korea, South Korea: The Military Balance on the Peninsula,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100526_north_korea_south_korea_military_balance_peninsula" rel="nofollow">http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100526_north_korea_south_korea_military_balance_peninsula</a>, JMP) </span><br />
<br />
So the real issue is the potential for escalation — or an accident that could precipitate escalation — that would be beyond the control of Pyongyang or Seoul. With both sides on high alert, both adhering to their own national (and contradictory) definitions of where disputed boundaries lie and with rules of engagement loosened, the potential for sudden and rapid escalation is quite real.<br />
Indeed, North Korea’s navy, though sizable on paper, is largely a hollow shell of old, laid-up vessels. What remains are small fast attack craft and submarines — mostly Sang-O “Shark” class boats and midget submersibles. These vessels are best employed in the cluttered littoral environment to bring asymmetric tactics to bear — not unlike those Iran has prepared for use in the Strait of Hormuz. These kinds of vessels and tactics — including, especially, the deployment of naval mines — are poorly controlled when dispersed in a crisis and are often impossible to recall. <br />
For nearly 40 years, tensions on the Korean Peninsula were managed within the context of the wider Cold War. During that time it was feared that a second Korean War could all too easily escalate into and a thermonuclear World War III, so both Pyongyang and Seoul were being heavily managed from their respective corners. In fact, USFK was long designed to ensure that South Korea could not independently provoke that war and drag the Americans into it, which for much of the Cold War period was of far greater concern to Washington than North Korea attacking southward. <br />
Today, those constraints no longer exist. There are certainly still constraints — neither the United States nor China wants war on the peninsula. But current tensions are quickly escalating to a level unprecedented in the post-Cold War period, and the constraints that do exist have never been tested in the way they might be if the situation escalates much further. <br />

<br />
The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious, not only for the Northeast Asian region but for the whole international community. <br />
At worst, there is the possibility of nuclear attack1, whether by intention, miscalculation, or merely accident, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities. On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust of unprecedented proportions. <br />
But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: <br />
That is not global winter, but the nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years. The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow…The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger…To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.4 <br />
These, of course, are not the only consequences. Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. The direct impacts, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, could make the present global financial crisis pale by comparison. How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. There could be many unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with subsequent nuclear breakout and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, and aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant states. The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community. <br />
<span class="Underline">North Korea is currently believed to have sufficient plutonium stocks to produce up to 12 nuclear weapons.6 If and when it is successful in implementing a uranium enrichment program - having announced publicly that it is experimenting with enrichment technology on September 4, 20097 in a communication with the UN Security Council - it would likely acquire the capacity to produce over 100 such weapons. Although some may dismiss Korean Peninsula proliferation risks on the assumption that the North Korean regime will implode as a result of its own economic problems, food problems, and treatment of its own populace, there is little to suggest that this is imminent. If this were to happen, there would be the risk of nuclear weapons falling into hands of non-state actors in the disorder and chaos that would ensue. Even without the outbreak of nuclear hostilities on the Korean Peninsula in either the near or longer term, North Korea has every financial incentive under current economic sanctions and the needs of its military command economy to export its nuclear and missile technologies to other states. Indeed, it has already been doing this for some time. The Proliferation Security Initiative may conceivably prove effective in intercepting ship-borne nuclear exports, but it is by no means clear how air-transported materials could similarly be intercepted. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Given the high stakes involved, North Korean proliferation, if unaddressed and unreversed, has the potential to destabilize the whole East Asian region and beyond. Even if a nuclear exchange does not occur in the short term, the acute sense of nuclear threat that has been experienced for over five decades by North Koreans as a result of US strategic deterrence is now likely to be keenly felt by fellow Koreans south of the 38th Parallel and Japanese across the waters of the Sea of Japan. China, too, must surely feel itself to be at risk from North Korean nuclear weapons, or from escalation that might ensue from next-use in the Korean Peninsula resulting not only in the environmental consequences noted above, but in regime collapse and massive refugee flows. South Korea and Japan appear willing to rely on their respective bilateral security pacts with the United States to deter North Korean nuclear attack for the time being. However, should South Korea and/or Japan acquire nuclear weapons, the outcome would be destabilizing, especially if this resulted from rupture of their alliance relationships with the United States. Both have the technical capability to do so very rapidly. South Korea has previously engaged in nuclear weapons research but desisted after US pressure. Japan still proclaims its adherence to the three Non-Nuclear Principles although recent confirmation that the United States routinely transited nuclear weapons through Japan and retains the right of emergency reintroduction of nuclear weapons has tarnished Japan’s non-nuclear image. Moreover, it has large stockpiles of plutonium that could rapidly be used to produce nuclear warheads. Such responses, already advocated by conservative and nationalist groups within South Korea and Japan, could trigger a regional nuclear arms race involving the Koreas, Japan, Taiwan, and China, with incalculable wider consequences for Southeast Asia, South Asia and the whole Pacific and beyond. These developments would spell the demise of the current global non-proliferation regime as underpinned by the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Failure to reverse the DPRK’s nuclear breakout is also an important factor driving a general malaise in the exercise of American power which one of the authors has characterized elsewhere as “the end of American nuclear hegemony.”8</span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">Escalates to nuclear war </span></strong></span><br />
<strong>Cimbala 10</strong><span style="font-size: 5.0pt;"> - Prof. of Political Science @ Penn State, (Stephen, Nuclear Weapons and Cooperative Security in the 21st Century, p. 117-8) </span><br />
<br />
Failure to contain proliferation in Pyongyang could spread nuclear fever throughout Asia. Japan and South Korea might seek nuclear weapons and missile defenses. A pentagonal configuration of nuclear powers in the Pacific basis (Russia, China, Japan, and the two Koreas – not including the United States, with its own Pacific interests) could put deterrence at risk and create enormous temptation toward nuclear preemption. Apart from actual use or threat of use, North Korea could exploit the mere existence of an assumed nuclear capability in order to support its coercive diplomacy. As George H. Quester has noted: <br />
If the Pyongyang regime plays its cards sensibly and well, therefore, the world will not see its nuclear weapons being used against Japan or South Korea or anyone else, but will rather see this new nuclear arsenal held in reserve (just as the putative Israeli nuclear arsenal has been held in reserve), as a deterrent against the outside world’s applying maximal pressure on Pyongyang and as a bargaining chip to extract the economic and political concessions that the DPRK needs if it wishes to avoid giving up its peculiar approach to social engineering. <br />
A five-sided nuclear competition in the Pacific would be linked, in geopolitical deterrence and proliferation space, to the existing nuclear deterrents in India and Pakistan, and to the emerging nuclear weapons status of Iran. An arc of nuclear instability from Tehran to Tokyo could place U.S. proliferation strategies into the ash heap of history and call for more drastic military options, not excluding preemptive war, defenses, and counter-deterrent special operations. In addition, an eight-sided nuclear arms race in Asia would increase the likelihood of accidental or inadvertent nuclear war. It would do so because: (1) some of these states already have histories of protracted conflict; (2) states may have politically unreliable or immature command and control systems, especially during a crisis involving a decision for nuclear first strike or retaliation; unreliable or immature systems might permit a technical malfunction that caused an unintended launch, or a deliberate but unauthorized launch by rogue commanders; (3) faulty intelligence and warning systems might cause one side to misinterpret the other’s defensive moves to forestall attack as offensive preparations for attack, thus triggering a mistaken preemption. <br />

<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">Sanger 12/6</span></strong><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">— Chief Washington Correspondent for The New York Times, appointed adjunct professor of public policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard AND Michael Wines, the China bureau chief for The New York Times, M.S. degree (David E., 6 December 2010, “North Korea Is Sign of Chilled U.S.-China Relations”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/world/asia/07china.html?ref=northkorea" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/world/asia/07china.html?ref=northkorea</a>, RBatra) </span></span><br />

<span class="Underline">But in Beijing, both Chinese and American officials and analysts have another explanation: the long silence epitomizes the speed with which relations between Washington and Beijing have plunged into a freeze. This year has witnessed the longest period of tension between the two capitals in a decade. And if anything, both sides appear to be hardening their positions. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">“The issues that used to be on the positive side of the ledger are increasingly on the negative side of the ledger, starting with North Korea,” Bonnie Glaser, a China scholar at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview last week. “I don’t think this is easily repairable, and I think we’re going to have a fairly cold relationship over the next two years, and potentially longer.” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Mr. Obama came into office seeking just the opposite: a new rapprochement with a rising power whose deep economic ties with the United States all but demand closer diplomatic ones. But the days when the White House spoke of a “G-2” that would manage the world economy and more, a phrase that preceded the first meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu in the depths of the financial crisis in early 2009, are long over. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Instead, he faces a problem very similar to the one Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton described in March 2009 during a lunch with Kevin Rudd, a China expert who was then Australia’s prime minister, according to a cable recounting their conversation that was in a newly released trove of WikiLeaks documents. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Mrs. Clinton was said to have asked Mr. Rudd, “How do you deal toughly with your banker?”‘ </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The latest bad sign is that cooperation on managing North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, which began with considerable promise in 2009, appears to have disintegrated. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">On Monday, Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to convene an emergency meeting in Washington with her Japanese and South Korean counterparts about both the North’s shelling of a South Korean island last month, and its recent disclosure of a new nuclear facility that potentially expands its nuclear arsenal. China, the only nation with real sway over the North Korean leadership, will not be there. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">To the contrary, China’s strategy on North Korea is at odds with that of Washington and its allies. In Monday’s telephone call with Mr. Hu, the White House said, Mr. Obama said North Korea’s new enrichment facility flouted commitments it made during the six-party talks on curbing its nuclear program, and urged China’s help in sending “a clear message to North Korea that its provocations are unacceptable.” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">One former Chinese official with close ties to the government dismissed the American approach last week as characteristically legalistic. The former official, who would not be named because he is not authorized to speak on the topic, said China’s strategy is to reassure the Koreans about their security, not lecture them about diplomatic obligations. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Beijing is deeply concerned about a quick South Korean and U.S. takeover of North Korea with U.S. troops at China's doorsteps. Beijing and Washington seem to be sliding into a vicious cycle of mutual strategic mistrust. The deeper the mistrust, the more valuable North Korea is to China. </span><br />

But American engagement may not be enough. The PRC could play a particularly important role in dissuading the North from its nuclear course. Indeed, H.D.S. Greenway of the Boston Globe has advocated building on &quot;the new climate of U.S.-Chinese cooperation of late.&quot; 94 Such a strategy would offer at least one additional benefit. Working together to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis successfully would make it easier to resolve other disputes between Washington and Beijing, thereby laying the groundwork for a wide-ranging partnership in the years and decades ahead. Nevertheless, the most important and immediate goal remains halting nuclear proliferation in Northeast Asia. <br />

<span class="Underline">The Obama administration has explicitly sought to “reset” the relationship with Russia, which had become quite dysfunctional during the final years of the Bush administration. Although Washington has not used the reset terminology with respect to the troubled U.S. relationship with China, the substantive goal appears to be similar.

<span class="Underline">Both goals, however, are encountering headwinds for a key reason. Policy makers seem unwilling to accept the reality that any great power in the international system expects, and will seek to enforce, a sphere of influence in its immediate region.

<br />
The evolution of Sino-U.S. relations over the next months, years, and decades has the potential to have a greater impact on global security and prosperity than any other bilateral or multilateral arrangement. In this sense, many analysts consider the US.-China diplomatic relationship to be the most influential in the world. Without question, strong and stable U.S. alliances provide the foundation for the protection and promotion of U.S. and global interests. Yet within that broad framework, the trajectory of U.S.-China relations will determine the success, or failure, of efforts to address the toughest global challenges: global financial stability, energy security and climate change, nonproliferation, and terrorism, among other pressing issues. Shepherding that trajectory in the most constructive direction possible must therefore be a priority for Washington and Beijing. Virtually no major global challenge can be met without U.S.-China cooperation. The uncertainty of that future trajectory and the &quot;strategic mistrust&quot; between leaders in Washington and Beijing necessarily concerns many experts and policymakers in both countries. Although some U.S. analysts see China as a strategic competitor—deliberately vying with the United States for energy resources, military superiority, and international political influence alike— analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has generally found that China uses its soft power to pursue its own, largely economic, international agenda primarily to achieve its domestic objectives of economic growth and social stability.1 Although Beijing certainly has an eye on Washington, not all of its actions are undertaken as a counterpoint to the United States. In addition, CSIS research suggests that growing Chinese soft power in developing countries may have influenced recent U.S. decisions to engage more actively and reinvest in soft-power tools that have atrophied during the past decade. To the extent that there exists a competition between the United States and China, therefore, it may be mobilizing both countries to strengthen their ability to solve global problems. To be sure, U.S. and Chinese policy decisions toward the respective other power will be determined in large part by the choices that leaders make about their own nations interests at home and overseas, which in turn are shaped by their respective domestic contexts. Both parties must recognize—and accept—that the other will pursue a foreign policy approach that is in its own national interest. Yet, in a globalized world, challenges are increasingly transnational, and so too must be their solutions. As demonstrated by the rapid spread of SARS from China in 2003, pandemic flu can be spread rapidly through air and via international travel. Dust particulates from Asia settle in Lake Tahoe. An economic downturn in one country can and does trigger an economic slowdown in another. These challenges can no longer be addressed by either containment or isolation. What constitutes the national interest today necessarily encompasses a broader and more complex set of considerations than it did in the past As a general principle, the United States seeks to promote its national interest while it simultaneously pursues what the CSIS Commission on Smart Power called in its November 2007 report the &quot;global good.&quot;3 This approach is not always practical or achievable, of course. But neither is it pure benevolence. Instead, a strategic pursuit of the global good accrues concrete benefits for the United States (and others) in the form of building confidence, legitimacy, and political influence in key countries and regions around the world in ways that enable the United States to better confront global and transnational challenges. In short, the global good comprises those things that all people and governments want but have traditionally not been able to attain in the absence of U.S. leadership. Despite historical, cultural, and political differences between the United States and China, Beijing's newfound ability, owing to its recent economic successes, to contribute to the global good is a matter for common ground between the two countries. Today there is increasing recognition that no major global challenge can be addressed effectively, much less resolved, without the active engagement of—and cooperation between—the United States and China. The United States and China—the worlds first- and third-largest economies—are inextricably linked, a fact made ever more evident in the midst of the current global financial crisis. Weak demand in both the United States and China, previously the twin engines of global growth, has contributed to the global economic downturn and threatens to ignite simmering trade tensions between the two countries. Nowhere is the interconnectedness of the United States and China more clear than in international finance. China has $2 trillion worth of largely U.S. dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves and is the world's largest holder—by far—of U.S. government debt. Former treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson and others have suggested that the structural imbalances created by this dynamic fueled the current economic crisis. Yet. China will almost certainly be called on to purchase the lion's share of new U.S. debt instruments issued in connection with the U.S. stimulus and recovery package. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's February 23.2009, reassurance to Beijing that U.S. markets remain safe and her call for continued Chinese investment in the U.S. bond market as a means to help both countries, and the world, emerge from global recession underscored the shared interest—and central role—that both countries have in turning around the global economy quickly. Although China's considerable holdings of U.S. debt have been seen as a troubling problem, they are now being perceived as a necessary part of a global solution. Similarly, as the worlds two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and the United States share not only the collateral damage of energy-inefficient economic growth, but a primary responsibility to shape any ultimate global solutions to climate change. To date, cooperation has been elusive, owing as much to Washington's reluctance as to Beijing's intransigence. Painting China as the environmental bogeyman as an excuse for foot-dragging in policymaking is no longer an option; for its part, China, as the world's top polluter, must cease playing the developing-economy card. Yet energy security and climate change remain an area of genuine opportunity for joint achievement. Indeed, U.S.-China cooperation in this field is a sine qua non of any response to the energy and climate challenges. The sheer size of the Chinese economy means that collaboration with the United States could set the de facto global standards for etficiency and emissions in key economic sectors such as industry and transportation. Climate change also provides an area for cooperation in previously uncharted policy waters, as in emerging Arctic navigational and energy exploration opportunities. Washington and Beijing also share a deep and urgent interest in international peace and stability. The resumption of U.S.-China military contacts is a positive development. As two nuclear powers with worldwide economic and strategic interests, both countries want to minimize instability and enhance maritime security, as seen by parallel antipiracy missions in the waters otT Somalia. Joint efforts in support of United Nations peacekeeping, nonproliferation, and counterterrorism offer critical areas for bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Certainly, regional and global security institutions such as the Six-Party Talks concerning North Korea or the UN Security Council require the active engagement of both Washington and Beijing. Even more broadly, crisis management in geographic regions of mutual strategic interest like the Korean peninsula, Iran, or Burma require much more Sino-U.S. communication if the two countries are to avoid miscalculation and maximize opportunities to minimize human sutfering. Increasing the number of mid-level military-to-military exchanges would help in this regard. The United States and China could do more to cooperate on law enforcement to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in Western China. Afghanistan is competing with Burma as the main provider of narcotics to China; Washington could use its influence with the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul to develop a joint antinarcotics program. This could potentially build networks and joint capabilities that might be useful for U.S.-China cooperation on the issue of Pakistan. In addition, Washington should also encourage NATO-China cooperation along the Afghan border. Collaborating under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) might provide an additional framework for Beijing and Washington to address Central Asian security issues in a cooperative manner. 1he SCO, which includes Pakistan as an observer and will convene a multinational conference on Afghanistan in March 2009, has long made curbing narcoterrorism in Afghanistan a priority. In addition, the VS. Drug Enforcement Agency and the Chinese Anti-Narcotics Bureau should expand cooperation on interdiction and prosecution of heroin and meth traffickers. To be sure, there are a number of areas of serious divergence between Washington and Beijing. This should surprise no one. The United States has disagreements with even its allies. Two large powers with vastly dilferent histories, cultures, and political systems are bound to have challenges. History has shown, however, that the most effective way of addressing issues is for the U.S. and Chinese governments to engage in quiet diplomacy rather than public recrimination. In the U.S.-China context, there is often little to be gained—and much to be lost in terms of trust and respect—by a polarizing debate. Any differences, moreover, must not necessarily impede Sino-U.S. cooperation when both sides share strong mutual interests. I;. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that &quot;the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.&quot;3 Effective policy toward China by the United States, and vice versa, will require this kind of dual-minded intelligence. Moreover, working together on areas of mutual and global interest will help promote strategic trust between China and the United States, facilitating possible cooperation in other areas. Even limited cooperation on specific areas will help construct additional mechanisms for bilateral communication on issues of irreconcilable disagreement. In fact, many of the toughest challenges in U.S.-China relations in recent years have been the result of unforeseen events, such as the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999 and the EP-3 reconnaissance plane collision in April 2001. Building trust and finding workable solutions to tough problems is the premise behind the Obama administrations foreign policy of smart power, as articulated by Secretary of State Clinton. Smart power is based on, as Secretary Clinton outlined in her confirmation hearing, the fundamental belief that 'We must use... the full range of tools at our disposal—diplomatic, economic, military, political and cultural—picking the right tool, or combination of tools, for each situation.&quot;' As the CS1S Commission on Smart Power noted in November 2007, &quot;Smart Power is neither hard nor soft—it is the skillful combination of bothIt is an approach that underscores the necessity of a strong military, but also invests heavily in alliances, partnerships and institutions at all levels... .°5 As such, smart power necessarily mandates a major investment in a U.S.-China partnership on key issues. 'The concept enjoys broad support among the Chinese and American people and, by promoting the global good, it reaps concrete results around the world. There should be no expectation that Washington and Beijing will or should agree on all, or even most, questions. But the American and Chinese people should expect their leaders to come together on those vital issues that require their cooperation. U.S.-China partnership, though not inevitable, is indispensable. <br />

Opportunities for collaboration in fighting climate change are plentiful, but moving forward at the scale needed will require high-level political support in two very different societies, each with considerable suspicion of the other. This report recommends ways to win such support and sustain it for the long term.<br />
Chapter 1 of the report provides a primer on two topics: climate change and U.S.-China relations. It describes the climate change threat, concluding that every year of delay in responding to it puts both countries—and the planet—at greater risk. Because the United States and China are the world’s top two greenhouse gas emitters, together accounting for more than 40% of annual emissions, any solution requires both countries to transition to low-carbon economies. U.S.-China cooperation on climate change would have not only bilateral but global benefits.<br />

<span class="Underline">Finally, there is one major existential threat to American security (as well as prosperity) of a nonviolent nature, which, though far in the future, demands urgent action. It is the threat of global warming to the stability of the climate upon which all earthly life depends. Scientists worldwide have been observing the gathering of this threat for three decades now, and what was once a mere possibility has passed through probability to near certainty. Indeed not one of more than 900 articles on climate change published in refereed scientific journals from 1993 to 2003 doubted that anthropogenic warming is occurring. “In legitimate scientific circles,” writes Elizabeth Kolbert, “it is virtually impossible to find evidence of disagreement over the fundamentals of global warming.” Evidence from a vast international scientific monitoring effort accumulates almost weekly, as this sample of newspaper reports shows: an international panel predicts “brutal droughts, floods and violent storms across the planet over the next century”; climate change could “literally alter ocean currents, wipe away huge portions of Alpine Snowcaps and aid the spread of cholera and malaria”; “glaciers in the Antarctic and in Greenland are melting much faster than expected, and…worldwide, plants are blooming several days earlier than a decade ago”; “rising sea temperatures have been accompanied by a significant global increase in the most destructive hurricanes”; “NASA scientists have concluded from direct temperature measurements that 2005 was the hottest year on record, with 1998 a close second”; “Earth’s warming climate is estimated to contribute to more than 150,000 deaths and 5 million illnesses each year” as disease spreads; “widespread bleaching from Texas to Trinidad…killed broad swaths of corals” due to a 2-degree rise in sea temperatures. “The world is slowly disintegrating,” concluded Inuit hunter Noah Metuq, who lives 30 miles from the Arctic Circle. “They call it climate change…but we just call it breaking up.” From the founding of the first cities some 6,000 years ago until the beginning of the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere remained relatively constant at about 280 parts per million (ppm). At present they are accelerating toward 400 ppm, and by 2050 they will reach 500 ppm, about double pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, atmospheric CO2 lasts about a century, so there is no way immediately to reduce levels, only to slow their increase, we are thus in for significant global warming; the only debate is how much and how serious the effects will be. As the newspaper stories quoted above show, we are already experiencing the effects of 1-2 degree warming in more violent storms, spread of disease, mass die offs of plants and animals, species extinction, and threatened inundation of low-lying countries like the Pacific nation of Kiribati and the Netherlands at a warming of 5 degrees or less the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could disintegrate, leading to a sea level of rise of 20 feet that would cover North Carolina’s outer banks, swamp the southern third of Florida, and inundate Manhattan up to the middle of Greenwich Village. Another catastrophic effect would be the collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation that keeps the winter weather in Europe far warmer than its latitude would otherwise allow. Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. But the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures. Past ice age transitions, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, took place in just decades, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “humankind’s continuing enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and humanity’s life support system. At worst, says physics professor Marty Hoffert of New York University, “we’re just going to burn everything up; we’re going to heat the atmosphere to the temperature it was in the Cretaceous when there were crocodiles at the poles, and then everything will collapse.” During the Cold War, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized a theory of nuclear winter to describe how a thermonuclear war between the Untied States and the Soviet Union would not only destroy both countries but possibly end life on this planet. Global warming is the post-Cold War era’s equivalent of nuclear winter at least as serious and considerably better supported scientifically. Over the long run it puts dangers from terrorism and traditional military challenges to shame. It is a threat not only to the security and prosperity to the United States, but potentially to the continued existence of life on this planet. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The U.S.-South Korea alliance forms the cornerstone of the South's national security and diplomacy.

<span class="Underline">The code word for &quot;containment&quot; in the Asian press, by the way, is &quot;Cold War atmosphere&quot;. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The message that the Time article was meant to send was that the U.S. Navy are now devoted to defining, countering, and to some extent creating a Chinese threat in the Pacific in order to preserve the scale of its forces and protect its budget. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The Chinese government, given the concerted efforts by the Obama adminstration to rollback China's influence throughout the world diplomatically and economically as well as militarily, will undoubtedly draw more sweeping conclusions. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">I would take issue with two statements in Williams' article. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">First, especially but not exclusively on the issue of the Korean peninsula, the U.S. is there as an unbalancer, not a &quot;balancer&quot; as Bonnie Glaser put it. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The tilt away from the Six Party Talks structure including China to a strengthened ROK-USA security condominium is a signal that a Western response to instability on the peninsula, be it from &quot;provocations&quot; or the demise of Kim Jung Il, will not include China as an equal partner. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The U.S. media has largely ignored the vitriolic response in the Chinese press to America's military moves, but the Chinese clearly see that the pendulum has swung away from stability--with the U.S. presence precluding a rush to rearmament by Japan---to containment. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Containment, to China, implies that the U.S. will continue to fan fears of China's military ambitions to encourage the rise of India and the the creation of pro-American governments and policies throughout Asia and turn a blind eye or, even worse, extend an enabling hand to Asian states that develop adventurist ambitions in challenging China on the issue of the uninhabited but contested islands that dot the region. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">I guess we'll find out if the Obama administration has a long-term plan sees an upside in a near-open breach of relations with China beyond giving the opportunity for the U.S. to play to its military strength in Asia and cooperate with local political leaders like South Korea's Lee Myung-bak, who want to use Washington as a counterweight to Beijing. </span><br />

Accompanying all these diplomatic initiatives has been a vigorous, if largely unheralded, effort by the Department of Defense (DoD) to bolster US military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. The broad sweep of US strategy was first spelled out in the Pentagon's most recent policy assessment, the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), released on February 5. In discussing long-term threats to US security, the QDR begins with a reaffirmation of the overarching precept first articulated in the DPG of 1992: that the United States will not allow the rise of a competing superpower. This country &quot;will attempt to dissuade any military competitor from developing disruptive or other capabilities that could enable regional hegemony or hostile action against the United States&quot;, the document states. It then identifies <span class="il">China</span> as the most likely and dangerous competitor of this sort. &quot;Of the major and emerging powers, <span class="il">China</span> has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States and field disruptive military technologies that could over time offset traditional US military advantages&quot; - then adding the kicker - &quot;absent US counter-strategies.&quot; According to the Pentagon, the task of countering future Chinese military capabilities largely entails the development, and then procurement, of major weapons systems that would ensure US success in any full-scale military confrontation. &quot;The United States will develop capabilities that would present any adversary with complex and multidimensional challenges and complicate its offensive planning efforts,&quot; the QDR explains. These include the steady enhancement of such &quot;enduring US advantages&quot; as &quot;long-range strike, stealth, operational maneuver and sustainment of air, sea and ground forces at strategic distances, air dominance, and undersea warfare&quot;. Preparing for <span class="il">war</span> with <span class="il">China</span>, in other words, is to be the future cash cow for the giant US weapons-making corporations in the military-industrial complex. It will, for instance, be the primary justification for the acquisition of costly new weapons systems such as the F-22A Raptor fighter, the multi-service Joint Strike Fighter, the DDX destroyer, the Virginia-class nuclear attack submarine, and a new intercontinental penetrating bomber - weapons that would just have utility in an all-out encounter with another great-power adversary of a sort that only <span class="il">China</span> might someday become. In addition to these weapons programs, the QDR also calls for a stiffening of present US combat forces in Asia and the Pacific, with a particular emphasis on the US Navy (the arm of the military least used in the ongoing occupation of and <span class="il">war</span> in Iraq). &quot;The fleet will have a greater presence in the Pacific Ocean,&quot; the document notes. To achieve this, &quot;The navy plans to adjust its force posture and basing to provide at least six operationally available and sustainable [aircraft] carriers and 60% of its submarines in the Pacific to support engagement, presence and deterrence.&quot; Since each of these carriers is, in fact, but the core of a large array of support ships and protective aircraft, this move is sure to entail a truly vast buildup of US naval capabilities in the Western Pacific and will certainly necessitate a substantial expansion of the US basing complex in the region - a requirement that is already receiving close attention from Admiral Fallon and his staff at PACOM. To assess the operational demands of this buildup, moreover, this summer the US Navy will conduct its most extensive military maneuvers in the Western Pacific since the end of the Vietnam <span class="il">War</span>, with four aircraft-carrier battle groups and many support ships expected to participate. Add all of this together, and the resulting strategy cannot be viewed as anything but a systematic campaign of containment. No high administration official may say this in so many words, but it is impossible to interpret the recent moves of Rice and Rumsfeld in any other manner. From Beijing's perspective, the reality must be unmistakable: a steady buildup of US military power along <span class="il">China</span>'s eastern, southern and western boundaries. How will <span class="il">China</span> respond to this threat? For now, it appears to be relying on charm and the conspicuous blandishment of economic benefits to loosen Australian, South Korean, and even Indian ties with the United States. To a certain extent, this strategy is meeting with success, as these countries seek to profit from the extraordinary economic boom now under way in <span class="il">China</span> - fueled to a considerable extent by oil, gas, iron, timber, and other materials supplied by <span class="il">China</span>'s neighbors in Asia. A version of this strategy is also being employed by President Hu Jintao during his current visit to the United States. As <span class="il">China</span>'s money is sprinkled liberally among such influential firms as Boeing and Microsoft, Hu is reminding the corporate wing of the Republican Party that there are vast economic benefits still to be had by pursuing a non-threatening stance toward <span class="il">China</span>. <span class="il">China</span>, however, has always responded to perceived threats of encirclement in a vigorous and muscular fashion as well, and so we should assume that Beijing will balance all that charm with a military buildup of its own. Such a drive will not bring <span class="il">China</span> to the brink of military equality with the United States - that is not a condition it can realistically aspire to over the next few decades. But it will provide further justification for those in the United States who seek to accelerate the containment of <span class="il">China</span>, and so will produce a self-fulfilling loop of distrust, competition and crisis. This will make the amicable long-term settlement of the Taiwan problem and of North Korea's nuclear program that much more difficult, and increase the risk of unintended escalation to full-scale <span class="il">war</span> in Asia. There can be no victors from such a conflagration.<br />

<strong>U.S. influence is ineffective and dead – arms races are inevitable now – the advantages solve</strong><br />
<strong>Dyer 12/15</strong><span style="font-size: 5.0pt;">—retired US Naval intelligence officer who served around the world, afloat and ashore, from 1983 to 2004 (J. E., 15 December 2010, “Hot Times in the Far East”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/j-e-dyer/384331" rel="nofollow">http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/j-e-dyer/384331</a>, RBatra) </span><br />
<br />
Japan’s announcements on defense this month figure collectively as the augury of a seminal shift. It’s not all that unusual for Tokyo to announce an increase in the size of the Japan Self-Defense Force (JSDF). But the reason invoked on this occasion amounts to a crack in the foundation of the U.S.-guaranteed security regime in the Far East. Japan plans to reorient its defense policy toward the emerging threat from China — and plans, in general, to defend its interests against Chinese and North Korean threats more proactively than at any time since 1945.<br />
The Japanese will officially abandon the Cold War–era “basic defense doctrine,” which provided for territorial defense but not for the projection of military power beyond Japan’s recognized borders. Besides adding more submarines to the fleet, they will look at a military build-up in the southern chain of Japanese islands, near the Senkaku archipelago disputed with China. And on Sunday, Prime Minister Naoto Kan startled South Koreans by telling an audience that Japan would consider changing JSDF policy to allow for the deploying of troops to South Korea to rescue Japanese citizens. <br />
The point here is not that any such move by Japan is suspicious. The point is that Japan perceives the need for a new, more active security posture. The tacit U.S. guarantee since World War II has been a balance in the Far East: the three great powers there — Russia, China, and Japan — held in check with a network of alliances and military presence. In the past two decades, however, the U.S. has failed to effectively counter what are arguably the most important threats to stability in the region: Chinese maritime aggression and the North Korean nuclear-weapons program. Against that backdrop, the Obama administration’s determined reliance on China to deal with North Korea looks — from the Asian side of the Pacific — like ceding China too much power. If America will not broker a balanced stasis, Russia and China will arm themselves for emerging opportunities, and everyone else will follow suit.<br />
Meanwhile, Russia is probing and making shows of force wherever possible. The intrusion of Russian patrol aircraft in the naval exercise held by the U.S. and Japan last week was remarkable for the fact that it was an actual intrusion. Military aircraft monitor foreign exercises all the time, but usually from a distance. The Russian planes approached so closely last week that the exercise was suspended while fighters were scrambled to intercept them. <br />
The Nixon administration concluded a 1972 agreement with Soviet Russia to avoid such provocations in air and naval activity. Indeed, it was Nixon who, during the same period, re-established relations with China, returned Okinawa to Japan, and signed landmark defense agreements with Thailand and the Philippines. He hoped that these measures, desirable in their own right, would contribute to an environment of stabilized tension in which the two Vietnams could coexist. Although the hopes for Vietnam were dashed, his larger arrangements have stood for nearly 40 years. But they will not last much longer. The older pattern that obtains in the absence of U.S. power is reasserting itself.<br />

<span class="Underline">So, the New York Times says that North Korea’s failure to respond to yesterday’s South Korean live-fire drills “could signal [a] new policy”—namely, that Pyongyang, to quote a South Korean analyst cited in the article, may be “trying to create the mood for dialogue.” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">We’ll see. But, sorry, I just don’t buy it. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Why didn’t North Korea act after all the bluster? The fact is, North Korea often rains fiery rhetoric on the South. And conflict this time was unlikely because North Korea did not need to strike, having already achieved many of its objectives. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Three explanations, taken together, probably explain what happened yesterday: (1) Beijing, humiliated by the 23 November attack, surely used (private) channels to tell Pyongyang to knock it off. (2) Pyongyang, quite simply, did not need to respond to yesterday’s exercise, having already accomplished its objective of humiliating South Korean president Lee Myung-bak and keeping Seoul off balance. And (3) North Korea’s threats of future attack remain credible; put differently, yesterday’s non-response would in no way suggest to Seoul or Washington that Pyongyang has “gone soft.” </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">The current crisis reveals yet another negative trend: North Korea no longer takes American security guarantees seriously. The United States is bound by a set of obligations to protect its two allies – Japan and South Korea; therefore, it is conventionally accepted that the United States would initiate the conflict. Now that the Obama administration has shown that, unlike the previous Republican administration, it does not necessarily take so robust stance on defending its allies, North Korea has begun to “vet” the United States to see if, under certain circumstances, they would be prepared to abandon their allies in the Pacific, especially since the United States already has serious ongoing commitments to two theaters of conflict: Iraq and Afghanistan. </span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>More provocations will go nuclear—we’re on the brink of massive South Korean retaliation</strong> </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">Tensions on the Korean pensinsula were at their most dangerous level since the 1950-53 war today when North Korea threatened to use nuclear weapons in a &quot;holy war&quot; against its neighbour after South Korean tanks, jets and artillery carried out one of the largest live-fire drills in history close to the border. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The military exercise at Pocheon, just south of the demilitarized zone, was the third such show of force this week by South Korea. Multiple rocket-launchers, dozens of tanks and hundreds of troops joined the drills, which the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, insisted was necessary for self-defence, following two deadly attacks this year. Last month, two civilians and two marines were killed by a North Korean barrage on Yeonpyeong island following a live-fire drill in disputed territory. In March, 46 sailors died when the South Korean naval ship, Cheonan, was sunk, apparently by an enemy torpedo. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">&quot;We had believed patience would ensure peace on this land, but that was not the case,&quot; Lee told troops today. He earlier warned that he was ready to order a &quot;merciless counterattack&quot; if further provoked. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">North Korea's armed forces minister, Kim Yong-chun, also lifted the pitch of the sabre-rattling. &quot;To counter the enemy's intentional drive to push the situation to the brink of war, our revolutionary forces are making preparations to begin a holy war at any moment necessary based on nuclear deterrent,&quot; North Korea's KCNA news agency quoted him telling a rally in Pyongyang. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Bellicosity and brinkmanship are nothing new on the divided peninsula and there are doubts that North Korea is capable of an accurate nuclear strike, though it has conducted two bomb tests and is believed to have enough high-grade plutonium for at least six warheads. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">But even with conventional artillery, the two neighbours are capable of inflicting horrendous casualties among their densely packed populations. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The political situation is less predictable than usual due to the ongoing transition of power in Pyongyang from Kim Jong-il to his son Kim Jong-un. There has also been a hardening of positions in Seoul, where president Lee is belatedly trying to demonstrate his toughness. After being criticised for his restrained response to the two earlier incidents, Lee has fired his top military advisers and replaced them with hardliners, who favour an escalated display of self-defence. </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Plan solves—2 reasons</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>FIRST, U.S. deterrence fails and only provokes the North. The root cause of all prior attacks as well as North Korean prolif is U.S. hostile policy. Only troop withdrawal prevents war with North Korea and China.</strong> </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The US-ROK joint military exercises not merely prepare for a possible invasion of North Korea but they also serve as weapons of attrition. They force North Korea to devote much more of its resources to the military than it would if there were no palpable threat. An important component of the exercise is their element of ambiguity. The Korean People’s Army (KPA) can never be sure when a feint might become the real thing, so every exercise has to be taken very seriously. The translation of this commentary from the Rodong Sinmun on the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises in 2009 may be fractured but the underling fear of attack is clear: The said largest-scale saber rattling kicked off by the U.S. imperialists against the DPRK at a time when their scenario for the second Korean war is at the final stage of completion is a very adventurous and dangerous military provocation that can be seen only on the eve of a war, and this is an undisguised military threat and a sort of declaration of war against the DPRK. No one can vouch that the U.S. imperialist bellicose elements will not ignite a war against the DPRK by surprise while reinforcing armed forces and staging war maneuvers in south Korea and its vicinity as they did in Iraq.[18] It is important to note that the clash at Yeonpyeong Island coincided with a substantial military exercise, the Hoguk (‘Safeguarding the Nation’): North Korea fired the artillery during South Korea’s military drill called the Hoguk Exercise on Nov. 22-30 that involves 70,000 South Korean military troops, 50 warships, 90 helicopters and 500 planes. The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) of U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Seventh Air Force will also participate in the exercise.[19] The scheduled participation of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is particularly significant.[20] The 31st MEU is based in Okinawa and it is America’s ‘forward deployed rapid-response’ unit in East Asia. It trains with the ROK marines practicing beach landings, but its major specialism appears to be urban warfare. [21] One of its possible functions is to mount a commando type raid on the DPRK. A Japanese scholar writing in the authoritative PACNET newsletter of Pacific Forum CSIS (the Honolulu branch of the Washington think tank Center for Strategic and International studies rather gave the game away about the ‘North Korean threat’ by putting it thus: As a collapse of North Korea -- rather than a North Korean invasion of South Korea -- has become a more likely scenario, the 31st MEU can search and seize the North Korean nuclear arsenal, and prevent proliferation of those weapons[22] It is not surprising therefore that the KPA was concerned about the Hoguk exercise and responded to the ROK live firing in line with the ‘zero tolerance’ strategy. However, concerns extend beyond specific military exercises, to the whole policy of building up of tension in preparation for a crisis that would lead to an invasion of the North. The KPA barrage can be seen as a message that an attack would be met by a devastating counteroffensive which would, at the very least, imperil Seoul; it was a reminder that ‘Seoul [is] not safe from artillery attacks’.[23] The DPRK’s ‘zero tolerance’ strategy The DPRK’s ‘zero tolerance’ policy long predates the Lee Myung-bak administration, let alone the present crisis. Basically this strategy is to reiterate than no infringement of DPRK territory will be tolerated, and any intrusion will be met by force. There has been flexibility and restraint in implementing this strategy, especially in respect of the NLL (see below), but the underlying strategic calculation is that any sign of weakness will lead to further US and ROK moves against the DPRK. The case of the US invasion of Iraq is often cited by the North Koreans of the dangers of an appeasement policy. This is often raised in respect of the nuclear deterrent. For instance, Alexander Frolov, writing recently in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs journal International Affairs on lessons from the Iraq war made the point: The leadership in N. Korea also realized that nothing less than a nuclear status can guarantee the country against US aggression. [24] However, the relevance of Iraq to the non-appeasement policy goes beyond developing a nuclear deterrent. For instance, in May 2003 after a breakdown in US-DPRK negotiations, the official Korea Central News Agency (KCNA) in a lengthy statement included a reference to Iraq: On March 20 this year the U.S. provoked a war of aggression against Iraq under the pretext of &quot;finding out weapons of mass destruction&quot; in a bid to topple the Saddam government. The Iraqi war taught the lesson that &quot;nuclear suspicion,&quot; &quot;suspected development of weapons of mass destruction&quot; and suspected &quot;sponsorship of terrorism&quot; touted by the U.S. were all aimed to find a pretext for war and one would fall victim to a war when one meekly responds to the IAEA's inspection for disarmament. Neither strong international public opinion nor big countries' opposition to war nor the UN Charter could prevent the U.S. from launching the Iraqi war. It is a serious lesson the world has drawn from the Iraqi war that a war can be averted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation can be protected only when a country has a physical deterrent force, a strong military deterrent force capable of decisively repelling any attack to be made by any types of sophisticated weapons. The reality indicates that building up a physical deterrent force is urgently required for preventing the outbreak of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring peace and security of the world, now that the U.S. does not show any political intention and will to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK. The DPRK will increase its self-defensive capacity strong enough to destroy aggressors at a single stroke. Any U.S. aerial attack will be decisively countered with aerial attack and its land strategy will be coped with land strategy. [25] In reality, a North Korean counter offensive would not match like with like - ‘aerial attack will be decisively countered with aerial attack and its land strategy will be coped with land strategy.’ The DPRK cannot hope to match US military power (especially in the air) so its offensive would be asymmetrical, drawing on its strengths.[26] It would probably utilise its special forces, submarines, and in particular its artillery[27] As noted, the frequent war exercises, the integration of the ROK military into the US command structure, and the associated operational plans, are seen by the DPRK as very threatening: [The United States] made public &quot;strategic guideline No. 1&quot; in November 1978 and thus officially announced the formation of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; in south Korea. It saw to it that the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; took over the &quot;UN Forces Command's&quot; Operation Control of the U.S. forces in south Korea and puppet army. The organization of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; deepened the military dependence of south Korea on the United States and increased the danger for an outbreak of a new war on the Korean Peninsula. The Team Spirit joint military exercises for invading the north had been escalated as a large-scale war exercises involving huge armed forces over100,000-200,000 strong from 1978. Such joint military exercises as the Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI), Ulji Focus Lens and Foal Eagle have been staged almost every day as planned and directed by the command. The aggressive and bellicose nature of the command has remained unchanged even after the June 15 era [the 2000 North-South summit], a new era of reconciliation and cooperation, was ushered in on the Korean Peninsula. Many war scenarios against the north including &quot;OPLAN 5030&quot;, &quot;New OPLAN 5026&quot; and &quot;OPLAN 8022-02&quot; have been worked out and war exercises to carry them into practice conducted in a more frenzied way. This year the command changed the codenames of the RSOI and Ulji Focus Lens with Key Resolve and Ulji Freedom Guardian and is holding actual maneuvers to hurl U.S. imperialist aggression forces in the mainland and abroad into Korean front. It goes without saying that such war exercises and arms buildup had have negative effect on the north-south relations and chilled the ardent desire for the Korean people for reunification. The south Korean people thus press for the dissolution of the &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot; disturbing peace in Korea and obstructing her reunification. The south Korea-U.S. &quot;Combined Forces Command&quot;, a tool for war of aggression and a source of permanent atmosphere of war and tension on the Korean Peninsula, should be disbanded without delay. [28] The most famous example of the efficacy of the strategy is the reported argument between President Kim Young-sam and President Bill Clinton in 1994. According to Kim, Clinton wanted to bomb the North Korea nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. A 2003 BBC report recounted the tale: &quot;Clinton told me that he would launch an immediate bombardment on the Yongbyon area. Clinton was very determined about it, but I argued to him that such an attack should never take place,&quot; said Mr Kim. &quot;So there was quite an argument between him and me. Sometimes the phone conversations lasted more than 40 minutes,&quot; he said. Mr Clinton first revealed the 1994 plan to attack North Korea last month, but said nothing of the alleged dispute with the South. Mr Kim said that a US attack would have led to a tremendous loss of life, and would have turned Seoul into a &quot;sea of fire&quot;. &quot;Finally I told him that if the United States attacks North Korea, I cannot send one single member of South Korea's 650,000 armed forces into battle.&quot; [29] Kim’s version of events was contradicted by Tong Kim (Kim Dong-hyun) a Korean-American who worked as an interpreter for the State Department for over 30 years. According to him, It simply is not the case [...]. There was no discussion about a possible U.S. attack on North Korea between the two presidents via phone. Such discussions indeed took place between their defense ministers Kwon Young-hae and William Perry with the South Korean minister obviously opposed to the military action.[30] The consequences of a Northern counterattack, and specifically an artillery offense against Seoul, was not the only consideration, although it was the main one. A South Korean simulation exercise predicted that ‘bombing of North Korea’s nuclear facilities could in the worst case make the whole of Korea uninhabitable for a decade’.[31] The bombing of Yongbyon was but one variant of the ‘military option’ that the United States has been examining, albeit the favoured one.[32] The release of radioactivity aside, an US attack would mean war with immense devastation of the Korea peninsula, so it is to be expected that there has been, in the past, opposition across the political spectrum, from progressive President Roh Moo-hyun to conservative legislator Park Jin.[33] The exception to that have been those, such as Lee Myung-bak, who pin their hopes on a collapse that would prevent the North from making a counterattack. This is an ongoing issue but as long as the DPRK functions as a viable state, committed and able, to retaliate, then there will be no attack. Part of the reason for the vigorous response at Yeonpyeong was presumably to demonstrate that the KPA was still in business. The DPRK has been threatened, and blockaded, by the United States for decades, but unlike various other countries, it has not been invaded, or bombed. To that degree the zero-tolerance strategy can be said to work. But it has its disadvantages. It is a high-risk strategy. If there is a miscalculation or a misunderstanding, or ‘maverick’ action by soldiers on the front line, then the situation could rapidly whirl out of control. War would be disastrous for North Korea, despite the brave words. It would have grave consequences for the South, and Japan. If it spread to China the results are incalculable, but it might mean the end of the United States, that ‘fragile empire’ as Niall Ferguson recently termed it.[34] It is a variant of the mutually assured destruction of the Cold War period, a bluff that is effective because it is credible, but a bluff that if put into action would be catastrophic. In this case, the destruction would not be equivalent. The DPRK would suffer more than other countries, but the ROK and the US would suffer unacceptable damage and that could be considered sufficient to keep the peace. The strategy has other disadvantages. It allows the DPRK to be portrayed as belligerent, and certainly the coverage of the Yeonpyeong incident, within South Korea, and internationally has been virtually uniformly hostile. Not everyone has jumped on to the bandwagon and there are those, in particular Korean-Americans, who oppose the drift towards war and call for engagement.[35] But these are only a tiny minority. The strategy also runs counter to the main thrust of DPRK strategy which is to negotiate the United States into accepting peaceful coexistence. Recourse to confrontation, and military action, makes that more difficult to prosecute. Finally, it gives a hostage to fortune. The other side (here South Korea but in other circumstances it could be the US) can construct a provocation knowing that it will trigger a response that can be labelled as belligerent. The trick here is to do something which the DPRK regards as provocative but which can be disguised as normal and legitimate. The military exercises in general fall within this category. For the DPRK (and China) they are intimidating and provocative, but that is not how they are described in the Western media. No doubt if the tables were turned and it was a North Korean carrier stalking up the American coast, perceptions would be different. In the particular case of Yeonpyeong the ROK did something that was portrayed as legitimate and non-threatening but which the DPRK found intolerable. To understand why that was so we must turn to the curious case of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) Northern Limit Line The Northern Limit Line is a very strange beast, as a glance at the map shows (fig 1). Fig 1: Contested seas: The NLL and the MDL 1.Yeonpyeong Island (artillery clash) 2.Baengnyeong Island (Cheonan sinking) 3.Daecheong Island 4. Incheon Airport 5.Seoul 6.Incheon 7.Haeju 8.Kaesong 9.Ganghwa County 10.Bukdo Myeon 11.Deokjeok Myeon 12.Jawol Myeon 13.Yeongheung Myeon On this map #1 indicates Yeonpyeong Island where the artillery clash took place, and #2 Baengnyeong Island, off which the Cheonan sank. The upper(blue) line represents the Northern Limit Line (NLL) and the lower (red) one the West Sea Military Demarcation Line (MDL) claimed by the DPRK. The NLL was unilaterally established by the Americans (officially the United Nations Command) in August 1953.[36] The NLL, instead of striking out directly from the coast at the end of the land Military Demarcation Line (MDL), snakes up the west coast of North Korea, through rice crab fish grounds, and taking in various islands the main three of which are .Yeonpyeong (1) , Baengnyeong (2), and Daecheong (3). It has been argued that it was set up to prevent Southern incursions into Northern waters (Syngman Rhee had not signed the Armistice Agreement and wanted the war to continue), although it would be more plausible to see it also as affording bases for inserting intelligence and commando teams. Be that as it may, by the 1990s commando raids were a thing of the past, and yet the ROK refused to negotiate. This despite two major incidents in 1999 and 2002 which were a distinct threat to the ‘Sunshine Policy of then president Kim Dae-jung.[37] There was a further clash in November 2009 under the presidency of Lee Myung-bak.[38] This 2009 incident may have owed something to the more assertive North Korea policy of the Lee administration.[39] The NLL did not receive much international attention until the Cheonan incident of March 2010. There were a number of reasons for this. Most of the causalities in the past were Northern and so, in the eyes of most of the international media, perhaps warranted less attention. The Cheonan was the largest single disaster for the ROK navy. Many commentators were quick to point out what a dangerous situation the sinking of the Cheonan illustrated. Typical was Nicole Finnegan of the Washington-based Korea Economic Institute: Regardless of what we learn the true cause of the tragedy to be, the sinking of the Cheonan has revived fear and debates on how easily North and South Korea could lurch into war unexpectedly.[40] There is nothing new in these concerns. The NLL by its unilateral nature, its configuration close to the North Korean coast, and running through highly prized crab grounds, is a recipe for conflict. Fishing boats from both South and North sometimes ignore the NLL during the crab season and their respective navies tend to follow them. The NLL is also at variance with the now standard territorial sea limit of 12 nautical miles.[41] Writing in 2002, after the clash of June that year, John Barry Kotch and Michael Abbey, point out that: If the two Koreas are genuinely committed to reconciliation, these differences can be resolved through negotiation, thereby preventing future incidents. A line that was drawn more than a half-century ago for an entirely different purpose should no longer be allowed to fester as a source of conflict, thereby retarding the peace process.[42] The differences were not resolved, so the question is why? If this failure to negotiate a resolution had just occurred during the Lee Myung-bak administration it might not have been surprising. But this was during the time of Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun. It is clear that a resolution would have meant the South abandoning the NLL and agreeing to something approximating the North’s line. It seems extremely unlikely that anyone in the DPRK would have opposed that. Although the NLL was established by the UNC, it appears that it is not longer involved, officially at least. It may well be that unofficially it is very much involved; the relationship between the US and ROK military seems to be unexplored territory. Whatever the role of Americans behind the scenes it seems clear that resolution of the NLL was opposed, successfully, by the ROK military. This opposition presumably was partly due to natural inertia – nobody likes giving up territory – but it must have gone deeper than that. The logical conclusion is that there were strong forces in the ROK political elite, revolving around the military, who wanted to keep the NLL precisely because it would “to fester as a source of conflict, thereby retarding the peace process” Fig 2: measuring policy change: KCNA mentions of the NLL over two administrations All of the previous conflicts around the NLL had been at sea, and the artillery duel at Yeonpyeong was the first one on land. To understand how that came about we must return to the map. It appears that the DPRK acknowledges ROK control over the islands, but claims these are its territorial waters, except for the access channels shown on the map.[43] Whilst the NLL has long been a bone of contention, the situation has greatly worsened since the Lee Myung-bak administration came into office. One rough way of measuring that is to calculate the number of times the official KCNA news agency mentions the North Limit Line. Roh Moo-hyun was in office from 25 February 2003 to 25 February 2008 when Lee Myung-bak took over. Fig 2 shows the monthly average of NLL stories over those two administrations. This is admittedly an imperfect metric but the difference between the two administrations is compelling: under Lee Myung-bak the number of North Korean complaints rose nearly three-fold. In March 2008, for instance, the KPA navy warned: Combined firepower drills for &quot;striking and destroying&quot; warships of the Navy of the Korean People's Army and drills for tactical naval maneuvers are staged on Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong Islets and in waters around them almost everyday. A situation in which an armed conflict may break out any moment is prevailing in the frontline waters in the West Sea due to the reckless military provocations of the south Korean military warmongers. Any attempt on the part of the south Korean military authorities to &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;northern limit line&quot; at any cost would only spark off a clash in the said waters.[44] The following year, as the Lee administration moved to join the US-led Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) the KPA navy issued another warning: 3. For the present, we will not guarantee the legal status of the five islands under the south side's control (Paekryong, Taechong, Sochong, Yonphyong [ and U islands) in our side's territorial waters northwest of the extension of the Military Demarcation Line in the West Sea of Korea and safe sailing of warships of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the south Korean puppet navy and civilian ships operating in the waters around there.[45] The PSI is in many ways similar to the NLL. It is unilateral and illegal. The PSI claims that a set of nations – the US and its clients – are above international law and may stop and search ships on the high seas. Ostensibly this is to stop the shipping of weapons of mass destruction which given the United States pre-eminence in the international arms trade smacks of a certain degree of chutzpah.[46] Indeed, as Hazel Smith has documented, ‘There is little hard evidence that the government of North Korea is involved in the illicit shipping of WMD or components of WMD’.[47] The PSI seems to be really about harassing the DPRK and stoking tension, and that also holds for the NLL. The NLL seems to have been much more successful in attaining these objectives so far than the PSI. The NLL was perhaps only peripheral to the Cheonan incident. True the ship sank in disputed waters, and had the NLL not existed, but the two Koreas had been separated by a mutually agreed maritime border, the sinking would probably not have occurred. It appears that it ran aground in shallow waters and in an attempt to extricate itself was sunk by one of the South’s mines.[48] Nevertheless, the actual sinking of the Cheonan appears to have been an accident; it was the subsequent investigation that was deliberately fraudulent. The Yeonpyeong incident is different in that it occurred because of a deliberate provocation by the South. The artillery duel at Yeonpyeong As to be expected there is much that is uncertain and contested about this incident. But the essentials can be traced. The media tends to give the impression that the North Korean barrage against the marine base on Yeonpyeong island on 23 November came out of the blue, with nothing preceding it. The Chosun Ilbo specifically makes that claim: … the latest artillery bombardment on Yeonpyeong Island came completely out of the blue, and there is no way of telling when, where and how North Korea will strike next.[49] A rather more nuanced version is the Washington Post narrative, with the North launching a barrage and the South responding: North Korea launched a massive artillery barrage on a South Korean island Tuesday, killing two South Korean marines, wounding at least 19 other people and setting more than 60 buildings ablaze in the most serious confrontation since the North's sinking of a South Korean warship in March. South Korea immediately responded with its own artillery fire and put its fighter jets on high alert, bringing the two sides - which technically have remained in a state of war since the Korean armistice in 1953 - close to the brink of a major conflagration[50] No mention here of the South’s arms buildup on the island, the North’s warnings, the provocative nature of the Northern Limit Line, or the threatening military exercises. Back in 2008 the KPA complained about the ROK introducing new weaponry into the NLL islands: They also issued an order to batteries of 155 mm caliber howitzers and various type guided weapons deployed on the above-said five islets to be ready to go into action.[51] The KPA statement also claimed that: Combined firepower drills for &quot;striking and destroying&quot; warships of the Navy of the Korean People's Army and drills for tactical naval maneuvers are staged on Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong Islets and in waters around them [take place] almost everyday. A situation in which an armed conflict may break out any moment is prevailing in the frontline waters in the West Sea due to the reckless military provocations of the south Korean military warmongers. Any attempt on the part of the south Korean military authorities to &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;northern limit line&quot; at any cost would only spark off a clash in the said waters. [52] The live fire drills that the ROK conducted on 23 November were not just artillery practice; they were specifically focussed on possible combat against KPA ships in waters around the island. However, it was the specific contested status of those waters, in a tense situation exacerbated by the military exercises since the Cheonan incident, which sparked the North Korean response. It appears that the North warned the South against the drills, but the warnings were disregarded. The Seoul newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported on 24 November that: North Korea in a telegram on Tuesday morning [23 November] criticized an annual South Korean defense drill now underway. The same afternoon the North Korean military fired on Yeonpyeong Island. An official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, &quot;At around 8:20 am. on Tuesday, North Korea sent a telegram that said they would not sit idly by and watch if South Korea fire at North Korean waters during the military training.&quot; North Korea already criticized the drill on Nov. 17 on the website of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland and again on Monday when the drill began. But the military dismissed North Korea's claims, saying an artillery firing drill by the Marine Corps that took place in Yeonpyeong Island on Tuesday had nothing to do with the annual drill but was a part of monthly training there. Moreover, the drill the North cited as an excuse for the attack is an annual routine drill which has been conducted by the South Korean military since 1996. A spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, &quot;The training was directed at South Korean waters to the southwest of Yeonpyeong Island, and the training site had been announced already through the international network of communication of merchant ships.[53] To say that the marine artillery drills had nothing to do with the Hoguk exercise seems to be a sophism. Moreover, the warnings stretched further back. The information available on the English-language KCNA website is only a portion of the published Korean-language material, and on top of that there are the direct communications between North and South (such as the telegram mentioned above). However, there is enough English-language for us to get a certain picture of preceding events, even though often the English translation is of poor quality.’ Fig3: Smoke from rocket fire over Yeonpyeong island This picture taken on November 23, 2010 by a South Korean tourist shows huge plumes of smoke rising from Yeonpyeong island in the disputed waters of the Yellow Sea on November 23, 2010. North Korea fired dozens of artillery shells onto a South Korean island on November 23, 2010, killing four people, setting homes ablaze and triggering an exchange of fire as the South's military went on top alert. (STR/AFP/Getty Images) On the 4th of June 2010 a Rodong Sinmun editorial headed ‘S. Korean Accused of Dangerous Provocations’ warned that: The puppet military is massively amassing offensive forces in the waters off five islets of the West Sea including Paekryong and Yonphyong [Yeonpyeong] islets while vociferating about &quot;defence of the northern limit line&quot; and ceaselessly infiltrating its warships into the territorial waters of the DPRK for the purpose of sparking off a new armed conflict. It is needless to say that the large-scale &quot;demonstration of military muscle&quot; and war maneuvers taking place under this situation are as dangerous acts as playing with fire by the side of a powder magazine. These moves are, in fact, a prelude to an all-out war. The DPRK loves peace and does not want a war. But it is the DPRK's spirit and mettle to react to fire with fire and punish the provocateurs with a merciless retaliation of justice. If the puppet group finally opts for starting a war of aggression against the DPRK in league with foreign forces, defying its warnings, the group will not be able to escape a thousand-fold indiscriminate retaliatory blow, warns the article. [54] This is a generalised warning about retaliation ‘for starting a war of aggression’ rather than specifically threatening a response to military exercises at Yeonpyeong. ‘Indiscriminate’ in this context presumably means ‘all-out war’. This warning was followed by another on 3 August which specifically threatened retaliation for ‘naval firing maneuvers’ from Yeonpyeong and other islands in the area: The Command of Forces of the Korean People's Army in the western sector of the front issued on Tuesday the following notice in this connection: The naval firing maneuvers to be staged by the above-said warmongers in the waters near Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong islets in August with all ground, naval and submarine attack means involved are not simple drills but undisguised military intrusion into the inviolable territorial waters of the DPRK and reckless politically motivated provocation to preserve the illegal &quot;northern limit line&quot; to the last. …. In view of the prevailing situation, the Command of Forces of the Korean People's Army in the western sector of the front made a decisive resolution to counter the reckless naval firing projected by the group of traitors with strong physical retaliation. …. As regards the expected DPRK's counteraction for self-defence, the command warns in advance all the civilian ships including fishing boats not to enter the theatre of naval firing fixed by the group of traitors in the waters close to the five islets in the West Sea of Korea. It is the unshakable will and steadfast resolution of the army and people of the DPRK to return fire for fire. [55] Whether the ROK marines carried out any firing exercises after that warning is unknown. The Chosun Ilbo report quoted above says the drills were held ‘monthly’ but the [London] Telegraph talks about ‘monthly air raid drills’, so the exercises on 23 November may have been the first since the August threat. The island, lined with tank traps and trenches, and equipped with 19 fully-stocked bomb shelters in which residents conduct monthly air raid drills, is permanently ready for war.[56] The South Koreans admitted carrying live firing exercises on 23 November but justified these by saying they were fired into the sea, away from the direction of the North Korean mainland. There seems no doubt they were firing into the sea (on the technical level it was presumably an anti-ship exercise), though the actual direction of fire is unclear. One report says southward.[57] Another says to the west. [58] Yet another has it to the southwest.[59] In fact, as far as the North was concerned, the direction was irrelevant because in any case the shells landed in their territorial waters. And therein lies the rub. The DPRK argues that if it tolerated the exercise it would be relinquishing its claim to the waters. The enemy fired shells from the islet which is so close to the territory of the DPRK that it is within each other's eyeshot despite the fact that there are so many mountains and rivers, sea waters and islets in south Korea. This powder-reeking saber-rattling cannot be construed otherwise than a politically motivated provocation. The enemy is claiming that they fired shells southward from the islet in a bid not to get on the nerves of the DPRK but Yonphyong Islet is located deep inside the territorial waters of the DPRK away from the maritime military demarcation line. If live shells are fired from the islet, they are bound to drop inside the territorial waters of the DPRK side no matter in which direction they are fired because of such geographical features. The ulterior aim sought by the enemy is to create the impression that the DPRK side recognized the waters off the islet as their &quot;territorial waters&quot;, in case that there was no physical counter-action on the part of the former. Herein lies the crafty and vicious nature of the enemy's provocation. The army of the DPRK took such a self-defensive measure as making a prompt powerful strike at the artillery positions from which the enemy fired the shells as it does not make an empty talk. [emphasis added].[60] As can be seen from the map (fig 1), the DPRK seems to accept ROK control of the island (but not necessarily sovereignty) but it does not recognise any claim over the surrounding sea. It would appear that the DPRK claim to these waters has much to justify it; the Northern Limit Line is manifestly iniquitous; it is unilateral and provocative and should have been abolished years ago. But does that justify the DPRK artillery barrage? An important point here is the number of warnings that were given. We have already quoted the public statements, and mentioned a telegram, but the North also claims it made a telephone call to the South: The south Korean puppet warmongers' firing of shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side in the West Sea of Korea on Nov. 23 was a premeditated and deliberate military provocation from A to Z and a war action in fact. On Nov. 22, the south Korean puppet forces made no scruple of announcing that they would fire shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side with artillery pieces they deployed on Yonphyong Island while staging Hoguk exercises for a war of aggression against the DPRK, straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula. In this connection the DPRK side sent a telephone notice to the south Korean puppet military at 8 a.m. on Nov. 23, strongly urging it to immediately cancel the plan for firing shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side. In the notice the DPRK side seriously warned that if it paid no heed to this demand, it would face a resolute physical counter-strike and would be held fully responsible for all the ensuing consequences.[61] This telephone call, and the previous public warnings, have received very little coverage in the Western media, but there is no doubt that it took place, since it was reported by the Seoul newspaper Korea Herald: In the morning [of the clash], the North sent a telephone message to the South, saying “The North would not just sit back if the South fired shots into the North Korean territorial waters,” according to JCS [South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff] officials.[62] We do not know how explicit that warning was, but since it was a telephone call, the Southern officer could presumably have sought clarification. Moreover, we have other reports that the ROK military was aware that that DPRK had moved artillery into position. This was then followed by practice shooting: A senior military said several hours before the shelling began the North Korean military deployed one battery of six 122-mm MLRS shells and later two batteries of 12 112-mm MLRS shells. It also carried out preparatory shooting practice just before the attack. &quot;As far as I know the South Korean military was aware of this,&quot; he said.[63] It seems fair to assume that the local ROK military commander knew what would happen if the firing exercise went ahead. Whether he relayed this to higher levels and asked for confirmation to go ahead we do not know, but it seems likely. There was no great time pressure and taking action which would result in the first artillery exchange since the Korean War would surely have been referred up to higher levels. The warning/foreknowledge issue become even more convoluted with revelations on 1 December that South Korean intelligence had known since August that the North would respond. The Director of the National Intelligence Service [NIS] gave testimony to a closed-door session of a committee of the National Assembly. Members of the National Assembly Intelligence Committee quoted NIS Director Won Sei-hoon as saying the agency knew from wiretapping that the North Korean regime ordered the military to prepare to attack the five islands in the West Sea. He said the NIS submitted the intelligence report to President Lee Myung-bak.[emphasis added] [64] The phrase ‘prepare to attack’ implies, and is meant to imply, a Northern provocation, an unprovoked assault. In fact, we have from another story a much more plausible phrase: The[Asahi Shimbun]quoted the source, who is familiar with North Korea-China relations, as saying, &quot;Early last month, the North Korean military issued instructions in Kim Jong-un's name to senior military commanders to get ready to counter the enemy's provocations any time.&quot; The source quoted an unnamed North Korean Army officer as commenting on the artillery attack on Yeonpyeong. &quot;It had been planned. We had been preparing for that for a long time.&quot; [emphasis added][65] This countering of what the North regarded as a Southern provocation is consistent with the published and telephone warnings. It gives a quite different take on who was provoking whom. This did not prevent the Chosun Ilbo, which ran the story, from heading it ‘Kim Jong-un 'Ordered Attack in Early November'. Not the first time a newspaper has mendaciously given a headline which is contradicted by the actual story under it. In fact, the Chosun Ilbo, which has a very virulent ideological position, often does it. On 3 December it ran a story about an interview Russian Prime Minister Putin gave in the United States in which it was reported that ‘Putin said that he finds the situation in the Korean Peninsula &quot;very acute and disturbing&quot;’. The headline was ‘N.Korean Attack 'Acute and Disturbing,' Says Putin’. The assertion that the NIS submitted the intelligence report to President Lee Myung-bak has to be taken cautiously. From the public account we do not know whether he was given it personally, and the warning drawn to his attention. It may have just been passed to his office, and he never got to read it. That is a generous interpretation. Whether Lee was aware personally it is clear that the North Korean warning that they would retaliate if the exercises took place was known at the highest levels of the South Korean command. Events of the day The actual sequence of events is more complex than most press reports and commentaries suggest. According to the Korea Herald report the Northern shelling started at 2.34pm, but was perhaps not the ‘massive onslaught’ that it was often called: “As the North fired coastal artillery shells at around 2:34 p.m. into waters off the Yeonpyeong Island as well as on the island, we immediately fired back in full accordance with combat rules,” said Lee Hong-kee, chief director for joint operations at the JCS, in a press briefing. [emphasis added][66] Either the accuracy of the Northern artillery was poor, or firing into the water was deliberate. According to the report, here is the sequence of events After 8.00am and before 2.34 pm South fires into sea 2.34 pm North starts firing into sea (and land?) 2.47 pm South starts firing at Northern coastal batteries – ‘strong, concentrated’ counterattack causing ‘considerable damage’ 2.55 pm North ceases firing 3.11 pm North recommences firing 3.42 pm North ceases firing 3.48 pm South telephones North urging it to stop its ‘provocative acts’ By 9.30 pm 2 marines killed; while six others were seriously injured. Ten other soldiers and three civilians suffered minor injuries This raises some intriguing questions. • Did the North fire simultaneously at the island and into the sea, or did the land fire come later? • Did the North fire onto the island only after the Southern counterattack on its positions? • Why did the South make a telephone call asking the North to stop if it had already done so? • Did the North recommence firing sometime after 3.42 pm? • As of 9.30 pm we have three civilians reported with minor injuries but subsequent reports give two dead. Were the dead amongst these three, or were they discovered later? The ‘fog of war’ no doubt produces confusion but these discrepancies suggest that we have not had the full story by any means. The quite erroneous claim that this was an ‘unprovoked attack’ by the North has been repeated so many times by ROK officials, and by the media, that even liberals such as the American investigative journalist Tim Shorrock have been taken in.[67] The other main canard in the official narrative concerns civilians. The theme is set at the top with statements from Lee Myung-bak. On 29 November he gave a short address to the nation: During a seven-minute speech Lee expressed outrage over the North's ruthless attack on civilians, calling it an &quot;inhumane&quot; crime [emphasis added].[68] Others were more circumspect. A JCS spokesman called the firing ‘indiscriminate’: “This provocation is a premeditated, intentional illegal attack in violation of the U.N. Convention, the Armistice Agreement and the inter-Korean non-aggression accord. It is also an inhumane atrocity, in which it indiscriminately fired shells into unarmed civilian residential areas.”[69] Song Min-soon, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade and currently a Democratic Party (i.e. opposition) member of the National Assembly attacked what he called an: outrageous indiscriminate artillery attack against civilians and military alike.[70] The American liberal John Feffer wrote of a ‘disproportionate response’ which killed ‘two civilians and two soldiers’. [71] Early reports (such as the Korea Herald one above) mention only minor civilian injuries, though they talk of a ’civilian area’: ..killing two South Korean marines, wounding 16 soldiers and three civilians, and damaging homes and facilities. This was the first time since the Korean War that the North has fired artillery shells on a civilian area in South Korea.[72] ‘Civilian area’ is a rather elastic term. Most military bases have civilians living in the vicinity, some more than others. The giant US headquarters in South Korea, Yongsan Garrison occupies 2.5 sq km in the centre of this city of 10 million people; the site was originally developed by the Japanese Imperial Army. By 24 November the casualties changed to four – two military and two civilians. In addition to the two marines killed, the bodies of two men, believed in their 60s, were pulled from a destroyed construction site, the coast guard said. At least 18 people - most of them troops - were injured.[73] It was not stated where this construction site was in relation to the marine camp. If it were on the other side of the island, then that would indicate fire that was either indiscriminate or very inaccurate. If it were close by, or even on the camp, then this would put a different complexion on things. It is clear that the main target was the marine camp, as this quotation from the JCS indicates Many landed on a military camp but others on a civilian village on the island. Flames and thick columns of smoke were seen rising above the village and a nearby mountain. &quot;The North must have carefully premeditated the provocation against the camp,&quot; a JCS officer speculated. [74] Fig 4: Damage at the marine base A K-9 Marine artillery base on Yeonpyeong Island under attack by North Korea on Tuesday /Courtesy of the Ministry of Defense [&quot;N.Korean Shelling 'Aimed for Maximum Damage to Lives, Property'.&quot; Chosun Ilbo, 26 November 2010. The Washington Post went one step further and reported that: Most of the shells landed on a military base on Yeonpyeong island [emphasis added][75] However, most reports either did not mention the marine base, or gave no details. For instance, another Washington Post article talked of ‘civilian-inhabited Yeonpyeong Island’ without any reference to the marine base.[76] In fact the military installations were very significant as a New York Times article makes evident. … [Yeonpyeong Island] houses a garrison of about 1,000 South Korean marines, and the navy has deployed its newest class of “patrol killer” guided-missile ships in the Western Sea, as the Yellow Sea is also known. [77] This NY Times article gave the civilian population as 1,600 but this was later revised down to 1,350. [78] Most appear to be connected, as one might expect, to fishing (this area is especially famous for crabs); how many work on the base is unclear. The most detailed, technical, assessment of the artillery duel is given by the US ‘geopolitical intelligence’ company STRATFOR. It released a report, accompanied by a pdf file showing satellite images taken after what it called the ‘North Korean attack on Yeonpyeong Island’. The STRATFOR reports are interesting partly for what they reveal but also what they hide or obscure and for what might be considered a surprising lack of geopolitical intelligence in an organisation in the business of selling the stuff. It admits that: A [South Korean] battery of six K9 155 mm self-propelled howitzers, which was conducting live-fire drills on a Yeonpyeong Island military base, fired some 80 rounds. And then, a bit further down: Significantly, the South claims its Yeonpyeong Island drill was not part of the larger Hoguk exercises under way simultaneously throughout South Korea. North Korea has occasionally protested these drills — including recently — and claims dozens of shells fell in North Korean waters near the island, provoking it to fire. However, as the North does not recognize the Northern Limit Line and considers the entire island and its surrounding water to be North Korean territory, it does not seem to be clear that this particular incident was any more provocative than any other drill.[79] This is a curious argument. Hoguk and the other military exercises over the decades have taken place in South Korean territory or international waters. This one was being held in what the North considered to be DPRK territory. It was not merely provocative from a military point of view, but as they made clear in their statement of 24 November, from a legal one as well. That is a very important distinction which differentiated the Yeonpyeong exercise from others. Although the STRAFOR report mentions the military base in passing, it is absent from the satellite images document. We have satellite photos of destroyed houses, but nothing about the base, which is not even identified. Since the base was the main target of attack, and early reports focused on military dead and wounded, this is a rather suspicious omission. The STRATFOR report, and images, do however throw considerable light, albeit inadvertently, on the issue of the civilian casualties. It would appear from this, and other sources, that the North Korean fire was not very accurate. The North Koreans either exclusively, or mainly (it is not clear which) used Multiple Launch Rocket System [MLRS] artillery These are, as the name suggests, basically a bundle of tubes which can fire rockets. Interestingly it is said that they can be traced back to the 15th century Korean hwacha (‘fire vehicle’) which could fire a hundred or more projectiles in one salvo.[80] The most famous example in modern times was the Soviet Katyusha, used in the Second World War and nicknamed the ‘Stalin organ’.[81] The Americans used them in 1991 in the Gulf War, and the ROK military is equipped with them.[82] MLRS can deliver formidable devastation but are not very accurate, especially the older versions with which the KPA is equipped: The initial barrage consisted of 150 rounds, followed by 20 more intermittently — meaning that while a full battalion appeared to be in position, a fully armed single battery could have conducted the entire attack. Of these 170 rounds, 80 struck Yeonpyeong Island, though 20 failed to detonate….. With a few modern exceptions, artillery rockets are unguided and achieve results through massed fires rather than exceptional accuracy. Here, North Korea had no opportunity to register targets or adjust fire based on input from forward observers; South Korea has subsequently conjectured based on the targets that the North’s maps of military positions on the island may have been dated. The failure of so many rounds to reach the island and a dud rate of roughly a quarter of those that did suggest issues of quality control in manufacture and/or poorly controlled storage, as well as the potential for there to have been issues in the fire direction or on the gunline.[83] So it would appear that the reason that shells fell on the town was not so much that that the firing was indiscriminate, but that it was inaccurate. The North Koreans do not have a monopoly on this, and there was anger in the National Assembly Intelligence Committee when they were presented with the satellite photo (Fig 5) which showed that Southern shells fired from their much more accurate howitzers had missed their target, the North Korean artillery positions Committee members reportedly reacted angrily since they show impact points scattered mainly in paddy and dry fields.[84] Fig 5: Evidence of inaccurate fire In this satellite photo released by the U.S. private intelligence agency Stratfor, rice paddies and fields in North Korea bear traces of South Korean artillery shells [&quot;Spies Intercepted Plans for Yeonpyeong Attack in August &quot;. Chosun Ilbo, 2 December 2010. There was also much dispute about the damage suffered by the North. The DPRK has not released any statement about casualties. In the South, some pointed out that their military equipment was far superior and more deadly and hence there must have been many casualties, and others pointed to the various satellite photos showing hits off target.[85] Sometimes military action is intended primarily to terrorise and demoralise the civilian population – the London blitz, the firebombing of Tokyo, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the ‘shock and awe’ bombing of Bagdad prior to invasion – are just a few examples. If the DPRK fired on Seoul to unleash ‘a sea of fire’ it would be the civilian population that would be hit, and the military impact would be secondary. However, much military action is aimed primarily at the enemy military, and if this happens in a populated area, civilians become, in the US euphemism, ‘collateral damage’. Clearly the distinction between the two is often blurred in practice, and it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to be sure, but it appears from the available evidence that the target for the North Korean fire was the marine base and that civilian casualties and damage were accidental. There are several reasons for assuming this. Firstly, the inaccuracy of the MLRS. Secondly, if the intention had been to cause civilian causalities as a warning about the consequences of Lee Myung-bak’s confrontational policy – ‘today Yeonpyeong, tomorrow Seoul’ – we would expect that point to be made. There is little point in giving a warning unless it is reasonably explicit. I can find no indication that the DPRK has made any suggestion that the Yeonpyeong incident carried such a lesson for the people of the ROK. On the contrary, the public statement expressed regret for civilian casualties and laid the blame on the Southern side: The DPRK side warned several times against the enemy's plan for shelling in the sensitive areas around Yonphyong Island and sent a telephone notice on the morning of the very day the incident occurred as part of its superhuman efforts to prevent the clash to the last moment, but the south side preempted the firing of shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side. The enemy side, however, has kept silent about all these facts. Moreover, it is now working hard to dramatize &quot;civilian casualties&quot; as part of its propaganda campaign, creating the impression that the defenceless civilians were exposed to &quot;indiscriminate shelling&quot; all of a sudden from the DPRK side. If that is true, it is very regrettable but the enemy should be held responsible for the incident as it took such inhuman action as creating &quot;a human shield&quot; by deploying civilians around artillery positions and inside military facilities before the launch of the provocation. The fact that there were human casualties inside the military base clearly proves itself the ulterior intention of the enemy. The U.S. regarded the death of innocent civilians as a common practice in the past in a bid to serve its military purposes in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and other parts of the world. This inhuman atrocity of the US. repeated itself on the Korean Peninsula this time. While the incident occurred, the shells indiscriminately fired by the enemy dropped in the area close to civilian houses far from the artillery positions of the Korean People's Army.[emphasis added][86] This statement brings up a third factor. The claim about a ‘human shield’ doesn’t carry much weight. Civilians live on the island for historical and economic reasons and there is no reason to suppose that they were used to shield the military. However, the claim that civilian casualties occurred within the camp is not implausible. Civilians must have worked at the camp. Indeed, one report from the United States said of the shelling that ‘this resulted in the killing of two South Korean soldiers and two civilian contractors working on a military base’ [emphasis added].[87] As with the Cheonan incident we need a proper, impartial, investigation if we are to draw any firm conclusions, but as with the Cheonan no such investigation is likely. It is interesting to note that the DPRK statement does not claim that it suffered any civilian causalities, merely that enemy shells ‘dropped in the area close to civilian houses’. North Korean propaganda is frequently portrayed as dishonest and deceitful. Here is surely a case where it would have been to their advantage to fabricate civilian casualties, but they did not do so. Finally, it should be remembered that the ROK military on Yeonpyeong Island are not just ordinary soldiers, they are marines, an elite force trained for amphibious assault. Indeed, back in 2009 Rodong Sinmun commented on the buildup up in the area The puppet military reinforced warships and armed forces along and near the &quot;northern limit line in the West Sea&quot; and formed a &quot;task force to be ready to go into action in half an hour&quot; and deployed it on Yonphyong Islet[emphasis added][88] The road behind, the road ahead The fire fight at Yeonpyeong Island seems to have been a manufactured crisis. It appears to be the first time that South Korea, alone or in tandem with the United States, has carried out a military exercise in territory claimed by the North.[89] There have been frequent naval clashes around the Northern Limit Line and it is fairly certain that it has been preserved for that purpose. If’ Seoul’ had really been anxious to avoid incidents and preserve peace then the NLL would have gone long ago. President Roh moo-hyun and Chairman Kim Jong Il, at their summit on 4 October 2007 agreed to ‘special peace and cooperation zone in the West Sea’, but this peace initiative was overturned, as so many others, by incoming president Lee Myung-bak.[90] Preserving the NLL as an area where incidents were likely is one thing, but utilising the NLL deliberately to create an incident is another Warnings and intelligence reports aside, it must have been known that a military exercise within the NLL area would be provocative. On top of which, the legal implications made it intolerably provocative. This suggests that the crisis was planned, not necessarily in great detail, but with sufficient surety of outcome. This reading is quite consistent with Lee Myung-bak’s policy, which is one of building up tension through tension in order to precipitate a crisis on the peninsula, a collapse of the DRPK, and its absorption by the ROK. The DPRK is well aware of this, hence the reaffirmation of the zero tolerance policy at Yeonpyeong. On 23 November, in the aftermath of the clash, the KPA issued a communiqué which reiterated the policy: It is a traditional mode of counter-action of the army of the DPRK to counter the firing of the provocateurs with merciless strikes. Should the south Korean puppet group dare intrude into the territorial waters of the DPRK even 0.001 mm, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will unhesitatingly continue taking merciless military counter-actions against it.[91] This is a calculated policy of brinkmanship, designed to avert war, by threatening war. The danger is, of course, that the momentum of events will bring war about. That, unfortunately, is becoming ever more likely. Lee Myung-bak is a consummate politician. He has set things in motion to produce, and replicate crisis, while giving the appearance of being reluctant. His address to the nation on 29 November used the same rhetorical device as Antony’s speech about Julius Caesar, where he claims to be burying Caesar, not praising him, but of course is doing just that. Lee combined ‘humility’ with an aggressive stance in such a way as to suggest he was reluctant to exacerbate the situation but was being forced into it. President Lee Myung-bak’s address Monday is being summarized as consisting mainly of “humility toward the people of South Korea” and an “ultra-hardline response to North Korea.” Analysts say it shows the president’s perception of the current crisis facing him and its solution following the North Korean artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island. Although even North Korea acknowledged the attack to be a “provocation,” President Lee has faced harsh criticism domestically. Surveys show that more than 70 percent of South Koreans, conservative and progressive alike, feel that the military and Lee Myung-bak administration did not respond appropriately at the time of the attack. The fact that the president began his address Monday with what amounted to an apology to the people of South Korea reflected a consideration of this situation. [emphasis added] The performance so impressed the reporter from the liberal Hankyoreh that we get manifestly false statement that ‘North Korea acknowledged the attack to be a ‘provocation’. Throughout the crises of 2001, especially over Cheonan and then Yeonpyeong, Lee Myung-bak has been very adroit in fanning the flames while give the impression that he was attempting to put them out. In respect of the Cheonan incident President Obama was reported as saying &quot;I think President Lee has shown extraordinary restraint given these circumstances.’[92] It may be objected that this was a public statement and should not be taken too literally; politicians often say in public the opposite of what they think in private. However, there does seem to be a consensus among Western observers at least that Lee is a reluctant warrior being driven into taking steps by the provocative obduracy of the North.[93] Take, for instance, this STRATFOR interview where the interviewer comments: I talked to three former [US?] envoys to Seoul this week and all of them agreed that South Korea had handled this in a pretty cool and sensible fashion[94] The South Korea public is rather more sceptical. One of the WikiLeaks cables [09SEOUL59] illustrates the confusion in the minds of US officials: President Lee is determined not to give in to North Korean pressure. Our Blue House contacts have told us on several occasions that President Lee remained quite comfortable with his North Korea policy and that he is prepared leave the inter-Korean relations frozen until the end of his term in office, if necessary. It is also our assessment that Lee's more conservative advisors and supporters see the current standoff as a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the North, even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship.[95] On the one hand we have Lee facing up to North Korean pressure, but we also get the admission that the ‘current standoff’ ( this was in 2009) is seen as ‘ a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the North, even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship’. Lee’s brinkmanship is, in fact, far more profound and aggressive than the US diplomat realised. Both North and South are engaging in brinkmanship, but the nature of the two is very different. Pyongyang is far poorer and weaker than its adversaries, which include not merely South Korea but the United States, and Japan.[96] North Korea’s brinkmanship is therefore inherently defensive. It is designed to protect the country (or regime if you prefer that) from attack and conquest. That does not mean that it is wise, or will be successful, that is a matter of debate. But it is important to recognise its essential characteristic of defensiveness. South Korea’s brinkmanship, on the other hand, is offensive. It is designed to bring about the collapse of the DPRK and its takeover by the ROK. Lee Myung-bak does not have to do this. His immediate predecessors (Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun) had very different policies. Indeed, his aggressive brinkmanship is arguably a new development because even in the days of the military dictatorships while there was hostility towards the North because the balance of forces if anything favoured the North, there was not such an ambitious policy. However, Lee Myung-bak is reputedly pragmatic and opportunistic. Soon after he won the presidency he was described in the New York Times thus: Mr. Lee has a reputation as a pragmatist who, in contrast to President Roh Moo-hyun, holds few strong ideological positions. As mayor, he created parks and reformed the public transportation system. As president, he said, his main agenda would be to revive the country’s economy.[97] If that is correct, his brinkmanship has been a response to events and opportunities, rather than a considered strategy. In addition, we may discern three factors which may be propelling him to accelerate the buildup of tension on the peninsula. • A desire to renew the anti-North momentum after the relative failure of the Cheonan incident. His setback in the May elections, the widespread public scepticism about the investigation, and the failure to get the UN Security Council to condemn North Korea must rankle. The Yeonpyeong incident is seen as away to rekindle anti-North Korea sentiment In his address on 29 November he specifically made the point: There was a split in public opinion over the torpedoing of the Cheonan. Unlike that time, our people have united as one this time.[98] Despite the frequent assertions of implosion and crisis, the DPRK is not facing collapse. Whilst sanctions must have caused huge damage it appears that the economy is recovering. Certainly Pyongyang, from personal observation on a visit in November 2010, is manifestly economically improved over my last visit three years ago, with more motor vehicles, bicycles, and shops. The electricity supply is much better and there is a very noticeable increase in street lighting. These observations are broadly corroborated by series of recent American visitors.[99] If the South is to take over the North then something must be done to reverse this recovery. Time is not on Lee Myung-bak’s side. His term of office comes to an end on 25 February 2013 and under the present constitution he is ineligible to run again. Moreover, there are suggestions that because of demographic changes the conservative ascendancy represented by the Lee administration may not be sustainable and that South Korea will move to more progressive administrations.[100] Since the North’s brinkmanship is defensive, it is reactive and this leaves the initiative in the hands of the South. Seoul has reinforced its forces on the NLL island and has announced that there will be artillery exercises from Daecheong Island, and again on Yeonpyeong. [101] It seems inevitable that Pyongyang will feel compelled to respond. The new ROK Defence Minister, Kim Kwan-jin, has threatened what he calls ‘self-defense air raids’ in the event of another clash; ‘self defense’ being used in the Japanese sense.[102] It will be recalled that clause 9 of the Japanese constitution prohibits the establishment of armed forces, so the Japanese army, navy and air forces all have ‘self-defense’ in their titles thus solving the constitutional problem. Kim Kwan-jin’s air strike policy is all part of what the New York Times rather approvingly, and with a professional use of euphemism, called a new ‘muscular military posture’.[103] The implications of this new policy are obvious. Not merely has the South great superiority in aircraft, but the new rules allow great flexibility for escalation. However, there are limits to the ROK military’s freedom of action. There is the legal issue of operational control – when would war be deemed a war and thus trigger US control of the ROK military ? But before that stage is reached, the ROK air force is dependent on US intelligence to operate. Thus any serious escalation of the situation on the Korean peninsula would require US endorsement. Would this be forthcoming? Unfortunately it looks as if it would. The Obama administration has termed its policy towards Korea as one of ‘strategic patience’. [104] It might be better described as ‘strategic paralysis’. Not merely has it ignored that calls of a many Korea experts to engage with the DPRK, but it has effectively relinquished control of events to Lee Myung-bak.[105] It might be said that ‘strategic paralysis’ is not confined to US Korea policy but is the defining characteristic of Obama foreign policy, and that would be true, but nowhere is it more perilous than in Korea. Because ultimately Korea is China. A second Korean war would, like the first, soon become a Sino-American war. </span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>SECOND, Chinese pressure on North Korea is key to maintain regional stability. However, the geopolitical rivalry with the U.S. on the peninsula dissuades them.</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Putten 12/21</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt; text-decoration: none;">—research fellow with the Clingendael Institue in The Hague, PhD in History (Frans-Paul van der Putten, 21 December 2010, “Sino-US geopolitical rivalry does not help Korean stability”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4781:http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/21/sino-us-geopolitical-rivalry-does-not-help-korean-stability/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/21/sino-us-geopolitical-rivalry-does-not-help-korean-stability/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/12/21/sino-us-geopolitical-rivalry-does-not-help-korean-stability/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4781 -->, RBatra)</span> </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">The United States government believes China needs to do more to contribute to stability on the Korean peninsula. According to this view, North Korea is highly dependent on Chinese support and Beijing should use its influence to moderate Pyongyang’s behavior. As some American and other Western observers have put it, it is time for China to start behaving like a responsible great power. But it is not likely that China will fundamentally alter its policies. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The main reason for this is that geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States overshadows the situation on the Korean peninsula. Lately both Chinese and US actions have escalated this rivalry. As long as the two powers are more interested in keeping the other in check than in stabilising the peninsula no significant progress in terms of stabilising the region is possible. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">North Korea recently shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong after a period of escalating tensions, killing two soldiers and two civilians. North Korea claims that it opened fire after being provoked by a South Korean exercise. In response to the shelling incident the US and South Korea have conducted joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea. These involved a US aircraft carrier and are regarded as threatening not only by North Korea but also by China. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">China’s economic and diplomatic support for North Korea undermines efforts by other countries to affect the behavior of the regime in Pyongyang. Even China is troubled by North Korean behavior. The North Korean nuclear program, and the risks Pyongyang is running in escalating tensions with South Korea and the US, are counter to China’s security interests. Theoretically, the Chinese government could therefore decide to put pressure on Pyongyang by limiting its economic support and by ending the diplomatic support it often gives in the United Nations Security Council. It is very unlikely that China’s policy towards North Korea will change much. The US diplomatic reports revealed by WikiLeaks are a confirmation of uneasy Sino-North Korean relations rather than an indication that this relationship is about to change. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">China will probably continue to give more support than any other country because it is highly vulnerable to the consequences of political or economic collapse in North Korea. The longest and most accessible border of North Korea is the one it shares with China. Chaos in North Korea would harm stability in China’s northeast, the region formerly known as Manchuria. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Moreover, Beijing is less motivated to put pressure on the North Korean regime than other countries are. The US is primarily interested in preventing the proliferation of nuclear technologies from North Korea. South Korea and Japan are mainly worried about the military threat from the north. Compared with these countries, China is less concerned about such issues. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The most fundamental element in China’s policy towards North Korea is that Beijing regards the US as a greater security threat than the situation on the Korean peninsula. Since neither China nor the US is by itself the predominant great power in Korean affairs, Beijing can only assume responsibility for regional stability if it does so jointly with the US. However, this will not happen since China and the US each regard one another as their main potential military adversary. They also have contrary interests on the Korean peninsula. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">While China regards the US military presence in South Korea as a potential threat that should eventually be removed, the US intends to maintain this presence as it helps to limit Chinese regional influence. The relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang cannot be seen apart from this context of geopolitical rivalry. It is desirable for China that the regime in North Korea continues to exist and that the Chinese government retains a certain degree of influence in Pyongyang. </span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>Carpenter 10</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt; text-decoration: none;">—vice president for defense and foreign-policy studies at the Cato Institute, PhD in history (Ted Galen, 3 August 2010, China Spats, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4782:http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/china-spats-3778 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/china-spats-3778" rel="nofollow">http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/china-spats-3778</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4782 -->, RBatra)</span> </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">Beijing's failure to rein in an increasingly reckless Pyongyang is a legitimate security issue for the United States. So too are China's breathtakingly broad claims in the South China Sea. China regards virtually that entire sea as its territorial waters—something that, if enforced, would have profound implications for international navigation and commerce. As the world's leading maritime and trading power, the United States cannot tamely accept such a brazen attempt to change the status of international waters through which much of the world's commerce flows. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">But even on those issues, Washington needs to understand that some concessions may need to be made to secure Chinese cooperation. It is unrealistic to expect, for example, that China will incur the risks involved in pressuring North Korea if the United States offers nothing in return. Beijing worries that coercing Pyongyang could cause Kim Jong-il's regime to unravel—perhaps even cause the North Korean state itself to implode, much as East Germany did at the end of the 1980s. That development would produce massive refugee flows into China, and possibly result in the emergence of a united Korea closely allied to the United States and with a U.S. military presence on the peninsula. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">If we want China to take on serious risks to tame North Korea, we have to offer some incentives. Promising to assist Beijing in dealing with the probable refugee problem would seem to be the absolute minimum. In all likelihood, Chinese leaders would also want a commitment to phase out American military bases in Korea if the North Korean threat were neutralized. Yet Washington has not offered the slightest hint of concessions on either issue. U.S. officials implicitly expect Beijing to accept the risks entailed in getting tough with Pyongyang but receive nothing at all in return. </span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>Plan leads to Chinese economic leverage that halts the nuclear program</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Carpenter 10</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt; text-decoration: none;">—vice president for defense and foreign-policy studies at the Cato Institute, PhD in history (Ted Galen, Winter 2010, Plan B for Dealing with North Korea, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4783:http://www.cato.org/pubs/Policy-TedGalenCarpenter.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/Policy-TedGalenCarpenter.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pubs/Policy-TedGalenCarpenter.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4783 -->, RBatra)</span> </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">The strategy of imposing tighter economic sanctions also faces major hurdles. Both Beijing and Moscow have consistently opposed vigorous sanctions in the UN Security Council, arguing that they will make Pyongyang less rather than more cooperative. The Russians and Chinese (particularly the latter) were successful in dramatically diluting the 2009 sanctions that the United States and Japan wanted. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">It is especially important to understand the reasons for China's reluctance to endorse truly robust sanctions. Although a few Sinophobes in the United States charge that China is in league with the North Koreans and would not mind a nuclear-armed North Korea, most evidence suggests that Beijing is not eager to see nuclear weapons introduced on the Korean Peninsula. Among other drawbacks, such a development may lead the Japanese to build nuclear deterrents of their own, which is the last thing China wants. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Maintaining the non-nuclear status quo on the Korean Peninsula may be a significant Chinese objective, but it is not their most important one.5 Beijing's top priority is to preserve the North Korean state as a buffer between China and the US sphere of influence in Northeast Asia. Chinese leaders probably fear that rigorous sanctions would increase the danger of the North Korean state imploding, much as East Germany did in 1989. Such a development could lead to a unified Korea allied to the United States right on China's doorsteps-probably with the continued presence of American military bases on the Korean Peninsula. It might lead to a massive flow of North Korean refugees into China. Uneasiness over these scenarios limits the amount of pressure that Beijing is willing to exert on Pyongyang. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In theory, China might be able to use its economic leverage as North Korea's principal source of energy, food, and other vital commodities to compel Kim Jong Il's regime to halt its nuclear weapons program. Without Chinese cooperation, coercive economic measures would have little impact on Pyongyang. And given Washington's dependence on Beijing's willingness to continue funding the soaring US Treasury debt, American officials are not in a good bargaining position to pressure China into endorsing robust sanctions. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">What value, then, is the alliance? </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Some proponents view it as a useful tool of nonproliferation, discouraging South Korea from developing a nuclear weapon. However, that possibility remains remote. Although nuclear negotiations with the North hardly look promising, China might yet forcefully weigh in to halt the North Korean program. Moreover, the U.S. could maintain a nuclear umbrella over the ROK without keeping conventional forces on the ground in South Korea, which only act as nuclear hostages vulnerable to DPRK intimidation. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Moreover, the most powerful incentive for Beijing to apply significant pressure on the North to denuclearize (and not just return to the Six-Party talks) is the threat of further proliferation. The People's Republic of China does not fear a North Korean atomic bomb. The PRC might not worry unduly about a South Korean weapon. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">But Japan and even Taiwan might consider joining a growing nuclear parade. That possibility should raise more than eyebrows in Beijing, encouraging a vigorous response to halt the process at the start. The best way to keep the ROK and neighboring states non-nuclear is to make the North non-nuclear. The best way to make North Korea non-nuclear is for the PRC to use its full array of diplomatic and economic tools on Pyongyang. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">China yesterday called for emergency direct diplomacy with North Korea in order to lower escalating tensions following last week's artillery attack on South Korea (see GSN, Nov. 24). </span><br />
<span class="Underline">However, the United States and its allies said now is not the time to address Pyongyang's demands for new six-party talks. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">North Korea's shelling of the inhabited South Korean island of Yeonpyeong resulted in the deaths of several soldiers and civilians and injuries to nearly 20 more. The incident directly followed news from Washington that Pyongyang revealed to visiting U.S. experts earlier this month that it had covertly built a large-scale advanced uranium enrichment facility at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, the Wall Street Journal reported. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The two events have renewed international attention on the North Korean nuclear impasse. Beijing dispatched its senior foreign affairs official to lead a delegation to Seoul over the weekend for talks on the crisis. However, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak told the Chinese visitors that it was not the &quot;right time&quot; to relaunch long-stalled six-nation talks aimed at the permament denuclearization of North Korea, according to an administration official. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The nuclear talks involve China, Japan, the two Koreas, Russia and the United States. They were last held almost two years ago. Pyongyang withdrew from the negotiations in April 2009 and one month later carried out its second nuclear weapons test, an action for which it was punished with heightened U.N. Security Council sanctions. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The North for some time has declared its willingness to return to the nuclear talks. However, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo are leery of returning to a negotiating framework that has been used by the North in the past as a means to win international concessions only to later resume work on its nuclear weapons program. The three allies have called on Pyongyang to demonstrate its &quot;sincere&quot; commitment to nuclear disarmament before they will agree to resume negotiations. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">China is North Korea's strongest foreign ally and chief economic benefactor. Beijing's continued support of the Kim Jong Il regime is frequently cited in Washington as the only thing keeping the Stalinist government from collapsing. Because of this, China has come under growing criticism from the international community to do more to press North Korea over its belligerent behavior. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">&quot;It's hard to know why China doesn't push harder,&quot; Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a CNN interview aired yesterday. &quot;They clearly are interested in this -- in the region not spinning out of control -- so my sense is they try to control this guy, and I'm not sure he is controllable.&quot; </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Lee yesterday told Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo in blunt remarks that China must take a &quot;more fair and responsible position&quot; on peninsula affairs and leave Cold War-era considerations behind, according to presidential spokesman Hong Sang-pyo. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In a television address today, Lee pledged North Korea &quot;would pay a price&quot; for any future hostilities and said that &quot;more endurance and forgiveness would only result in bigger provocations&quot; (Fairclough/Ramstad, Wall Street Journal I, Nov. 28). </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Japan today dismissed Beijing's call for direct talks with North Korea. Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said it would be &quot;unacceptable for us to hold six-party talks only because North Korea has gone amok,&quot; the Wall Street Journal reported (Yuka Hayashi, Wall Street Journal II, Nov. 29). </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The United States has yet to give a response to China's call for emergency talks, saying it would carry out discussions with the South Korean government first, Reuters reported. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">A high-ranking Pyongyang official voiced doubts about Beijing's initiative to engage in discussions. While the North has not responded to China's call, the unidentified official told Kyodo News that countries involved in the latest incident should meet for talks first (Laurence/Choonsik, Reuters, Nov. 29). </span><br />
<span class="Underline">While urging that the two Koreas to refrain from actions that would raise tensions on the peninsula, China has abstained from condemning Pyongyang's shelling of the South Korean island, indicating that Beijing will refuse the urging of Washington and other states to punish the North, the Los Angeles Times reported last Thursday. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">North Korea's presumed possession of the nuclear bomb, its large arsenal of chemical weapons and a massive standing army make a military assault on the isolated state an unattractive option, according to reports. The United States and much of the international community have already drastically curtailed trade relations with the Stalinist state. In the White House view, China remains the only nation to have sway over the North and the only hope of producing a change in the Korean nuclear impasse. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">&quot;China is pivotal to moving North Korea in a fundamentally different direction,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">&quot;You can go [to] the U.N. Security Council or call for a five-party meeting (minus North Korea). But first you've got to go after China,&quot; said Victor Cha, point man for North Korean policy during the Bush administration. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Incendiary rhetoric has accompanied the crisis on both sides of Korea’s demilitarized zone. On Friday, North Korea denounced the planned joint US-South Korean exercises as a provocation and warned, “The situation on the Korean peninsula is inching closer to the brink of war.” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In the South, the government replaced its defense minister with a former chairman of the military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff and announced the adoption of new rules of engagement that would allow the military to respond with disproportionate force to attacks from the North. The garrison on Yeonpyeong (just seven miles from the North Korean coast), meanwhile, has been reinforced with more troops and heavy weapons. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Right-wing legislators, meanwhile have denounced the government of President Lee Myung-bak for failing to take more aggressive action, including the use of air strikes, against the North. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Lee and his Grand National Party (GNP), the party of the former military dictatorships that ruled South Korea with US support, came into office promising a hard-line stance toward North Korea. Its cutting off of aid and rejection of the “Sunshine Policy,” through which previous South Korean governments sought reconciliation via investments and aid, have played a significant role in provoking the escalating conflict. Now Lee is under pressure from his own supporters and elements within the military to make good on his hard-line rhetoric. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The potential for a catastrophic confrontation on the Korean peninsula is high. It is difficult to imagine another armed confrontation not provoking a major retaliation by the South Korean military. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">“Mr. Obama’s decision to accelerate the deployment of an American aircraft carrier group to the region is intended to prod the Chinese,” the New York Times reported Thursday. “American officials hope that by presenting Beijing with an unpalatable result—the expansion of American maneuvers off its shores—China will decide that pressing North Korea is the lesser of two evils.” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">A senior administration official told the New York Times on Wednesday: “To the Chinese, the message is that if North Korea undertakes actions such as uranium enrichment or the attack on the South that threaten our equities, the US will respond in ways that negatively affect China’s perceived interests. The response is directed at messaging North Korea and reassuring South Korea, but China clearly does not like to see US aircraft carriers, for example, in the Yellow Sea.” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Washington had threatened to carry out joint US-South Korean military exercises in the Yellow Sea last July, ostensibly in response to the sinking of a South Korean warship in which 46 sailors lost their lives. South Korea has charged North Korea with having sunk the vessel, which went down near the disputed maritime border imposed by the US at the end of the Korean War, but Pyongyang has denied any responsibility. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In the face of Beijing’s sharp protests, the Obama administration shifted those exercises to the Sea of Japan, away from Chinese waters. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">This time Washington is deploying one of its most powerful warships in the Yellow Sea as a demonstration of its military supremacy against China. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">While the Chinese government issued a measured warning over the exercise, declaring that it opposed “any military acts in our exclusive economic zone”—which extends 200 miles from the Chinese coast—others close to the Beijing government and its military vigorously denounced the US maneuvers. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">While the immediate pretext for the provocative exercise is the Korean conflict, it is in line with an increasingly aggressive US policy in Asia. This has included the US attempt to insert itself into territorial conflicts in the South China Sea, backing Japan, Vietnam and other ASEAN countries against China. Washington’s aim in the region has been the pursuit of a series of alliances and assertions of military power directed against China that stretch from India, Pakistan and Afghanistan to Southeast Asia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In the wake of the world capitalist financial meltdown, geostrategic offensive has been coupled with increasingly aggressive demands for Chinese currency revaluations and trade concessions. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Fundamentally, the growing US-China tensions are rooted in deep-going shifts in the world economy and the global balance of forces: China’s rise to the position of the world’s second-largest economy, eclipsing Japan, on the one hand, and the relative economic decline of US imperialism, combined with its growing use of military force, on the other. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">This conflict threatens to turn Northeast Asia and the entire planet into a tinderbox. Much as in the period preceding the First World War, seemingly isolated regional confrontations between minor powers have the potential of precipitating a global conflagration, this time between nuclear-armed adversaries. </span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>Continued North Korean proliferation risks nuclear strikes that kill millions and de-stabilizing prolif throughout Asia</strong> </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious, not only for the Northeast Asian region but for the whole international community. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">At worst, there is the possibility of nuclear attack1, whether by intention, miscalculation, or merely accident, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities. On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust of unprecedented proportions. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: </span><br />
<span class="Underline">That is not global winter, but the nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years. The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow…The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger…To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.4 </span><br />
<span class="Underline">These, of course, are not the only consequences. Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. The direct impacts, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, could make the present global financial crisis pale by comparison. How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. There could be many unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with subsequent nuclear breakout and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, and aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant states. The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">North Korea is currently believed to have sufficient plutonium stocks to produce up to 12 nuclear weapons.6 If and when it is successful in implementing a uranium enrichment program - having announced publicly that it is experimenting with enrichment technology on September 4, 20097 in a communication with the UN Security Council - it would likely acquire the capacity to produce over 100 such weapons. Although some may dismiss Korean Peninsula proliferation risks on the assumption that the North Korean regime will implode as a result of its own economic problems, food problems, and treatment of its own populace, there is little to suggest that this is imminent. If this were to happen, there would be the risk of nuclear weapons falling into hands of non-state actors in the disorder and chaos that would ensue. Even without the outbreak of nuclear hostilities on the Korean Peninsula in either the near or longer term, North Korea has every financial incentive under current economic sanctions and the needs of its military command economy to export its nuclear and missile technologies to other states. Indeed, it has already been doing this for some time. The Proliferation Security Initiative may conceivably prove effective in intercepting ship-borne nuclear exports, but it is by no means clear how air-transported materials could similarly be intercepted. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Given the high stakes involved, North Korean proliferation, if unaddressed and unreversed, has the potential to destabilize the whole East Asian region and beyond. Even if a nuclear exchange does not occur in the short term, the acute sense of nuclear threat that has been experienced for over five decades by North Koreans as a result of US strategic deterrence is now likely to be keenly felt by fellow Koreans south of the 38th Parallel and Japanese across the waters of the Sea of Japan. China, too, must surely feel itself to be at risk from North Korean nuclear weapons, or from escalation that might ensue from next-use in the Korean Peninsula resulting not only in the environmental consequences noted above, but in regime collapse and massive refugee flows. South Korea and Japan appear willing to rely on their respective bilateral security pacts with the United States to deter North Korean nuclear attack for the time being. However, should South Korea and/or Japan acquire nuclear weapons, the outcome would be destabilizing, especially if this resulted from rupture of their alliance relationships with the United States. Both have the technical capability to do so very rapidly. South Korea has previously engaged in nuclear weapons research but desisted after US pressure. Japan still proclaims its adherence to the three Non-Nuclear Principles although recent confirmation that the United States routinely transited nuclear weapons through Japan and retains the right of emergency reintroduction of nuclear weapons has tarnished Japan’s non-nuclear image. Moreover, it has large stockpiles of plutonium that could rapidly be used to produce nuclear warheads. Such responses, already advocated by conservative and nationalist groups within South Korea and Japan, could trigger a regional nuclear arms race involving the Koreas, Japan, Taiwan, and China, with incalculable wider consequences for Southeast Asia, South Asia and the whole Pacific and beyond. These developments would spell the demise of the current global non-proliferation regime as underpinned by the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Failure to reverse the DPRK’s nuclear breakout is also an important factor driving a general malaise in the exercise of American power which one of the authors has characterized elsewhere as “the end of American nuclear hegemony.”8 </span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>Escalates to nuclear war</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Cimbala 10</strong> <span style="font-size: 7pt; text-decoration: none;">- Prof. of Political Science @ Penn State, (Stephen, Nuclear Weapons and Cooperative Security in the 21st Century, p. 117-8)</span> </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">Failure to contain proliferation in Pyongyang could spread nuclear fever throughout Asia. Japan and South Korea might seek nuclear weapons and missile defenses. A pentagonal configuration of nuclear powers in the Pacific basis (Russia, China, Japan, and the two Koreas – not including the United States, with its own Pacific interests) could put deterrence at risk and create enormous temptation toward nuclear preemption. Apart from actual use or threat of use, North Korea could exploit the mere existence of an assumed nuclear capability in order to support its coercive diplomacy. As George H. Quester has noted: </span><br />
<span class="Underline">If the Pyongyang regime plays its cards sensibly and well, therefore, the world will not see its nuclear weapons being used against Japan or South Korea or anyone else, but will rather see this new nuclear arsenal held in reserve (just as the putative Israeli nuclear arsenal has been held in reserve), as a deterrent against the outside world’s applying maximal pressure on Pyongyang and as a bargaining chip to extract the economic and political concessions that the DPRK needs if it wishes to avoid giving up its peculiar approach to social engineering. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">A five-sided nuclear competition in the Pacific would be linked, in geopolitical deterrence and proliferation space, to the existing nuclear deterrents in India and Pakistan, and to the emerging nuclear weapons status of Iran. An arc of nuclear instability from Tehran to Tokyo could place U.S. proliferation strategies into the ash heap of history and call for more drastic military options, not excluding preemptive war, defenses, and counter-deterrent special operations. In addition, an eight-sided nuclear arms race in Asia would increase the likelihood of accidental or inadvertent nuclear war. It would do so because: (1) some of these states already have histories of protracted conflict; (2) states may have politically unreliable or immature command and control systems, especially during a crisis involving a decision for nuclear first strike or retaliation; unreliable or immature systems might permit a technical malfunction that caused an unintended launch, or a deliberate but unauthorized launch by rogue commanders; (3) faulty intelligence and warning systems might cause one side to misinterpret the other’s defensive moves to forestall attack as offensive preparations for attack, thus triggering a mistaken preemption. </span><br />

On the one hand, the resolution of the nuclear problem of the Korean Peninsula would set a very important precedent for resolving similar problems in other parts of the world and thus become a weighty contribution to the strengthening of the nuclear nonproliferation regime.

<span class="Underline">The Obama administration took office in 2009 determined to move beyond might-makes-right-makes-might unilateralism of the Bush years, and reassert America's global influence as the most principled and powerful guarantor of rule-based multilateralism. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">With respect to China, this approach was presented as a doctrine of &quot;strategic reassurance&quot;. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">However, the policy has not yielded the systemic breakthroughs that the Obama administration hoped to achieve on climate change, non-proliferation, Middle East security, still less on U.S.-China relations. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Instead, increasingly acrimonious exchanges between Beijing and Washington reveal the contradictions inherent in attempting to shoehorn an authoritarian, mercantilist, and suspicious nation into a refurbished world system that ostensibly promotes democracy, open markets, multilateralism, while forcefully advancing American interests. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Now the Obama administration seems to have accepted a world of lowered expectations and strives for the more achievable goal of advancing U.S. power at China’s expense. Friction with China has emerged as a regular feature of U.S. diplomacy—a means to score points in the game of international diplomacy at the expense of an unpopular, uncooperative, and, at least for the moment, diplomatically and militarily weaker regime. Indeed, U.S. China policy today looks a lot like good old-fashioned rollback, isolating China instead of incorporating it into a win-win multi-polar system. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The Western press, distracted by individual issues such as Iran sanctions, Google, and the Cheonan sinking, seems oblivious to the fact that the U.S.-China relationship has lurched into zero-sum territory and relations are in the deep freeze, largely as the result of the willingness of the Obama administration to confront China in pursuit of its agenda. The Chinese media, on the other hand, talks about nothing else. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Observers who believe that China will yield to U.S. pressure as long as its access to world markets is assured are ignoring unmistakable signs that Beijing has decided that, while its economic interests are vital, it must be prepared to downplay short-term economic gain in order to ensure its geopolitical position and national future. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Even in its inception, U.S. demands for “strategic reassurance” were inherently unequal, framed as something that China had to provide up front before the U.S. would reciprocate. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg described the doctrine at a Center for a New American Security conference on China in September 2009. The onus for reassurance was put on China in a way that Beijing undoubtedly found grating. (1) </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Strategic reassurance rests on a core, if tacit, bargain. Just as we and our allies must make clear that we are prepared to welcome China’s “arrival”, as you all have so nicely put it, as a prosperous and successful power, China must reassure the rest of the world that its development and growing global role will not come at the expense of security and well-being of others. Bolstering that bargain must be a priority in the U.S.-China relationship. And strategic reassurance must find ways to highlight and reinforce the areas of common interest, while addressing the sources of mistrust directly, whether they be political, military or economic. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">But in Beijing, both Chinese and American officials and analysts have another explanation: the long silence epitomizes the speed with which relations between Washington and Beijing have plunged into a freeze. This year has witnessed the longest period of tension between the two capitals in a decade. And if anything, both sides appear to be hardening their positions. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">“The issues that used to be on the positive side of the ledger are increasingly on the negative side of the ledger, starting with North Korea,” Bonnie Glaser, a China scholar at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview last week. “I don’t think this is easily repairable, and I think we’re going to have a fairly cold relationship over the next two years, and potentially longer.” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Mr. Obama came into office seeking just the opposite: a new rapprochement with a rising power whose deep economic ties with the United States all but demand closer diplomatic ones. But the days when the White House spoke of a “G-2” that would manage the world economy and more, a phrase that preceded the first meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu in the depths of the financial crisis in early 2009, are long over. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Instead, he faces a problem very similar to the one Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton described in March 2009 during a lunch with Kevin Rudd, a China expert who was then Australia’s prime minister, according to a cable recounting their conversation that was in a newly released trove of WikiLeaks documents. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Mrs. Clinton was said to have asked Mr. Rudd, “How do you deal toughly with your banker?”‘ </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The latest bad sign is that cooperation on managing North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, which began with considerable promise in 2009, appears to have disintegrated. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">On Monday, Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to convene an emergency meeting in Washington with her Japanese and South Korean counterparts about both the North’s shelling of a South Korean island last month, and its recent disclosure of a new nuclear facility that potentially expands its nuclear arsenal. China, the only nation with real sway over the North Korean leadership, will not be there. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">To the contrary, China’s strategy on North Korea is at odds with that of Washington and its allies. In Monday’s telephone call with Mr. Hu, the White House said, Mr. Obama said North Korea’s new enrichment facility flouted commitments it made during the six-party talks on curbing its nuclear program, and urged China’s help in sending “a clear message to North Korea that its provocations are unacceptable.” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">One former Chinese official with close ties to the government dismissed the American approach last week as characteristically legalistic. The former official, who would not be named because he is not authorized to speak on the topic, said China’s strategy is to reassure the Koreans about their security, not lecture them about diplomatic obligations. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Indeed, China’s strongest public reaction to last month’s shelling of South Korea has not been to condemn the North, but to criticize Washington’s response — joint war games with South Korea that put the American carrier George Washington and its strike force in the Yellow Sea, off China’s borders. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Clearly, the key to solving the North Korea problem lies in cooperative U.S.-China relations.

<span class="Underline">The Obama administration has explicitly sought to “reset” the relationship with Russia, which had become quite dysfunctional during the final years of the Bush administration. Although Washington has not used the reset terminology with respect to the troubled U.S. relationship with China, the substantive goal appears to be similar. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates’ effort to restore the dialogue between the militaries of the two countries is one indication of that intent. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Both goals, however, are encountering headwinds for a key reason. Policy makers seem unwilling to accept the reality that any great power in the international system expects, and will seek to enforce, a sphere of influence in its immediate region. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice famously (or infamously) insisted that the concept of a sphere of influence was both obsolete and pernicious. But that viewpoint is dangerously erroneous.

<span class="Underline">To begin with, the Korean peninsula encapsulates China’s continuing yet elusive quest to restore its past glory, to make a “rich country, strong army” (fuguo qiangbing), and to achieve great-power status. For one thing, not only was traditional Korea part of the Sinocentric world order up to the mid-19th century, but it was also there that the fledgling People’s Republic confronted the mighty United States 50 years ago. Moreover, the 1992 Sino-South Korean normalization and their fastgrowing economic and other ties testify to the vicissitude of Cold War politics and the validity of China’s ongoing reform and open-door policy. Furthermore, as North Korea’s newest nuclear gambit and a recent spate of anti-American sentiment in South Korea portend, China’s potential to become a full-fledged major power will likely be tested again in the rapidly-changing, yet uncharted, Korean peninsula. This fundamental fact has taken on a new relevance in light of the global discourse over the “rise of China”—be that “China’s peaceful rise” (heping jueqi),3 “China’s peaceful development” (heping fazhan)4 or “China threat theory” (weixielun).5 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The evolution of Sino-U.S. relations over the next months, years, and decades has the potential to have a greater impact on global security and prosperity than any other bilateral or multilateral arrangement. In this sense, many analysts consider the US.-China diplomatic relationship to be the most influential in the world. Without question, strong and stable U.S. alliances provide the foundation for the protection and promotion of U.S. and global interests. Yet within that broad framework, the trajectory of U.S.-China relations will determine the success, or failure, of efforts to address the toughest global challenges: global financial stability, energy security and climate change, nonproliferation, and terrorism, among other pressing issues. Shepherding that trajectory in the most constructive direction possible must therefore be a priority for Washington and Beijing. Virtually no major global challenge can be met without U.S.-China cooperation. The uncertainty of that future trajectory and the &quot;strategic mistrust&quot; between leaders in Washington and Beijing necessarily concerns many experts and policymakers in both countries. Although some U.S. analysts see China as a strategic competitor—deliberately vying with the United States for energy resources, military superiority, and international political influence alike— analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has generally found that China uses its soft power to pursue its own, largely economic, international agenda primarily to achieve its domestic objectives of economic growth and social stability.1 Although Beijing certainly has an eye on Washington, not all of its actions are undertaken as a counterpoint to the United States. In addition, CSIS research suggests that growing Chinese soft power in developing countries may have influenced recent U.S. decisions to engage more actively and reinvest in soft-power tools that have atrophied during the past decade. To the extent that there exists a competition between the United States and China, therefore, it may be mobilizing both countries to strengthen their ability to solve global problems. To be sure, U.S. and Chinese policy decisions toward the respective other power will be determined in large part by the choices that leaders make about their own nations interests at home and overseas, which in turn are shaped by their respective domestic contexts. Both parties must recognize—and accept—that the other will pursue a foreign policy approach that is in its own national interest. Yet, in a globalized world, challenges are increasingly transnational, and so too must be their solutions. As demonstrated by the rapid spread of SARS from China in 2003, pandemic flu can be spread rapidly through air and via international travel. Dust particulates from Asia settle in Lake Tahoe. An economic downturn in one country can and does trigger an economic slowdown in another. These challenges can no longer be addressed by either containment or isolation. What constitutes the national interest today necessarily encompasses a broader and more complex set of considerations than it did in the past As a general principle, the United States seeks to promote its national interest while it simultaneously pursues what the CSIS Commission on Smart Power called in its November 2007 report the &quot;global good.&quot;3 This approach is not always practical or achievable, of course. But neither is it pure benevolence. Instead, a strategic pursuit of the global good accrues concrete benefits for the United States (and others) in the form of building confidence, legitimacy, and political influence in key countries and regions around the world in ways that enable the United States to better confront global and transnational challenges. In short, the global good comprises those things that all people and governments want but have traditionally not been able to attain in the absence of U.S. leadership. Despite historical, cultural, and political differences between the United States and China, Beijing's newfound ability, owing to its recent economic successes, to contribute to the global good is a matter for common ground between the two countries. Today there is increasing recognition that no major global challenge can be addressed effectively, much less resolved, without the active engagement of—and cooperation between—the United States and China. The United States and China—the worlds first- and third-largest economies—are inextricably linked, a fact made ever more evident in the midst of the current global financial crisis. Weak demand in both the United States and China, previously the twin engines of global growth, has contributed to the global economic downturn and threatens to ignite simmering trade tensions between the two countries. Nowhere is the interconnectedness of the United States and China more clear than in international finance. China has $2 trillion worth of largely U.S. dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves and is the world's largest holder—by far—of U.S. government debt. Former treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson and others have suggested that the structural imbalances created by this dynamic fueled the current economic crisis. Yet. China will almost certainly be called on to purchase the lion's share of new U.S. debt instruments issued in connection with the U.S. stimulus and recovery package. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's February 23.2009, reassurance to Beijing that U.S. markets remain safe and her call for continued Chinese investment in the U.S. bond market as a means to help both countries, and the world, emerge from global recession underscored the shared interest—and central role—that both countries have in turning around the global economy quickly. Although China's considerable holdings of U.S. debt have been seen as a troubling problem, they are now being perceived as a necessary part of a global solution. Similarly, as the worlds two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and the United States share not only the collateral damage of energy-inefficient economic growth, but a primary responsibility to shape any ultimate global solutions to climate change. To date, cooperation has been elusive, owing as much to Washington's reluctance as to Beijing's intransigence. Painting China as the environmental bogeyman as an excuse for foot-dragging in policymaking is no longer an option; for its part, China, as the world's top polluter, must cease playing the developing-economy card. Yet energy security and climate change remain an area of genuine opportunity for joint achievement. Indeed, U.S.-China cooperation in this field is a sine qua non of any response to the energy and climate challenges. The sheer size of the Chinese economy means that collaboration with the United States could set the de facto global standards for etficiency and emissions in key economic sectors such as industry and transportation. Climate change also provides an area for cooperation in previously uncharted policy waters, as in emerging Arctic navigational and energy exploration opportunities. Washington and Beijing also share a deep and urgent interest in international peace and stability. The resumption of U.S.-China military contacts is a positive development. As two nuclear powers with worldwide economic and strategic interests, both countries want to minimize instability and enhance maritime security, as seen by parallel antipiracy missions in the waters otT Somalia. Joint efforts in support of United Nations peacekeeping, nonproliferation, and counterterrorism offer critical areas for bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Certainly, regional and global security institutions such as the Six-Party Talks concerning North Korea or the UN Security Council require the active engagement of both Washington and Beijing. Even more broadly, crisis management in geographic regions of mutual strategic interest like the Korean peninsula, Iran, or Burma require much more Sino-U.S. communication if the two countries are to avoid miscalculation and maximize opportunities to minimize human sutfering. Increasing the number of mid-level military-to-military exchanges would help in this regard. The United States and China could do more to cooperate on law enforcement to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in Western China. Afghanistan is competing with Burma as the main provider of narcotics to China; Washington could use its influence with the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul to develop a joint antinarcotics program. This could potentially build networks and joint capabilities that might be useful for U.S.-China cooperation on the issue of Pakistan. In addition, Washington should also encourage NATO-China cooperation along the Afghan border. Collaborating under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) might provide an additional framework for Beijing and Washington to address Central Asian security issues in a cooperative manner. 1he SCO, which includes Pakistan as an observer and will convene a multinational conference on Afghanistan in March 2009, has long made curbing narcoterrorism in Afghanistan a priority. In addition, the VS. Drug Enforcement Agency and the Chinese Anti-Narcotics Bureau should expand cooperation on interdiction and prosecution of heroin and meth traffickers. To be sure, there are a number of areas of serious divergence between Washington and Beijing. This should surprise no one. The United States has disagreements with even its allies. Two large powers with vastly dilferent histories, cultures, and political systems are bound to have challenges. History has shown, however, that the most effective way of addressing issues is for the U.S. and Chinese governments to engage in quiet diplomacy rather than public recrimination. In the U.S.-China context, there is often little to be gained—and much to be lost in terms of trust and respect—by a polarizing debate. Any differences, moreover, must not necessarily impede Sino-U.S. cooperation when both sides share strong mutual interests. I;. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that &quot;the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.&quot;3 Effective policy toward China by the United States, and vice versa, will require this kind of dual-minded intelligence. Moreover, working together on areas of mutual and global interest will help promote strategic trust between China and the United States, facilitating possible cooperation in other areas. Even limited cooperation on specific areas will help construct additional mechanisms for bilateral communication on issues of irreconcilable disagreement. In fact, many of the toughest challenges in U.S.-China relations in recent years have been the result of unforeseen events, such as the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999 and the EP-3 reconnaissance plane collision in April 2001. Building trust and finding workable solutions to tough problems is the premise behind the Obama administrations foreign policy of smart power, as articulated by Secretary of State Clinton. Smart power is based on, as Secretary Clinton outlined in her confirmation hearing, the fundamental belief that 'We must use... the full range of tools at our disposal—diplomatic, economic, military, political and cultural—picking the right tool, or combination of tools, for each situation.&quot;' As the CS1S Commission on Smart Power noted in November 2007, &quot;Smart Power is neither hard nor soft—it is the skillful combination of bothIt is an approach that underscores the necessity of a strong military, but also invests heavily in alliances, partnerships and institutions at all levels... .°5 As such, smart power necessarily mandates a major investment in a U.S.-China partnership on key issues. 'The concept enjoys broad support among the Chinese and American people and, by promoting the global good, it reaps concrete results around the world. There should be no expectation that Washington and Beijing will or should agree on all, or even most, questions. But the American and Chinese people should expect their leaders to come together on those vital issues that require their cooperation. U.S.-China partnership, though not inevitable, is indispensable. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Opportunities for collaboration in fighting climate change are plentiful, but moving forward at the scale needed will require high-level political support in two very different societies, each with considerable suspicion of the other. This report recommends ways to win such support and sustain it for the long term. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Chapter 1 of the report provides a primer on two topics: climate change and U.S.-China relations. It describes the climate change threat, concluding that every year of delay in responding to it puts both countries—and the planet—at greater risk. Because the United States and China are the world’s top two greenhouse gas emitters, together accounting for more than 40% of annual emissions, any solution requires both countries to transition to low-carbon economies. U.S.-China cooperation on climate change would have not only bilateral but global benefits. </span><br />

&quot;Copenhagen 2&quot; will not only have to navigate this complicated terrain, but it must do so in less than five years. The climate bomb is ticking, and there is a palpable sense of urgency among policymakers. For, as the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has explicitly warned, if emissions do not fall before 2015, and only fall from then onward (and the overall trend is that they have been rising), we will reach the point of no return.<br />
At that point, the Armageddon scenarios of droughts, rising sea levels, floods, energy and resource wars and mass migration will become a reality. Just think of the images of recent storms and floods in the Philippines and Vietnam that displaced and killed thousands, and multiply those horrors manifold. That is what we are up against.<br />
Climate change negotiations are arguably the most important of our lifetime, because their outcome will determine the fate of our planet. It is essential that they take place within structures and frameworks that encourage agreement by putting other major multilateral issues up for discussion.<br />

<span style="font-size: 13.2px;"><strong>Case is a gateway to the alt—can’t affirm suffering if you’re dead—Nietzsche’s doesn’t assume nuclear weapons</strong></span><br />

<u>The Nietzschean</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> conception of a </span><u>few who overcome resentment</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> above politics while the rest remain stuck in the muck of resentment in politics </span><u>is not today viable on its own</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> terms. Today circumstances require that many give the sign of the overman a presence in themselves and in the ethicopolitical orientations they project onto the life of the whole. But this break with the spirit of Nietzsche requires further elucidation. The shift results partly from </span><u>the</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> late-</span><u>modern possibility of human</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> self-</span><u>extinction</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.

But the entanglement of each with the other in sociopolitical relations means, when the logic of this entanglement is worked out, that the &quot;</span><u>overman</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">&quot; as a type </span><u>cannot eliminate from its life</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> some of the modalities definitive of </span><u>the &quot;human</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.&quot; If the overman was ever projected as a distinct type—and this is not certain—it now becomes refigured into a struggle within the self between the inclination to existential resentment and an affirmation of life that rises above this tendency. </span><br />

<br />
<u>Nietzsche exhorts us to live beautifully</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">; on this point, Nehamas and I agree. A second point of our agreement is in at­tributing to Nietzsche an insistence that the </span><u>assessment of</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> a specific </span><u>life's beauty is</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> a matter, primarily, </span><u>for the individual living that life</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. [Continued] </span><u>A post-moral world</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">, one wherein the minotaur was silenced, </span><u>would be one in which each</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of us </span><u>could determine his or her own good</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">; that would have to be a world within which diversity would be encouraged rather than inhibited. But that, it might seem, would entail a new form of moral dog­matism, one with the paradoxical form, &quot;the good for all is that there be no 'good for all'&quot;? How could Nietzsche defend such a perspective, or such affirmation, as one appropriate for everyone? How could Nietzsche defend any general position at all? With this question, I turn to what I take to be the dan­gerous part of Nehamas's response to the problem of immoralism. The problem emerges, for Nehamas, through the question, what is a bad life, if life is literature? Must we not respond, the only bad life is a boring life, a life that doesn't make a good story? Are we then to denounce or condemn the couch potato, but not the mass murderer or the child molester? At times, Nehamas seems to point us in this direction. Insisting that Nietzsche's perspec­tivism &quot;forbids any general evaluation [of life], positive or negative,&quot; Nehamas argues: What Nietzsche eventually comes to attack directly is not any par­ticular judgment but the very tendency to make general judgments about the value of life in itself, as if there were such a single thing with a character of its own, capable of being praised or blamed by some uniform standard. [...] </span><u>Life itself has no value, but the life</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of an individual or a group </span><u>has as great a value as that individual</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> or group </span><u>can give it</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> . Some lives are mean or hor­rible, others magnificent. Life's value depends on what one makes of it, and this is a further sense in which Nietzsche believes that value is created and not discovered. (135) This conclusion, which follows from the forbidding of any general evaluation of life, is, it seems to me, as dangerous in its implications as any of Nietzsche's &quot;words of war,&quot; any of his &quot;thunder and fireworks.&quot; If &quot;life itself has no value,&quot; and if &quot;some lives are mean and horrible,&quot; then those who strive to live beautifully need take no account of those whose lives they deem, on whatever basis, to be ugly. &quot;Some lives,&quot; Nehamas tells us, &quot;are mean or horrible.&quot; I agree, but only if we read Nehamas as asserting that some lives have been mean or horrible. This correction is vital, for no life can be simply &quot;mean or horrible&quot; until it is over. The life that appears, as it develops, to be simply &quot;mean or horrible&quot; may be a life whose beauty has not yet emerged. As Nietzsche notes in what he calls &quot;a parable,&quot; &quot;Not every end is a goal. A melody's end is not its goal; nevertheless, so long as the melody has not reached its end, it also has not reached its goal&quot; (HHII:WS:204). Perhaps Nehamas is right in asserting that Nietzsche's perspectivism &quot;forbids any general evaluation [of life], positive or negative&quot;; yet, I have argued, Nietzsche attempts to develop a &quot;general&quot; perspective of life, he attempts to see life as it really is. The lenses of art are not the only lenses we need; Nietzsche exhorts us to view art through the lenses of life. One of the things we see through the lenses of life is that no final evaluation of a life can be made until, at least, the life is over. To say that a life still underway is simply &quot;mean and horrible&quot; is not to express a justifiable opinion, it is to judge prematurely. Nietzsche's parable, which presents life as melody rather than as literature, provides a basis for rejecting the inhumanity seemingly licensed by the simple classification of some lives as &quot;mean or horrible&quot;; yet it may intensify the problem that led to that classification, for it may also seem to provide further sup­port for the claim that the life of the child molester or serial murderer can be a life that is beautiful. Even if we agree that child molestation is simply ugly, does it follow that a life that has included child molestation must be ugly? That there can be no objection to the execution of the child molester? A different way to put the question is this: can suicide be noble? Would the life of the pale criminal attain its highest beauty if the pale criminal were to kill himself? Granting that nothing the pale criminal may do following his crime will suffice to make his life, as a whole, one to be emulated -- one cannot , I think, will to commit a crime for the sole purpose of then being able to overcome that crime -- we must also recognize that the question that faces the pale criminal himself is not, &quot;would I want others to act as I have acted?&quot; Nor is his question the one posed by Nehamas, i.e., &quot;would I want to do the same things all over again?&quot; His question, rather, is, </span><u>what</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> now ? What is to be the significance of this murder, which I myself deem repellent, within my life as it continues to develop? Is this calamity to destroy me, or rather, perhaps, to be the basis for my transforma­tion? We approximate the situation the pale criminal is in if we ask ourselves whether we might think better of him, perhaps even be inspired by him, </span><u>if, instead of committing suicide, he were to</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> seek to </span><u>help others</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> to learn from his example. Phrasing the question in terms of suicide indicates that the earlier formulation is too simple. Just as accounts are neither simply true nor simply false, lives are neither simply beautiful or noble nor simply ugly or base. Lives are more or less beauti­ful, and </span><u>as long as</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> any </span><u>life continues, it can</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, in principle, </span><u>con­tinue to transform</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the initial </span><u>ugliness</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, if there be such, of its past. </span><br />

<strong>Nietzsche forces consequentialism—only life has intrinsic value</strong><br />
<strong>Hales 95</strong> (Steven, “Was Nietzsche a Consequentialist?,” <em>International Studies in Philosophy</em> 27.3, AG)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Yet, there is a strong textual case to be made for the claim that </span><u>Nietzsche considered life to have intrinsic value</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Consider what he says at TI IX 35: &quot;[T]he moral lie in the mouth of the decadent says: `nothing is worth anything life is not worth anything'. Here Nietzsche claims that it is decadents who deny the value of life, and that to do so constitutes a moral lie. This clearly implies that life is valuable, or has value. In fact, Nietzsche's entire treatment of decadence is a useful signpost here—he defines decadence in terms of activities and emotions harmful to life (cf. TI 35, 37; AC 30, 50; WP 4044, 153, 180, 268, 423, 435), and he consistently derides decadence as immoral. Moreover, GS 301 can be read in such a way that it is consistent with this view. There </span><u>Nietzsche claims that nothing in &quot;our world&quot; has intrin­sic value, and that the only kind of value is the value that humans assign for</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the purposes of satisfying </span><u>their own interests. The world of value is anthropocentric</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, and we stand at the center of valuations, providing the grounding of intrinsic value that allows other acts and objects to be instrumentally valuable. The instrumental value of non-human objects stems from the relations they hear to humans and their interests. One lesson to be taken away from GS 301 is that </span><u>if anything has intrinsic value</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, then the only thing </span><u>that</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> does so </span><u>is life</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. If we agree that what </span><u>Nietzsche offers</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> us is essentially </span><u>a con­sequentialist view</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, complete with an account of intrinsic and instrumental value, something must be said about his frequent attacks on utilitarian­ism. These criticisms constitute at least a prima facie challenge to the interpretation offered.

Nietzsche does not jettison proof theory, e.g., even while he abhors semantics that posit domains of non-fictional entities.&quot; It is an all-too-easy error to assimilate his rejection of extant semantics to a rejection of logic altogether. Likewise, </span><u>Nietzsche's complaint against utilitarianism is</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">not so much a gripe about the struc­ture of the theory as it is one </span><u>about hedonism</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Only the English strive after happiness, he tells us in TI I 12, and he considers hedonism to be a typical example of decadence (AC 30). The utilitarian dichotomy between pleasure and pain is too simplistic for Nietzsche, and </span><u>the idea that all people work towards their happiness too simple-minded.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> He says quite explicitly, &quot;man does not seek pleasure and does not avoid displeasure: one will realize which famous prejudice I am contradicting&quot;' (WP 702, Nietzsche's italics).

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Jonathan Tepperman’s article in the September 7, 2009 issue of Newsweek, “Why Obama Should Learn to Love the Bomb,” provides a novel but frivolous argument that nuclear weapons “may not, in fact, make the world more dangerous….” Rather, in Tepperman’s world, “The bomb may actually make us safer.” Tepperman shares this world with Kenneth Waltz, a University of California professor emeritus of political science, who Tepperman describes as “the leading ‘nuclear optimist.’” Waltz expresses his optimism in this way: “We’ve now had 64 years of experience since Hiroshima. It’s striking and against all historical precedent that for that substantial period, there has not been any war among nuclear states.” Actually, there were a number of proxy wars between nuclear weapons states, such as those in Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan, and some near disasters, the most notable being the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Waltz’s logic is akin to observing a man falling from a high rise building, and noting that he had already fallen for 64 floors without anything bad happening to him, and concluding that so far it looked so good that others should try it. Dangerous logic! Tepperman builds upon Waltz’s logic, and concludes “that all states are rational,” even though their leaders may have a lot of bad qualities, including being “stupid, petty, venal, even evil….” He asks us to trust that rationality will always prevail when there is a risk of nuclear retaliation, because these weapons make “the costs of war obvious, inevitable, and unacceptable.” Actually, he is asking us to do more than trust in the rationality of leaders; he is asking us to gamble the future on this proposition. “The iron logic of deterrence and mutually assured destruction is so compelling,” Tepperman argues, “it’s led to what’s known as the nuclear peace….” But if this is a peace worthy of the name, which it isn’t, it certainly is not one on which to risk the future of civilization. One irrational leader with control over a nuclear arsenal could start a nuclear conflagration, resulting in a global Hiroshima. Tepperman celebrates “the iron logic of deterrence,” but deterrence is a theory that is far from rooted in “iron logic.” It is a theory based upon threats that must be effectively communicated and believed. Leaders of Country A with nuclear weapons must communicate to other countries (B, C, etc.) the conditions under which A will retaliate with nuclear weapons. The leaders of the other countries must understand and believe the threat from Country A will, in fact, be carried out. The longer that nuclear weapons are not used, the more other countries may come to believe that they can challenge Country A with impunity from nuclear retaliation. The more that Country A bullies other countries, the greater the incentive for these countries to develop their own nuclear arsenals. Deterrence is unstable and therefore precarious. Most of the countries in the world reject the argument, made most prominently by Kenneth Waltz, that the spread of nuclear weapons makes the world safer. These countries joined together in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, but they never agreed to maintain indefinitely a system of nuclear apartheid in which some states possess nuclear weapons and others are prohibited from doing so. The principal bargain of the NPT requires the five NPT nuclear weapons states (US, Russia, UK, France and China) to engage in good faith negotiations for nuclear disarmament, and the International Court of Justice interpreted this to mean complete nuclear disarmament in all its aspects. Tepperman seems to be arguing that seeking to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is bad policy, and that nuclear weapons, because of their threat, make efforts at non-proliferation unnecessary and even unwise. If some additional states, including Iran, developed nuclear arsenals, he concludes that wouldn’t be so bad “given the way that bombs tend to mellow behavior.” Those who oppose Tepperman’s favorable disposition toward the bomb, he refers to as “nuclear pessimists.” These would be the people, and I would certainly be one of them, who see nuclear weapons as presenting an urgent danger to our security, our species and our future. Tepperman finds that when viewed from his “nuclear optimist” perspective, “nuclear weapons start to seem a lot less frightening.” “Nuclear peace,” he tells us, “rests on a scary bargain: you accept a small chance that something extremely bad will happen in exchange for a much bigger chance that something very bad – conventional war – won’t happen.” But the “extremely bad” thing he asks us to accept is the end of the human species. Yes, that would be serious. He also doesn’t make the case that in a world without nuclear weapons, the prospects of conventional war would increase dramatically. After all, it is only an unproven supposition that nuclear weapons have prevented wars, or would do so in the future. We have certainly come far too close to the precipice of catastrophic nuclear war. As an ultimate celebration of the faulty logic of deterrence, Tepperman calls for providing any nuclear weapons state with a “survivable second strike option.” Thus, he not only favors nuclear weapons, but finds the security of these weapons to trump human security. Presumably he would have President Obama providing new and secure nuclear weapons to North Korea, Pakistan and any other nuclear weapons states that come along so that they will feel secure enough not to use their weapons in a first-strike attack. Do we really want to bet the human future that Kim Jong-Il and his successors are more rational than Mr. Tepperman?</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Nuclear weapons today present tremendous dangers but also a historic opportunity. U.S. leadership will be required to take the world to the next stage—to a solid consensus for reversing reliance on nuclear weapons globally as a vital contribution to preventing their proliferation into potentially dangerous hands, and ultimately ending them as a threat to the world. Nuclear weapons were essential to maintaining international security during the Cold War because they were a means of deterrence. The end of the Cold War made the doctrine of mutual Soviet-American deterrence obsolete. Deterrence continues to be a relevant consideration for many states with regard to threats from other states. But reliance on nuclear weapons for this purpose is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective. North Korea’s recent nuclear test and Iran’s refusal to stop its program to enrich uranium—potentially to weapons grade—highlight the fact that the world is now on the precipice of a new and dangerous nuclear era. Most alarming, the likelihood that nonstate terrorists will get their hands on nuclear weaponry is increasing. In today’s war waged on world order by terrorists, nuclear weapons are the ultimate means of mass devastation. And nonstate terrorist groups with nuclear weapons are conceptually outside the bounds of a deterrent strategy and present difficult new security challenges. Apart from the terrorist threat, unless urgent new actions are taken, the United States soon will be compelled to enter a new nuclear era that will be more precarious, psychologically disorienting, and economically costly than Cold War deterrence. It is far from certain that we can successfully replicate the old Soviet-American “mutually assured destruction” with an increasing number of potential nuclear enemies worldwide without dramatically increasing the risk that nuclear weapons will be used. New nuclear states do not have the benefit of years of step-by-step safeguards put in effect during the Cold War to prevent nuclear accidents, misjudgments, or unauthorized launches. The United States and the Soviet Union learned from mistakes that were less than fatal. Both countries were diligent to ensure that no nuclear weapon was used during the Cold War by design or by accident. Will new nuclear nations and the world be as fortunate in the next 50 years as we were during the Cold War?</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The assumption of the Cold War deterrence framework, that deterrence will “work” in the context of secure and severe mutual threats because decision-making will be well-informed, dispassionate, and rational cum reasonable, ignores or discounts the variety of factors illustrated above. A comparison of the Cold War deterrence framework with the incredibly broad spectrum of human motivations, goals, thought and values highlights the point that this framework cannot capture the reality of human decision-making. As a result, it is inadequate at best, and potentially grossly misleading. The introduction of nuclear weapons to the mix of factors operating does not “ﬁx” this problem. The tremendous lethality of nuclear weapons may usefully focus leadership attention on occasion. Even very lethal threats, however, cannot bring to an end the enormous capacity of leaders to have poor judgment, impaired rationality, to pursue “unreasonable” goals and embrace unreasonable values, to be ignorant, passionate, foolish, arrogant, or selectively attentive to risks and costs, and to base their actions on severely distorted perceptions of reality. As much as we might wish it not to be so, these factors play to some degree in virtually all crisis decision-making, and in some crises, they—not the particular character of the nuclear balance—will dominate decision-making. This conclusion ultimately calls into question conﬁdence in the Cold War deterrence framework. Even the most hard-headed practitioners of realpolitik—assuming their opponent to be driven by rational, pragmatic, predictable calculation—will be vulnerable to gross surprise if they do not recognize that rational decision-making may be shaped by surprising goals and values, and by such imponderables as belief in astrology, dreams, or an inner “voice.”</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Proliferation. Roger Molander, of RAND Corporation, asserts that “in the near future, a large number of countries are each going to develop a small number of nuclear weapons.” 50 The Union of Concerned Scientists considers this to be the greatest long term danger confronting both US and international security today. 51 Proliferation increases risk in a number of ways. First, the more states that hold nuclear weapons, the more likely it is that one will have an insufficiently mature or robust nuclear doctrine to manage its capability responsibly. Tom Sauer suggests that developing states that do not have democratic political systems present a particularly high risk because in dictatorial regimes, the military are frequently in control, and as Sagan has observed, the military appear to be more inclined to initiate preventative attacks against adversaries than civilians. 52 Second, the more widely proliferated nuclear weapons become, the more theoretical opportunities may be presented for theft of nuclear material. Third, proliferation increases the risk of nuclear intervention by an established nuclear power, including the five NWS s.Stephen Younger envisages several scenarios in which currently established nuclear powers might “feel a need” to intervene with nuclear weapons in present regional conflicts, especially if WMD are being employed or threatened. Moreover, since proliferation is frequently associated with reaction to nuclear development either within a bordering nation or regional counterpart, further proliferation is in turn likely to generate a quasi-exponential expansion of similar regional scenarios. 53 Ambassador Lehman envisages a scenario in which proliferation may induce a chain reaction of related regional arms races that could result in unintended and unexpected consequences far removed from the objectives of the proliferating nations, and in the United States’ specific case, a risk that the nation could get sucked into a conventional regional conflict which is subsequently escalated into nuclear warfare by its allies or their opponents. 54</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Despite his relative optimism that proliferation may not present the dangers that other commentators fear, Waltz can not escape the fact that the chances of an explosive accident or an unauthorized or inadvertent launch increase as the number of nuclear states increases. However, he retains his optimism, arguing against the notion that unstable and bordering states necessarily present higher risks than other nations. Ivan Oelrich contends that the real threat is not something external that needs to be countered. Rather, it is something internal that the United States is self-generating through its retention of nuclear weapons, and is worsened by maintaining high states of alert. He is particularly concerned that “we [the United States] are not looking at the risks which nuclear weapons create.”In his view, nuclear weapons are the only thing that today poses an existential threat to the United States, and the perpetuation of their existence simply prolongs that threat. Meanwhile, Barry Blechman and Cathleen Fisher view the specific dangers of nuclear accident or inadvertent use as the greatest short term threat.</span><br />

The safest route would be to cease using civilians whenever the possibility exists that their activities are integrated into combat operations, but this would prove difficult from a political standpoint. The positions affected are critical for military operations; eliminating them without replacement would mean a reduction in military capability while replacing them with military personnel would be expensive. Either choice would not be appealing to Congress or the taxpayers. n157 A less [*137] drastic approach, at least theoretically, would be to discontinue their usage temporarily while attempts are made to clarify the law (or perhaps amend the law to recognize the aforementioned quasi-combatant status), but as anyone familiar with international law knows, getting countries to agree on anything is extremely difficult.

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">US withdrawal from East Asia appears to be a distinct long-term possibility. With the collapse of Soviet power, the United States no longer faces a grave threat—the rise of a regional hegemon—to its vital security interests (Mearsheimer 2001). While a nuclear-armed North Korea and its possible link to terrorists are significant, they are neither a security threat of equivalent magnitude to a regional hegemon nor a problem that the US regional presence can readily solve. Although the regional alliances might be useful long-term assets in hedging against China's pursuit of regional hegemony, US retrenchment could better serve this purpose by inducing the regional states to increase their own military strength. South Korea's and Japan's armaments would make possible an overwhelming counter-hegemonic coalition should China threaten to dominate East Asia in the future. For these reasons, the United States will likely reduce its military presence and commitment in the region over the long haul. The Iraq quagmire and its associated expenses will play catalytic roles in such retrenchment, as the recent reduction of USFK demonstrates. China's efforts to push the United States out of East Asia and enhance its regional influence might also facilitate US strategic retreat.</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">In sixteenth-century Paris, a popular form of entertainment was cat-burning, in which a cat was hoisted in a sling on a stage and slowly lowered into a fire. According to historian Norman Davies, &quot;[T]he spectators, including kings and queens, shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized.&quot; Today, such sadism would be unthinkable in most of the world. This change in sensibilities is just one example of perhaps the most important and most underappreciated trend in the human saga: Violence has been in decline over long stretches of history, and today we are probably living in the most peaceful moment of our species' time on earth. In the decade of Darfur and Iraq, and shortly after the century of Stalin, Hitler, and Mao, the claim that violence has been diminishing may seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene. Yet recent studies that seek to quantify the historical ebb and flow of violence point to exactly that conclusion. Some of the evidence has been under our nose all along. Conventional history has long shown that, in many ways, we have been getting kinder and gentler. Cruelty as entertainment, human sacrifice to indulge superstition, slavery as a labor-saving device, conquest as the mission statement of government, genocide as a means of acquiring real estate, torture and mutilation as routine punishment, the death penalty for misdemeanors and differences of opinion, assassination as the mechanism of political succession, rape as the spoils of war, pogroms as outlets for frustration, homicide as the major form of conflict resolution—all were unexceptionable features of life for most of human history. But, today, they are rare to nonexistent in the West, far less common elsewhere than they used to be, concealed when they do occur, and widely condemned when they are brought to light. At one time, these facts were widely appreciated. They were the source of notions like progress, civilization, and man's rise from savagery and barbarism. Recently, however, those ideas have come to sound corny, even dangerous. They seem to demonize people in other times and places, license colonial conquest and other foreign adventures, and conceal the crimes of our own societies. The doctrine of the noble savage—the idea that humans are peaceable by nature and corrupted by modern institutions—pops up frequently in the writing of public intellectuals like José Ortega y Gasset (&quot;War is not an instinct but an invention&quot;), Stephen Jay Gould (&quot;Homo sapiens is not an evil or destructive species&quot;), and Ashley Montagu (&quot;Biological studies lend support to the ethic of universal brotherhood&quot;). But, now that social scientists have started to count bodies in different historical periods, they have discovered that the romantic theory gets it backward: Far from causing us to become more violent, something in modernity and its cultural institutions has made us nobler. To be sure, any attempt to document changes in violence must be soaked in uncertainty. In much of the world, the distant past was a tree falling in the forest with no one to hear it, and, even for events in the historical record, statistics are spotty until recent periods. Long-term trends can be discerned only by smoothing out zigzags and spikes of horrific bloodletting. And the choice to focus on relative rather than absolute numbers brings up the moral imponderable of whether it is worse for 50 percent of a population of 100 to be killed or 1 percent in a population of one billion. Yet, despite these caveats, a picture is taking shape. The decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon, visible at the scale of millennia, centuries, decades, and years. It applies over several orders of magnitude of violence, from genocide to war to rioting to homicide to the treatment of children and animals. And it appears to be a worldwide trend, though not a homogeneous one. The leading edge has been in Western societies, especially England and Holland, and there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the Age of Reason in the early seventeenth century. At the widest-angle view, one can see a whopping difference across the millennia that separate us from our pre-state ancestors. Contra leftist anthropologists who celebrate the noble savage, quantitative body-counts—such as the proportion of prehistoric skeletons with axemarks and embedded arrowheads or the proportion of men in a contemporary foraging tribe who die at the hands of other men—suggest that pre-state societies were far more violent than our own. It is true that raids and battles killed a tiny percentage of the numbers that die in modern warfare. But, in tribal violence, the clashes are more frequent, the percentage of men in the population who fight is greater, and the rates of death per battle are higher. According to anthropologists like Lawrence Keeley, Stephen LeBlanc, Phillip Walker, and Bruce Knauft, these factors combine to yield population-wide rates of death in tribal warfare that dwarf those of modern times. If the wars of the twentieth century had killed the same proportion of the population that die in the wars of a typical tribal society, there would have been two billion deaths, not 100 million. Political correctness from the other end of the ideological spectrum has also distorted many people's conception of violence in early civilizations—namely, those featured in the Bible. This supposed source of moral values contains many celebrations of genocide, in which the Hebrews, egged on by God, slaughter every last resident of an invaded city. The Bible also prescribes death by stoning as the penalty for a long list of nonviolent infractions, including idolatry, blasphemy, homosexuality, adultery, disrespecting one's parents, and picking up sticks on the Sabbath. The Hebrews, of course, were no more murderous than other tribes; one also finds frequent boasts of torture and genocide in the early histories of the Hindus, Christians, Muslims, and Chinese. At the century scale, it is hard to find quantitative studies of deaths in warfare spanning medieval and modern times. Several historians have suggested that there has been an increase in the number of recorded wars across the centuries to the present, but, as political scientist James Payne has noted, this may show only that &quot;the Associated Press is a more comprehensive source of information about battles around the world than were sixteenth-century monks.&quot; Social histories of the West provide evidence of numerous barbaric practices that became obsolete in the last five centuries, such as slavery, amputation, blinding, branding, flaying, disembowelment, burning at the stake, breaking on the wheel, and so on. Meanwhile, for another kind of violence—homicide—the data are abundant and striking. The criminologist Manuel Eisner has assembled hundreds of homicide estimates from Western European localities that kept records at some point between 1200 and the mid-1990s. In every country he analyzed, murder rates declined steeply—for example, from 24 homicides per 100,000 Englishmen in the fourteenth century to 0.6 per 100,000 by the early 1960s. On the scale of decades, comprehensive data again paint a shockingly happy picture: Global violence has fallen steadily since the middle of the twentieth century. According to the Human Security Brief 2006, the number of battle deaths in interstate wars has declined from more than 65,000 per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 per year in this decade. In Western Europe and the Americas, the second half of the century saw a steep decline in the number of wars, military coups, and deadly ethnic riots. Zooming in by a further power of ten exposes yet another reduction. After the cold war, every part of the world saw a steep drop-off in state-based conflicts, and those that do occur are more likely to end in negotiated settlements rather than being fought to the bitter end. Meanwhile, according to political scientist Barbara Harff, between 1989 and 2005 the number of campaigns of mass killing of civilians decreased by 90 percent.</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Leftist American culture critics might put their considerable talents to better use if they bury some of their cynicism about America's social and political prospects and help forge public and political possibilities in a spirit of determination to, indeed, achieve our country - the country of Jefferson and King; the country of John Dewey and Malcom X; the country of Franklin Roosevelt and Bayard Rustin, and of the later George Wallace and the later Barry Goldwater. To invoke the words of King, and with reference to the American society, the time is always ripe to seize the opportunity to help create the &quot;beloved community,&quot; one woven with the thread of agape into a conceptually single yet diverse tapestry that shoots for nothing less than a true intra-American cosmopolitan ethos, one wherein both same sex unions and faith-based initiatives will be able to be part of the same social reality, one wherein business interests and the university are not seen as belonging to two separate galaxies but as part of the same answer to the threat of social and ethical nihilism. We who fancy ourselves philosophers would do well to create from within ourselves and from within our ranks a new kind of public intellectual who has both a hungry theoretical mind and who is yet capable of seeing the need to move past high theory to other important questions that are less bedazzling and &quot;interesting&quot; but more important to the prospect of our flourishing - questions such as &quot;How is it possible to develop a citizenry that cherishes a certain hexis, one which prizes the character of the Samaritan on the road to Jericho almost more than any other?&quot; or &quot;How can we square the political dogma that undergirds the fantasy of a missile defense system with the need to treat America as but one member in a community of nations under a &quot;law of peoples?&quot;</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The new public philosopher might seek to understand labor law and military and trade theory and doctrine as much as theories of surplus value; the logic of international markets and trade agreements as much as critiques of commodification, and the politics of complexity as much as the politics of power (all of which can still be done from our arm chairs.) This means going down deep into the guts of our quotidian social institutions, into the grimy pragmatic details where intellectuals are loathe to dwell but where the officers and bureaucrats of those institutions take difficult and often unpleasant, imperfect decisions that affect other peoples' lives, and it means making honest attempts to truly understand how those institutions actually function in the actual world before howling for their overthrow commences. This might help keep us from being slapped down in debates by true policy pros who actually know what they are talking about but who lack awareness of the dogmatic assumptions from which they proceed, and who have not yet found a good reason to listen to jargon-riddled lectures from philosophers and culture critics with their snobish disrespect for the so-called &quot;managerial class.&quot;</span><br />

According to EPA, these changes were collectively designed to minimize the transaction costs associated with NSR and to increase [*367] industry incentives to undertake pollution-minimizing projects. n97 EPA claimed that the changes would lower or maintain overall emissions levels across the affected industrial sources. n98 However, while the new rules may achieve these goals, they do so at the expense of the greater emissions reductions possible under traditional new source review. 1. Revised calculation methodologies for baseline emissions and <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">actual-to-future emissions</span>. Under new source review, facilities must estimate their baseline emissions prior to any addition or modification, to determine whether the projected emissions increase will be &quot;significant&quot; enough to trigger NSR's technology requirements. n99 Under the original rules for non-utility sources, baseline emissions were calculated by measuring the average emissions rate for the two years prior to the proposed modification. n100 The new rules, however, allow non-utility facilities to use the emissions levels from any consecutive twenty-four month period in its past decade of operation. n101 In cases where emissions have declined over the most recent twenty-four months, these facilities will be able to establish higher baselines under the new rules. This change narrows the gap between baseline and projected emissions and reduces the likelihood that the increase will be deemed &quot;significant&quot; enough to trigger NSR. EPA argues that the change simply ensures that facilities whose emissions decreased in the two years prior to a potential project will not be unfairly &quot;penalized&quot; in the NSR process, and improves these facilities' incentives to upgrade and modernize their plants. n102 In addition to revising EPA's calculation methodology for baseline emissions, the 2002 rules revise the methodology for future emissions - again, so as to decrease the likelihood of triggering new source review. Under the old rules, future emissions were calculated by examining the unit's &quot;potential to emit.&quot; This was defined as the &quot;maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit a [*368] pollutant under its physical and operational design.&quot; n103 Under the new rules, a facility may use projected actual emissions for any one of the next five to ten years (the range depends on the specific change proposed), even if the plant is expected to operate at less than its maximum capacity in the chosen year. n104 Under the new rules, therefore, facilities can avoid triggering NSR, as long as during at least one year in the prescribed period they will have predicted emissions low enough to appear insignificant, relative to the baseline. <br />

Under a security agreement between Washington and Baghdad, all American troops are to leave Iraq by the end of the year. However, Iraq’s top military commander has said U.S. troops should stay until Iraq’s security forces can defend its borders — which he said could take until 2020. But al-Maliki, pressured by hardline Shiite Muslims, has signaled he wants American troops to leave on schedule. Last weekend, the influential and anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr returned to Iraq after nearly four years of exile, in part to insist that the U.S. “occupiers” must leave on time or face retribution among his followers “by all the means of resistance.” Al-Sadr, who headed one of Iraq’s Shiite militias blamed for deadly attacks on U.S. troops, met Wednesday with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in Najaf, one of Iraq’s holiest Shiite cities, in a step to gain credibility among the nation’s clerics and in its political circles. Aides to both men refused to discuss details of their evening meeting. Both Washington and Baghdad refused to discuss publicly any possibility of U.S. troops staying until after Iraq installed its new government. Moreover, the Obama administration has maintained it would leave on time unless Iraq’s officials asked the U.S. to reconsider the security agreement and allow at least some troops to stay. <br />

The Central Intelligence Agency <br />
( CIA ) is a civilian intelligence agency of the United States government. Its primary function is collecting and analyzing information about foreign governments, corporations, and persons in order to advise public policymakers. Prior to December 2004, the CIA was literally the central intelligence organization for the US government. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 created the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), who took over some of the government and intelligence community (IC)-wide function that had previously been under the CIA. The DNI manages the United States Intelligence Community and in so doing it manages the intelligence cycle. Among the functions that moved to the DNI were the preparation of estimates reflecting the consolidated opinion of the 16 IC agencies, and preparation of briefings for the President. On July 30, 2008, President Bush issued Executive Order 13470 amending Executive Order 12333 to strengthen the role of the DNI.<br />

<strong>they kill topic education</strong><br />
<strong>Till 6 –</strong> Professor of Maritime Studies in the Defence Studies Department of King's College (Geoffrey, The development of British naval thinking: essays in memory of Bryan McLaren Ranft, p. 130) <br />
<br />
Accordingly, the aim of professional military education was to correct such dysfunctional practices by encouraging the development of the joint approach. In this, professional educators would be serving strategic, operational and, indirectly, even tactical purposes. Richmond’s aim was to help develop what we would now call ‘jointery’, specifically by encouraging naval officers to think about their interrelationship with their Army and RAF colleagues. Naval strategy needed to be thought of as an essential but contributory part of general strategy: We all, of all three services, worked in the most complete harmony at the college. We were too busy seeking to understand each other’s needs, to find ways by which we could combine our efforts, to descend to petty squabbles about the greater or lesser importance of our respective services. These early indications of a developing interest in ‘joint’ rather than simply naval thinking were of course built on foundations laid by Corbett and Callwell before the war. But all three service chiefs were still wary of the IDC and everything it stood for, partly because they thought it might well encourage the creation of institutions, procedures and personnel that could in due course undermine their own service authority. In this, they were, of course, quite right. There were also some misgivings amongst the thinkers about how far this could safely go. Aston, one of the first, as we have seen, to fold airpower within a joint strategy, very much approved of the fact that the services were now much more familiar with each other’s work: ‘Army officers are constantly to be met with in his Majesty’s ships all over the world…and naval officers see a good deal of the field training of troops. All of this is very much to the good’. But he was concerned by the increasingly common usage of the word ‘military’ to encompass all the services: ‘This practice is objectionable, as it leads constantly to serious misunderstandings. As naval conditions transcend all others in importance to those interested in our security, it is desirable that this wide use of the term “military”, swallowing the word “naval” into its maw, should be noticed by a public accustomed to use the word in its narrower sense in conversation’. In effect, the worry was that ‘joint’ could all too easily become ‘insufficiently naval’. <br />

<strong>U.S. deterrence in Asia is high—China <u>perceives</u> U.S. superiority</strong><br />

<br />
Alarmists are convinced the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates is losing ground around the world. Two critical regions make them particularly anxious: Asia and the Middle East, where American power is challenged by <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">big competitors</span> and small rogue states. Both regions are also home to opaque nuclear programs and anti-American regimes; North Korea possesses nuclear warheads, while Iran most likely wants the same. Worse yet, America’s position is compromised by military and economic challenges, as it concludes two major wars and struggles to recover from a fierce recession. <br />
If the triple threat of China, North Korea, and Iran remains unchecked – as some claim it might– <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">it would be news to these countries</span> and their capitals. The US responded to each challenge <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">symbolically</span> and <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">substantively</span> in 2010. In some cases, it explicitly declared its intent while in others, it pursued bold action and empowerment measures. The return of American muscle is a reminder that no power can project force like the US and no country enjoys the multitude of friends who share its strategic vision (e.g. hemming in China, countering Iran, isolating North Korea). Any swan song is premature. <br />
This year’s warning shots were fired loudest in Asia, where the US and South Korea held a series of massive war games following North Korea’s alleged attack on a South Korean vessel in March. By July, thousands of Americans and South Koreans were mobilized for anti-submarine drills and joint maneuvers off the coast of North Korea – a combined effort that left no doubts about American resolve in Asia. &quot;These defensive, combined exercises are designed to send a clear message to North Korea that its aggressive behavior must stop, and that we are committed to together enhancing our combined defensive capabilities,&quot; read a July statement from US Defense Secretary Robert Gates. <br />
North Korea is not the only target of American posturing. The US’s expansive role in Asian waters is raising alarms in Beijing as well. US and Japanese navies are scheduled for drills off the coast of Okinawa in December. Last month, US and South Korean forces launched joint exercises in the Yellow Sea – water considered vital to China. And in August, the US staged joint maneuvers in the South China Sea with Vietnam, a country whose territorial claims frequently clash with the People’s Republic. <br />
The frequency of these drills is a direct consequence of renewed fears among China’s neighbors. China’s maritime assertiveness – specifically its claims to regional waters and recent deployments of advanced submarines and destroyers – has given new urgency to American primacy in Asia. As The Economist noted in August, “Absent without leave, America helped foster an overblown perception in the region of America’s decline and China’s ascent. It is now putting that right,” with high-profile displays of power and solidarity. <br />
Regional fears are also allowing the US to strengthen its position in the Persian Gulf, where Iran’s ambitions are creating consensus. This year has been punctuated by significant arms deals between the US and states like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. Although the $60 billion deal with Saudi Arabia received the most attention, Kuwait and the UAE are both expecting deliveries of sophisticated anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems soon, thus offsetting the threat posed by Iranian warheads. <br />
Not surprisingly, Qatar and Bahrain are both abstaining from the American-sponsored arms race, and with good reason: both maintain sizable US bases that already protect them from Iranian aggression. In May, the US broke ground in Bahrain for the purposes of doubling the size of its naval base there, which is situated directly across the Persian Gulf from Iran. This combination of new weapons systems and anti-missile technology ensures a more hostile environment for Iran, one in which its threats are cheapened and American allies are immune to intimidation. <br />
By empowering friendly states and flexing American muscle in the form of joint drills and deployments, the US is dispelling the myth that the world’s only superpower is neither super nor powerful. The Beltway is momentarily full of pessimists but America’s profile in Beijing, Riyadh, Seoul, Tehran, and Pyongyang is consequential like no other. Critical US allies are enjoying new resources and priority, while challengers to the American order suffer from isolation (North Korea), the threat of overwhelming force (Iran), and territorial push-back (China). <br />
<br />
<strong>Presence in Okinawa is key to ensure a peaceful Chinese rise</strong><br />
<strong>Bush 10</strong>—senior fellow in the Foreign Policy program at The Brookings Institution, director of Brookings’s Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, served for nineteen years in the U.S. Government, in the Congress, the intelligence community, and as chairman and managing director of the American Institute in Taiwan (Richard C., 10 March 2010, “Okinawa and Security in East Asia,” <span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4827:http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2010/0310_japan_politics_bush.aspx --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2010/0310_japan_politics_bush.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2010/0310_japan_politics_bush.aspx</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4827 --></span>, RBatra) <br />
<br />
The threat environment in Northeast Asia is not benign. North Korea’s WMD capabilities are a matter of concern but will hopefully be a medium-term problem. More attention, however, is focused on China which has gradually developed a full spectrum of capabilities, including nuclear weapons. Their current emphasis is on power projection and their immediate goal is to create a strategic buffer in at least the first island chain. Although Taiwan is the driver for these efforts, they affect Japan. Of course, capabilities are not intentions. However, how will Japan feel as the conventional U.S.-China balance deteriorates and a new equilibrium is reached, especially knowing that China has nuclear weapons? There are also specific points of friction within Northeast Asia such as the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, the East China Sea, North Korea, and Taiwan, some of which involve and concern more than one government. Although we can hope that China will not seek to dominate East Asia at the U.S. and Japan’s expense, we can’t be sure of their intentions either. Hope is not a policy. <br />
The most sensible strategy—for both the U.S. and Japan—is to try to shape China’s intentions over time so that they move in a benign direction; so that it has more to gain from cooperation than a challenge. This has been the U.S. and Japan’s strategy since the early 1970s. The strategy has a good foundation in economic interdependence. However, it is easier said than done and is one of the biggest challenges of this century. The strategy requires at least two elements: engaging and incorporating China as much as possible, and maintaining the strength and willingness to define limits. This combination of elements is important because engagement without strength would lead China to exploit our good will while strength without engagement would lead China to suspect that our intentions are not benign. <br />
If engagement-plus-strength is the proper strategy for the U.S. and Japan each to cope with a rising China, it only makes sense that Japan and the United States will be more effective if they work together, complementing each other’s respective abilities. The strength side of this equation almost requires Japan to rely on the alliance since history suggests that it will not build up sufficiently on its own. An important part of strength is positioning your power in the right places. That is why forward deployment of U.S. forces in Japan has always been important. <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">That is why our presence on Okinawa is important. </span><br />

<strong>The impact is collapses hegemony, causes allied prolif and nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Goh 8</strong> – Lecturer in International Relations in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the Univ of Oxford (Evelyn, International Relations of the Asia-Pacific, “Hierarchy and the role of the United States in the East Asian security order,” 2008 8(3):353-377, Oxford Journals Database, JMP) <br />
<br />
The centrality of these mutual processes of assurance and deference means that the stability of a hierarchical order is fundamentally related to a collective sense of certainty about the leadership and order of the hierarchy. This certainty is rooted in a combination of material calculations – smaller states' assurance that the expected costs of the dominant state conquering them would be higher than the benefits – and ideational convictions – the sense of legitimacy, derived from shared values and norms that accompanies the super-ordinate state's authority in the social order. The empirical analysis in the next section shows that regional stability in East Asia in the post-Second World War years can be correlated to the degree of collective certainty about the US-led regional hierarchy. East Asian stability and instability has been <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">determined by U.S. assurances,</span> self-confidence, and commitment to maintaining its primary position in the regional hierarchy; the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">perceptions and confidence</span> of regional states about US commitment; and the reactions of subordinate states in the region to the varied challengers to the regional hierarchical order. 4. Hierarchy and the East Asian security order Currently, the regional hierarchy in East Asia is still dominated by the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates. Since the 1970s, China has increasingly claimed the position of second-ranked great power, a claim that is today legitimized by the hierarchical deference shown by smaller subordinate powers such as South Korea and Southeast Asia. Japan and South Korea can, by virtue of their alliance with the United States, be seen to occupy positions in a third layer of regional major powers, while India is ranked next on the strength of its new strategic relationship with Washington. North Korea sits outside the hierarchic order but affects it due to its military prowess and nuclear weapons capability. Apart from making greater sense of recent history, conceiving of the US' role in East Asia as the dominant state in the regional hierarchy helps to clarify three critical puzzles in the contemporary international and East Asian security landscape. First, it contributes to explaining the lack of sustained challenges to American global preponderance after the end of the Cold War. Three of the key potential global challengers to US unipolarity originate in Asia (China, India, and Japan), and their support for or acquiescence to, US dominance have helped to <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">stabilize its global leadership.</span> Through its dominance of the Asian regional hierarchy, the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates has been able to neutralize the potential threats to its position from Japan via an alliance, from India by gradually identifying and pursuing mutual commercial and strategic interests, and from China by encircling and deterring it with allied and friendly states that support American preponderance. Secondly, recognizing US hierarchical preponderance further explains contemporary under-balancing in Asia, both against a rising China, and against incumbent American power. I have argued that one defining characteristic of a hierarchical system is voluntary subordination of lesser states to the dominant state, and that this goes beyond rationalistic bandwagoning because it is manifested in a social contract that comprises the related processes of hierarchical assurance and hierarchical deference. Critically, successful and sustainable hierarchical assurance and deference helps to explain why Japan is not yet a ‘normal’ country. Japan has experienced significant impetus to revise and expand the remit of its security forces in the last 15 years. Yet, these pressures continue to be insufficient to prompt a wholesale revision of its constitution and its remilitarization. The reason is that the United States extends its security umbrella over Japan through their alliance, which has led Tokyo not only to perceive no threat from US dominance, but has in fact helped to forge a security community between them (Nau, 2003). Adjustments in burden sharing in this alliance since the 1990s have arisen not from greater independent Japanese strategic activism, but rather from periods of strategic uncertainty and crises for Japan when it appeared that American hierarchical assurance, along with US' position at the top of the regional hierarchy, was in question. Thus, the Japanese priority in taking on more responsibility for regional security has been to improve its ability to facilitate the US' central position, rather than to challenge it.13 In the face of the security threats from North Korea and China, Tokyo's continued reliance on the security pact with the United States is rational. While there remains debate about Japan's re-militarization and the growing clout of nationalist ‘hawks’ in Tokyo, for regional and domestic political reasons, a sustained ‘normalization’ process cannot take place outside of the restraining framework of the United States–Japan alliance (Samuels, 2007; Pyle, 2007). Abandoning the alliance will entail Japan making a conscience choice not only to remove itself from the US-led hierarchy, but also to challenge the United States dominance directly. The United States–ROK alliance may be understood in a similar way, although South Korea faces different sets of constraints because of its strategic priorities related to North Korea. As J.J. Suh argues, in spite of diminishing North Korean capabilities, which render the US security umbrella less critical, the alliance endures because of mutual identification – in South Korea, the image of the US as ‘the only conceivable protector against aggression from the North,’ and in the United States, an image of itself as protector of an allied nation now vulnerable to an ‘evil’ state suspected of transferring weapons of mass destruction to terrorist networks (Suh, 2004). Kang, in contrast, emphasizes how South Korea has become less enthusiastic about its ties with the United States – as indicated by domestic protests and the rejection of TMD – and points out that Seoul is not arming against a potential land invasion from China but rather maritime threats (Kang, 2003, pp.79–80). These observations are valid, but they can be explained by hierarchical deference toward the United States, rather than China. The ROK's military orientation reflects its identification with and dependence on the United States and its adoption of US' strategic aims. In spite of its primary concern with the North Korean threat, Seoul's formal strategic orientation is toward maritime threats, in line with Washington's regional strategy. Furthermore, recent South Korean Defense White Papers habitually cited a remilitarized Japan as a key threat. The best means of coping with such a threat would be continued reliance on the US security umbrella and on Washington's ability to restrain Japanese remilitarization (Eberstadt et al., 2007). Thus, while the United States–ROK bilateral relationship is not always easy, its durability is based on South Korea's fundamental acceptance of the United States as the region's primary state and reliance on it to defend and keep regional order. It also does not rule out Seoul and other US allies conducting business and engaging diplomatically with China. India has increasingly adopted a similar strategy vis-à-vis China in recent years. Given its history of territorial and political disputes with China and its contemporary economic resurgence, India is seen as the key potential power balancer to a growing China. Yet, India has sought to negotiate settlements about border disputes with China, and has moved significantly toward developing closer strategic relations with the United States. Apart from invigorated defense cooperation in the form of military exchange programs and joint exercises, the key breakthrough was the agreement signed in July 2005 which facilitates renewed bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation (Mohan, 2007). Once again, this is a key regional power that could have balanced more directly and independently against China, but has rather chosen to align itself or bandwagon with the primary power, the United States, partly because of significant bilateral gains, but fundamentally in order to support the latter's regional order-managing function. Recognizing a regional hierarchy and seeing that the lower layers of this hierarchy have become more active since the mid-1970s also allows us to understand why there has been no outright balancing of China by regional states since the 1990s. On the one hand, the US position at the top of the hierarchy has been revived since the mid-1990s, meaning that deterrence against potential Chinese aggression is reliable and in place.14 On the other hand, the aim of regional states is to try to consolidate China's inclusion in the regional hierarchy at the level below that of the United States, not to keep it down or to exclude it. East Asian states recognize that they cannot, without great cost to themselves, contain Chinese growth. But they hope to socialize China by enmeshing it in peaceful regional norms and economic and security institutions. They also know that they can also help to ensure that the capabilities gap between China and the United States remains wide enough to deter a power transition. Because this strategy requires persuading China about the appropriateness of its position in the hierarchy and of the legitimacy of the US position, all East Asian states engage significantly with China, with the small Southeast Asian states refusing openly to ‘choose sides’ between the United States and China. Yet, hierarchical deference continues to explain why regional institutions such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN + 3, and East Asian Summit have made limited progress. While the United State has made room for regional multilateral institutions after the end of the Cold War, its hierarchical preponderance also constitutes the regional order to the extent that it cannot comfortably be excluded from any substantive strategic developments. On the part of some lesser states (particularly Japan and Singapore), hierarchical deference is manifested in inclusionary impulses (or at least impulses not to exclude the United States or US proxies) in regional institutions, such as the East Asia Summit in December 2005. Disagreement on this issue with others, including China and Malaysia, has stymied potential progress in these regional institutions (Malik, 2006). Finally, conceiving of a US-led East Asian hierarchy amplifies our understanding of how and why the United States–China relationship is now the key to regional order. The vital nature of the Sino-American relationship stems from these two states' structural positions. As discussed earlier, China is the primary second-tier power in the regional hierarchy. However, as Chinese power grows and Chinese activism spreads beyond Asia, the United States is less and less able to see China as merely a regional power – witness the growing concerns about Chinese investment and aid in certain African countries. This causes a disjuncture between US global interests and US regional interests. Regional attempts to engage and socialize China are aimed at mediating its intentions. This process, however, cannot stem Chinese growth, which forms the material basis of US threat perceptions. Apprehensions about the growth of China's power culminates in US fears about the region being ‘lost’ to China, echoing Cold War concerns that transcribed regional defeats into systemic setbacks.15 On the other hand, the US security strategy post-Cold War and post-9/11 have regional manifestations that disadvantage China. The strengthening of US alliances with Japan and Australia; and the deployment of US troops to Central, South, and Southeast Asia all cause China to fear a consolidation of US global hegemony that will first threaten Chinese national security in the regional context and then stymie China's global reach. Thus, the key determinants of the East Asian security order relate to two core questions: (i) Can the US be persuaded that China can act as a reliable ‘regional stakeholder’ that will help to buttress regional stability and US global security aims;16 and (ii) can China be convinced that the United States has neither territorial ambitions in Asia nor the desire to encircle China, but will help to promote Chinese development and stability as part of its global security strategy? (Wang, 2005). But, these questions cannot be asked in the abstract, outside the context of negotiation about their relative positions in the regional and global hierarchies. One urgent question for further investigation is how the process of assurance and deference operate at the topmost levels of a hierarchy? When we have two great powers of unequal strength but contesting claims and a closing capabilities gap in the same regional hierarchy, how much scope for negotiation is there, before a reversion to balancing dynamics? This is the main structural dilemma: as long as the United States does not give up its primary position in the Asian regional hierarchy, China is very unlikely to act in a way that will provide comforting answers to the two questions. Yet, the East Asian regional order has been and still is constituted by US hegemony, and to change that could be extremely disruptive and may lead to regional actors acting in highly destabilizing ways. Rapid Japanese remilitarization, armed conflict across the Taiwan Straits, Indian nuclear brinksmanship directed toward Pakistan, or a highly destabilized Korean peninsula are all illustrative of potential regional disruptions. 5. Conclusion To construct a coherent account of East Asia's evolving security order, I have suggested that the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates is the central force in constituting regional stability and order. The major patterns of equilibrium and turbulence in the region since 1945 can be explained by the relative stability of the US position at the top of the regional hierarchy, with periods of greatest insecurity being correlated with greatest uncertainty over the American commitment to managing regional order. Furthermore, relationships of hierarchical assurance and hierarchical deference explain the unusual character of regional order in the post-Cold War era. However, the greatest contemporary challenge to East Asian order is the potential conflict between China and the United States over rank ordering in the regional hierarchy, a contest made more potent because of the inter-twining of regional and global security concerns. Ultimately, though, investigating such questions of positionality requires conceptual lenses that go beyond basic material factors because it entails social and normative questions. How can China be brought more into a leadership position, while being persuaded to buy into shared strategic interests and constrain its own in ways that its vision of regional and global security may eventually be reconciled with that of the United States and other regional players? How can Washington be persuaded that its central position in the hierarchy must be ultimately shared in ways yet to be determined? The future of the East Asian security order is tightly bound up with the durability of the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates' global leadership and regional domination. At the regional level, the main scenarios of disruption are an outright Chinese challenge to US leadership, or the defection of key US allies, particularly Japan. Recent history suggests, and the preceding analysis has shown, that challenges to or defections from US leadership will come at junctures where it <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">appears that the US commitment to the region is in doubt,</span> which in turn destabilizes the hierarchical order. At the global level, American geopolitical over-extension will be the key cause of change. This is the one factor that could lead to both greater regional and global turbulence, if only by the attendant strategic uncertainly triggering off regional challenges or defections. However, it is notoriously difficult to gauge thresholds of over-extension. More positively, East Asia is a region that has adjusted to previous periods of uncertainty about US primacy. Arguably, the regional consensus over the United States as primary state in a system of benign hierarchy could accommodate a shifting of the strategic burden to US allies like Japan and Australia as a means of systemic preservation. The alternatives that could surface as a result of not doing so would appear to be much worse. <br />

6. Interstate War, Down but Far from Out Logically, the reverse side of the coin which proclaims a trend favoring political violence internal to states is the claim that interstate warfare is becoming, or has become, a historical curiosity. Steven Metz and Raymond Millen assure us that “most armed conflicts in coming decades are likely to be internal ones.”21 <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">That</span></span> is probably a safe prediction, though one might choose to be troubled by their prudent hedging with the qualifier “most.” Their plausible claim would look a little different in hindsight were it to prove true except for a mere one or two interstate nuclear conflicts, say between India and Pakistan, or North Korea and the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates and its allies. The same authors also offer the comforting judgment that “decisive war between major states is rapidly moving toward history’s dustbin.”22 It is an attractive claim; it is a shame that it is wrong. War, let alone “decisive war,” between major states currently is enjoying an off-season for one main reason: So extreme is the imbalance of military power in favor of the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates that potential rivals rule out policies that might lead to hostilities with the superpower. It is fashionable to argue that major interstate war is yesterday’s problem—recall that the yesterday in question is barely 15 years in the past—because now there is nothing to fight about and nothing to be gained by armed conflict. Would that those points were true; unfortunately they are not. The menace of major, if not necessarily decisive, interstate war will return to frighten us when great-power rivals <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">feel able to challenge American hegemony</span>. If you read Thucydides, or Donald Kagan, you will be reminded of the deadly and eternal influence of the triad of motives for war: “fear, honor, and interest.”23 <br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Is America in &quot;decline&quot;? The answer is yes — but it doesn't matter. This may seem a puzzling assertion at a time when China's economy is booming, its military power growing, and India and other nations are rising fast while the United States seems economically and militarily sidelined. To many, the eclipse of the West by the rising East seems inevitable. But America and her allies are as strong as they ever were. It's the rest of the world that's getting stronger, a trend that is neither a surprise nor an immediate threat. Indeed, the whole notion of &quot;decline&quot; only shows how short memories can be when thinking about international affairs. In the wake of the global financial meltdown, the rise of terrorism and one of the angriest elections in recent U.S. history, it would be understandable to mark the first 10 years of the millennium as characterized by a fast-growing East, a failing model of Western capitalism, and an America struggling in the endgame of a grinding foreign war, all of which could be the ingredients of &quot;decline.&quot; The problem is that this could just as well be a description of the United States in 1974. It is easy to forget that by the mid-1970s many Western observers agreed with Soviet spokesmen who crowed that the &quot;correlation of forces&quot; had turned against the United States and its allies. America had been defeated in Vietnam. High unemployment, low growth, and high inflation improbably coexisted, a condition described by the now-forgotten term &quot;stagflation.&quot; The United States had not only endured the resignation of a president, but for a time was led by both a president and a vice-president who had not been elected by the American people. In the 1974 midterm election, reform candidates exiled scores of incumbents as they pledged to take Washington back (sound familiar?) from the forces of corruption in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Overseas, the Americans were pleading with NATO to stay together in the face of a massive Soviet military buildup. Ten years later, Western economies were humming, NATO was vital and strong, and it was the East's turn to face a military buildup, fuelled by superior technology and a seemingly endless supply of cash. Soviet leaders who once gloated over American weakness were soon turned out of power, and only 15 years after the worst predictions of &quot;decline,&quot; the United States and its allies dominated the globe as the strongest military and economic alliance in the history of mankind. Like the many premature epitaphs written for Canadian federalism, the predictions for America were not only wrong, but embarrassingly so. And yet, here we are again. For some time now, it has become conventional wisdom that power is shifting from West to East, and that the United States in particular has been so distracted by its own troubles that it is unaware of the dawning of a new world marked by a Chinese-dominated Asia and a Russian-dominated Europe. America and Canada, in this dystopic future, will be left to trade with each other, to hope that Mexico does not dissolve into further instability, and to watch as the era of Pan-Atlantic supremacy comes to a close. This is a fantasy. It is not only alarmism, it is in some cases a disingenuous complaint that unless the United States is effectively omnipotent, it is therefore in &quot;decline.&quot; First, what does &quot;decline&quot; mean? If we mean absolute decline, then the whole argument collapses in the face of the obvious. The United States and the Western alliance have never been more powerful or more prosperous than they are today. Of course, people are products of the time in which they live, and the wealth and power of the United States did not stop over half of American respondents in a recent poll from declaring that the first 10 years of the new millennium were the &quot;worst&quot; in U.S. history. (One can only wonder how many of those who answered had lived through the 1930s; certainly, none of them had lived through the U.S. Civil War.) Indeed, my younger students are almost in disbelief when I tell them that the economy of the late 1970s was far worse than it is today; they have become so used to prolonged periods of economic stability and cheap credit that they cannot imagine anything worse than the recent recession. However, if the issue is relative decline, then yes, the nations of the West, including the U.S. and Canada, are in &quot;decline.&quot; But to say this is not to say very much. It means that the staggeringly inefficient economies in countries like China and India are becoming more productive and more modern. This was to be expected, and it would become a crisis for the regimes in these nations if their economies could not continue to modernize. It is here that the &quot;decline&quot; argument at times seems to ignore basic logic. Much has been made, for example, of the fact that the Chinese economy is now the second largest in the world, and could surpass the U.S. economy in size by 2020. But let us pause for a moment: China has 1.3 billion people and access to the same advanced technologies, from space travel to computing, that are available in the West. And yet its export-dependent economy is dwarfed by a post-industrial nation one-fourth its size, its worker productivity far below that of American workers who, contrary to this conventional wisdom, are still the most productive in the world. Or consider a comparison with Canada: China has nearly 40 times Canada's population, but an economy only roughly five times larger. If the Chinese economy grows — as it must, for the regime to provide even a lower-middle-income life for its people — is it &quot;decline&quot; if already-matured Western economies do not grow as fast? Another concern is that a richer China could throw its weight around. Again, this is a story we've heard before. In the 1980s, the Japanese were going to repossess New York's landmark buildings, and in the 1970s Arab petrodollars were going to buy southern California. What, exactly, the Chinese will do with this new-found power is rarely explained, perhaps because common sense dictates that the greater China's economic involvement with the world, the greater the stake the Chinese have in the health of the international economic system, including the American economy. As Henry Kissinger observed last year, never in history have all the major powers of the world been so dependent on the same global system of cooperation. For many &quot;declinists,&quot; the real issue is military security, not economy: &quot;decline&quot; means &quot;danger.&quot; There is no denying that other nations, relative to the United States and NATO, are becoming more powerful. Advances in military technology are rapidly becoming more diffuse and widespread, and the qualitative and quantitative gap between Western military hardware and that in China, India, Russia and elsewhere will narrow, although how fast is unclear. (The Chinese, for all their efforts at modernization, still cannot manufacture a reliable engine for jet fighters, and have to buy them from the Russians.) But in practical terms, this only means that the nearly unchallengeable supremacy of the United States — an unnatural situation that could not have lasted — will &quot;decline&quot; to a huge margin of superiority. Later this year, for example, China is scheduled to launch a refurbished Soviet aircraft carrier. Is this one ship a match for U.S. supercarriers like the George Washington? If pushing a retooled Soviet carrier into the Pacific is &quot;decline,&quot; then it is decline Americans can live with. More to the point, all of this concern about military decline takes place in a strategic vacuum. What scenarios, exactly, present such danger to the West that we must remedy &quot;decline&quot;? Does a major war loom in Asia or Europe in which the U.S. or NATO will be outclassed and outgunned? Ironically, the only truly existential threat to North America is the one most people don't think much about: strategic nuclear weapons. Without progress on reducing the stocks of these arms, arguments about &quot;decline&quot; seem almost petty by comparison. The obvious objection is that all this is far too optimistic. Economic and military decline, the argument goes, are inevitable if for no other reason than because the Western nations, and the United States in particular, are out of money. As long ago as 1989, the first president Bush warned in his inaugural address that &quot;we have more will than wallet.&quot; But this is nonsense: we have plenty of wallet. Where we choose to spend it, of course, is another matter. The continuing warnings about American decline represent a kind of atavistic Cold War mindset, in which every military advance in another nation is by definition a threat to the United States and its allies. Have we become so accustomed to our great fortune that economic or military developments in countries that have not yet completely mastered basic human services like clean water, literacy and roads represent our own &quot;decline&quot;? </span></span><br />

<strong>And asserting masculinity is key to justify heg</strong><br />

<br />
Pro-war actors often made their argument by mobilizing gendered metaphors to challenge the masculinity of the anti-war position<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span> This discursive strategy constructed the anti-war position is as either not sufficiently masculine or as expressing an insufficiently dominant or heterosexual kind of masculinity. Looking at the 402 gendered images used in these 149 articles, we find that 76 (19%) present those who are anti-war as unmanly. Even balanced or anti-war stories echo the framing of “being masculine enough” as an issue for anti-war speakers: “Some of the war hawks are saying that Powell is not strong enough, that he’s something of a sissy” (NPR 8/19/02). Sissy and wimp are used interchangeably in an ad hominem way to dismiss any opposition to going to war, as this pro-war speaker in a balanced discussion on NPR asserts: “the EU is a bunch of worthless wimps—they’re not good for anything, you can’t take them seriously; they’re not valuable partners” (NPR 4/21/ 02). The equation of power and masculinity is further underlined in the image of “impotence,” as a pro-war speaker on Fox News asserts: “the UN has become impotent thanks to the Democrats, thanks to the French, thanks to the Germans” (Fox News 1/23/03). Such unmasculine actors are weak and unable to act, and thus “worthless.” In constructing the anti-war position as unmasculine, the pro-war position frames toughness as the opposite of both femininity and homosexuality, both coded as non-hegemonic masculinity. In a discussion on Fox News about the United Nations’ refusal to mandate immediate invasion of Iraq, a pro-war actor chastises the US for ever seeking UN authority for invasion: “if we would have done this right off the bat, what we would have ended up getting was a slap on the wrist from a limp-wristed organization” (Fox News 3/10/03). Dismissing the United Nations as “limp-wristed” ties the anti-invasion position to homosexuality, and makes the inappropriateness of this position seem self-evident to any who share a positive regard for “country masculinity.” Similarly, opposition to pro-war policy is packaged as a lack of nationalism and masculinity together, as one military analyst reports, “There’s a few people in the Pentagon who basically say...that [for] people who disagree, it's not just a question of loyal opposition; this is disloyalty, and these are wimps” (NPR 3/9/02). The homosexual or “wimpy” male is defined as disloyal to “real” masculinity and US interests, which are conflated. The contrast between the US as “Mars” and Europe as “Venus” is sometimes explicitly invoked as a gendered reason for why these nations have different policy preferences, as when as pro-war editorial in the NYT points to the “Venus–Mars disconnect over Iraq” (NYT 2/16/ 03). The Kagan model of the US as masculine and Europe as feminine is by no means restricted to the Mars–Venus analogy alone, but instead is used by both sides to depict European countries as metaphorically women. A pro-war article describes Germany in feminine terms asking; “Who knew the Germans were such delicate, easily intimidated creatures?” (NYT 1/26/03), while an anti-war editorial calling for more diplomacy, chastises the Bush Administration, saying, “Germany is not some wimpy republic you can just date at your convenience and never call again” (NPR 3/18/03). This gendered relationship metaphor (dating, marriage, dancing together) appears in both text and editorial cartoons, using the supposed power of the United States to cast it as the “man” in the relationship and Europe as the subordinate, and therefore womanly “partner.” One antiwar speaker opens a discussion by asking “how can the marriage of Europe and the US be saved?” (NPR 5/28/02) Editorial cartoons in Europe as well as the US took up this gendered framing. Figure 1, an editorial cartoon that appeared in the Baltimore Sun, shows a charming Bush stepping on the toes of his female dance partner, Europe. Figure 2, from a Swedish newspaper, depicts Bush as a cowboy wooing a disinterested woman/Europe. The partnership of unequals politically signified by these courtship images is used in both papers to criticize Bush as an awkward suitor, but casting the US as “the man” naturalizes American leadership and places it beyond debate while also framing marriage as inherently an unequal partnership between “a man” and “a woman.” Europe is portrayed in the US not only as a woman, but as a “bad” and ungrateful woman who fails to appreciate the protective role of the masculine US. For example, a pro-war editorial argues: “France threatens to use its veto in the United Nations Security Council over Iraq. That veto power is undeserved, because France was a WorldWar II wimp” (USA Today 3/7/03). The theme that Europe should be more grateful and appreciative also appears with images of Europeans as “hysterical women, throwing fits and whining” (NYT 1/26/03). Or as a pro-war journalist claims, the US takes action against Iraq, while European countries just “watch and whine” (Fox News 1/23/03). In sum, the war debate between European allies and the US is sometimes cast in terms of a troubled marriage or dating relationship, one in which the strength and power of the US makes it the “man” who legitimately has the right to make decisions. The views of those who take issue with the rush to war are characterized in negatively feminized terms as “wimps” and “whining.” Men who fail to take the “manly” posture of “Mars” are denigrated as “sissies” and their actions are “limp-wristed.” This hegemonic view of masculinity as powerful, decisive, heterosexual and unwilling to listen to the “whining” of women is not left uncontested, however. <br />

<strong>Multiple nuclear wars</strong><br />

<br />
Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe 's stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world's great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China 's neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene -- even if it remained the world's most powerful nation -- could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe -- if it adopted what some call a strategy of &quot;offshore balancing&quot; -- this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, &quot;offshore&quot; role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more &quot;even-handed&quot; policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel 's aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn 't change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn 't changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to &quot;normal&quot; or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. <br />

<br />
First, the “hybrid” hegemonic model assumes that the goal of U.S. foreign affairs should be the preservation of American hegemony, which is more stable, more peaceful, and better for America’s security and prosperity, than the alternatives. If the United States were to withdraw from its global leadership role, no other nation would be capable of taking its place.376 The result would be radical instability and a greater risk of major war.377 In addition, the United States would no longer benefit from the public goods it had formerly produced; as the largest consumer, it would suffer the most.<br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted Friday that a &quot;large majority&quot; of members in his party will back a key nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia and that it will be ratified.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">So far, Lugar (Ind.) has been the only Senate Republican to back the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which was negotiated in the spring but has yet to be ratified by the Senate. The Indiana Republican predicted that the treaty pass his committee in mid-September and will come up for a vote in the lame-duck session after the November elections.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">&quot;In fairness to the Republicans in the Senate, I think a majority in fact do favor the treaty nominally and will eventually vote for the treaty,&quot; he said in an interview on C-SPAN's &quot;Newsmakers&quot; program that will air Sunday. If it is brought up, &quot;a large number of Republicans will be in favor of the treaty, but not all of them,&quot; he said.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">President Obama has urged the Senate to ratify the treaty for months, but it has been stalled in the Senate due to Republican doubts over the agreement.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R), a 2008 presidential candidate, penned a July Washington Post op-ed, in which he called the START &quot;Obama's worst foreign policy mistake yet,&quot; arguing it would impede U.S. missile defense efforts and give the Russians too many concessions. Lugar at the time called his comments &quot;hyperbolic.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The veteran senator acknowledged that some in his party are using the ratification process to gain commitments from the Obama administration to modernize the country's existing nuclear facilities. He also said that some in his party, going back years, &quot;don't like the Russians, don't trust them, don't want to deal with them.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">By rule, getting enough Republicans on board to ratify a treaty would be a heavier lift than passing legislation -- it takes 67 senators to approve a treaty, meaning eight Republicans will need to vote for the treaty assuming all 59 Democrats do as well.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Lugar expressed &quot;hope&quot; that the treaty would not turn into a political football since it is likely to come up after the November midterm elections, which senators will not be feeling the pressures of the campaign trail.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">&quot;I think a large majority of Republicans agree with me&quot; on arms reduction, he said. &quot;But I'm hopeful, to get to your point, that we will not get into a political situation in which Republicans say 'well this is a treaty that President Obama and his folks negotiated, ipso facto, it must not be a very good treaty. That would be very unfortunate. But I think we will not deal with the treaty on the floor until after the election.&quot;</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">However, Obama will have to obtain the ratification of the treaty by the Senate this year, Rogov said. &quot;Obama will need to use up all his political capital in order to obtain the treaty's ratification this year. Why does it have to be this year? There will be mid-term Congress elections in November and one-third of Senators are to be elected. It appears that the Republicans will win back five or six seats. It is even possible that they will win back the majority and in this case Obama will need not eight Republican votes but 13 or 15 or even more,&quot; he added. &quot;Taking into account the fact that radical right-wing extremist ideas have become popular in the Republican Party, the new Republican Senators will be even more conservative,&quot; the expert said. Nevertheless, he did add that the incumbent American administration has &quot;good connections in the Senate&quot;.</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Failure to Ratify Threatens US Global Interests</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Our allies cannot believe that this simple, straightforward continuation of Ronald Reagan's START I treaty, is having trouble in the U.S. Senate. The Washington Post reported French Ambassador Pierre Vimont said recently that after diplomats cabled home that the treaty could run into problems, &quot;People ask us, 'Have you been drinking?'&quot;</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Failure to ratify this treaty would raise serious doubts about the ability of any U.S. president to negotiate new agreements. As veteran national security expert Michael Krepon explains:</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Foreign capitals would be justified in concluding that Washington has lost its bearings. America's standing in the world would take a dive. Friends and allies would count less on Washington. Troublemakers would have more room to maneuver. The currency of international power would continue to flow towards Beijing, and there would be no agreed rules for reductions and verification arrangements for the two largest nuclear arsenals.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">As of August 4, it has been 242 days and counting since START I expired and we lost our on-site inspectors in Russia. This new treaty has got to be a top priority for the Administration. The case for this treaty is so strong that approval by the Senate is, as former Republican Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger said, &quot;obligatory.&quot;In September, the Senate must give its advice and consent to New START. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry (D.-MA) set a vote for September 15 in a letter to his colleagues yesterday. The six weeks will give every Senator a chance to get their legitimate questions answered. They should come back prepared to vote. The Administration and the Senate leadership must give this critical pact priority time on the floor for a vote before the October 8 recess.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Every day without New START in force is another day we don't know for sure what is going on with Russia's nuclear weapons. That is not good for America.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because a world in which the United States exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with the world's major problems, such as nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts. Finally, U.S. leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling the United States and the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Jonathan Cohn falls into the same trap as his apathetic Netroots liberals as far as national security is concerned. The Rodney Dangerfield of the Obama administration, security can’t even get enough of their attention to be disrespected. (It should be said that Netroots organizers convened their first-ever broadly themed foreign policy panel to take a look at exactly this question, and invited my organization, the National Security Network, to put it together, so give them some credit. Like many of the successes described below, it’s a work in progress.)</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">And yet. In 2008, Americans said they were anxious about terrorism, about Iraq, about U.S. global standing. Liberals felt we were trapped on a path toward expanding, endless wars and shrinking interaction with global partners on global problems. President Obama will have us down to 50,000 troops in Iraq (from 145,000 in February 2009) and end combat missions next month. His administration revived the international consensus on reducing and ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons, and safeguarding nuclear materials. Next month will likely get the New START treaty through the Senate (albeit with an ugly, health care-like orgy of side deals).</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The economy looks bad now, but with full global recession it might have been much worse–administration leadership prevented global meltdown and created a more representative and inclusive forum, the G20, to manage global recovery.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The first 18 months of the Administration saw more terrorism convictions in civilian courts than did five years of Bush Administration military tribunals–and the killing or capturing of half the leadership of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, according to CIA Director Leon Panetta. Counterterrorism experts like Stephen Flynn of the Center for National Policy argue that the smaller-scale terrorism attempts we’re now seeing (and thwarting) reflect an important success–Al Qaeda no longer enjoys the safety in its AfPak border hideaways to plot complex, multi-part attacks such as September 11.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The administration successfully reset relations with Russia to get things we want in other fora (Afghanistan, Iran). Iran itself is weaker, more isolated externally and divided internally, than at any time in recent memory. Last year, the administration and Congress passed through a significant increase in aid to fight poverty and disease around the world. Global public opinion of the U.S. moved up nearly everywhere, soaring in Western Europe, Russia, and China. Americans who work at the UN and other international bodies tell stories of foreign nationals sidling up to them in the halls with a message: “We’re so glad you’re back.”</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Hey, I can be critical, too. The opportunity to close Guantanamo promptly, send most of its inmates to humane destinations, and try those deserving in our civilian courts fell victim to ugly politics and inattention. Nobody, not even General Petraeus, thinks Afghanistan is going well enough as the Administration tries to hold steady on its plan for an “inflection point” next summer. (Speaking of Afghanistan, just 8 percent of Netroots attendees told pollsters that “finishing Afghanistan” should be the Administration’s top priority, vs. 74 percent favoring “improve the jobs situation.” I’d say the White House hears them loud and clear.) Middle East results have disappointed. The effort to find a post-Bush language for the promotion of democracy and human rights remains a work in progress. Some vital longer-term structural questions, about how we organize our nation’s conduct of international affairs and redress the funding and capability imbalance between civilians and the military, have slipped down the priority list in the welter of short-term challenges–as does the effort to explain again and again to Americans what kind of a world it is we are building toward.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Substantively, though, those shortcomings and delays are fixable–if the administration has the political capital and the time. Where, on the domestic side, liberals got the big change and need the enthusiasm to use and keep them, in foreign policy the administration has fought to clear the path. A changed paradigm is now possible–if liberals can rouse themselves from apathy enough to work for it and embrace politicians when they are supportive, in addition to pummeling them when they are not.</span><br />

Lugar, who is the key Republican leader spearheading the drive to ratify the treaty, will submit a substitute resolution at the committee's Sept. 16 meeting that includes several changes to Kerry's language, in the hope of securing the votes of additional GOP senators he believes would oppose Kerry's version.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Multiple GOP Senate aides close to the issue told The Cable they found the Kerry language unacceptable on a number of issues, including how it dealt with missile defense, tactical nuclear weapons, counting rules for warheads, and the sharing of telemetry data. &quot;There are a lot of concerns raised that the Kerry draft didn't answer,&quot; one senior GOP aide said.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Kerry's staff told The Cable that his draft is meant to be a starting point to negotiations. The letter accompanying the draft invites committee members to put forth their own ideas in advance of the vote. Kerry's office maintains this is the normal procedure for getting a resolution ready.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Kerry and Lugar &quot;are working on a resolution that will engender bipartisan support,&quot; said committee spokesman Frederick Jones. &quot;Committee members are continuing to provide input on this resolution and this is an ongoing process. We're in the process of building consensus.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Lugar's office confirmed that the senator will offer a substitute amendment, which he will circulate next Monday. This will be one of several amendments that committee members will put forth. &quot;The Kerry draft was intended to be a framework to get us started,&quot; said Lugar spokesman Andy Fisher.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">As these negotiations illustrate, Lugar has become the pivotal figure in the START debate. He appears torn between his heartfelt desire to see the treaty enacted and his need to maintain his role as the bridge between Senate Democrats and the Obama administration, and the GOP senators the administration needs to get the 67 ratification votes necessary for the resolution to pass.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Lugar has been sending out letters to various GOP offices asking them for input as to what the treaty resolution would have to include to win their approval. Aides said the top targets for Lugar right now are Sens. Bob Corker (R-TN) and Johnny Isaacson (R-GA), who remain concerned that the Obama administration has not yet sufficiently assured them that it will commit to robust investment in the modernization of the U.S. nuclear stockpile.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">After Corker and Isaacson, the hunt for GOP committee votes gets tougher. Sens. James Inhofe (R-OK) and Jim DeMint (R-SC), are solid no votes. The remaining three Republican committee members are seen by Lugar and the administration as more difficult to get.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Lugar continues to project optimism about the treaty, telling C-Span recently he is confident that a &quot;large majority&quot; of Republicans will end up voting in favor of new START. But his increased involvement at this stage may also show frustration with the process. At last month's committee meeting, he openly criticized Kerry's decision to delay the vote and expressed a desire to put members to a decision sooner rather than later.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">On the substance of Kerry's draft, aides from multiple GOP Senate offices said it didn't go far enough to meet their concerns on several issues.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Regarding missile defense, for example, the resolution says that the new START treaty &quot;will not impede any missile defense deployments that are currently planned or might be required during the life of the Treaty, and it is therefore fully consistent with United States policy as established by the National Missile Defense Act of 1999.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Regarding Russia's threat to withdraw from the treaty if U.S. missile defense advancements upset the strategic balance between the two countries, the resolution says, &quot;The unilateral statement issued by the Russian Federation on missile defense does not impose a legal obligation on the United States and will have no practical impact.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Some GOP offices are calling for more aggressive language, such as a pledge not to include missile defense as part of the agenda of the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) being set up between the United States and Russia to discuss details of treaty implementation.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Regardless, it seems now that Lugar's amendment will be the center of gravity in the negotiations over the resolutions language, because it has the best chance of getting GOP committee votes.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">&quot;They want some Republicans other than Lugar,&quot; one GOP aide said, referring to Kerry and the administration. &quot;So, the resolution Lugar writes has to be good enough to get at least Corker.&quot;</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong>Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, 9</strong> (“The Road to Missile Defense” August 17, 2009, da:8-12-10, lexis, KK)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">When the who’s who of missile defense mavens gathered for a gala in Washington last year, there was a palpable aura of triumph. Twenty-five years earlier, with much fanfare, President Ronald Reagan had announced the Strategic Defense Initiative. The political right embraced SDI as a heroic plan, akin to Apollo or the Manhattan Project, that could make nuclear warfare obsolete. The left ridiculed SDI as Star Wars and derided the endeavor as chimerical at best, wasteful and dangerous at worst. After a quarter-century, the world had changed and so had missile defense. Whether the program deserved a lot of credit or none for the Soviet Union’s demise, the monolithic nemesis was gone. But the threat of ballistic missiles, though nowhere nearly as massive as that of the Soviets, had become more diverse, less predictable and in some ways more frightening. Iran and North Korea, in their determination to develop reliable launch vehicles and nuclear weapons, had made the new threat palpable. Over the years, the name and scope of the plan changed from «nuclear umbrella» to layered defense against limited attacks. Some technology demonstrations failed, others succeeded. Amazingly, most Democrats as well as Republicans have become basically supportive of ballistic missile defense R&amp;D, at least in principle. Taxpayers have spent $125 billion on missile defense research and technology, and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is expected to spend another $50 billion through 2013. What has this bought? Even the Pentagon acknowledges the system, incorporating national/regional and exoatmospheric/terminal defenses, is crude. But eight years after President George W. Bush nearly doubled annual MDA funding, it is clear the elements of the system—the sea-based Aegis/SM-3 (see photo); land mobile Patriot, PAC-3 and Thaad; and, to a lesser extent, the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) System—have begun to prove themselves. Aegis/SM-3 shot down an ailing U.S. intelligence satellite last year. The Thaad (Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense) system is finally scoring repeatable successes (see p. 38). Investment in both will double under new MDA plans, and the Navy and Army are finally embracing them because of the encouraging test results. Still, while individual systems have matured, profound questions remain about just how integrated, operable, effective and affordable the end-to-end system will prove to be. Both Aegis/SM-3 and Thaad have a checkered past.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">But job losses one place often mean new jobs elsewhere, since Gates is also ramping up orders for Lockheed's F-35 joint strike fighter. Plans are now to manufacture 2,443 of the jets, he announced. One asset Gates has no plans to cut is the military's lifeblood: Americans in uniform. As part of his &quot;fundamental overhaul&quot; of the military - from a huge force prepared to face rogue nation-states into an elite group tailor-made for small wars and counterterrorism - the Pentagon chief will boost the ranks of helicopter crews and the stealthiest of its war fighters. Gates will increase special operations forces by 2,800, roughly 5% more, and develop transport aircraft just for their use, capable of carrying secret warriors to more remote targets, he said. The proposals are &quot;the product of a holistic assessment&quot; of needs that will end up &quot;shifting this department in a different strategic direction,&quot; Gates said. Absent, however, was any bold new plan to make the country's biggest gas-guzzler - the military - more fuel-efficient. As lawmakers digested the Pentagon chief's sweeping ideas, few had much criticism initially. Republicans limited their griping to Gates' intent on chopping $1.4 billion from their beloved ballistic missile defense program. &quot;Just a day after North Korea launched a long-range ballistic missile, the secretary missed an opportunity to recommit to investment in missile defense capabilities,&quot; said Rep. John McHugh (R-Watertown), the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">A budget out of balance and a populace more worried about the economic present than our atmospheric future does not bode well for global warming emerging as a top-tier issue in the early days of the new administration. An agenda crowded with critical items - an economy in recession, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the continuing mortgage meltdown, healthcare - awaits our newly elected leaders. There are only so many priorities that an administration and Congress can focus on, and they will need to make choices on how to use their initial honeymoon period and their finite supply of political capital.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Obama will, however, begin his stint with a vast accumulation of political capital, perhaps more than that held by any other modern leader. Seventy-eight per cent of Americans polled believe that his inauguration is one of the most historic the country will witness. Political capital is, however, a lumpy and fast diminishing asset in today's world of instant communication, which once misspent, is rarely ever renewable. The world is full of political leaders like George Bush and Tony Blair who had visions, promised a lot, and probably meant well, but who did not know how to husband the political capital with which they were provided as they assumed office. They squandered it as quickly as they emptied the contents of the public vaults. Many will be watching to see how Obama manages his assets and liabilities register. Watching with hope would be the white young lady who waved a placard in Obama's face inscribed with the plaintive words, &quot;I Trust You.&quot;</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson will soon have the opportunity to protect America’s national security by voting in favor of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) with Russia, which would further a process started by Ronald Reagan to verifiably reduce U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to 1,550 warheads and 700 deployed launchers.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">New START also ensures strategic stability by reinstating a strong verification regime that allows U.S. inspectors, for the first time, to peer inside Russian missiles and track warheads with unique identifiers.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">As Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has written, “The New START Treaty has the unanimous support of America’s military leadership — to include the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all of the service chiefs, and the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, the organization responsible for our strategic nuclear deterrent.”</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Recently, I joined a group of retired flag officers, including Lt. Gen. Dirk Jameson, former commander of all ICBM units and Deputy Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, in expressing my support for the New START accord. Like Secretary Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, we understand that New START is essential to national security.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">For more than 40 years, the U.S. has pursued strategic stability through an arms control process that has been vigorously supported by Republicans and Democrats alike. The New START Treaty both continues these established principles and tailors them to meet the security needs of the 21st century.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">In today’s security environment, we must protect against the dual threats of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism. With the nuclear arsenals of the U.S. and Russia accounting for nearly 95 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons, the first step to nuclear security begins with New START.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The original START agreement expired Dec. 5, 2009, leaving the U.S. without the intrusive inspection and verification regime that allowed U.S. inspectors to monitor Russia’s nuclear arsenal for so many years.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The U.S. Senate should work to reinstate these verification provisions by ratifying New START and getting U.S. boots back on the ground.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Without these measures, our strategic command loses its access to Russia’s nuclear forces, and the predictability between the world’s two largest nuclear powers is called into question.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Some have argued that we’ve not yet fully explored the treaty. That’s not true. The Senate has held an extensive series of hearings and meticulously reviewed the treaty and its accompanying documents.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Throughout this process, serious national security experts of all ideological stripes have voiced strong support for the New START treaty. James Schlesinger, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, James Baker, Stephen Hadley and Colin Powell have all expressed strong support for this treaty.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Gen. Brent Scowcroft, George H.W. Bush’s national security adviser, previously warned senators that a rejection of this treaty would throw our nuclear policies into a “state of chaos.”</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The support for New START from our military is clear. The national security benefits of New START are clear. So is the choice.</span><br />

<strong>Obama pushing hard and there is</strong> broad support <strong>for all 3 FTAs</strong><br />
<strong>Wenk, 2/15</strong> – Senior Director, International Policy at the Chamber of Commerce (Christopher, 2/15/11, “Building Momentum on the Latin FTAs,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.chamberpost.com/category/author-christopher-wenk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chamberpost.com/category/author-christopher-wenk/</a>, JMP) <br />
<br />
Today, the Chamber-led Latin America Trade Coalition (LATC) is leading a delegation of about a dozen companies and associations to Colombia and Panama to help push forward those FTAs in what is building up to be the &quot;Year of Trade&quot; in 2011. Make no mistake about it, the Chamber, and the business community, strongly supports the U.S.-Korea FTA as well. And we are very pleased that the Administration is pushing so hard on that agreement. So are we!!! However, there is also broad and deep support in the business community and on Capitol Hill (think John Boehner, Max Baucus and others) to move forward on all 3 pending FTAs this year. <br />
<br />
<strong>Leadership and focus by Obama is key</strong><br />
<strong>McLarty &amp; Cunningham, 1/24</strong> – *chief of staff to Clinton in 1993-94 and helped bring Bill Daley into the White House to lead the 1993 Nafta ratification effort, AND <strong>Mr. Cunningham was an aide to President Clinton and to then-Sen. Joseph Biden (1/24/11, Thomas &quot;Mack&quot; McLarty III and Nelson W. Cunningham, “Obama's Free Trade Opportunity,” Factiva, JMP)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Much has been written about Bill Daley's selection as White House chief of staff, a position sometimes called &quot;Chief Javelin Catcher&quot; (a title whose accuracy one of us strongly affirms). Most agree that Mr. Daley is the perfect choice to help President Obama set a new tone for his presidency. He is a moderate, strongly rooted in Democratic principles and politics. Though he comes from the business community, he is no colorless technocrat or Republican shill. He is a Daley from Chicago and will not forget the needs of the lunchbucket voters who've supported Daleys for 50 years, or the political lessons he learned at the knee of his father, Mayor Richard J. Daley.</strong><br />
<strong>Mr. Daley will need all his political skills to tackle what we think should become one of the signature accomplishments of his tenure: the return of liberalized trade as a centerpiece of Democrats' vision of economic competitiveness and globalization.</strong><br />
<strong>Bill Clinton embraced this vision, and he understood that trade liberalization required strong bipartisan efforts. To pass the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) in 1993, we set up a bipartisan war room within the White House, headed by Bill Daley and former Republican Congressman Bill Frenzel. Messrs. Daley and Frenzel worked together, with the full support of the president and White House staff, to push Nafta through the House with 102 Democratic and 132 Republican votes, and on to an equally bipartisan total in the Senate.</strong><br />
<strong>Liberalized trade was also at the heart of President Clinton's view that America needed international competition to succeed in an increasingly trade-dependent world. Not every Democrat supported this view, though Mr. Clinton strongly pushed it within the party.</strong><br />
<strong>But we quickly lost this bipartisan consensus and the progress Mr. Clinton had forged in his own party. By 1997, when Mr. Clinton sought renewal of &quot;fast track&quot; authority to negotiate more trade agreements, Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich could not corral his majority to support the president and the effort failed. And although President George W. Bush did manage to make congressional headway on trade with his Republican majorities, he did so principally with Republican support.</strong><br />
<strong>In the first two years of President Obama's tenure, progress on trade was largely frozen. Mr. Obama stated his support for the uncompleted pieces of the Bush trade agenda -- free trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia, the dangling Doha World Trade Organization round, and Russia WTO accession -- but little measurable progress was made.</strong><br />
<strong>Now, in a few short weeks, Mr. Obama has renegotiated the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement and announced that it will be a priority in the new Congress. He has taken steps to resolve a longstanding trade dispute with Mexico over trucks that goes back to the Clinton years. And, with his selection of Mr. Daley, the president has hired the man who can make this trade revival a reality.</strong><br />
<strong>What now? Our experience tells us that the only way to push a major trade agreement through Congress -- even one where the nominally pro-trade GOP rules the House -- is with <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; padding: 0in;">strong and unyielding presidential leadership</span>, a unified White House staff and cabinet, and a genuinely bipartisan approach to stakeholders and the Congress. First, the president must be fully committed. Nafta was a bipartisan success in no small part because of the personal involvement of Mr. Clinton and sometimes tortuous negotiations with members of Congress. It's true that some pork was doled out and more than one bridge was built as a result of a Nafta vote -- something they probably still understand in Chicago. Second, the White House and cabinet must be unified in pulling for passage. Everyone from Vice President Joe Biden to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk must be fully engaged, without hesitation. Don't forget the crucial role that then-Vice President Al Gore's 1993 debate with Ross Perot played in swinging public opinion in favor of Nafta. Third, the effort must be genuinely bipartisan. We'll need <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">scores of members from both sides</span> to make passage possible (this is particularly true with a large tea party GOP caucus that is as yet undefined on trade). Perhaps Mr. Obama could even take a page from the 1993 playbook and bring into the White House a prominent Republican -- former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, former Reagan Chief of Staff Ken Duberstein, or a former congressman such as Jim Kolbe or Chris Shays, for example -- to help quarterback the effort. Finally, the president has to show that his commitment to the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement isn't a one-off. Moderates and independents who have been spooked by an economic approach they see as veering strongly to the left are looking for signs that this president embraces their centrist views. A commitment to deficit reduction, sustained outreach to business, and a genuine embrace of trade liberalization must go hand-in-hand. Most importantly, the president should commit to advancing the pending trade agreements with Colombia and Panama right now, instead of leaving them until later as some in his administration would prefer. Why bother taking a half-measure on trade? A full-throated campaign for the Korea, Colombia and Panama trade agreements, along with WTO accession for Russia, can help reset this presidency. Capitalizing on his selection of Mr. Daley with a renewed American trade policy, Mr. Obama has the chance to remind moderates in both parties and independent voters that he is the man they voted for in 2008 -- a leader who appreciates the goals of businesses large and small, and who sees America as confident and innovative enough to remain the global economy's True North. It also gives the president the opportunity to strengthen ties with longtime allies who cultivate liberal democracy, reject old and ugly political and social traditions, stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us when it comes to fighting the world's darkest forces, and are willing to open their markets to us -- or in the case of Russia, to encourage that behavior. It won't be easy, and it may alienate some in the Democratic base, but it is essential.</strong><br />

Key to maintain hegemony in Asia <br />
Bandow, 10/19 <strong>– Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute (Doug, The Daily Caller, “South Korea Free Trade Agreement Key to Prosperity and Security,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4838:http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=12488 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=12488" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=12488</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4838 -->, JMP)</strong><br />

<strong>The Korean FTA also is part of East Asia's greater economic game. A rising China is bumping up against a still dominant America. Strengthening trade ties is one way for Washington to ensure continued American influence in East Asia. Especially since East Asian countries have increasingly turned, with or without the U.S., to bilateral economic agreements to promote trade. Despite the Wall Street crash, the U.S. retains the world's largest and most productive economy. However, the PRC now possesses the second largest economy. Moreover, China's rapid economic growth has naturally led to expanded Chinese investment and trade throughout East Asia. China's top trading partner is the U.S., but the former's second through fifth largest are Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan. Australia, Malaysia, and Singapore fall in at numbers seven, nine, and ten. Between 2007 and 2008, all of these countries except Singapore saw its trade with the People's Republic of China increase faster than its trade with America. China's increasing economic growth is leading to increasing Chinese domination of East Asian economies. American companies have been pushed into second and even third place, most notably in South Korea and Japan. As recently as 2003, the U.S. was number one in the former. At the same time, the PRC is asserting itself politically throughout Asia, including in the ROK. China has linked its growing economic power with strong diplomatic initiatives throughout Asia. In June Beijing finalized the economic framework cooperation agreement with Taiwan, and is pressing for FTAs with Australia and Japan. Most important, the PRC and South Korea have discussed the possibility of a FTA. There are significant barriers to agreements between Beijing and all of these nations. But the fact the PRC is pursuing this strategy — and that America's three leading military allies in the region view FTAs with China as a serious possibility — illustrate the challenge now facing Washington. Nor is South Korea waiting for the U.S. Last year Seoul completed the world's largest bilateral trade pact, with the European Union. Despite political opposition in Europe, similar to that in the U.S., the agreement will soon take effect. American manufacturers will then find themselves at a disadvantage compared to European producers — one estimate is a likely loss of roughly $30 billion in exports. Frank Vargo, vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, argued: &quot;if the president sends the [U.S.-ROK] agreement up in early 2011, we will be able to avoid the export and job loss&quot; that otherwise will result from the European pact. If not, however, Prof. Choi Byung-il warns that the European agreement &quot;poses a serious and substantial threat to the commercial interests of the United States, including automobiles, legal services, and accounting services.&quot; Yet the U.S.-ROK FTA sits unratified in Washington. Expanding trade ties offers geopolitical advantages as well. The Bush administration may have overstated the benefits, but only slightly, when it argued: &quot;By boosting economic ties and broadening and modernizing our longstanding alliance, it promises to become the pillar of our alliance for the next 50 years, as the Mutual Defense Treaty has been for the last 50 years.&quot; Washington's influence in East Asia is slowly ebbing. And America's military alliance, created in a different era, is obsolescent. The two nations, once united by the threat of a dangerous North Korea backed by a hostile China and Soviet Union, now perceive regional threats differently. The U.S. already has begun a force drawdown and a full withdrawal is becoming ever more likely. To meet this challenge Washington needs to employ American &quot;soft power&quot; — access to the world's most important, advanced, and productive economy. Chinese influence will inevitably grow throughout East Asia. But the U.S. need not yield the playing field; instead, it should actively engage friendly nations. The most profitable and least dangerous means to do so is to make it easier for its people to trade. Washington should press for multilateral agreements, particularly the long-stalled Doha round of the World Trade Organization. Various nations also have expressed interest in a Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership, a Free Trade Area in the Asia Pacific, an East Asian Community, and other similar though differently-named groupings. The U.S. government should respond positively to any and all. Washington also should negotiate FTAs with Japan and Taiwan. So too with ASEAN, the collection of highly-trade dependent Southeast Asian states which currently host nearly $300 billion worth of U.S. investment. But the start is for Congress to ratify the trade accord with South Korea. Failing to approve the South Korean FTA would likely result in permanent economic and geopolitical damage. This would be a high price to pay at any time, but especially when China is rapidly expanding its influence throughout East Asia.</strong><br />

Key to global hegemony and stopping multiple nuclear wars <br />
Goh 8 <strong>– Lecturer in International Relations in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the Univ of Oxford (Evelyn, International Relations of the Asia-Pacific, “Hierarchy and the role of the United States in the East Asian security order,” 2008 8(3):353-377, Oxford Journals Database, JMP)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The centrality of these mutual processes of assurance and deference means that the stability of a hierarchical order is fundamentally related to a collective sense of certainty about the leadership and order of the hierarchy. This certainty is rooted in a combination of material calculations – smaller states' assurance that the expected costs of the dominant state conquering them would be higher than the benefits – and ideational convictions – the sense of legitimacy, derived from shared values and norms that accompanies the super-ordinate state's authority in the social order. The empirical analysis in the next section shows that regional stability in East Asia in the post-Second World War years can be correlated to the degree of collective certainty about the US-led regional hierarchy. East Asian stability and instability has been <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">determined by U.S. assurances,</span> self-confidence, and commitment to maintaining its primary position in the regional hierarchy; the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">perceptions and confidence</span> of regional states about US commitment; and the reactions of subordinate states in the region to the varied challengers to the regional hierarchical order. 4. Hierarchy and the East Asian security order Currently, the regional hierarchy in East Asia is still dominated by the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates. Since the 1970s, China has increasingly claimed the position of second-ranked great power, a claim that is today legitimized by the hierarchical deference shown by smaller subordinate powers such as South Korea and Southeast Asia. Japan and South Korea can, by virtue of their alliance with the United States, be seen to occupy positions in a third layer of regional major powers, while India is ranked next on the strength of its new strategic relationship with Washington. North Korea sits outside the hierarchic order but affects it due to its military prowess and nuclear weapons capability. Apart from making greater sense of recent history, conceiving of the US' role in East Asia as the dominant state in the regional hierarchy helps to clarify three critical puzzles in the contemporary international and East Asian security landscape. First, it contributes to explaining the lack of sustained challenges to American global preponderance after the end of the Cold War. Three of the key potential global challengers to US unipolarity originate in Asia (China, India, and Japan), and their support for or acquiescence to, US dominance have helped to <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">stabilize its global leadership.</span> Through its dominance of the Asian regional hierarchy, the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates has been able to neutralize the potential threats to its position from Japan via an alliance, from India by gradually identifying and pursuing mutual commercial and strategic interests, and from China by encircling and deterring it with allied and friendly states that support American preponderance. Secondly, recognizing US hierarchical preponderance further explains contemporary under-balancing in Asia, both against a rising China, and against incumbent American power. I have argued that one defining characteristic of a hierarchical system is voluntary subordination of lesser states to the dominant state, and that this goes beyond rationalistic bandwagoning because it is manifested in a social contract that comprises the related processes of hierarchical assurance and hierarchical deference. Critically, successful and sustainable hierarchical assurance and deference helps to explain why Japan is not yet a ‘normal’ country. Japan has experienced significant impetus to revise and expand the remit of its security forces in the last 15 years. Yet, these pressures continue to be insufficient to prompt a wholesale revision of its constitution and its remilitarization. The reason is that the United States extends its security umbrella over Japan through their alliance, which has led Tokyo not only to perceive no threat from US dominance, but has in fact helped to forge a security community between them (Nau, 2003). Adjustments in burden sharing in this alliance since the 1990s have arisen not from greater independent Japanese strategic activism, but rather from periods of strategic uncertainty and crises for Japan when it appeared that American hierarchical assurance, along with US' position at the top of the regional hierarchy, was in question. Thus, the Japanese priority in taking on more responsibility for regional security has been to improve its ability to facilitate the US' central position, rather than to challenge it.13 In the face of the security threats from North Korea and China, Tokyo's continued reliance on the security pact with the United States is rational. While there remains debate about Japan's re-militarization and the growing clout of nationalist ‘hawks’ in Tokyo, for regional and domestic political reasons, a sustained ‘normalization’ process cannot take place outside of the restraining framework of the United States–Japan alliance (Samuels, 2007; Pyle, 2007). Abandoning the alliance will entail Japan making a conscience choice not only to remove itself from the US-led hierarchy, but also to challenge the United States dominance directly. The United States–ROK alliance may be understood in a similar way, although South Korea faces different sets of constraints because of its strategic priorities related to North Korea. As J.J. Suh argues, in spite of diminishing North Korean capabilities, which render the US security umbrella less critical, the alliance endures because of mutual identification – in South Korea, the image of the US as ‘the only conceivable protector against aggression from the North,’ and in the United States, an image of itself as protector of an allied nation now vulnerable to an ‘evil’ state suspected of transferring weapons of mass destruction to terrorist networks (Suh, 2004). Kang, in contrast, emphasizes how South Korea has become less enthusiastic about its ties with the United States – as indicated by domestic protests and the rejection of TMD – and points out that Seoul is not arming against a potential land invasion from China but rather maritime threats (Kang, 2003, pp.79–80). These observations are valid, but they can be explained by hierarchical deference toward the United States, rather than China. The ROK's military orientation reflects its identification with and dependence on the United States and its adoption of US' strategic aims. In spite of its primary concern with the North Korean threat, Seoul's formal strategic orientation is toward maritime threats, in line with Washington's regional strategy. Furthermore, recent South Korean Defense White Papers habitually cited a remilitarized Japan as a key threat. The best means of coping with such a threat would be continued reliance on the US security umbrella and on Washington's ability to restrain Japanese remilitarization (Eberstadt et al., 2007). Thus, while the United States–ROK bilateral relationship is not always easy, its durability is based on South Korea's fundamental acceptance of the United States as the region's primary state and reliance on it to defend and keep regional order. It also does not rule out Seoul and other US allies conducting business and engaging diplomatically with China. India has increasingly adopted a similar strategy vis-à-vis China in recent years. Given its history of territorial and political disputes with China and its contemporary economic resurgence, India is seen as the key potential power balancer to a growing China. Yet, India has sought to negotiate settlements about border disputes with China, and has moved significantly toward developing closer strategic relations with the United States. Apart from invigorated defense cooperation in the form of military exchange programs and joint exercises, the key breakthrough was the agreement signed in July 2005 which facilitates renewed bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation (Mohan, 2007). Once again, this is a key regional power that could have balanced more directly and independently against China, but has rather chosen to align itself or bandwagon with the primary power, the United States, partly because of significant bilateral gains, but fundamentally in order to support the latter's regional order-managing function. Recognizing a regional hierarchy and seeing that the lower layers of this hierarchy have become more active since the mid-1970s also allows us to understand why there has been no outright balancing of China by regional states since the 1990s. On the one hand, the US position at the top of the hierarchy has been revived since the mid-1990s, meaning that deterrence against potential Chinese aggression is reliable and in place.14 On the other hand, the aim of regional states is to try to consolidate China's inclusion in the regional hierarchy at the level below that of the United States, not to keep it down or to exclude it. East Asian states recognize that they cannot, without great cost to themselves, contain Chinese growth. But they hope to socialize China by enmeshing it in peaceful regional norms and economic and security institutions. They also know that they can also help to ensure that the capabilities gap between China and the United States remains wide enough to deter a power transition. Because this strategy requires persuading China about the appropriateness of its position in the hierarchy and of the legitimacy of the US position, all East Asian states engage significantly with China, with the small Southeast Asian states refusing openly to ‘choose sides’ between the United States and China. Yet, hierarchical deference continues to explain why regional institutions such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN + 3, and East Asian Summit have made limited progress. While the United State has made room for regional multilateral institutions after the end of the Cold War, its hierarchical preponderance also constitutes the regional order to the extent that it cannot comfortably be excluded from any substantive strategic developments. On the part of some lesser states (particularly Japan and Singapore), hierarchical deference is manifested in inclusionary impulses (or at least impulses not to exclude the United States or US proxies) in regional institutions, such as the East Asia Summit in December 2005. Disagreement on this issue with others, including China and Malaysia, has stymied potential progress in these regional institutions (Malik, 2006). Finally, conceiving of a US-led East Asian hierarchy amplifies our understanding of how and why the United States–China relationship is now the key to regional order. The vital nature of the Sino-American relationship stems from these two states' structural positions. As discussed earlier, China is the primary second-tier power in the regional hierarchy. However, as Chinese power grows and Chinese activism spreads beyond Asia, the United States is less and less able to see China as merely a regional power – witness the growing concerns about Chinese investment and aid in certain African countries. This causes a disjuncture between US global interests and US regional interests. Regional attempts to engage and socialize China are aimed at mediating its intentions. This process, however, cannot stem Chinese growth, which forms the material basis of US threat perceptions. Apprehensions about the growth of China's power culminates in US fears about the region being ‘lost’ to China, echoing Cold War concerns that transcribed regional defeats into systemic setbacks.15 On the other hand, the US security strategy post-Cold War and post-9/11 have regional manifestations that disadvantage China. The strengthening of US alliances with Japan and Australia; and the deployment of US troops to Central, South, and Southeast Asia all cause China to fear a consolidation of US global hegemony that will first threaten Chinese national security in the regional context and then stymie China's global reach. Thus, the key determinants of the East Asian security order relate to two core questions: (i) Can the US be persuaded that China can act as a reliable ‘regional stakeholder’ that will help to buttress regional stability and US global security aims;16 and (ii) can China be convinced that the United States has neither territorial ambitions in Asia nor the desire to encircle China, but will help to promote Chinese development and stability as part of its global security strategy? (Wang, 2005). But, these questions cannot be asked in the abstract, outside the context of negotiation about their relative positions in the regional and global hierarchies. One urgent question for further investigation is how the process of assurance and deference operate at the topmost levels of a hierarchy? When we have two great powers of unequal strength but contesting claims and a closing capabilities gap in the same regional hierarchy, how much scope for negotiation is there, before a reversion to balancing dynamics? This is the main structural dilemma: as long as the United States does not give up its primary position in the Asian regional hierarchy, China is very unlikely to act in a way that will provide comforting answers to the two questions. Yet, the East Asian regional order has been and still is constituted by US hegemony, and to change that could be extremely disruptive and may lead to regional actors acting in highly destabilizing ways. Rapid Japanese remilitarization, armed conflict across the Taiwan Straits, Indian nuclear brinksmanship directed toward Pakistan, or a highly destabilized Korean peninsula are all illustrative of potential regional disruptions. 5. Conclusion To construct a coherent account of East Asia's evolving security order, I have suggested that the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates is the central force in constituting regional stability and order. The major patterns of equilibrium and turbulence in the region since 1945 can be explained by the relative stability of the US position at the top of the regional hierarchy, with periods of greatest insecurity being correlated with greatest uncertainty over the American commitment to managing regional order. Furthermore, relationships of hierarchical assurance and hierarchical deference explain the unusual character of regional order in the post-Cold War era. However, the greatest contemporary challenge to East Asian order is the potential conflict between China and the United States over rank ordering in the regional hierarchy, a contest made more potent because of the inter-twining of regional and global security concerns. Ultimately, though, investigating such questions of positionality requires conceptual lenses that go beyond basic material factors because it entails social and normative questions. How can China be brought more into a leadership position, while being persuaded to buy into shared strategic interests and constrain its own in ways that its vision of regional and global security may eventually be reconciled with that of the United States and other regional players? How can Washington be persuaded that its central position in the hierarchy must be ultimately shared in ways yet to be determined? The future of the East Asian security order is tightly bound up with the durability of the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates' global leadership and regional domination. At the regional level, the main scenarios of disruption are an outright Chinese challenge to US leadership, or the defection of key US allies, particularly Japan. Recent history suggests, and the preceding analysis has shown, that challenges to or defections from US leadership will come at junctures where it <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">appears that the US commitment to the region is in doubt,</span> which in turn destabilizes the hierarchical order. At the global level, American geopolitical over-extension will be the key cause of change. This is the one factor that could lead to both greater regional and global turbulence, if only by the attendant strategic uncertainly triggering off regional challenges or defections. However, it is notoriously difficult to gauge thresholds of over-extension. More positively, East Asia is a region that has adjusted to previous periods of uncertainty about US primacy. Arguably, the regional consensus over the United States as primary state in a system of benign hierarchy could accommodate a shifting of the strategic burden to US allies like Japan and Australia as a means of systemic preservation. The alternatives that could surface as a result of not doing so would appear to be much worse.</strong><br />

6. Interstate War, Down but Far from Out Logically, the reverse side of the coin which proclaims a trend favoring political violence internal to states is the claim that interstate warfare is becoming, or has become, a historical curiosity. Steven Metz and Raymond Millen assure us that “most armed conflicts in coming decades are likely to be internal ones.”21 <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">That</span></span> is probably a safe prediction, though one might choose to be troubled by their prudent hedging with the qualifier “most.” Their plausible claim would look a little different in hindsight were it to prove true except for a mere one or two interstate nuclear conflicts, say between India and Pakistan, or North Korea and the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates and its allies. The same authors also offer the comforting judgment that “decisive war between major states is rapidly moving toward history’s dustbin.”22 It is an attractive claim; it is a shame that it is wrong. War, let alone “decisive war,” between major states currently is enjoying an off-season for one main reason: So extreme is the imbalance of military power in favor of the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates that potential rivals rule out policies that might lead to hostilities with the superpower. It is fashionable to argue that major interstate war is yesterday’s problem—recall that the yesterday in question is barely 15 years in the past—because now there is nothing to fight about and nothing to be gained by armed conflict. Would that those points were true; unfortunately they are not. The menace of major, if not necessarily decisive, interstate war will return to frighten us when great-power rivals <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">feel able to challenge American hegemony</span>. If you read Thucydides, or Donald Kagan, you will be reminded of the deadly and eternal influence of the triad of motives for war: “fear, honor, and interest.”23 <br />

 <strong>SKFTA key to US trade leadership</strong><br />
<strong>Bacchus, 12/30</strong> – chairman, Global Trade and Investment Practice Group, Greenberg Traurig (James, 12/30/10, “Reviving U.S. Power Abroad From Within,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4840:http://www.cfr.org/publication/23701/reviving_us_power_abroad_from_within.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/23701/reviving_us_power_abroad_from_within.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/23701/reviving_us_power_abroad_from_within.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4840 -->) <br />
<br />
But the president may be beginning to realize -- if he did not before -- that trade is not only about exports; it is about how exports and imports can combine in an international division of labor to create more overall prosperity for the entire world. Creating such prosperity requires much more than merely export incentives and export promotion; it requires increased market access everywhere. <br />
This is why, in the past, Democratic and Republican presidents alike have made securing more market access by lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers to international trade the bipartisan cornerstone of U.S. trade policy. And this is why Obama will be driven to do the same in 2011. <br />
He got a head start toward yearend when the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates and South Korea resolved their longstanding differences over auto trade. This could lead to congressional approval early in the new year of the long-delayed free trade agreement between the two countries. Approval of the trade agreement with South Korea could also pave the way toward approval of long-pending free trade agreements with Colombia and Panama. <br />
This in turn could open the political door, at long last, to renewed American leadership in breaking the deadlock in the decade-long Doha Development Round of global trade negotiations among the more than 150 member countries of the World Trade Organization. By far the best way of creating more market access worldwide for U.S. goods and services -- and more American jobs through more trade -- is by lowering trade barriers worldwide among all WTO members. <br />
Although it is not at all clear where &quot;Tea Party&quot; Republicans stand on trade, Republican control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the new Congress should ease the way for all of this politically and could give the president yet another opportunity for achieving bipartisan success in the new year. <br />
<br />
<strong>Extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Dreier, 1/5</strong> – Rep. Chairman of the House Rules Committee (Rep. David Dreier, 1/5/11, Politico, “Bipartisanship can revive economy,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0111/47044.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0111/47044.html</a>, JMP) <br />
<br />
There are no higher priorities for our country right now than job creation and economic growth. <br />
As the new Congress begins, every decision we make must be tied directly to those goals. If we are going to get our economy back on track, we need to take several key steps. These include making the current tax rates permanent, repealing the job-killing health care law and dramatically reducing federal spending. <br />
Some of these efforts will divide Congress politically. But they are all a part of what House Republicans pledged we would do — and of what the American people expect us to do. <br />
At the same time, there are areas in which both parties can work together. A strong trade agenda presents a unique opportunity to promote economic growth, global partnerships and bipartisan cooperation. <br />
Unfortunately, the trade agenda has been allowed to languish for the past four years and, in some cases, has been thwarted. In the meantime, our economy and our global prestige have suffered. There’s never been a more important time to re-engage on trade. <br />
Trade is often blamed for every manner of society’s ills. Globally connected commerce has been accused of having a hand in everything from terrorism to pandemics. In December, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez blamed it for the tragic mudslides that claimed dozens of lives in his nation and in Colombia. <br />
Setting aside the disservice that such a claim does for addressing the true root causes of the great challenges we face, the reality of the role of trade is precisely the opposite of what this viewpoint presents. International trade plays an important part in improving a nation’s circumstances — far beyond the immediate scope of exports and imports. <br />
Given the current climate, the direct economic impact is the most urgent. Opening up new markets for U.S. producers, farmers, service providers and investors is essential for spurring growth and creating new job opportunities for both union and nonunion workers here at home. The three markets with which we have pending free-trade agreements — Colombia, Panama and South Korea — represent 96 million consumers and $1.8 trillion in economic activity. The opportunity for U.S. job creators is enormous, so the delay in the agreements’ consideration is unjustifiable. <br />
The benefits of trade, however, extend considerably beyond job creation and economic growth. Economic engagement across borders builds the strong global partnerships that are necessary to address the challenges of the 21st century. Whether the issue is tariffs or nuclear proliferation, the trust and spirit of collaboration forged through economic ties help the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates advance its interests and spread its values around the globe. <br />
Enhancing prosperity through international trade also creates the resources necessary for essential efforts like improving environmental quality, protecting human rights and building democratic institutions. Raising living standards, in fact, helps alleviate many of society’s ills, including terrorism, pandemics and, yes, even the ability to respond to natural disasters in South America. <br />
Reviving the trade agenda also helps with another challenge: partisan politics. Trade once enjoyed a strong bipartisan consensus. The last time there was a new Republican majority, we were enthusiastic about working with then-President Bill Clinton on the trade agenda. That collaboration produced some of the biggest bipartisan achievements of the 1990s. <br />
We are eager, again, to join with a Democratic president in revitalizing America’s global leadership role in trade liberalization. <br />
President Barack Obama has demonstrated a commitment to expanding trade by finalizing negotiations on a side agreement with South Korea, as well as through his National Export Initiative. Republicans stand ready as committed partners in these efforts to create new opportunities for Americans through greater international trade. <br />
By working together to pass our three pending free-trade agreements and re-engaging in the bilateral, regional and multilateral negotiations that have languished, we can revive our stagnant job market and sluggish economy. We can re-energize our relationships with key international partners. <br />
What’s more, we can demonstrate that Republicans and Democrats can come together for the sake of our economy and our country. Though many of the issues the 112th Congress faces will inevitably lead to a clash of ideas, both parties can and should work together with a renewed commitment to economic growth and <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">global leadership</span> through trade. <br />

<br />
Buried beneath the daily stories about car bombs and insurgents is an underappreciated but comforting fact during this Christmas season: The world has somehow become a more peaceful place. <br />
As one little-noticed headline on an Associated Press story recently reported, <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">&quot;War declining worldwide, studies say.&quot;</span> According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the number of armed conflicts around the world has been in decline for the past half century. In just the past 15 years, ongoing conflicts have dropped from 33 to 18, with all of them now <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">civil conflicts within countries.</span> As 2005 draws to an end, no two nations in the world are at war with each other. The death toll from war has also been falling. According to the AP story, &quot;The number killed in battle has fallen to its lowest point in the post-World War II period, dipping below 20,000 a year by one measure. Peacemaking missions, meanwhile, are growing in number.&quot; Those estimates are down sharply from annual tolls ranging from 40,000 to 100,000 in the 1990s, and from a peak of 700,000 in 1951 during the Korean War. Many causes lie behind the good news -- the end of the Cold War and the spread of democracy, among them -- but expanding trade and globalization appear to be playing a major role. Far from stoking a &quot;World on Fire,&quot; as one misguided American author has argued, growing commercial ties between nations have had a dampening effect on armed conflict and war, for three main reasons. First, trade and globalization have reinforced the trend toward democracy, and democracies don't pick fights with each other. Freedom to trade nurtures democracy by expanding the middle class in globalizing countries and equipping people with tools of communication such as cell phones, satellite TV, and the Internet. With trade comes more travel, more contact with people in other countries, and more exposure to new ideas. Thanks in part to globalization, almost two thirds of the world's countries today are democracies -- a record high. Second, as national economies become more integrated with each other, those nations have more to lose should war break out. War in a globalized world not only means human casualties and bigger government, but also ruptured trade and investment ties that impose lasting damage on the economy. In short, globalization has dramatically raised the economic cost of war. Third, globalization allows nations to acquire wealth through production and trade rather than conquest of territory and resources. Increasingly, wealth is measured in terms of intellectual property, financial assets, and human capital. Those are assets that cannot be seized by armies. If people need resources outside their national borders, say oil or timber or farm products, they can acquire them peacefully by trading away what they can produce best at home. Of course, free trade and globalization do not guarantee peace. Hot-blooded nationalism and ideological fervor can overwhelm cold economic calculations. But deep trade and investment ties among nations make war less attractive. Trade wars in the 1930s deepened the economic depression, exacerbated <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">global tensions,</span> and helped to <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">usher in a world war.</span> Out of the ashes of that experience, the United States urged Germany, France and other Western European nations to form a common market that has become the European Union. In large part because of their intertwined economies, a general war in Europe is now unthinkable. In East Asia, the extensive and growing economic ties among Mainland China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan is helping to keep the peace. China's communist rulers may yet decide to go to war over its &quot;renegade province,&quot; but the economic cost to their economy would be staggering and could provoke a backlash among its citizens. In contrast, poor and isolated North Korea is all the more dangerous because it has nothing to lose economically should it provoke a war. In Central America, countries that were racked by guerrilla wars and death squads two decades ago have turned not only to democracy but to expanding trade, culminating in the Central American Free Trade Agreement with the United States. As the Stockholm institute reports in its 2005 Yearbook, &quot;Since the 1980s, the introduction of a more open economic model in most states of the Latin American and Caribbean region has been accompanied by the growth of new regional structures, the dying out of interstate conflicts and a reduction in intra-state conflicts.&quot; Much of the political violence that remains in the world today is concentrated in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa -- the two regions of the world that are the least integrated into the global economy. Efforts to bring peace to those regions must include lowering their high barriers to trade, foreign investment, and domestic entrepreneurship. Advocates of free trade and globalization have long argued that trade expansion means more efficiency, higher incomes, and reduced poverty. The welcome decline of armed conflicts in the past few decades indicates that free trade also comes with its own peace dividend.<br />

<strong>The affirmative’s attempt to moralize politics inevitably fails—it only risks breeding the violence they try to prevent</strong><br />
<strong>William Rasch, Germanic Studies – Indiana, ‘4</strong> (Sovereignty and its Discontents p. 3-4) <br />
<br />
It is true, of course, that within the leftist tradition, especially as represented by the eschatological strains of Marxism, the political has often been thought of in ways similar to Milbank’s, as, that is, the vehicle by means of which social reality can be so altered as to match utopian expectation; and perhaps this nostalgia for infinite perfectibility accounts for the appeal of the ontological hope offered there and elsewhere in recent political philosophy. When viewed as a path to secularized salvation, the political must at least implicitly be thought of as a self-consuming artifact. Once imperfect reality and perfect expectation are ‘reconciled’, the purpose of this manner of imagining the political has been fulfilled and can cease to exist. On this more traditionally accepted view, then, even if the process of reconciliation is considered to be infinite and never to be completed, the political must be seen as a constitutively non-essential and negative feature of social life, a feature that reflects undesired imperfection. Thus, at the imagined fulfillment of reconciliation, politics, along with other sins of the world, simply vanishes. In a world that sees perfection as its goal, the end of politics is the end of politics. Given the experiences of the 20th century, both the totalitarian abolition of the political, and the more recent liberal legalization and moralization of politics, the non-Heideggerian and non-Deleuzian Left ought to be more than a little leery of the eschatological promise of a ‘completely new politics’ (Agamben, 1998, p 11). Dreams of a truer, more authentic ontology, of a more natural expression of human desire, a more spontaneous efflorescence of human productivity and re-productivity, feed rather than oppose the contemporary compulsive lurch toward universal pacification and total management of global economic and political life. Rather than dream those dreams, we should return to more sober insights about the ineluctability of conflict that not only calls the political into being but also structures it as a contingent, resilient, and necessary form of perpetual disagreement (Rancier 1999). To claim the primacy of ‘guilt’ over ‘innocence’ or disharmony over harmony does not imply a glorification of violence for its own sake. It merely registers a pragmatic insight, namely, that assuming incommensurate conflict as an ineradicable feature of social life leads to more benign human institutions than the impossible attempt to instantiate the shimmering City of God on the rocky hills and sodden valleys that form the environment of the various cities of men and women on this very real and insurmountable terrestrial plain. The political does not exist to usher in the good life by eliminating social antagonism; rather, it exists to serve as the medium for an acceptably limited and therefore productive conflict in the inevitable absence of any final, universally accepted vision of the good life. The political, therefore, can only be defined by a structure that allows for the perpetual production as well as contingent resolution of dissent and opposition. If conflict is its vocation, then maintaining the possibility of conflict and thus the possibility of opposition ought to be our vocation, especially in an age when the managers of our lives carry out their actions in the name of democracy, while the majority of their weary subjects no longer even register what those actions are. <br />

<br />
Most importantly, and related to this concern, there is the relation of the concept of humanity to ‘the other’, and to war and violence. In its historical location, the humanity concept had critical purchase against aristocratic prerogatives; yet its utilisation by liberal ethical discourses within a philosophy of an ‘absolute humanity’, Schmitt feared, could bring about new and unimaginable modes of exclusion (1996a, 2003, 2004/2007): By virtue of its universality and abstract normativity, it has no localizable polis, no clear distinction between what is inside and what is outside. Does humanity embrace all humans? Are there no gates to the city and thus no barbarians outside? If not, against whom or what does it wage its wars? (Rasch 2003: 135). ‘Humanity as such’, Schmitt noted, ‘cannot wage war because it has no enemy’, (1996a: 54), indicating that humanity ‘is a polemical word that negates its opposite’ (Kennedy 1998: 94; emphasis added). In The Concept of the Political Schmitt argued that humanity ‘excludes the concept of the enemy, because the enemy does not cease to be a human being’ (1996a: 54). However, in his 1950 book with an international focus, The Nomos of the Earth, Schmitt noted how only when ‘man appeared to be the embodiment of absolute humanity, did the other side of this concept appear in the form of a new enemy: the inhuman’ (2003a: 104). It becomes apparent that, historically examined, the concept of humanity engenders a return to a ‘discriminatory concept of war’, by which Schmitt meant that it reintroduces the legitimacy and need for substantive causes of justice in war (Schmitt 2003b: 37-52). This in turn disallows the notion of justus hostis, of a ‘just enemy’ – explored in section three – associated with the notion of non-discriminatory interstate war which took the shape of guerre en forme (Schmitt 2003a: 142-144). The concept of humanity, therefore, shatters the formal concept of justus hostis, allowing the enemy to now be designated substantively as an enemy of humanity as such. This leaves the enemy of humanity with no value and open to dehumanisation and political and physical annihilation (Schmitt 2004: 67). In discussing the League of Nations, Schmitt highlights that, compared to the kinds of wars that can be waged on behalf of humanity, the interstate European wars from 1815 to 1914 in reality were regulated; they were bracketed by the neutral Great Powers and were completely legal procedures in comparison with the modern and gratuitous police actions against violators of peace, which can be dreadful acts of annihilation (Schmitt 2003a: 186). Enemies of humanity cannot be considered ‘just and equal’. Moreover, they cannot claim neutrality: one cannot remain neutral in the call to be for or against humanity or its freedom; one cannot, similarly, claim a right to resist or defend oneself, in the sense we understand this right to have existed in the international law of Europe (the jus publicum Europeaum). Such a denial of self-defence and resistance ‘can presage a dreadful nihilistic destruction of all law’ (ibid.: 187). When the enemy is not accorded a procedural justice and formal equality, the notion that peace can be made with him is unacceptable, as Schmitt detailed through his study of the League of Nations, which had declared the abolition of war, but in rescinding the concept of neutrality only succeeded in the ‘dissolution of “peace”’ (ibid.: 246). It is with the dissolution of peace that total wars of annihilation become possible, where ‘the other’ cannot be assimilated, or accommodated, let alone tolerated: the friend/enemy distinction is not longer taking place with a justus hostis but rather between good and evil, human and inhuman, where ‘the negative pole of the distinction is to be fully and finally consumed without remainder’ (Rasch 2003: 137). <br />

Such critiques, however, do not negate that there exists ‘an urgent plea for a universal morality’ (Nielsen 1966: 545; cf. Cochran 1999: 206; Booth 1999: 53). Put otherwise, these objections and critiques do not actually articulate the impossibility of an ethics. They are not tantamount to a denial of its need or possibility but variably suggest other, better, paths to ethics: ontological ethics (Benso 1994), originary ethics (Caputo 1989), dialogical ethics (Coles 1992) etc.: that ethics might lie, in other words, in an ‘openness’ (in the sense of disposition, sensibility or even obligation) towards the other (Campbell 1994, 1996; Warner 1996; Odysseos 2003, 2007a). Even political realists are really idealists of prudence. Ethics holds us in captivity to it: we have, as John Caputo accuses Emmanuel Levinas, ‘made ethics into a holy of holies, an inviolable inner sanctum, pure and uncontaminated’ (1993: 125). Yet, the situation is far more ‘polymorphic’ and there are other ‘games’ to play: there is politics, Caputo says (ibid.). Coming from a philosopher particularly interested in the question of ethics (cf. Scott 1990) and working intensively in the Heideggerian and Levinasian traditions, this declaration against (universal, originary, fundamental, etc.) ethics is important. Caputo moves from the question of ethics to the possibility of a notion of obligation that cannot be contained within ethics, which shatters ethics (1993). Caputo’s injunction begs the question: might we conceive of a different trajectory? Can we today speak against ethics, hope for an anti-ethics? This paper situates itself in much this vein of thinking, yet by further specifying and refocussing its domain of concern: to speak against ethics, to hope for an anti-ethics, is to listen to the demands of and for politics. The paper examines Carl Schmitt’s particular, if increasingly familiar, critique of universal ethics. This critique argues that, in as much as ethics is predicated on the discourse of a universal humanity (and its human rights), it produces and objectifies the other as the inhuman, which then becomes the proper object of annihilation as the enemy of humanity (Schmitt 1996a, 2003, 2004; Rasch 2003; Odysseos 2007b). The paper extends this critique to include the ways in which the discourse of humanity transforms itself in the era of global governmentality into ‘biopolitical care of the living’, taking ‘population’ as its privileged object (Foucault 2001, 2007a), and leading to an governmental stance that the paper analyses as the ethics and politics of the subject of (enforced) freedom. Inherent, too, in this governmental transformation of universal ethics is the figure of the enemy.<br />

Nor can economic crises explain the bloodshed. What may be the most familiar causal chain in modern historiography links the Great Depression to the rise of fascism and the outbreak of World War II. But that simple story leaves too much out. Nazi Germany started the war in Europe only after its economy had recovered. Not all the countries affected by the Great Depression were taken over by fascist regimes, nor did all such regimes start wars of aggression. In fact, no general relationship between economics and conflict is discernible for the century as a whole. Some wars came after periods of growth, others were the causes rather than the consequences of economic catastrophe, and some severe economic crises were not followed by wars. <br />

<strong>Global economy is resilient</strong><br />
<strong>Behravesh, PhD in economics, 7—</strong>PhD and MA in economics, U Penn. BSC, MIT. (Nariman, updated 9/15, The Great Shock Absorber, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4845:http://www.newsweek.com/id/47483/output/print --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/47483/output/print" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsweek.com/id/47483/output/print</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4845 -->, AG) <br />
<br />
The U.S. and global economies were able to withstand three body blows in 2005--one of the worst tsunamis on record (which struck at the very end of 2004), one of the worst hurricanes on record and the highest energy prices after Hurricane Katrina--without missing a beat. This resilience was especially remarkable in the case of the United States, which since 2000 has been able to shrug off the biggest stock-market drop since the 1930s, a major terrorist attack, corporate scandals and war. Does this mean that recessions are a relic of the past? No, but recent events do suggest that the global economy's &quot;immune system&quot; is now strong enough to absorb shocks that 25 years ago would probably have triggered a downturn. In fact, over the past two decades, recessions have not disappeared, but have become considerably milder in many parts of the world. What explains this enhanced recession resistance? The answer: a combination of good macroeconomic policies and improved microeconomic flexibility. Since the mid-1980s, central banks worldwide have had great success in taming inflation. This has meant that long-term interest rates are at levels not seen in more than 40 years. A low-inflation and low-interest-rate environment is especially conducive to sustained, robust growth. Moreover, central bankers have avoided some of the policy mistakes of the earlier oil shocks (in the mid-1970s and early 1980s), during which they typically did too much too late, and exacerbated the ensuing recessions. Even more important, in recent years the Fed has been particularly adept at crisis management, aggressively cutting interest rates in response to stock-market crashes, terrorist attacks and weakness in the economy. The benign inflationary picture has also benefited from increasing competitive pressures, both worldwide (thanks to globalization and the rise of Asia as a manufacturing juggernaut) and domestically (thanks to technology and deregulation). Since the late 1970s, the United States, the United Kingdom and a handful of other countries have been especially aggressive in deregulating their financial and industrial sectors. This has greatly increased the flexibility of their economies and reduced their vulnerability to inflationary shocks. Looking ahead, what all this means is that a global or U.S. recession will likely be avoided in 2006, and probably in 2007 as well. Whether the current expansion will be able to break the record set in the 1990s for longevity will depend on the ability of central banks to keep the inflation dragon at bay and to avoid policy mistakes. The prospects look good. Inflation is likely to remain a low-level threat for some time, and Ben Bernanke, the incoming chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, spent much of his academic career studying the past mistakes of the Fed and has vowed not to repeat them. At the same time, no single shock will likely be big enough to derail the expansion. What if oil prices rise to $80 or $90 a barrel? Most estimates suggest that growth would be cut by about 1 percent--not good, but no recession. What if U.S. house prices fall by 5 percent in 2006 (an extreme assumption, given that house prices haven't fallen nationally in any given year during the past four decades)? Economic growth would slow by about 0.5 percent to 1 percent. What about another terrorist attack? Here the scenarios can be pretty scary, but an attack on the order of 9/11 or the Madrid or London bombings would probably have an even smaller impact on overall GDP growth. <br />

<span style="margin-right: .2in;">Using extensive interviews with participants in all three administrations, and memoirs by former officials, they paint a compelling picture of officials often over-whelmed by the challenge of an entirely new reality. The unexpected collapse of communism and of the Soviet Union, coming just after the GulfWar, left them with no road map to understand how Russia and other post-Soviet states might develop. Nightmare scenarios suggested themselves: nuclear war between Russia and Ukraine; weapons proliferation on a terrifying scale; Yugoslav-type ethnically based civil war on the territory of the former Soviet Union; mass starvation; economic collapse--the ominous possibilities were endless. That these &quot;dogs did not bark&quot; is testimony to the unwillingness of people in the post-Soviet space to engage in armed conflict and to Western assistance that staved off famine and economic collapse. The failure of catastrophic scenarios to come about is one indicator of success--but if one were to measure America's contribution to transforming Russia in more positive ways, the evidence is more mixed. If a minimalist definition of success was the absence of catastrophe, the maximalist definition was the creation of a fully functioning democracy in Russia with a transparent market economy and the rule of law. That has not happened yet, and it is unclear when it will. So far, there is no consensus about what would constitute a realistic timetable for Russia's democratic development. </span><br />

<span style="margin-right: .2in;">At the time and since, observers of the events of 1989-1990 in Europe have been properly amazed at what happened and at what did not happen. The Soviet empire collapsed in Eastern Europe. Divided Germany was unified. Democratic governments replaced communist dictatorships in Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union itself imploded and was reincarnated as quasi-democratic, quasi- authoritarian Russia. Yet a unified Germany has not become a menacing Fourth Reich, and Russia, despite a collapse of its economy and the spectacular loss of the Cold War, did not turn in bitterness and frustration to the alliance of nationalists and communists who were seeking to reverse the humiliations of a decade ago </span><br />

<br />
Either way, the fundamental issue remains: Preemption or containment - is a nuclear-armed Iran acceptable if economic sanctions and diplomatic pressures fail? Obama's primary-season supporters would argue that a pre-emptive strike poses far greater danger than a nuclear Iran. Iran, the argument runs, can be &quot;kept in a box,&quot; as happened with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Here are a few problems with that argument: Iran's ruling mullahs and their bombastic, hand-picked president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, are not the Politburo and Nikita Khrushchev. For starters, Soviet leaders had absolute control over their weapons and launch codes. Given the leadership struggle among Iran's military, mullahs and political leadership, control of that nation's nuclear arms would be subject to ongoing internal power plays. This would increase the chance of an &quot;unplanned&quot; launch as well as a weapon falling into the hands of Islamic terrorists. We trusted the Soviets to act rationally and respond rationally to our actions. History proved we were right to do so. Given the radical nature of the Ahmadinejad's regime, his promise to &quot;wipe Israel off the map&quot; and his nation's close theological and military ties to terrorist organizations, we cannot expect the same from the Iranians. Today's nuclear chess game would have three or more nuclear powers, not just two, playing at the same time and exponentially increasing complexity and uncertainty. On top of that the game is being played in a region where brinkmanship and deception are standard operating procedures. <br />

<strong>No Middle East war</strong><br />

Underlying this anxiety was a scenario in which Iraq's sectarian and ethnic violence spills over into neighboring countries, producing conflicts between the major Arab states and Iran as well as Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government. These wars then destabilize the entire region well beyond the current conflict zone, involving heavyweights like Egypt. This is scary stuff indeed, but with the exception of the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds, the scenario is far from an accurate reflection of the way Middle Eastern leaders view the situation in Iraq and calculate their interests there. It is abundantly clear that major outside powers like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey are heavily involved in Iraq. These countries have so much at stake in the future of Iraq that it is natural they would seek to influence political developments in the country. Yet, the Saudis, Iranians, Jordanians, Syrians, and others are very unlikely to go to war either to protect their own sect or ethnic group or to prevent one country from gaining the upper hand in Iraq. The reasons are fairly straightforward. First, Middle Eastern leaders, like politicians everywhere, are primarily interested in one thing: self-preservation. Committing forces to Iraq is an inherently risky proposition, which, if the conflict went badly, could threaten domestic political stability. Moreover, most Arab armies are geared toward regime protection rather than projecting power and thus have little capability for sending troops to Iraq. Second, there is cause for concern about the so-called blowback scenario in which jihadis returning from Iraq destabilize their home countries, plunging the region into conflict. Middle Eastern leaders are preparing for this possibility. Unlike in the 1990s, when Arab fighters in the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union returned to Algeria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia and became a source of instability, Arab security services are being vigilant about who is coming in and going from their countries. In the last month, the Saudi government has arrested approximately 200 people suspected of ties with militants. Riyadh is also building a 700 kilometer wall along part of its frontier with Iraq in order to keep militants out of the kingdom. Finally, there is no precedent for Arab leaders to commit forces to conflicts in which they are not directly involved. The Iraqis and the Saudis did send small contingents to fight the Israelis in 1948 and 1967, but they were either ineffective or never made it. In the 1970s and 1980s, Arab countries other than Syria, which had a compelling interest in establishing its hegemony over Lebanon, never committed forces either to protect the Lebanese from the Israelis or from other Lebanese. The civil war in Lebanon was regarded as someone else's fight. Indeed, this is the way many leaders view the current situation in Iraq. To Cairo, Amman and Riyadh, the situation in Iraq is worrisome, but in the end it is an Iraqi and American fight. As far as Iranian mullahs are concerned, they have long preferred to press their interests through proxies as opposed to direct engagement. At a time when Tehran has access and influence over powerful Shiite militias, a massive cross-border incursion is both unlikely and unnecessary. So Iraqis will remain locked in a sectarian and ethnic struggle that outside powers may abet, but will remain within the borders of Iraq. The Middle East is a region both prone and accustomed to civil wars. But given its experience with ambiguous conflicts, the region has also developed an intuitive ability to contain its civil strife and prevent local conflicts from enveloping the entire Middle East. <br />

Could today's quarrel between the Israelis and Hezbollah over Lebanon produce a Third World War? That's what the former Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, called it last week, echoing earlier fighting talk by Dan Gillerman, Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations. Such language can - for now, at least - safely be dismissed as hyperbole. This crisis is not going to trigger another world war. Indeed, I do not expect it to produce even another Middle Eastern war worthy of comparison with those of June 1967 or October 1973. In 1967, Israel fought four of its Arab neighbours, Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq. In 1973, Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. Such combinations are very hard to imagine today. Nor does it seem to me likely that Syria and Iran will escalate their involvement in the crisis beyond continuing their support for Hezbollah. Neither is in a position to risk a full-scale military confrontation with Israel, given the risk that this might precipitate an American military reaction. Crucially, America's consistent support for Israel is not matched by any great power support for Israel's neighbours.<br />

<br />
There is an &quot;almost vanishingly small&quot; likelihood that terrorists would ever be able to acquire and detonate a nuclear weapon, one expert said here yesterday (see GSN, Dec. 2, 2008). In even the most likely scenario of nuclear terrorism, there are 20 barriers between extremists and a successful nuclear strike on a major city, said John Mueller, a political science professor at Ohio State University. The process itself is seemingly straightforward but exceedingly difficult -- buy or steal highly enriched uranium, manufacture a weapon, take the bomb to the target site and blow it up. Meanwhile, variables strewn across the path to an attack would increase the complexity of the effort, Mueller argued. Terrorists would have to bribe officials in a state nuclear program to acquire the material, while avoiding a sting by authorities or a scam by the sellers. The material itself could also turn out to be bad. &quot;Once the purloined material is purloined, [police are] going to be chasing after you. They are also going to put on a high reward, extremely high reward, on getting the weapon back or getting the fissile material back,&quot; Mueller said during a panel discussion at a two-day Cato Institute conference on counterterrorism issues facing the incoming Obama administration. Smuggling the material out of a country would mean relying on criminals who &quot;are very good at extortion&quot; and might have to be killed to avoid a double-cross, Mueller said. The terrorists would then have to find scientists and engineers willing to give up their normal lives to manufacture a bomb, which would require an expensive and sophisticated machine shop. Finally, further technological expertise would be needed to sneak the weapon across national borders to its destination point and conduct a successful detonation, Mueller said. Every obstacle is &quot;difficult but not impossible&quot; to overcome, Mueller said, putting the chance of success at no less than one in three for each. The likelihood of successfully passing through each obstacle, in sequence, would be roughly one in 3 1/2 billion, he said, but for argument's sake dropped it to 3 1/2 million. &quot;It's a total gamble. This is a very expensive and difficult thing to do,&quot; said Mueller, who addresses the issue at greater length in an upcoming book, <em>Atomic Obsession</em>. &quot;So unlike buying a ticket to the lottery ... you're basically putting everything, including your life, at stake for a gamble that's maybe one in 3 1/2 million or 3 1/2 billion.&quot; Other scenarios are even less probable, Mueller said. A nuclear-armed state is &quot;exceedingly unlikely&quot; to hand a weapon to a terrorist group, he argued: &quot;States just simply won't give it to somebody they can't control.&quot; Terrorists are also not likely to be able to steal a whole weapon, Mueller asserted, dismissing the idea of &quot;loose nukes.&quot; Even Pakistan, which today is perhaps the nation of greatest concern regarding nuclear security, keeps its bombs in two segments that are stored at different locations, he said (see <em>GSN</em>, Jan. 12). Fear of an &quot;extremely improbable event&quot; such as nuclear terrorism produces support for a wide range of homeland security activities, Mueller said. He argued that there has been a major and costly overreaction to the terrorism threat -- noting that the Sept. 11 attacks helped to precipitate the invasion of Iraq, which has led to far more deaths than the original event. Panel moderator Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow at the Cato Institute, said academic and governmental discussions of acts of nuclear or biological terrorism have tended to focus on &quot;worst-case assumptions about terrorists' ability to use these weapons to kill us.&quot; There is need for consideration for what is probable rather than simply what is possible, he said. Friedman took issue with the finding late last year of an experts' report that an act of WMD terrorism would &quot;more likely than not&quot; occur in the next half decade unless the international community takes greater action. &quot;I would say that the report, if you read it, actually offers no analysis to justify that claim, which seems to have been made to change policy by generating alarm in headlines.&quot; One panel speaker offered a partial rebuttal to Mueller's presentation. Jim Walsh, principal research scientist for the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he agreed that nations would almost certainly not give a nuclear weapon to a nonstate group, that most terrorist organizations have no interest in seeking out the bomb, and that it would be difficult to build a weapon or use one that has been stolen. <br />

The argument about terrorist motivation is also important. Terrorists generally have not killed as many as they have been capable of killing. This restraint seems to derive from an understanding of mass casualty attacks as both unnecessary and counterproductive. They are unnecessary because terrorists, by and large, have succeeded by conventional means. Also, they are counterproductive because they might alienate key constituencies, whether among the public, state sponsors, or the terrorist leadership group. In Brian Jenkins' famous words, terrorists want a lot of people watching, not a lot of people dead. Others have argued that the lack of mass casualty terrorism and effective exploitation of BW has been more a matter of accident and good fortune than capability or intent. Adherents of this view, including former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, argue that &quot;it's not a matter of if but when.&quot; The attacks of September 11 would seem to settle the debate about whether terrorists have both the motivation and sophistication to exploit weapons of mass destruction for their full lethal effect. After all, those were terrorist attacks of unprecedented sophistication that seemed clearly aimed at achieving mass casualties--had the World Trade Center towers collapsed as the 1993 bombers had intended, perhaps as many as 150,000 would have died. Moreover, Osama bin Laden's constituency would appear to be not the &quot;Arab street&quot; or some other political entity but his god. And terrorists answerable only to their deity have proven historically to be among the most lethal. But this debate cannot be considered settled. Bin Laden and his followers could have killed many more on September 11 if killing as many as possible had been their primary objective. They now face the core dilemma of asymmetric warfare: how to escalate without creating new interests for the stronger power and thus the incentive to exploit its power potential more fully. Asymmetric adversaries want their stronger enemies fearful, not fully engaged--militarily or otherwise. They seek to win by preventing the stronger partner from exploiting its full potential. To kill millions in America with biological or other weapons would only commit the United States--and much of the rest of the international community--to the annihilation of the perpetrators. <br />

<br />
In the post-9/11 world, “better safe than sorry” has become an article of faith guiding sthe actions we take in the name of preventing terrorism. But are we truly better safe than sorry? To begin, the main reason so many people are willing to accept “better safe than sorry” is because they believe the consequences are too terrible to act otherwise. In other words, we should be willing to do almost anything to prevent another terrorist attack. Although another terrorist attack on the scale of 9/11 – which killed some 3,000 people – would be a great catastrophe and tragedy, it would not be an end-of-the-world event. As a nation, we survived 9/11, and we would (or at least we should) survive if there was another 9/11. That is not to trivialize or marginalize the people killed by the 9/11 attacks (or who would be killed in any future terrorist attacks), but it’s important to understand that terrorism is not an existential threat – otherwise, our responses are disproportionate (in magnitude or cost, or both) to the actual threat. It’s hard to be dispassionate because of the emotionalism surrounding 9/11, but here are some numbers worth considering to put “better safe than sorry” in context when it comes to terrorism. According to the Global Terrorism Database, from 1970 through 2007, there have been 1,347 terrorist incidents in the United States resulting in 3,340 fatalities (2,949 of which were on 9/11) and 2,234 injuries. That’s less than 100 fatalities per year on average (and more like 10 if you exclude 9/11 as an extraordinary event). By way of comparison, consider these 2006 fatality statistics from the the Centers for Disease Control: * Unintentional fall deaths: 20,853 * Motor vehicle traffic deaths: 43,646 * Unintentional poisoning deaths: 27,531 * Homicides: 18,573 * Firearms homicides: 12,791 Put another way, far more people die in a single year from other causes than have died as result of terrorism over a span of more than 35 years. Yet we have a Chicken Little attitude that the sky is falling when it comes to the potential threat of terrorism. <br />

<span style="tab-stops: 13.5pt;">What would happen if there were a new terrorist attack inside the United States on 11 September 2004? How would it affect the presidential election campaign? The conventional wisdom is that Americans - their patriotic defiance aroused - would rally to President George W Bush and make him an all but certain winner in November. But consider the differences between the context of the original 9/11 and that of any attack which might occur this autumn. In 2001, the public reaction was one of disbelief and incomprehension. Many Americans realised for the first time that large-scale terrorist attacks on US soil were not only conceivable; they were, perhaps, inevitable. A majority focused for the first time on the threat from al-Qaeda, on the Taliban and on the extent to which Saudis were involved in terrorism. This time, the public response would move much more quickly from shock to anger; debate over how America should respond would begin immediately. Yet it is difficult to imagine how the Bush administration could focus its response on an external enemy. Should the US send 50,000 troops to the Afghan-Pakistani border to intensify the hunt for Osama Bin Laden and &quot;step up&quot; efforts to attack the heart of al-Qaeda? Many would wonder if that wasn't what the administration pledged to do after the attacks three years ago. The president would face intensified criticism from those who have argued all along that Iraq was a distraction from &quot;the real war on terror&quot;. And what if a significant number of the terrorists responsible for the pre-election attack were again Saudis? The Bush administration could hardly take military action against the Saudi government at a time when crude-oil prices are already more than $45 a barrel and global supply is stretched to the limit. While the Saudi royal family might support a co-ordinated attack against terrorist camps, real or imagined, near the Yemeni border - where recent searches for al-Qaeda have concentrated - that would seem like a trivial, insufficient retaliation for an attack on the US mainland. Remember how the Republicans criticised Bill Clinton's administration for ineffectually &quot;bouncing the rubble&quot; in Afghanistan after the al-Qaeda attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in the 1990s. So what kind of response might be credible? Washington's concerns about Iran are rising. The 9/11 commission report noted evidence of co-operation between Iran and al-Qaeda operatives, if not direct Iranian advance knowledge of the 9/11 hijacking plot. Over the past few weeks, US officials have been more explicit, too, in declaring Iran's nuclear programme &quot;unacceptable&quot;. However, in the absence of an official Iranian claim of responsibility for this hypothetical terrorist attack, the domestic opposition to such a war and the international outcry it would provoke would make quick action against Iran unthinkable. </span><br />

Diplomatic Gains after &quot;September 11&quot;: Taking advantage of the unprecedented moral support extended to the United States by the international community, America has successfully organized an international counter-terrorist alliance, and has gained political dominant power; it has strengthened its relations with its allies, at the same time it has pushed forward its ties with other big powers, particularly US-Russian relations; US troops have entered Central Asia, gone deep into South Asia and returned to Southeast Asia, and further enhanced the superiority of its global strategy. In the anti-terrorist war, it has put into practice its theory of military revolution, and displayed and consolidated its military superiority. Generally speaking, the US status as the superpower has become more prominent after &quot;September 11&quot;.<br />

<br />
Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe 's stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world's great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China 's neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene -- even if it remained the world's most powerful nation -- could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe -- if it adopted what some call a strategy of &quot;offshore balancing&quot; -- this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, &quot;offshore&quot; role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more &quot;even-handed&quot; policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel 's aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn 't change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn 't changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to &quot;normal&quot; or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. <br />

<strong>Terrorist attacks cause seizure of terrorist funding to solve international development</strong><br />
<strong>Krasner 5</strong> – IR prof, Stanford (Stephen The Day After Foreign Policy Jan/Feb, proquest, AG) <br />
<br />
A state's right to control the exploitation of its natural resources (most notably oil) within its territory will be an added casualty. Gone will be the days when the industrialized West provided Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries with hundreds of billions of dollars, some of which was used to support activities that foster terrorism. Economic exigencies, coupled with the widespread acceptance of conventional rules, have made nations reluctant to challenge the sovereignty of exporting states. Not so in a world transformed by megaterrorist attacks. Revenue-generating activities that funded terrorist activities or undermined the stability of nations would be seized and placed under the control of an international agency, such as the World Bank or some new global authority. Export earnings would be used to fund economic progress throughout the developing world. <br />

<strong>Gilligan, prof of psychiatry, 96</strong>—prof of psychiatry at Harvard. Director of the Center for the Study of Violence, and a member of the Academic Advisory Council of the National Campaign Against Youth Violence. [James, <u>Violence: Our Deadly Epidemic and its Causes</u>, p 191-196] <br />
<br />
The deadliest form of violence is poverty. You cannot work for one day with the violent people who fill our prisons and mental hospitals for the criminally insane without being forcible and constantly reminded of the extreme poverty and discrimination that characterizes their lives. Hearing about their lives, and about their families and friends, you are forced to recognize the truth in Gandhi’s observation that the deadliest form of violence is poverty. Not a day goes by without realizing that trying to understand them and their violent behavior in purely individual terms is impossible and wrong-headed. Any theory of violence, especially a psychological theory, that evolves from the experience of men in maximum security prisons and hospitals for the criminally insane must begin with the recognition that these institutions are only microcosms. They are not where the major violence in our society takes place, and the perpetrators who fill them are far from being the main causes of most violent deaths. Any approach to a theory of violence needs to begin with a look at the structural violence in this country. Focusing merely on those relatively few men who commit what we define as murder could distract us from examining and learning from those structural causes of violent death that are far more significant from a numerical or public health, or human, standpoint. By “structural violence” I mean the increased rates of death, and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted with the relatively lower death rates experienced by those who are above them. Those excess deaths (or at least a demonstrably large proportion of them) are a function of class structure; and that structure is itself a product of society’s collective human choices, concerning how to distribute the collective wealth of the society. These are not acts of God. I am contrasting “structural” with “behavioral violence,” by which I mean the non-natural deaths and injuries that are caused by specific behavioral actions of individuals against individuals, such as the deaths we attribute to homicide, suicide, soldiers in warfare, capital punishment, and so on. Structural violence differs from behavioral violence in at least three major respects. *The lethal effects of structural violence operate continuously, rather than sporadically, whereas murders, suicides, executions, wars, and other forms of behavioral violence occur one at a time. *Structural violence operates more or less independently of individual acts; independent of individuals and groups (politicians, political parties, voters) whose decisions may nevertheless have lethal consequences for others. *Structural violence is normally invisible, because it may appear to have had other (natural or violent) causes. The finding that structural violence causes far more deaths than behavioral violence does is not limited to this country. Kohler and Alcock attempted to arrive at the number of excess deaths caused by socioeconomic inequities on a worldwide basis. Sweden was their model of the nation that had come closes to eliminating structural violence. It had the least inequity in income and living standards, and the lowest discrepancies in death rates and life expectancy; and the highest overall life expectancy in the world. When they compared the life expectancies of those living in the other socioeconomic systems against Sweden, they found that 18 million deaths a year could be attributed to the “structural violence” to which the citizens of all the other nations were being subjected. During the past decade, the discrepancies between the rich and poor nations have increased dramatically and alarmingly. The 14 to 18 million deaths a year caused by structural violence compare with about 100,000 deaths per year from armed conflict. Comparing this frequency of deaths from structural violence to the frequency of those caused by major military and political violence, such as World War II (an estimated 49 million military and civilian deaths, including those by genocide—or about eight million per year, 1939-1945), the Indonesian massacre of 1965-66 (perhaps 575,000) deaths), the Vietnam war (possibly two million, 1954-1973), and even a hypothetical nuclear exchange between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. (232 million), it was clear that even war cannot begin to compare with structural violence, which continues year after year. In other words, every fifteen years, on the average, as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed by the Nazi genocide of the Jews over a six-year period. This is, in effect, the equivalent of an ongoing, unending, in fact accelerating, thermonuclear war, or genocide, perpetrated on the weak and poor every year of every decade, throughout the world. Structural violence is also the main cause of behavioral violence on a socially and epidemiologically significant scale (from homicide and suicide to war and genocide). The question as to which of the two forms of violence—structural or behavioral—is more important, dangerous, or lethal is moot, for they are inextricably related to each other, as cause to effect.<br />

Extinction risks constitute an especially severe subset of what could go badly wrong for humanity. There are many possible global catastrophes that would cause immense worldwide damage, maybe even the collapse of modern civilization, yet fall short of terminating the human species. An all-out nuclear war between Russia and the United States might be an example of a global catastrophe that would be unlikely to result in extinction. A terrible pandemic with high virulence and 100% mortality rate among infected individuals might be another example: if some groups of humans could successfully quarantine themselves before being exposed, human extinction could be avoided even if, say, 95% or more of the world's population succumbed. What distinguishes extinction and other existential catastrophes is that a comeback is impossible. A non-existential disaster causing the breakdown of global civilization is, from the perspective of humanity as a whole, a potentially recoverable setback: a giant massacre for man, a small misstep for mankind. <br />

<br />
Even as Russia's nuclear forces deteriorate, the United States is improving its ability to track submarines and mobile missiles, further eroding Russian military leaders' confidence in Russia's nuclear deterrent. (As early as 1998, these leaders publicly expressed doubts about the ability of Russia's ballistic missile submarines to evade U.S. detection.) Moreover, Moscow has announced plans to reduce its land-based ICBM force by another 35 percent by 2010; outside experts predict that the actual cuts will slice 50 to 75 percent off the current force, possibly leaving Russia with as few as 150 ICBMs by the end of the decade, down from its 1990 level of almost 1,300 missiles. The more Russia's nuclear arsenal shrinks, the easier it will become for the United States to carry out a first strike. To determine how much the nuclear balance has changed since the Cold War, we ran a computer model of a hypothetical U.S. attack on Russia's nuclear arsenal using the standard unclassified formulas that defense analysts have used for decades. We assigned U.S. nuclear warheads to Russian targets on the basis of two criteria: the most accurate weapons were aimed at the hardest targets, and the fastest-arriving weapons at the Russian forces that can react most quickly. Because Russia is essentially blind to a submarine attack from the Pacific and would have great difficulty detecting the approach of low-flying stealthy nuclear-armed cruise missiles, we targeted each Russian weapon system with at least one submarine-based warhead or cruise missile. An attack organized in this manner would give Russian leaders virtually no warning. This simple plan is presumably less effective than Washington's actual strategy, which the U.S. government has spent decades perfecting. The real U.S. war plan may call for first targeting Russia's command and control, sabotaging Russia's radar stations, or taking other preemptive measures -- all of which would make the actual U.S. force far more lethal than our model assumes. According to our model, such a simplified surprise attack would have a good chance of destroying every Russian bomber base, submarine, and ICBM. [See Footnote #1] This finding is not based on best-case assumptions or an unrealistic scenario in which U.S. missiles perform perfectly and the warheads hit their targets without fail. Rather, we used standard assumptions to estimate the likely inaccuracy and unreliability of U.S. weapons systems. Moreover, our model indicates that all of Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal would still be destroyed even if U.S. weapons were 20 percent less accurate than we assumed, or if U.S. weapons were only 70 percent reliable, or if Russian ICBM silos were 50 percent &quot;harder&quot; (more reinforced, and hence more resistant to attack) than we expected. (Of course, the unclassified estimates we used may understate the capabilities of U.S. forces, making an attack even more likely to succeed.) <br />

Armed conflict between the United States and Russia is neither inevitable nor likely. Indeed, Mikhail Delyagin, an adviser to former Russian Prime Minister Evgeny Primakov, says a struggle with the West in general it is not in the interests of Russian elites. He spoke through an interpreter. &quot;Representatives of the ruling groups have their bank accounts in the West. And the second point is to understand that the Russian army does not exist and the Russian economy is extremely weak. Our Black Sea fleet is not even at the level of the forces of Bulgaria and Romania,&quot; he said. One of the panel members at the Hudson Institute conference, Moscow political analyst Andrei Piontkovsky, says Russia and the United States, dominant powers of the 20th Century, now need to cooperate with one another. &quot;In the 21st century, both the West and Russia are in a much more vulnerable position. We are both challenged by Islamic radicalism, and then, maybe more long term and less obvious, but maybe more dangerous -- the potential challenge of a rising China,&quot; he said. Russian journalist Evgeny Kiselyev agrees that the United States and Russia have common interests. <br />

Farther East, and despite its economic recovery and the restoration of central power under Putin, Russia remains overwhelmingly dependent on the current boom in energy and commodity prices—and correspondingly vulnerable in the event of their decline. The country suffers from pervasive corruption, with a ranking from Transparency International that puts it at 121 among 163 countries in this category. Its population, already less than half that of the U.S. and plagued with alcoholism, chronic violence, a decrepit health-care system, and a male life expectancy of fewer than 60 years of age (lower than that of Bangladesh), shrinks by some half a million people per year. And its army, while bidding for attention and resources, remains weak and in disarray. As The Economist recently summarized Putin’s Russia, it has become one of the most “criminalized, corrupt and bureaucratized countries in the world.” True, the Putin regime plays to its domestic base with strident nationalism and xenophobia. In doing so, it has actively opposed and occasionally subverted American policies on some issues while providing a degree of cooperation on others. Instances of the former include opposition to NATO enlargement and to the stationing of anti-missile systems in Poland and the Czech Republic, the use of oil and gas resources as leverage against neighboring countries, overt and covert pressure against former Soviet Republics, and arms sales to Syria and Iran. Yet Moscow grudgingly collaborates where it has shared concerns, as with North Korea and combating terrorism. Russia presents a problem for the United States, but its erratic behavior, its priorities at home, and its own internal decline put it well short of being a major power challenger.<br />

<strong>Realism is true and inevitable – trying to shift away by reducing military presence causes great power war</strong><br />
<strong>Mearsheimer 1</strong> [professor of political science at University of Chicago, <em>The Tragedy of Great Power Politics</em>, pg. 361] <br />
<br />
The optimists' claim that security competition and war among the great powers has been burned out of the system is wrong. In fact, all of the major states around the globe still care deeply about the balance of power and are destined to compete for power among themselves for the foreseeable future. Consequently, realism will offer the most powerful explanations of international politics over the next century, and this will be true even if the debates among academic and policy elites are dominated by non-realist theories. In short, the real world remains a realist world. States still fear each other and seek to gain power at each other's expense, because international anarchy-the driving force behind greatpower behavior-did not change with the end of the Cold War, and there are few signs that such change is likely any time soon. States remain the principal actors in world politics and there is still no night watchman standing above them. For sure, the collapse of the Soviet Union caused a major shift in the global distribution of power. But it did not give rise to a change in the anarchic structure of the system, and without that kind of profound change, there is no reason to expect the great powers to behave much differently in the new century than they did in previous centuries. Indeed, considerable evidence from the 1990s indicates that power politics has not disappeared from Europe and Northeast Asia, the regions in which there are two or more great powers, as well as possible great powers such as Germany and Japan. There is no question, however, that the competition for power over the past decade has been low-key. Still, there is potential for intense security competion among the great powers that might lead to a major war. Probably the best evidence of that possibility is the fact that the United States maintains about one hundred thousand troops each in Europe and in Northeast Asia for the explicit purpose of keeping the major states in each region at peace. <br />

<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">If major interstate war is predominantly a product of a synergy between a potential nondemocratic aggressor and an absence of effective deterrence, what is the role of the many traditional &quot;causes&quot; of war? Past, and many contemporary, theories of war have focused on the role of specific disputes between nations, ethnic and religious differences, arms races, poverty and social injustice, competition for resources, incidents and accidents, greed, fear, perceptions of &quot;honor,&quot; and many other factors. Such factors may well play a role in motivating aggression or generating fear and manipulating public opinion. The reality, however, is that while some of these factors may have more potential to contribute to war than others, there may well be an infinite set of motivating factors, or human wants, motivating aggression. It is not the independent existence of such motivating factors for war but rather the circumstances permitting or encouraging high-risk decisions leading to war that is the key to more effectively controlling armed conflict. And the same may also be true of democide. The early focus in the Rwanda slaughter on &quot;ethnic conflict,&quot; as though Hutus and Tutsis had begun to slaughter each other through spontaneous combustion, distracted our attention from the reality that a nondemocratic Hutu regime had carefully planned and orchestrated a genocide against Rwandan Tutsis as well as its Hutu opponents. 158 Certainly if we were able to press a button and end poverty, racism, religious intolerance, injustice, and endless disputes, we would want to do so. Indeed, democratic governments must remain committed to policies that will produce a better world by all measures of human progress. The broader achievement of democracy and the rule of law will itself assist in this progress. No one, however, has yet been able to demonstrate the kind of robust correlation with any of these &quot;traditional&quot; causes of war that is reflected in the &quot;democratic peace.&quot; Further, given the difficulties in overcoming many of these social problems, an approach to war exclusively dependent on their solution may doom us to war for generations to come. [*394] A useful framework for thinking about the war puzzle is provided in the Kenneth Waltz classic Man, the State and War, 159 first published in 1954 for the Institute of War and Peace Studies, in which he notes that previous thinkers about the causes of war have tended to assign responsibility at one of the three levels of individual psychology, the nature of the state, or the nature of the international system. This tripartite level of analysis has subsequently been widely copied in the study of international relations. We might summarize my analysis in this classical construct by suggesting that the most critical variables are the second and third levels, or &quot;images,&quot; of analysis. Government structures, at the second level, seem to play a central role in levels of aggressiveness in high-risk behavior leading to major war. In this, the &quot;democratic peace&quot; is an essential insight. The third level of analysis, the international system, or totality of external incentives influencing the decision to go to war, is also critical when government structures do not restrain such high-risk behavior on their own. Indeed, nondemocratic systems may not only fail to constrain inappropriate aggressive behavior, they may even massively enable it by placing the resources of the state at the disposal of a ruthless regime elite. It is not that the first level of analysis, the individual, is unimportant - I have already argued that it is important in elite perceptions about the permissibility and feasibility of force and resultant necessary levels of deterrence. It is, instead, that the second level of analysis, government structures, may be a powerful proxy for settings bringing to power those who are disposed to aggressive military adventures and in creating incentive structures predisposed to high-risk behavior. We might also want to keep open the possibility that a war/peace model focused on democracy and deterrence might be further usefully refined by adding psychological profiles of particular leaders as we assess the likelihood of aggression and levels of necessary deterrence. Nondemocracies' leaders can have different perceptions of the necessity or usefulness of force and, as Marcus Aurelius should remind us, not all absolute leaders are Caligulas or Neros. Further, the history of ancient Egypt reminds us that not all Pharaohs were disposed to make war on their neighbors. Despite the importance of individual leaders, however, the key to war avoidance is understanding that major international war is critically an interaction, or synergy, of certain characteristics at levels two and three - specifically an absence of [*395] democracy and an absence of effective deterrence. Yet another way to conceptualize the importance of democracy and deterrence in war avoidance is to note that each in its own way internalizes the costs to decision elites of engaging in high-risk aggressive behavior. Democracy internalizes these costs in a variety of ways including displeasure of the electorate at having war imposed upon it by its own government. And deterrence either prevents achievement of the objective altogether or imposes punishing costs making the gamble not worth the risk. 160 III. Testing the Hypothesis Hypotheses, or paradigms, are useful if they reflect the real world better than previously held paradigms. In the complex world of foreign affairs and the war puzzle, perfection is unlikely. No general construct will fit all cases even in the restricted category of &quot;major interstate war;&quot; there are simply too many variables. We should insist, however, on testing against the real world and on results that suggest enhanced usefulness over other constructs. In testing the hypothesis, we can test it for consistency with major wars. That is, in looking, for example, at the principal interstate wars in the twentieth century, did they present both a nondemocratic aggressor and an absence of effective deterrence? 161 And although it, by itself, does not prove causation, we might also want to test the hypothesis against settings of potential wars that did not occur. That is, in non-war settings, was there an absence of at least one element of the synergy? We might also ask questions about the effect of changes on the international system in either element of the synergy. That is, what, in general, happens when a totalitarian state makes a transition to stable democracy or vice versa? And what, in general, happens when levels of deterrence are dramatically increased or decreased? </span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><strong>Other states will inevitable act realist—trying to shift away collapses hegemony</strong></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><strong>Mearsheimer</strong> <strong>1</strong> [professor of political science at University of Chicago, <em>The Tragedy of Great Power Politics</em>, pg. 2] </span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"> </span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">There are no status quo powers in the international system, save for the occasional hegemon that wants to maintain its dominating position over potential rivals. Great powers are rarely content with the current distribution of power; on the contrary, they face a constant incentive to change it in their favor. They almost always have revisionist intentions, and they will use force to alter the balance of power if they think it can be done at a reasonable price. At times, the costs and risks of trying to shift the balance of power are too great, forcing great powers to wait for more favorable circumstances. But the desire for more power does not go away, unless a state achieves the ultimate goal of hegemony. Since no state is likely to achieve global hegemony, however, the world is condemned to perpetual great-power competition. This unrelenting pursuit of power means that great powers are inclined to look for opportunities to alter the distribution of world power in their favor. They will seize their opportunities if they have the necessary capability. Simply put, great powers are primed for offense. But not only does a great power seek to gain power at the expense of other states, it also tries to thwart rivals bent on gaining power at its expense. Thus, a great power will defend the balance of power when looming change favors another state, and it will try to undermine the balance when the direction of change is in its own favor. Why do great powers behave this way? My answer is that the structure of the international system forces states which seek only to be secure nonetheless to act aggressively toward each other. Three features of the international system combine to cause states to fear one another: 1) the absence of a central authority that sits above states and can protect them from each other, 2) the fact that states always have some offensive military capability, and 3) the fact that states can never be certain about other states’ intentions. Given this fear—which can never be wholly eliminated—states recognize that the more powerful they are relative to their rivals, the better their chances of survival. Indeed, the best guarantee of survival is to be a hegemon, because no other state can seriously threaten such a mighty power. This situation, which no one consciously designed or intended, is genuinely tragic. Great powers that have no reason to fight each other—that are merely concerned with their own survival—nevertheless have little choice but to pursue power and to seek to dominate the other states in the system. This dilemma is captured in brutally frank comments that Prussian statesman Otto von Bismarck made during the early 1860s, when it appeared that Poland, which was not an independent state at the time, might regain its sovereignty. “Restoring the Kingdom of Poland in any shape or form is tantamount to creating an ally for any enemy that chooses to attack us,” he believed, and therefore he advocated that Prussia should “smash those Poles till, losing all hope, they lie down and die; I have every sympathy for their situation, but if we wish to survive we have no choice but to wipe them out.” Although it is depressing to realize that great powers might think and act this way, it behooves us to see the world as it is, not as we would like it to be. For example, one of the key foreign policy issues facing the United States is the question of how China will behave if its rapid economic growth continues and effectively turns China into a giant Hong Kong. Many Americans believe that if China is democratic and enmeshed in the global capitalist system, it will not act aggressively; instead it will be content with the status quo in Northeast Asia. According to this logic, the United States should engage China in order to promote the latter’s integration into the world economy, a policy that also seeks to encourage China’s transition to democracy. If engagement succeeds, the United States can work with a wealthy and democratic China to promote peace around the globe. Unfortunately, a policy of engagement is doomed to fail. If China becomes an economic powerhouse it will almost certainly translate its economic might into military might and make a run at dominating Northeast Asia. Whether China is democratic and deeply enmeshed in the global economy or autocratic and autarkic will have little effect on its behavior, because democracies care about security as much as non-democracies do, and hegemony is the best way for any state to guarantee its own survival. Of course, neither its neighbors nor the United States would stand idly by while China gained increasing increments of power. Instead, they would seek to contain China, probably by trying to form a balancing coalition. The result would be an intense security of great-power war hanging over them. In short, China and the United States are destined to be adversaries as China’s power grows. </span><br />

<span class="Style1CharCharChar"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">This is a good thing, and it should continue to be a primary goal of American foreign policy to perpetuate this relatively benign international configuration of power. The unipolar order with the United States as the predominant power is unavoidably riddled with flaws and contradictions. It inspires fears and jealousies. The United States is not immune to error, like all other nations, and because of its size and importance in the international system those errors are magnified and take on greater significance than the errors of less powerful nations.</span></span> Compared to the ideal Kantian international order, in which all the world's powers would be peace-loving equals, conducting themselves wisely, prudently, and in strict obeisance to international law, the unipolar system is both dangerous and unjust. Compared to any plausible alternative in the real world, however, it is relatively stable and less likely to produce a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">major war between great powers</span>. <span class="Style1CharCharChar"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">It is also comparatively benevolent, from a liberal perspective, for it is more conducive to the principles of economic and political liberalism that Americans and many others value.</span></span> American predominance <span class="Style1CharCharChar"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">does not stand in the way of progress toward a better world, therefore. It</span></span> stands in the way of regression toward a more dangerous world. The choice is not between an American-dominated order and a world that looks like the European Union. The future international order will be shaped by those who have the power to shape it. The leaders of a post-American world will not meet in Brussels but in Beijing, Moscow, and Washington. The return of great powers and great games If the world is marked by the persistence of unipolarity, it is nevertheless also being shaped by the reemergence of competitive national ambitions of the kind that have shaped human affairs from time immemorial. During the Cold War, this historical tendency of great powers to jostle with one another for status and influence as well as for wealth and power was largely suppressed by the two superpowers and their rigid bipolar order. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has not been powerful enough, and probably could never be powerful enough, to suppress by itself the normal ambitions of nations. This does not mean the world has returned to multipolarity, since none of the large powers is in range of competing with the superpower for global influence. Nevertheless, several large powers are now competing for regional predominance, both with the United States and with each other. National ambition drives China's foreign policy today, and although it is tempered by prudence and the desire to appear as unthreatening as possible to the rest of the world, the Chinese are powerfully motivated to return their nation to what they regard as its traditional position as the preeminent power in East Asia. They do not share a European, postmodern view that power is passé; hence their now two-decades-long military buildup and modernization. Like the Americans, they believe power, including military power, is a good thing to have and that it is better to have more of it than less. Perhaps more significant is the Chinese perception, also shared by Americans, that status and honor, and not just wealth and security, are important for a nation. Japan, meanwhile, which in the past could have been counted as an aspiring postmodern power -- with its pacifist constitution and low defense spending -- now appears embarked on a more traditional national course. Partly this is in reaction to the rising power of China and concerns about North Korea's nuclear weapons. But it is also driven by Japan's own national ambition to be a leader in East Asia or at least not to play second fiddle or &quot;little brother&quot; to China. China and Japan are now in a competitive quest with each trying to augment its own status and power and to prevent the other 's rise to predominance, and this competition has a military and strategic as well as an economic and political component. Their competition is such that a nation like South Korea, with a long unhappy history as a pawn between the two powers, is once again worrying both about a &quot;greater China&quot; and about the return of Japanese nationalism. As Aaron Friedberg commented, the East Asian future looks more like Europe's past than its present. But it also looks like Asia's past. Russian foreign policy, <span class="Style1CharCharChar"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">too, looks more like something from the nineteenth century. It </span></span>is being driven by a typical, and typically Russian, blend of national resentment and ambition. A postmodern Russia simply seeking integration into the new European order, the Russia of Andrei Kozyrev, would not be troubled by the eastward enlargement of the EU and NATO, would not insist on predominant influence over its &quot;near abroad,&quot; and would not use its natural resources as means of gaining geopolitical leverage and enhancing Russia 's international status in an attempt to regain the lost glories of the Soviet empire and Peter the Great. But Russia, like China and Japan, is moved by more traditional great-power considerations, including the pursuit of those valuable if intangible national interests: honor and respect. Although Russian leaders complain about threats to their security from NATO and the United States, the Russian sense of insecurity has more to do with resentment and national identity than with plausible external military threats. 16 Russia's complaint today is not with this or that weapons system. It is the entire post-Cold War settlement of the 1990s that Russia resents and wants to revise. But that does not make insecurity less a factor in Russia 's relations with the world; indeed, it makes finding compromise with the Russians all the more difficult. One could add others to this list of great powers with traditional rather than postmodern aspirations. India's regional ambitions are more muted, or are focused most intently on Pakistan, but it is clearly engaged in competition with China for dominance in the Indian Ocean and sees itself, correctly, as an emerging great power on the world scene. In the Middle East there is Iran, which mingles religious fervor with a historical sense of superiority and leadership in its region. 17 Its nuclear program is as much about the desire for regional hegemony as about defending Iranian territory from attack by the United States. Even the European Union, in its way, expresses a pan-European national ambition to play a significant role in the world, and it has become the vehicle for channeling German, French, and British ambitions in what Europeans regard as a safe supranational direction. Europeans seek honor and respect, too, but of a postmodern variety. The honor they seek is to occupy the moral high ground in the world, to exercise moral authority, to wield political and economic influence as an antidote to militarism, to be the keeper of the global conscience, and to be recognized and admired by others for playing this role. Islam is not a nation, but many Muslims express a kind of religious nationalism, and the leaders of radical Islam, including al Qaeda, do seek to establish a theocratic nation or confederation of nations that would encompass a wide swath of the Middle East and beyond. Like national movements elsewhere, Islamists have a yearning for respect, including self-respect, and a desire for honor. Their national identity has been molded in defiance against stronger and often oppressive outside powers, and also by memories of ancient superiority over those same powers. China had its &quot;century of humiliation.&quot; Islamists have more than a century of humiliation to look back on, a humiliation of which Israel has become the living symbol, which is partly why even Muslims who are neither radical nor fundamentalist proffer their sympathy and even their support to violent extremists who can turn the tables on the dominant liberal West, and particularly on a dominant America which implanted and still feeds the Israeli cancer in their midst. Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as &quot;No. 1&quot; and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, <span class="Style1CharCharChar"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">if it ever went away,</span></span> and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American <span style="font-size: 4pt;">pre</span>dominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying -- its regional as well as its global predominance. Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: <span class="Style1CharCharChar"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but </span></span>often through confrontation and wars <span class="Style1CharCharChar"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness.</span></span> One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them <span class="Style1CharCharChar"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">less likely, or it could simply make them more</span></span> <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">catastrophic.</span> It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War I and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe's stability depends on the guarantee, <span class="Style1CharCharChar"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">however distant and one hopes unnecessary, </span></span>that the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">world war.</span> People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world's great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China 's neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. In Europe, too, the departure of the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates from the scene -- even if it remained the world's most powerful nation -- could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe -- if it adopted what some call a strategy of &quot;offshore balancing&quot; -- this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, &quot;offshore&quot; role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more &quot;even-handed&quot; policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel 's aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn't change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">alternative to American </span><span style="font-size: 4pt;">pre</span><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">dominance </span>in the region<span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"> is not balance and peace. It is further competition.</span> The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn 't changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to &quot;normal&quot; or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path. <br />

The central issue here is what causes states to behave as offensive realists predict. Mearsheimer advances a powerful argument that anarchy is the fundamental cause of such behavior. <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">The fact that there is no world government compels the leaders of states to take steps to ensure their security, such as striving to have a powerful military, aggressing when forced to do so, and forging and maintaining alliances.

<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Research from all angles has produced convincing evidence that some features of violence are remarkably similar across time and space. These commonalities comprise: the sex distribution of people involved in fighting (mostly men); the approximate age at which people are most likely to engage in violence (about &amp;' to 0)); essential goals over which fights are fought (material resources, power, and sex); situations that are prone to violence (e.g. humiliations in the presence of others); individual characteristics associated with violence (e.g. courage and risk-seeking); and emotional processes involved in violent encounters (e.g. arousal and anger). Such commonalities are difficult to understand from a purely cultural perspective. Rather, it is becoming increasingly clear that any general theory of violence will need to integrate an evolutionary perspective on human nature (Pinker +,,+). In an insightful paper, Wood (+,,/) has recently laid out how and why an evolutionary perspective is an essential element for the way social scientists understand violence both historically and across societies. On the most general level, an evolutionary perspective serves as a corrective to the view, long cherished amongst social scientists, that the human mind is essentially a blank slate, ready to store and retrieve whatever happens to characterize a given culture (Pinker +,,+). In contrast, evolutionary psychologists emphasize that the “hardwired” architecture of our brain evolved over long periods of time as a solution to the adaptive problems posed by the environmental conditions and problems in the ancestral world (Tooby and Cosmides &amp;((+). Hence the human brain is theorized to be a network of “regulatory circuits” that “organize the way we interpret our experiences, inject certain recurrent concepts and motivations into our mental life, and provide universal frames of meaning that allow us to understand the actions and intentions of others” (Tooby and Cosmides &amp;((/). In developing answers to these questions Buss and Shackelford (&amp;((/) suggest that aggression is a highly context-specific collection of strategies that have evolved as an adaptation to recurrent problems that humans were confronted with during the history of human evolution. They may be grouped into strategies of proactive aggression developed to in#ict costs on rivals and reactive strategies that have developed to deter rivals and to defend one’s interests. The proactive use of aggression entails violence as means to gain access to resources that are valuable for reproduction (land, water, food); as a strategy to win in competitions against intrasexual rivals; and a way to negotiate status and power hierarchies. Reactive uses include strategies where violence is used to defend against attack, situations where it serves as a way to gain a reputation as aggressive in order to deter rivals from future aggression, and reactions that deter longterm mates from sexual infidelity (jealousy). </span></span><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Our immediate response to the question “how is culture biological?” is “how can it not be?”; if “culture” refers to identifiable regularities in the ways that a specific group of people thinks and acts, where else is it to be found other than in their minds (and, thus, their brains)? Behaviour is a product of psychology (whether conscious or unconscious) combined with the dynamics of a particular social environment, and no cultural production (whether material or not) has meaning except when someone produces or interacts with (that is, thinks about) it. We have, ultimately, only the culture that nature allows. Recognising the biological basis of culture thus means to give it a location: in the mind. Although such statements seem obvious enough, it is a challenge to explain the biological basis of culture in a less abstract manner, and we will address it with reference to a single topic. Violence—in this context the deliberate infliction of non-consensual physical harm on human beings—is present in all societies, but its prevalence varies widely. Both factors make it useful for examining continuity (and universality) as well as change (and difference). Violence has been related to differential rates of survival and reproduction across history and pre-history, and throughout the human past many forms of it have been seen as broadly socially legitimate. These facts suggest that the potential for physical aggression is a normal part of our species-typical psychology rather than a psychological aberration (Eisner 2009). But historical studies of violence have emphasised the variability of this behaviour: in Europe, for example, everyday forms of interpersonal violence declined significantly between the sixteenth and mid-twentieth centuries (Eisner 2001), which itself might be only the tail-end of a much longer (and even more profound) decline (Pinker 2007). Nonetheless, violence remains a prominent social fear, even in comparatively pacified societies. It also plays a significant role not only in our real but also our imagined lives, in fictional forms from theatre and literature to film and video games, where its representation can inspire strong emotions: from pleasure and fascination to disgust and horror (and often some more ambiguous mixture thereof). The same psychology that generates real violence influences the ways it is imagined—and imaginatively enjoyed. Our joint contribution addresses both topics, combining the views of a historian and a literature scholar. Historical studies of violence have tended to focus on its social and cultural causes and have addressed the specific codes that have provided motives for violence (such as responding to injuries to “honour” or maintaining “discipline” in the family or workplace) and prescribed the legitimate forms that it should take (such as a duel, fight or ritualised punishment). In other words, they have emphasised “cultures of violence” (Carroll 2007). These explanations have accompanied (and sometimes overlapped with) diachronic analyses positing a “process of civilisation” that has encouraged greater self-control and heightened degrees of empathy toward the suffering of others (Fletcher 1997; Spierenburg 2008). We have learned a great deal, but biology (with some important exceptions) has so far had little influence on historians, partly since some assume that Darwinian approaches consider only continuity and ‘universals’, thereby ignoring the stock-in-trade of most historians: particularity and change (Adler and Gallant 2000; Adler 2003). Some have even sought to position history as a site of resistance to biology, driven by a conviction that its methods are “essentially at cross purposes” or “deeply incommensurable” with the interests of historians (Hesse 2004, 207). There are signs, however, of an increasing openness to evolutionary psychology among historians interested in violence (e.g.; Hanlon 2007; Wood 2007; Eisner 2009), who suggest that a common psychological (and thus “biological”) basis underneath—and driving—cultural change is signalled by violence’s universal features as well as its tendency to vary in similar ways (and for similar reasons). One “universal” that has preoccupied historians of violence is the greater participation of men in physical aggression (Wiener 2004; Emsley 2005). Men are not only far more likely to engage in physical violence, they do so in distinctive ways: male violence toward other men—whether individually or in groups—far exceeds women’s violence against other women (Daly and Wilson 1988; Campbell 1999). Violence rates change (and differ across cultures), but the almost mind-numbing regularity of male violence aimed at gaining resources, increasing status, deterring rivals and responding to public humiliation makes a strong prima facie case that some kind of underlying human constant is involved. Evolutionary psychologists have suggested many specific adaptive problems that violence has likely contributed to solving (Buss and Shackelford 1997). Across species, the sex that invests less in reproduction and parental care is under greater competitive pressure to gain access to the sex that invests more: greater male competition leads to greater male aggression and risk-taking, apparent in sex differences in impulsivity, sensation-seeking, jealousy, fear and empathy, which are mediated through innate psychological mechanisms and endocrine functions (Archer 2009). (Women, of course, compete actively as well, although usually in less overtly aggressive and risky ways [Campbell 1999].) The convincing cross-species, cross-cultural and long-term historical (and pre-historical) evidence of the higher violent potential of males suggests that solely cultural explanations of violence must be incomplete. Rather than cultures of violence coming into existence ex nihilo and teaching men to fight, they have emerged out of pre-cultural predispositions. And as men are—by nature—the more dangerous sex, the bulk of cultural violence codes have concerned them, both enabling violence—to enact revenge and enforce social discipline—and limiting it. Contrary to a frequent misunderstanding (e.g., Jones 2000, 33-34), there is nothing in biological or evolutionary reasoning that would predict violence to be constant and unchanging; indeed, scholars who have studied violence from an evolutionary perspective have always emphasised its ‘context-specific’ nature. For example, environments with an elevated ratio of sexually active men to fertile women have been found to heighten male competition and its accompanying physical aggression (Courtwright 1996; Archer 2009, 257-58). High rates of social inequality or local mortality have had a similar effect (Wilson and Daly 1997). Key roles have been posited in evolutionary psychology for both ‘evoked’ cultures emerging from innate, context-dependent mechanisms as well as ‘transmitted’ cultures passed on through learning (Cosmides and Tooby 1992). Indeed, it is on precisely the issue of historical change that evolutionary psychologists and historians have, perhaps, had the most in common. As historians have turned to examining the steep decline in everyday violence in Europe over the last several centuries, they have focused on varying social norms (regarding self-control or the acceptability of physical harm), the development of institutions (courts and the police) and changing relations between the classes and sexes (Ruff 2001; Wiener 2004; Wood 2004; Godfrey and Lawrence 2005; Emsley 2005; Spierenburg 2008). However, all of these phenomena are related to underlying psychological mechanisms. The “rule of law,” for instance, is an abstract cultural concept; however, the development of justice systems has provided means for dealing with social transgressions that, while they avoid the need for personal vengeance seeking, nevertheless satisfy the underlying (and emotionally charged) mental calculus of revenge (Frijda 1994, 265; Miller 1998, 168-69; Solomon 1994). Apart from the obvious fact that we possess an innate cognitive apparatus that allows us to (selectively) recognise and absorb social norms, the rising social cost (i.e., loss of status) for using inappropriate violence generated pressure for self-control. Not only anger and vengeance are rooted in emotional and psychological mechanisms, so are relevant factors such as empathy and forgiveness (Singer 1982; McCullough 2008). Disentangling the interactions among changing demographic, economic, normative, technological, institutional and other social factors is a complex matter: homicide rates go up and down, some cultures tolerate violence more than others, dominant notions of masculinity and femininity vary, and people are, ultimately, ‘flexible’, a fact that has been pointed to in asserting social role theory as an alternative to evolutionary psychology (Eagly and Wood 2009, 276). There is, however, no contradiction between such social variation and an underlying evolved psychology (Barkow 2006). This latter observation also allows us to reflect upon fictional representations of violence, which—while illustrating changing views and attitudes towards violence—also indicate underlying continuities in human culture that point to its biological roots. Because violence is a central, seemingly inexorable feature of human behaviour and interaction, it has provided a literary topic of enduring fascination. And as most literature is to a greater or lesser extent modelled on real-life experience, it is plausible to interpret literary representations of violence with the aid of the same biological explanations that help us understand actual behaviour. In fact, some critics see literature as an anthropological database, which confirms the sociobiological formula that human beings are fitness-maximisers acting according to the evolutionary logic of reproductive success. In this vein, representations of violence in the Iliad have been considered in light of an underlying struggle for ‘resources, social status and power’ (Gottschall 2008, 3) and acts of vengeance in Shakespearean tragedy as expressing an interrelated ‘concern for our kind and unconcern for others’ (Boyd 2004, 66). Investigations along these lines by literary Darwinists have offered intriguing insights into literature; however, despite their unflinching view of human nature, they seem to tell only part of the story. By turning the literary critic into an anthropologist gathering data about Homo sapiens, they tend to leave her or him at a distance from what actually happens in the process of reading and untouched by the emotional reactions called forth by fictional texts. Such content-focused interpretations also tend to skirt the question of how violence is represented in literature, an issue that is no less telling about our violent capacities than the data we can gather by skimming the content. In reading fiction, or in watching a play, we are not simply emotionally detached anthropologists observing our objects of enquiry: we are partners in a bilateral pragmatic encounter (Phelan 2003, 132) that relies upon our evolved, cognitive and emotional capacities. If literature aims to achieve particular aesthetic and emotional effects, then their scope is demarcated by what its human recipients are capable of feeling. It is not very difficult to see how imaginations of violence might be related to the ways that we react to and think about violence in real circumstances, despite the fact that the contexts are different. There is evidence that violence offers ‘intrinsic’ rewards to its perpetrators in the form of enjoyment, whether this derives from the essential thrill of undertaking a risky activity or the pleasure of demonstrating one’s dominance (Eisner 2009, 51-53). By removing the actual risk of harm or injury, fictional violence can tap into this source of intense psychological gratification (Miller 1998, 164-65). Hence our deep-seated desire to seek revenge for personal wrongs can still be triggered even when it is addressed, in a sense, at second hand and even if we ultimately refrain from acting upon this desire. Apart from being a repository of vital information about real life (Scalise Sugiyama 2001), literature can be thought of as a “dummy” (Mellmann 2006, 42-43) that elicits and exploits the same emotions that we experience in real life while preventing us from taking action. That we have the ability to imaginatively place ourselves in particular situations and to experience emotions that we would feel in those circumstances is itself likely to be a biological phenomenon. With John Tooby and Leda Cosmides we might explain our restrained responsiveness to fiction in terms of the distinction between the “functional” mode of behaviour—which leads us to act upon environmental information according to fixed, functional and universal programmes—and its “organisational” counterpart, in which such responses are merely triggered in order to train, maintain and refine our cognitive capacities (Tooby and Cosmides 2001). This distinction is related to what Tooby and Cosmides call “scope syntax” (2000), our evolved ability to “tag” information, identify its source, assess its relevance and reliability, and adjust our responses accordingly: information tagged as fictional will not activate the functional mode. The significance of this cognitive ability for representational art is obvious: it enables the development of a whole range of sophisticated aesthetic and narrative features, from free indirect discourse to dramatic irony, that render literary representation complex and worth our attention. Most important for the topic of violence, however, is that it allows us to experience real emotions within the safe confines of fiction and without the risk that we will act upon them. This capacity affirms the enduring relevance of emotional responses even as it helps to stop them short. To consider the biological dimensions of literature from the perspective of the reader’s emotional responses unsettles the detachment established by purely thematic, plot-based interpretations. It testifies to our continuing fascination with violence and thereby subtly shifts the balance in the relationship between text and reader/audience. It is not merely that authors depict fictional violence in order to manipulate their readers’ responses; more fundamentally, it is the reader’s pre-existing psychology of violence that explains why its fictional depiction can be meaningful at all (as well as, it must be added, enjoyable). Just as with real-world cultures of violence, these capacities are context-dependent and mediated in different ways in different times and places. Still, they are supported and enabled by a psychological potential for violence that a civilising process might modify but not obliterate. On the back of this knowledge, we realise how paradoxical the question of how culture is biological actually is. It is by engaging in activities usually considered to be entirely cultural, such as reading a novel or watching a play, that human animals reveal themselves to be at their most natural. </span></span><br />

 <br />
<strong>Predictions are feasible – they can be made logically from empirical evidence.</strong><br />
<strong>Chernoff 9</strong> (Fred, Prof. IR and Dir. IR – Colgate U., European Journal of International Relations, “Conventionalism as an Adequate Basis for Policy-Relevant IR Theory”, 15:1, Sage) <br />
<br />
For these and other reasons, many social theorists and social scientists have come to the conclusion that prediction is impossible. Well-known IR reflexivists like Rick Ashley, Robert Cox, Rob Walker and Alex Wendt have attacked naturalism by emphasizing the interpretive nature of social theory. Ashley is explicit in his critique of prediction, as is Cox, who says quite simply, ‘It is impossible to predict the future’ (Ashley, 1986: 283; Cox, 1987: 139, cf. also 1987: 393). More recently, Heikki Patomäki has argued that ‘qualitative changes and emergence are possible, but predictions are not’ defective and that the latter two presuppose an unjustifiably narrow notion of ‘prediction’.14 A determined prediction sceptic may continue to hold that there is too great a degree of complexity of social relationships (which comprise ‘open systems’) to allow any prediction whatsoever. Two very simple examples may circumscribe and help to refute a radical variety of scepticism. First, we all make reliable social predictions and do so with great frequency. We can predict with high probability that a spouse, child or parent will react to certain well-known stimuli that we might supply, based on extensive past experience. More to the point of IR prediction – scepticism, we can imagine a young child in the UK who (perhaps at the cinema) (1) picks up a bit of 19th-century British imperial lore thus gaining a sense of the power of the crown, without knowing anything of current balances of power, (2) hears some stories about the US–UK invasion of Iraq in the context of the aim of advancing democracy, and (3) hears a bit about communist China and democratic Taiwan. Although the specific term ‘preventative strike’ might not enter into her lexicon, it is possible to imagine the child, whose knowledge is thus limited, thinking that if democratic Taiwan were threatened by China, the UK would (possibly or probably) launch a strike on China to protect it, much as the UK had done to help democracy in Iraq. In contrast to the child, readers of this journal and scholars who study the world more thoroughly have factual information (e.g. about the relative military and economic capabilities of the UK and China) and hold some cause-and-effect principles (such as that states do not usually initiate actions that leaders understand will have an extremely high probability of undercutting their power with almost no chances of success). Anyone who has adequate knowledge of world politics would predict that the UK will not launch a preventive attack against China. In the real world, China knows that for the next decade and well beyond the UK will not intervene militarily in its affairs. While Chinese leaders have to plan for many likely — and even a few somewhat unlikely — future possibilities, they do not have to plan for various implausible contingencies: they do not have to structure forces geared to defend against specifically UK forces and do not have to conduct diplomacy with the UK in a way that would be required if such an attack were a real possibility. Any rational decision-maker in China may use some cause-and-effect (probabilistic) principles along with knowledge of specific facts relating to the Sino-British relationship to predict (P2) that the UK will not land its forces on Chinese territory — even in the event of a war over Taiwan (that is, the probability is very close to zero). The statement P2 qualifies as a prediction based on DEF above and counts as knowledge for Chinese political and military decision-makers. A Chinese diplomat or military planner who would deny that theory-based prediction would have no basis to rule out extremely implausible predictions like P2 and would thus have to prepare for such unlikely contingencies as UK action against China. A reflexivist theorist sceptical of ‘prediction’ in IR might argue that the China example distorts the notion by using a trivial prediction and treating it as a meaningful one. But the critic’s temptation to dismiss its value stems precisely from the fact that it is so obviously true. The value to China of knowing that the UK is not a military threat is significant. The fact that, under current conditions, any plausible cause-and-effect understanding of IR that one might adopt would yield P2, that the ‘UK will not attack China’, does not diminish the value to China of knowing the UK does not pose a military threat. A critic might also argue that DEF and the China example allow non-scientific claims to count as predictions. But we note that while physics and chemistry offer precise ‘point predictions’, other natural sciences, such as seismology, genetics or meteorology, produce predictions that are often much less specific; that is, they describe the predicted ‘events’ in broader time frame and typically in probabilistic terms. We often find predictions about the probability, for example, of a seismic event in the form ‘some time in the next three years’ rather than ‘two years from next Monday at 11:17 am’. DEF includes approximate and probabilistic propositions as predictions and is thus able to catagorize as a prediction the former sort of statement, which is of a type that is often of great value to policy-makers. With the help of these ‘non-point predictions’ coming from the natural and the social sciences, leaders are able to choose the courses of action (e.g. more stringent earthquake-safety building codes, or procuring an additional carrier battle group) that are most likely to accomplish the leaders’ desired ends. So while ‘point predictions’ are not what political leaders require in most decision-making situations, critics of IR predictiveness often attack the predictive capacity of IR theory for its inability to deliver them. The critics thus commit the straw man fallacy by requiring a sort of prediction in IR (1) that few, if any, theorists claim to be able to offer, (2) that are not required by policy-makers for theory-based predictions to be valuable, and (3) that are not possible even in some natural sciences.15 The range of theorists included in ‘reflexivists’ here is very wide and it is possible to dissent from some of the general descriptions. From the point of view of the central argument of this article, there are two important features that should be rendered accurately. One is that reflexivists reject explanation–prediction symmetry, which allows them to pursue causal (or constitutive) explanation without any commitment to prediction. The second is that almost all share clear opposition to predictive social science.16 The reflexivist commitment to both of these conclusions should be evident from the foregoing discussion. <br />

<strong>Turn—rejecting predictions makes them inevitable—decisionmakers will rely on ideology instead of analysis</strong><br />
<strong>Fitzsimmons 7</strong> (Michael, “The Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic Planning”, Survival, Winter 06/07) <br />
<br />
But handling even this weaker form of uncertainty is still quite challeng- ing. If not sufficiently bounded, a high degree of variability in planning factors can exact a significant price on planning. The complexity presented by great variability strains the cognitive abilities of even the most sophisticated decision- makers.15 And even a robust decision-making process sensitive to cognitive limitations necessarily sacrifices depth of analysis for breadth as variability and complexity grows. It should follow, then, that in planning under conditions of risk, variability in strategic calculation should be carefully tailored to available analytic and decision processes. Why is this important? What harm can an imbalance between complexity and cognitive or analytic capacity in strategic planning bring? Stated simply, where analysis is silent or inadequate, the personal beliefs of decision-makers fill the void. As political scientist Richard Betts found in a study of strategic sur- prise, in ‘an environment that lacks clarity, abounds with conflicting data, and allows no time for rigorous assessment of sources and validity, ambiguity allows intuition or wishfulness to drive interpretation ... The greater the ambiguity, the greater the impact of preconceptions.’16 The decision-making environment that Betts describes here is one of political-military crisis, not long-term strategic planning. But a strategist who sees uncertainty as the central fact of his environ- ment brings upon himself some of the pathologies of crisis decision-making. He invites ambiguity, takes conflicting data for granted and substitutes a priori scepticism about the validity of prediction for time pressure as a rationale for discounting the importance of analytic rigour. It is important not to exaggerate the extent to which data and ‘rigorous assessment’ can illuminate strategic choices. Ambiguity is a fact of life, and scepticism of analysis is necessary. Accordingly, the intuition and judgement of decision-makers will always be vital to strategy, and attempting to subordinate those factors to some formulaic, deterministic decision-making model would be both undesirable and unrealistic. All the same, there is danger in the opposite extreme as well. Without careful analysis of what is relatively likely and what is relatively unlikely, what will be the possible bases for strategic choices? A decision-maker with no faith in prediction is left with little more than a set of worst-case scenarios and his existing beliefs about the world to confront the choices before him. Those beliefs may be more or less well founded, but if they are not made explicit and subject to analysis and debate regarding their application to particular strategic contexts, they remain only beliefs and premises, rather than rational judgements. Even at their best, such decisions are likely to be poorly understood by the organisations charged with their implementation. At their worst, such decisions may be poorly understood by the decision-makers themselves. <br />

<strong>Arguments why predictions aren’t 100% accurate aren’t a reason to reject them</strong><br />

In the social sciences the explanations of state behaviour in rational-choice theory, which posits the existence of a rationally behaving state, or in economics, which posits the existence of ‘the rational economic person’, are clearly idealisations. However, these are parallel to – and not completely disconnected from – the postulation of laws governing frictionless machines or ideal gases in the physical sciences. With regard to underlying and immediate causes, Bernstein et al. advance a number of points in the course of offering the critique of ‘predictiveness’ of IR theory and the scenario-based alternative that Bernstein et al. present. The main point to be made with respect to the use made by Bernstein et al. of the ‘uncertain relationships between underlying and immediate causes’ is that, in their view, such a connection ‘makes point prediction extraordinarily difficult’ (2000: 47). As will become clear, this chapter argues that IR theorists offer non-point predictions and that such predictions are often of genuine policy value. A statement like ‘a rapid withdrawal of US military forces from Iraq after the defeat of Saddam Hussein is likely to lead to increased violence and long-term instability’, would not qualify as a point prediction. Yet it is the sort of prediction that policymakers typically rely on and it has value for policy-makers. Bernstein et al. thus commit a straw-person fallacy, as do other critics of ‘predictiveness’ discussed above. They raise the bar of ‘prediction’ much too high. The sort of prediction that policy-makers need is often much less than ‘point prediction’. One may grant Bernstein et al. all of their points seeking to undermine point prediction and still conclude that they have not provided good reason to reject many sorts of statements that satisfy the requirements of prediction, as laid out in the definition on p. 8. With regard to learning, IR differs from predictive natural sciences in that, according to Bernstein et al., ‘[m]olecules do not learn from experience. People do, or think they do. … We know that expectations and behavior are influenced by experience, one’s own and others’ (2000: 47). They argue that US policies visàvis the USSR were a response to the failure of appeasement in the 1930s, and those policies were a response to British leaders’ belief that more aggressive policies failed to keep peace in 1914. They cite concepts like ‘chain reactions’ and ‘contagion effects’ to describe these phenomena and hazard analysis for their measurement. But they charge that these do not succeed in explaining ‘how and why these patterns emerge and persist’ (Bernstein et al. 2000: 47). They note also that theories that attempt to predict the future predict incorrectly in part because groups (often states) react in such a way as to prevent their predictions from obtaining. ‘Human prophecies … are often self-negating’ (Bernstein et al. 2000: 52). Another approach that has considerable explanatory success is cybernetic theory, which lays out mechanisms and may even be viewed as predictive. Cybernetic theory was developed by Wiener (1949) and applied to IR especially by Deutsch et. al (1957), and specifically to foreign-policy decision-making by Steinbruner (1974), Chernoff (1995) and others. It not only accords with the data but offers a causal mechanism to account for the patterns. Bernstein et al. argue that actors can change ‘the rules of the game’ and consequently ‘general theories of process in international relations will have restricted validity’ (Bernstein et al. 2000: 52). Generalisations will apply only to ‘discrete portions’ of history. They add that ‘scholars need to specify carefully the temporal and geographic domains to which their theories are applicable. We suspect those domains are often narrower and more constrained than is generally accepted’ (Bernstein et al. 2000: 52). This is, however, just what one of the most systematic and generalising of all IR scholars, i.e., Waltz, demands. He maintains that a body of propositions does not even qualify as a theory unless it so specifies. Once these restrictions on domain are specified, theoretical generalisations might have value. For example, Waltz says that whether we are interested in natural sciences or social sciences, ‘[n]o matter what the subject, we have to bound the domain of our concern, to organize it, to simplify the materials we deal with, to concentrate on the central tendencies, and to single out the strongest propelling forces’ (1979: 68). He later adds, ‘[t]o be a success … a theory has to show how international politics can be conceived of as a domain distinct from economic, social, and other international domains that one may conceive of ’ (1979: 79). So it is not accurate to suggest that IR theorists, at least careful ones, do not bound or constrain the scope of their studies and generalisations. While bounded theories may offer predictions, the fallible nature of all empirical knowledge and the probabilistic nature of IR laws does restrict what can be predicted. The longer the chain of reasoning and the greater the number of probabilistic propositions that are conjoined, the less one may rely on the predicted event. But this is an argument for limitations on certain types of predictions, not an argument against the predictiveness of IR or social science theory. Bernstein et al. note also that there is the problem of the ‘single case’. They correctly observe that policy-makers often worry about a single instance of an event type (e.g., possible war with our neighbours on our western frontier in the next year) rather than with general propositions (e.g., the problem of war in general, or great-power war, etc.). First, with regard to the relevance of theory to policy, it is important to note that policy-makers do sometimes care about longrun patterns or generalisations in some of their decision-situations. Long-run generalisations are very frequently important for policy-makers. For example, in the 1990s, numerous new states emerged in Europe and central Asia due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of its domination of central eastern Europe. Policy-makers had to understand as correctly as possible the truth of generalisations in DP theory in order to decide how much in the way of financial and diplomatic resources should be committed to help promote democratic polities in the region. Policy-makers in 1994 were not primarily worried about a specific war, say, between Hungary and Slovakia, but rather the long-run chances of conflict arising in a Europe with many nondemocratic states as compared to a Europe with very few such states. Policy-makers could consider two alternative scenarios of the future. One is a Europe with some democratic states and many non-democratic ones, possibly including a non-democratic Russia. The other one envisions a Europe with virtually all democratic states. The generalisations about the effects of democracy on behaviour would allow policy-makers to draw general conclusions about peace and international stability from each scenario. <br />

<strong>Predictions might not be accurate, but that’s a reason they should read specific take-outs</strong><br />
<strong>Fitzsimmons 7</strong> (Michael, “The Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic Planning”, Survival, Winter 06/07) <br />
<br />
Much has been made about the defining role of uncertainty in strategic plan- ning since the end of the Cold War. With the end of bipolar competition, so the argument goes, and the accelerating pace of change in technology and inter- national political and economic relations, forecasting world events even a few years into the future has become exceedingly difficult. Indeed, few in the year 2000 would have described with much accuracy the current conditions facing national-security decision-makers. Moreover, history offers ample evidence, from the Schlieffen Plan to the Soviet economy, that rigid planning creates risks of catastrophic failure. Clearly, uncertainty demands an appreciation for the importance of flexibility in strategic planning. For all of its importance, however, recognition of uncertainty poses a dilemma for strategists: in predicting the future, they are likely to be wrong; but in resisting prediction, they risk clouding the rational bases for making strategic choices. Over-confidence in prediction may lead to good preparation for the wrong future, but wholesale dismissal of prediction may lead a strategist to spread his resources too thinly. In pursuit of flexibility, he ends up well pre- pared for nothing. A natural compromise is to build strategies that are robust across multiple alternative future events but are still tailored to meet the chal- lenges of the most likely future events. Recent US national security strategy, especially in the Department of Defense, has veered from this middle course and placed too much emphasis on the role of uncertainty. This emphasis, paradoxically, illustrates the hazards of both too much allowance for uncertainty and too little. Current policies on nuclear-force planning and the results of the recent Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) are examples of overreaching for strategic flexibility. The record of planning for post-war operations in Iraq, by contrast, indicates that decision-makers, in enlisting uncertainty as a rationale for discounting one set of predictions, have fallen prey to overconfidence in their own alternative set of predictions. A more balanced approach to accounting for uncertainty in strategic plan- ning would address a wide range of potential threats and security challenges, but would also incorporate explicit, transparent, probabilistic reasoning into planning processes. The main benefit of such an approach would not neces- sarily be more precise predictions of the future, but rather greater clarity and discipline applied to the difficult judgements about the future upon which strategy depends. <br />

 <strong>Jackson is wrong—discursive othering doesn’t result in ‘uncontrollable violence’</strong><br />
<strong>Rodwell 5</strong>—PhD candidate, Manchester Met. (Jonathan, Trendy But Empty: A Response to Richard Jackson, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4862:http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/rodwell1.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/rodwell1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/rodwell1.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4862 -->, AMiles) <br />
<br />
In this response I wish to argue that the Post-Structural analysis put forward by Richard Jackson is inadequate when trying to understand American Politics and Foreign Policy. The key point is that this is an issue of methodology and theory. I do not wish to argue that language is not important, in the current political scene (or indeed any political era) that would be unrealistic. One cannot help but be convinced that the creation of identity, of defining ones self (or one nation, or societies self) in opposition to an ‘other’ does indeed take place. Masses of written and aural evidence collated by Jackson clearly demonstrates that there is a discursive pattern surrounding post 9/11 U.S. politics and society. [i] Moreover as expressed at the start of this paper it is a political pattern and logic that this language is useful for politicians, especially when able to marginalise other perspectives. Nothing illustrates this clearer than the fact George W. Bush won re-election, for whatever the reasons he did win, it is undeniable that at the very least the war in Iraq, though arguable far from a success, at the absolute minimum did not damage his campaign. Additionally it is surely not stretching credibility to argue Bush performance and rhetoric during the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks also strengthened his position. However, having said that, the problem is Jackson’s own theoretical underpinning, his own justification for the importance of language. If he was merely proposing that the understanding of language as one of many causal factors is important that would be fine. But he is not. The epistemological and theoretical framework of his argument means the ONLY thing we should look at is language and this is the problem.[ii] Rather than being a fairly simple, but nonetheless valid, argument, because of the theoretical justification it actually becomes an almost nonsensical. My response is roughly laid out in four parts. Firstly I will argue that such methodology, in isolation, is fundamentally reductionist with a theoretical underpinning that does not conceal this simplicity. Secondly, that a strict use of post-structural discourse analysis results in an epistemological cul-de-sac in which the writer cannot actually say anything. Moreover the reader has no reason to accept anything that has been written. The result is at best an explanation that remains as equally valid as any other possible interpretation and at worse a work that retains no critical force whatsoever. Thirdly, possible arguments in response to this charge; that such approaches provide a more acceptable explanation than others are, in effect, both a tacit acceptance of the poverty of force within the approach and of the complete lack of understanding of the identifiable effects of the real world around us; thus highlighting the contradictions within post-structural claims to be moving beyond traditional causality, re-affirming that rather than pursuing a post-structural approach we should continue to employ the traditional methodologies within History, Politics and International Relations. Finally as a consequence of these limitations I will argue that the post-structural call for ‘intertextuals’ must be practiced rather than merely preached and that an understanding and utilisation of all possible theoretical approaches must be maintained if academic writing is to remain useful rather than self-contained and narrative. Ultimately I conclude that whilst undeniably of some value post-structural approaches are at best a footnote in our understanding . <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The first major problem then is that historiographically discourse analysis is so capacious as to be largely of little use. The process of inscription identity, of discourse development is not given any political or historical context, it is argued that it just works, is simply a universal phenomenon. It is history that explains everything and therefore actually explains nothing. To be specific if the U.S. and every other nation is continually reproducing identities through ‘othering’ it is a constant and universal phenomenon that fails to help us understand at all why one result of the othering turned out one way and differently at another time. For example, how could one explain how the process resulted in the 2003 invasion of Iraq but didn’t produce a similar invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 when that country (and by the logic of the Regan administrations discourse) the West was threatened by the ‘Evil Empire’. By the logical of discourse analysis in both cases these policies were the result of politicians being able to discipline and control the political agenda to produce the outcomes. So why were the outcomes not the same? To reiterate the point how do we explain that the language of the War on Terror actually managed to result in the eventual Afghan invasion in 2002? Surely it is impossible to explain how George W. Bush was able to convince his people (and incidentally the U.N and Nato) to support a war in Afghanistan without referring to a simple fact outside of the discourse; the fact that a known terrorist in Afghanistan actually admitted to the murder of thousands of people on the 11h of Sepetember 2001. The point is that if the discursive ‘othering’ of an ‘alien’ people or group is what really gave the U.S. the opportunity to persue the war in Afghanistan one must surly wonder why Afghanistan. Why not North Korea? Or Scotland? If the discourse is so powerfully useful in it’s own right why could it not have happened anywhere at any time and more often? Why could the British government not have been able to justify an armed invasion and regime change in Northern Ireland throughout the terrorist violence of the 1980’s? Surely they could have just employed the same discursive trickery as George W. Bush? Jackson is absolutely right when he points out that the actuall threat posed by Afghanistan or Iraq today may have been thoroughly misguided and conflated and that there must be more to explain why those wars were enacted at that time. Unfortunately that explanation cannot simply come from the result of inscripting identity and discourse. On top of this there is the clear problem that the consequences of the discursive othering are not necessarily what Jackson would seem to identify. This is a problem consistent through David Campbell’s original work on which Jackson’s approach is based[iii]. David Campbell argued for a linguistic process that ‘always results in an other being marginalized’ or has the potential for ‘demonisation’[iv]. At the same time Jackson, building upon this, maintains without qualification that the systematic and institutionalised abuse of Iraqi prisoners first exposed in April 2004 “is a direct consequence of the language used by senior administration officials: conceiving of terrorist suspects as ‘evil’, ‘inhuman’ and ‘faceless enemies of freedom creates an atmosphere where abuses become normalised and tolerated”[v]. The only problem is that the process of differentiation does not actually necessarily produce dislike or antagonism. In the 1940’s and 50’s even subjected to the language of the ‘Red Scare’ it’s obvious not all Americans came to see the Soviets as an ‘other’ of their nightmares. And in Iraq the abuses of Iraqi prisoners are isolated cases, it is not the case that the U.S. militarily summarily abuses prisoners as a result of language. Surely the massive protest against the war, even in the U.S. itself, is also a self evident example that the language of ‘evil’ and ‘inhumanity’ does not necessarily produce an outcome that marginalises or demonises an ‘other’. Indeed one of the points of discourse is that we are continually differentiating ourselves from all others around us without this necessarily leading us to hate fear or abuse anyone.[vi] Consequently, the clear fear of the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War, and the abuses at Abu Ghirab are unusual cases. To understand what is going on we must ask how far can the process of inscripting identity really go towards explaining them? As a result at best all discourse analysis provides us with is a set of universals and a heuristic model. </span></span><br />

<strong>Otherness not the root cause of war</strong><br />

Though “otherness”–cultural, ethnic, religious, racial difference–is an important factor in our relations with others, we should not overestimate it as a cause of conflict. During the war in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990′s, I was often asked, “What is this war about? Is it about religious and cultural differences? Is it about economic advantage? Is it about political power? Is it about land?” The correct response was, of course, that the war was about all of these things. Monocausal explanations of major eruptions of violence are rarely right. Moreover, various causes are intimately intertwined, and each contributes to others. That holds true also for otherness, which I am highlighting here. However, neither should we underestimate otherness as a factor. The contest for political power, for economic advantage, and for a share of the land took place between people who belonged to discrete cultural and ethnic groups. Part of the goal of the war in the former Yugoslavia was the creation of ethnically clean territories with economic and political autonomy. The importance of “otherness” is only slightly diminished if we grant that the sense of ethnic and religious belonging was manipulated by unscrupulous, corrupt, and greedy politicians for their own political and economic gain. The fact that conjured fears for one’s identity could serve to legitimize a war whose major driving force lay elsewhere is itself a testimony to how much “otherness” matters. <br />

<strong>All violence is structural</strong><br />
<strong>Dekker 98</strong> – Senior Lecturer of Law, Utrecht (Ige, Reflections on International Law from the Low Countries, ed Erik Denters, p 327, AG) <br />
<br />
For Galtung structural violence is, in principle, of equal importance as all other forms of violence. In a more recent article, Galtung broadened the concept of violence even further by introducing a third dimension, namely that of cultural violence, which he defined as 'those aspects of culture (...) that can be used to justify or legitimize direct or structural violence.&quot; For Galtung the broadness of the concept of structural violence was and is essential, because 'by means of this concept a social net is constructed whereby birds of many feathers can be caught and kept.&quot; He went so far as to say that 'every profession is in and by itself some form of structural violence.&quot; <br />

The evidence in this book suggests that causality runs at least as strongly the other way. War is not a product of capitalism, imperialism, gender, innate aggression, or any other single cause, although all of these influence wars' outbreaks and outcomes. Rather, war has in part fueled and sustained these and other injustices.4 So, &quot;if you want peace, work for peace.&quot; Indeed, if you want justice (gender and others), work for peace. Causality does not run just upward through the levels of analysis, from types of individuals, societies, and governments up to war. It runs downward too. Enloe suggests that changes in attitudes towards war and the military may be the most important way to &quot;reverse women's oppression.&quot; The dilemma is that peace work focused on justice brings to the peace movement energy, allies, and moral grounding, yet, in light of this book's evidence, the emphasis on injustice as the main cause of war seems to be empirically inadequate.&quot; <br />

<strong>Maximizing all lives is the only way to affirm equality</strong><br />
<strong>Cummiskey 90</strong> – Professor of Philosophy, Bates (David, Kantian Consequentialism, Ethics 100.3, p 601-2, p 606, jstor, AG) <br />
<br />
We must not obscure the issue by characterizing this type of case as the sacrifice of individuals for some abstract &quot;social entity.&quot; It is not a question of some persons having to bear the cost for some elusive &quot;overall social good.&quot; Instead, the question is whether some persons must bear the inescapable cost for the sake of other persons. Nozick, for example, argues that &quot;to use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he is a separate person, that his is the only life he has.&quot;30 Why, however, is this not equally true of all those that we do not save through our failure to act? By emphasizing solely the one who must bear the cost if we act, one fails to sufficiently respect and take account of the many other separate persons, each with only one life, who will bear the cost of our inaction. In such a situation, what would a conscientious Kantian agent, an agent motivated by the unconditional value of rational beings, choose? We have a duty to promote the conditions necessary for the existence of rational beings, but both choosing to act and choosing not to act will cost the life of a rational being. Since the basis of Kant's principle is &quot;rational nature exists as an end-in-itself' (GMM, p. 429), the reasonable solution to such a dilemma involves promoting, insofar as one can, the conditions necessary for rational beings. If I sacrifice some for the sake of other rational beings, I do not use them arbitrarily and I do not deny the unconditional value of rational beings. Persons may have &quot;dignity, an unconditional and incomparable value&quot; that transcends any market value (GMM, p. 436), but, as rational beings, persons also have a fundamental equality which dictates that some must sometimes give way for the sake of others. The formula of the end-in-itself thus does not support the view that we may never force another to bear some cost in order to benefit others. If one focuses on the equal value of all rational beings, then equal consideration dictates that one sacrifice some to save many. [continues] According to Kant, the objective end of moral action is the existence of rational beings. Respect for rational beings requires that, in deciding what to do, one give appropriate practical consideration to the unconditional value of rational beings and to the conditional value of happiness. Since agent-centered constraints require a non-value-based rationale, the most natural interpretation of the demand that one give equal respect to all rational beings lead to a consequentialist normative theory. We have seen that there is no sound Kantian reason for abandoning this natural consequentialist interpretation. In particular, a consequentialist interpretation does not require sacrifices which a Kantian ought to consider unreasonable, and it does not involve doing evil so that good may come of it. It simply requires an uncompromising commitment to the equal value and equal claims of all rational beings and a recognition that, in the moral consideration of conduct, one's own subjective concerns do not have overriding importance. <br />

<strong>Ethical policymaking requires calculation of consequences</strong><br />
<strong>Gvosdev 5</strong> – Rhodes scholar, PhD from St. Antony’s College, executive editor of The National Interest (Nikolas, The Value(s) of Realism, SAIS Review 25.1, pmuse, AG) <br />
<br />
As the name implies, realists focus on promoting policies that are achievable and sustainable. In turn, the morality of a foreign policy action is judged by its results, not by the intentions of its framers. A foreign policymaker must weigh the consequences of any course of action and assess the resources at hand to carry out the proposed task. As Lippmann warned, Without the controlling principle that the nation must maintain its objectives and its power in equilibrium, its purposes within its means and its means equal to its purposes, its commitments related to its resources and its resources adequate to its commitments, it is impossible to think at all about foreign affairs.8 Commenting on this maxim, Owen Harries, founding editor of The National Interest, noted, &quot;This is a truth of which Americans—more apt to focus on ends rather than means when it comes to dealing with the rest of the world—need always to be reminded.&quot;9 In fact, Morgenthau noted that &quot;there can be no political morality without prudence.&quot;10 This virtue of prudence—which Morgenthau identified as the cornerstone of realism—should not be confused with expediency. Rather, it takes as its starting point that it is more moral to fulfill one's commitments than to make &quot;empty&quot; promises, and to seek solutions that minimize harm and produce sustainable results. Morgenthau concluded: [End Page 18] Political realism does not require, nor does it condone, indifference to political ideals and moral principles, but it requires indeed a sharp distinction between the desirable and the possible, between what is desirable everywhere and at all times and what is possible under the concrete circumstances of time and place.11 This is why, prior to the outbreak of fighting in the former Yugoslavia, U.S. and European realists urged that Bosnia be decentralized and partitioned into ethnically based cantons as a way to head off a destructive civil war. Realists felt this would be the best course of action, especially after the country's first free and fair elections had brought nationalist candidates to power at the expense of those calling for inter-ethnic cooperation. They had concluded—correctly, as it turned out—that the United States and Western Europe would be unwilling to invest the blood and treasure that would be required to craft a unitary Bosnian state and give it the wherewithal to function. Indeed, at a diplomatic conference in Lisbon in March 1992, the various factions in Bosnia had, reluctantly, endorsed the broad outlines of such a settlement. For the purveyors of moralpolitik, this was unacceptable. After all, for this plan to work, populations on the &quot;wrong side&quot; of the line would have to be transferred and resettled. Such a plan struck directly at the heart of the concept of multi-ethnicity—that different ethnic and religious groups could find a common political identity and work in common institutions. When the United States signaled it would not accept such a settlement, the fragile consensus collapsed. The United States, of course, cannot be held responsible for the war; this lies squarely on the shoulders of Bosnia's political leaders. Yet Washington fell victim to what Jonathan Clarke called &quot;faux Wilsonianism,&quot; the belief that &quot;high-flown words matter more than rational calculation&quot; in formulating effective policy, which led U.S. policymakers to dispense with the equation of &quot;balancing commitments and resources.&quot;12 Indeed, as he notes, the Clinton administration had criticized peace plans calling for decentralized partition in Bosnia &quot;with lofty rhetoric without proposing a practical alternative.&quot; The subsequent war led to the deaths of tens of thousands and left more than a million people homeless. After three years of war, the Dayton Accords—hailed as a triumph of American diplomacy—created a complicated arrangement by which the federal union of two ethnic units, the Muslim-Croat Federation, was itself federated to a Bosnian Serb republic. Today, Bosnia requires thousands of foreign troops to patrol its internal borders and billions of dollars in foreign aid to keep its government and economy functioning. Was the aim of U.S. policymakers, academics and journalists—creating a multi-ethnic democracy in Bosnia—not worth pursuing? No, not at all, and this is not what the argument suggests. But aspirations were not matched with capabilities. As a result of holding out for the &quot;most moral&quot; outcome and encouraging the Muslim-led government in Sarajevo to pursue maximalist aims rather than finding a workable compromise that could have avoided bloodshed and produced more stable conditions, the peoples of Bosnia suffered greatly. In the end, the final settlement was very close [End Page 19] to the one that realists had initially proposed—and the one that had also been roundly condemned on moral grounds. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:335:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@_Toc105294165&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: _Toc105294165&quot;/&gt; --><a name="_Toc105294165"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:335 --><br />

<strong>Moral tunnel vision is complicit with evil</strong><br />
<strong>Issac 2</strong>—Professor of Political Science at Indiana-Bloomington, Director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Public Life, PhD from Yale (Jeffery C., Dissent Magazine, Vol. 49, Iss. 2, “Ends, Means, and Politics,” p. Proquest) <br />
<br />
As a result, the most important political questions are simply not asked. It is assumed that U.S. military intervention is an act of &quot;aggression,&quot; but no consideration is given to the aggression to which intervention is a response. The status quo ante in Afghanistan is not, as peace activists would have it, peace, but rather terrorist violence abetted by a regime--the Taliban--that rose to power through brutality and repression. This requires us to ask a question that most &quot;peace&quot; activists would prefer not to ask: What should be done to respond to the violence of a Saddam Hussein, or a Milosevic, or a Taliban regime? What means are likely to stop violence and bring criminals to justice? Calls for diplomacy and international law are well intended and important; they implicate a decent and civilized ethic of global order. But they are also vague and empty, because they are not accompanied by any account of how diplomacy or international law can work effectively to address the problem at hand. The campus left offers no such account. To do so would require it to contemplate tragic choices in which moral goodness is of limited utility. Here what matters is not purity of intention but the intelligent exercise of power. Power is not a dirty word or an unfortunate feature of the world. It is the core of politics. Power is the ability to effect outcomes in the world. Politics, in large part, involves contests over the distribution and use of power. To accomplish anything in the political world, one must attend to the means that are necessary to bring it about. And to develop such means is to develop, and to exercise, power. To say this is not to say that power is beyond morality. It is to say that power is not reducible to morality. As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah Arendt have taught, an unyielding concern with moral goodness undercuts political responsibility. The concern may be morally laudable, reflecting a kind of personal integrity, but it suffers from three fatal flaws: (1) It fails to see that the purity of one's intention does not ensure the achievement of what one intends. Abjuring violence or refusing to make common cause with morally compromised parties may seem like the right thing; but if such tactics entail impotence, then it is hard to view them as serving any moral good beyond the clean conscience of their supporters; (2) it fails to see that in a world of real violence and injustice, moral purity is not simply a form of powerlessness; it is often a form of complicity in injustice. This is why, from the standpoint of politics--as opposed to religion--pacifism is always a potentially immoral stand. In categorically repudiating violence, it refuses in principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any effect; and (3) it fails to see that politics is as much about unintended consequences as it is about intentions; it is the effects of action, rather than the motives of action, that is most significant. Just as the alignment with &quot;good&quot; may engender impotence, it is often the pursuit of &quot;good&quot; that generates evil. This is the lesson of communism in the twentieth century: it is not enough that one's goals be sincere or idealistic; it is equally important, always, to ask about the effects of pursuing these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic and historically contextualized ways. Moral absolutism inhibits this judgment. It alienates those who are not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it undermines political effectiveness. <br />

<strong>Ethics can’t guide public policy</strong><br />
<strong>Posner 99</strong> – highly influential legal theorist; Chicago Law School professor (Richard, The Problematics of Moral and Legal Theory, p vii-x, AG) <br />
<br />
The book is in two parts, each containing two chapters. The first part is primarily critical, the second primarily constructive. Chapter 1 tackles normative moral theory on its own terms, arguing that people who make philosophical arguments for why we should alter our moral beliefs or behavior are wasting their time if what they want to do is to alter those beliefs and the behavior the beliefs might influence. Moral intuitions neither do nor should yield to the weak arguments that are all that philosophers can bring to bear on moral issues. I call this position &quot;pragmatic moral skepticism.&quot; It must not be confused with philosophically more radical isms. I am not a moral nihilist, nor an epistemological skeptic or relativist, but merely a limited skeptic, as an example will show. That the Nazis killed millions of defenseless civilians is a fact; its truth is independent of what anyone believes. That the Nazis' actions were morally wrong is a value judgment: it depends on beliefs that cannot be proved true or false. I thus reject moral realism, at least in its strong sense as the doctrine that there are universal moral laws ontologically akin to scientific laws. I am a kind of moral relativist. But my metaethical views are not essential to pragmatic moral skepticism, the doctrine that moral theory is useless, although they help to explain why it is useless. The doctrine is supported by bodies of thought as various as the psychology of action, the character of academic professions in general and of the profession of academic philosophy in particular, and the undesirability of moral uniformity; and above all by the fact that the casuistic and deliberative techniques that moral theorists deploy are too feeble, both epistemologically and rhetorically, to shake moral intuitions. The analogy (of a pregnant woman forced to carry her fetus to term to a person forcibly attached by tubes to a famous violinist for nine months in order to save the violinist from dying of kidney disease) with which Judith Jarvis Thomson defends a right of abortion, and at the other end of the spectrum of abstraction the elaborate contractarian and natural-law arguments that John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis, and others make on behalf of their preferred resolutions of issues in applied ethics, are convincing only to readers predisposed to agree with the philosophers' conclusions. The class of innovators whom I call &quot;moral entrepreneurs&quot; do have the power to change our moral intuitions. But moral entrepreneurs are not the same as academic moralists, such as Thomson and the others I have named. Moral entrepreneurs persuade, but not with rational arguments. Academic moralists use rational arguments; but in part because of the sheer feebleness of such arguments, they do not persuade. Chapter 2 carries the discussion explicitly into the realm of law. I examine issues in jurisprudence, constitutional law, and (to a limited extent) common law and statutory law. I try to show with reference both to individual theorists—Dworkin again, Jurgen Habermas, and others—and to particular cases that moral theory, and such cousins of it as jurisprudence and constitutional theory, are useless in the resolution of concrete legal issues. This is true even when those issues concern such morally charged subjects as abortion, affirmative action, racial and sexual discrimination, and homosexual rights. Consider the constitutionality of laws forbidding physician-assisted suicide, the issue that impelled a group of distinguished moral philosophers led by Dworkin to submit an amicus curiae brief in the Supreme Court that the Court ignored in its decisions upholding those laws. Judges are properly wary about using moral or constitutional theory to decide cases. At the same time, as I illustrate with the Supreme Court's decisions invalidating sex segregation in military academies and a state constitutional provision forbidding local governments to prohibit discrimination against homosexuals, judges are insensitive to the limitations of their own knowledge of the social realities out of which cases arise. They are right to distrust theory that academics press upon them, but they have as yet nothing to put in its place—unless it is an attitude of caution. That is the right attitude in the circumstances. Until judges acquire a better knowledge base, the limitations of moral and constitutional theory provide a compelling argument for judicial self-restraint, although to accept it would be to renounce the dream of many constitutional theorists that the Supreme Court might make over American society in the name of the Constitution but in the reality of radical egalitarianism, Catholic natural law, laissez-Faire economics, or reactionary populism, depending on the theorist. Constitutional scholars would be more helpful to the courts and to society as a whole if they examined constitutional cases and doctrines in relation not to what passes as theory in jurisprudential circles but rather to the social context of constitutional issues, their causes, their costs, and their consequences. This is a neglected perspective, which I illustrate in Chapter 2 by reference to the &quot;real world&quot; effects of constitutional criminal procedure. <br />

<br />
The risks from anthropogenic hazards appear at present larger than those from natural ones. Although great progress has been made in reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the world, humanity is still threatened by the possibility of a global thermonuclear war and a resulting nuclear winter. We may face even greater risks from emerging technologies. Advances in synthetic biology might make it possible to engineer pathogens capable of extinction-level pandemics. The knowledge, equipment, and materials needed to engineer pathogens are more accessible than those needed to build nuclear weapons. And unlike other weapons, pathogens are self-replicating, allowing a small arsenal to become exponentially destructive. Pathogens have been implicated in the extinctions of many wild species. Although most pandemics &quot;fade out&quot; by reducing the density of susceptible populations, pathogens with wide host ranges in multiple species can reach even isolated individuals. The intentional or unintentional release of engineered pathogens with high transmissibility, latency, and lethality might be capable of causing human extinction. While such an event seems unlikely today, the likelihood may increase as biotechnologies continue to improve at a rate rivaling Moore's Law. Farther out in time are technologies that remain theoretical but might be developed this century. Molecular nanotechnology could allow the creation of self-replicating machines capable of destroying the ecosystem. And advances in neuroscience and computation might enable improvements in cognition that accelerate the invention of new weapons. A survey at the Oxford conference found that concerns about human extinction were dominated by fears that new technologies would be misused. These emerging threats are especially challenging as they could become dangerous more quickly than past technologies, outpacing society's ability to control them. As H.G. Wells noted, &quot;Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.&quot; Such remote risks may seem academic in a world plagued by immediate problems, such as global poverty, HIV, and climate change. But as intimidating as these problems are, they do not threaten human existence. In discussing the risk of nuclear winter, Carl Sagan emphasized the astronomical toll of human extinction: A nuclear war imperils all of our descendants, for as long as there will be humans. Even if the population remains static, with an average lifetime of the order of 100 years, over a typical time period for the biological evolution of a successful species (roughly ten million years), we are talking about some 500 trillion people yet to come. By this criterion, the stakes are one million times greater for extinction than for the more modest nuclear wars that kill &quot;only&quot; hundreds of millions of people. There are many other possible measures of the potential loss--including culture and science, the evolutionary history of the planet, and the significance of the lives of all of our ancestors who contributed to the future of their descendants. Extinction is the undoing of the human enterprise. There is a discontinuity between risks that threaten 10 percent or even 99 percent of humanity and those that threaten 100 percent. For disasters killing less than all humanity, there is a good chance that the species could recover. If we value future human generations, then reducing extinction risks should dominate our considerations. Fortunately, most measures to reduce these risks also improve global security against a range of lesser catastrophes, and thus deserve support regardless of how much one worries about extinction. These measures include: Removing nuclear weapons from hair-trigger alert and further reducing their numbers; Placing safeguards on gene synthesis equipment to prevent synthesis of select pathogens; Improving our ability to respond to infectious diseases, including rapid disease surveillance, diagnosis, and control, as well as accelerated drug development; Funding research on asteroid detection and deflection, &quot;hot spot&quot; eruptions, methane hydrate deposits, and other catastrophic natural hazards; Monitoring developments in key disruptive technologies, such as nanotechnology and computational neuroscience, and developing international policies to reduce the risk of catastrophic accidents. Other measures to reduce extinction risks may have less in common with strategies to improve global security, generally. Since a species' survivability is closely related to the extent of its range, perhaps the most effective means of reducing the risk of human extinction is to colonize space sooner, rather than later. Citing, in particular, the threat of new biological weapons, Stephen Hawking has said, &quot;I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet.&quot; Similarly, NASA Administrator Michael Griffin has noted, &quot;The history of life on Earth is the history of extinction events, and human expansion into the Solar System is, in the end, fundamentally about the survival of the species.&quot; <br />

<strong>American imperialism good—solves free trade, property rights, and economic development.</strong><br />
<strong>Ebeling, econ prof, 3</strong> (Richard, econ prof at Northwood University, former president of The Foundation for Economic Education, was the Ludwig von Mises Prof at Hillsdale College, “An American Empire! If You Want It instead of Freedom,”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0305b.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0305b.asp</a>, May, ZBurdette) <br />

Among the great tragedies resulting from the First World War, he believes, was the beginning of the end to the European, and especially British, empires around the world. In the 19th century they had created and maintained a system of international free trade, protected property rights, legally enforced contracts, and secured a global arena for investment and economic development. In their place arose political and economic nationalism that created the chaos of the 1920s and 1930s, which culminated in the Second World War. Now, in the wake of the end of the Cold War, the world is confronted with the same dangers that it faced in the period between the world wars: nationalist and ideological demagogues and religious fanatics. America, therefore, must accept the mantle of global empire for the good of the world and its own well-being. It must do for mankind in the 21st century what the European empires did in the 19th century. <br />

<strong>Trade solves nuclear war and extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Copley News 99</strong> (“Commentary,” Copley News Service, 12-1-1999, Lexis) <br />
<br />
For decades, many children in America and other countries went to bed fearing <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">annihilation by nuclear war</span>. The specter of nuclear winter freezing the life out of planet Earth seemed very real. Activists protesting the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">W</span>orld <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">T</span>rade <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">O</span>rganization's meeting in Seattle apparently have forgotten that threat. The truth is that nations join together in groups like the WTO not just to further their own prosperity, but also to forestall conflict with other nations. In a way, our planet has traded in the threat of a worldwide nuclear war for the benefit of cooperative global economics. Some Seattle protesters clearly fancy themselves to be in the mold of nuclear disarmament or anti-Vietnam War protesters of decades past. But they're not. They're special-interest activists, whether the cause is environmental, labor or paranoia about global government. Actually, most of the demonstrators in Seattle are very much unlike yesterday's peace activists, such as Beatle John Lennon or philosopher Bertrand Russell, the father of the nuclear disarmament movement, both of whom urged people and nations to work together rather than strive against each other. These and other war protesters would probably approve of 135 WTO nations sitting down peacefully to discuss economic issues that in the past might have been settled by bullets and bombs. As long as nations are trading peacefully, and their economies are built on exports to other countries, they have a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">major disincentive to wage war.</span> That's why bringing China, a budding superpower, into the WTO is so important. As exports to the United States and the rest of the world feed Chinese prosperity, and that prosperity increases demand for the goods we produce, the threat of hostility diminishes. Many anti-trade protesters in Seattle claim that only multinational corporations benefit from global trade, and that it's the everyday wage earners who get hurt. That's just plain wrong. First of all, it's not the military-industrial complex benefiting. It's U.S. companies that make high-tech goods. And those companies provide a growing number of jobs for Americans. In San Diego, many people have good jobs at Qualcomm, Solar Turbines and other companies for whom overseas markets are essential. In Seattle, many of the 100,000 people who work at Boeing would lose their livelihoods without world trade. Foreign trade today accounts for 30 percent of our gross domestic product. That's a lot of jobs for everyday workers. Growing global prosperity has helped <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">counter the specter of nuclear winter.</span> Nations of the world are learning to live and work together, like the singers of anti-war songs once imagined. Those who care about world peace shouldn't be protesting world trade. They should be celebrating it. <br />

<strong>Independently, maintain property rights are a voting issue</strong><br />

<br />
Side constraints express the inviolability of other persons. But why may not one violate persons for the greater social good? Individually, we each sometimes choose to undergo some pain or sacrifice for a greater benefit or to avoid a greater harm: we go to the dentist to avoid worse suffering later; we do some unpleasant work for its results; some persons diet to improve their health or looks; some save money to support themselves when they are older. In each case, some cost is borne for the sake of the greater overall good. Why not, similarly, hold that some persons have to bear some costs that benefit other persons more, for the sake of the overall social good? But there is no social entity with a good that undergoes some sacrifice for its own good. There are only individual people, different individual people, with their own individual lives. Using one of these people for the benefit of others, uses him and benefits the others. Nothing more. What happens is that something is done to him for the sake of others. Talk of an overall social good covers this up. (Intentionally?) To use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he is a separate person, that his is the only life he has. He does not get some overbalancing good from his sacrifice, and no one is entitled to force this upon him—least of all a state or government that claims his allegiance (as other individuals do not) and that therefore scrupulously must be neutral between its citizens. <br />

<strong>Imperialism is key to global security—deters conflicts</strong><br />
<strong>Joffe, pol sci prof, 9—</strong>Senior Fellow of Stanford's Freeman-Spogli Institute for International Studies. Fellow in International Relations at the Hoover Institutionand.

Vol. 88, Iss. 5; pg. 21, 15 pgs, AMiles) <br />
<br />
The default power does what others cannot or will not do. It underwrites Europe's security against a resurgent Russia - which is why U.S. troops remain welcome there even 20 years after Moscow's capitulation in the Cold War. It helps the Europeans take care of local malefactors, such as former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. It chastises whoever reaches for mastery over the Middle East, thus the United States helped Iraq in its war against Iran between 1980 and 1988 and then defanged it in 1991 and again in 2003. Only the default power has the power to harness a coalition against Iran, the new pretender in the Middle East. It guarantees the survival of Israel, but at the same time, the Palestinians and the Saudis look to the United States for leverage against Jerusalem. Is it possible to imagine China, Europe, or Russia as a more persuasive mediator? No, because only the United States can insure both the Arabs and the Israelis against the consequences of misplaced credulity. In the new Great Game, the United States offers itself as a silent partner against Russian attempts to restore sway over its former satrapies, and it leads the renewed battle against the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan, signaling ever so softly that it will sequester Pakistan's nuclear weapons if chaos widens into collapse. At the same time, only the United States can rein in both India and Pakistan and protect each against the other. The United States has drawn India into its orbit, and in doing so it has added to the informal balance against China. Dreams of Asia Rising must pay respect to a strategic reality centered on the United States as the underwriter of regional security. Whether Vietnam or Japan, South Korea or Australia - all of Asia counts on the United States to keep China on its best behavior and Japan from going nuclear. <br />

<br />
First, the “hybrid” hegemonic model assumes that the goal of U.S. foreign affairs should be the preservation of American hegemony, which is more stable, more peaceful, and better for America’s security and prosperity, than the alternatives. If the United States were to withdraw from its global leadership role, no other nation would be capable of taking its place.376 The result would be radical instability and a greater risk of major war.377 In addition, the United States would no longer benefit from the public goods it had formerly produced; as the largest consumer, it would suffer the most. <br />

 <strong>War on terror effective now</strong><br />
<strong>Daily Telegraph 10</strong>—British Newspaper (10/13, “Al-Qaeda in crisis amid cash shortage”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4865:http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6318787/Al-Qaeda-in-crisis-amid-cash-shortage.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6318787/Al-Qaeda-in-crisis-amid-cash-shortage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6318787/Al-Qaeda-in-crisis-amid-cash-shortage.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4865 -->, Aly M) <br />
<br />
In the first half of this year, al-Qaeda's core leadership was compelled to make four public appeals for cash, complaining in one case of a &quot;weakness in operations because of lack of money&quot;. Part of the reason for this is that some funding is believed to have gone to the Taliban instead. This financial squeeze has compounded the problems faced by &quot;core al-Qaeda&quot;. Highly effective attacks launched by American Predator drones have eliminated a raft of its most able leaders. Experts believe that Osama bin Laden's network is under immense pressure inside its last redoubts in the Tribal Areas lining Pakistan's north-west frontier. David Cohen, the assistant secretary at the US Treasury responsible for countering terrorist finance, said that al-Qaeda's recent appeal for funds showed its &quot;financial predicament&quot;. He added: &quot;We assess that al-Qaeda is in its weakest financial condition in several years, and that, as a result, its influence is waning. This success is important. It is a sign that we are moving in the right direction.&quot; America and its allies have taken increasingly sophisticated steps to choke the movement of funds to all terrorist groups, principally by freezing assets belonging to &quot;designated&quot; individuals, banks and companies. Traditionally, al-Qaeda's money has tended to come from the Gulf kingdoms, but there is evidence that this flow is being blocked. Carrying out terrorist attacks is relatively cheap - the bombing of the London Underground on 7 July 2005 probably cost only £8,000 - but al-Qaeda also needs cash to train new operatives and buy the safety of its leading figures in the Tribal Areas Without these funds, its ability to operate is severely constrained. Meanwhile, the drone strikes are taking a steady toll of &quot;core al-Qaeda&quot;. Pakistani authorities calculate that 14 al-Qaeda figures died in 60 American drone attacks in the Tribal Areas between January 2006 and April this year. Those who are left are forced to concentrate on securing their own safety and hunting down informers, rather than planning attacks. &quot;Operationally, it does look increasingly difficult for them to hold together as a coherent, disciplined terrorist group,&quot; said Paul Cornish, the head of international security at the Chatham House think tank. <br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Victory has usually been defined throughout the ages as forcing the enemy to accept certain political objectives. “Forcing” usually meant killing, capturing, or wounding men at arms. In today’s polite and politically correct society we seem to have forgotten that nasty but eternal truth in the confusing struggle to defeat radical Islamic terrorism. What stopped the imperial German army from absorbing France in World War I and eventually made the Kaiser abdicate was the destruction of a once magnificent army on the Western front — superb soldiers and expertise that could not easily be replaced. Saddam Hussein left Kuwait in 1991 when he realized that the U.S. military was destroying his very army. Even the North Vietnamese agreed to a peace settlement in 1973, given their past horrific losses on the ground and the promise that American air power could continue indefinitely inflicting its damage on the North. When an enemy finally gives up, it is for a combination of reasons — material losses, economic hardship, loss of territory, erosion of civilian morale, fright, mental exhaustion, internal strife. But we forget that central to a concession of defeat is often the loss of the nation’s soldiers — or even the threat of such deaths. A central theme in most of the memoirs of high-ranking officers of the Third Reich is the attrition of their best warriors. In other words, among all the multifarious reasons why Nazi Germany was defeated, perhaps the key was that hundreds of thousands of its best aviators, U-boaters, panzers, infantrymen, and officers, who swept to victory throughout 1939–41, simply perished in the fighting and were no longer around to stop the allies from doing pretty much what they wanted by 1944–45. After Stalingrad and Kursk, there were not enough good German soldiers to stop the Red Army. Even the introduction of jets could not save Hitler in 1945 — given that British and American airmen had killed thousands of Luftwaffe pilots between 1939 and 1943. After the near destruction of the Grand Army in Russia in 1812, even Napoleon’s genius could not restore his European empire. Serial and massive Communist offensives between November 1950 and April 1951 in Korea cost Red China hundreds of thousands of its crack infantry — and ensured that, for all its aggressive talk, it would never retake Seoul in 1952–53. But aren’t these cherry-picked examples from conventional wars of the past that have no relevance to the present age of limited conflict, terrorism, and insurgency where ideology reigns? Not really. We don’t quite know all the factors that contributed to the amazing success of the American “surge” in Iraq in 2007–08. Surely a number of considerations played a part: Iraqi anger at the brutish nature of al-Qaeda terrorists in their midst; increased oil prices that brought massive new revenues into the country; General Petraeus’s inspired counterinsurgency tactics that helped win over Iraqis to our side by providing them with jobs and security; much-improved American equipment; and the addition of 30,000 more American troops. But what is unspoken is also the sheer cumulative number of al Qaeda and other Islamic terrorists that the U.S. military killed or wounded between 2003 and 2008 in firefights from Fallujah to Basra. There has never been reported an approximate figure of such enemy dead — perhaps wisely, in the post-Vietnam age of repugnance at “body counts” and the need to create a positive media image. Nevertheless, in those combat operations, the marines and army not only proved that to meet them in battle was a near death sentence, but also killed thousands of low-level terrorists and hundreds of top-ranking operatives who otherwise would have continued to harm Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. Is Iraq relatively quiet today because many who made it so violent are no longer around? Contemporary conventional wisdom tries to persuade us that there is no such thing as a finite number of the enemy. Instead, killing them supposedly only incites others to step up from the shadows to take their places. Violence begets violence. It is counterproductive, and creates an endless succession of the enemy. Or so we are told. We may wish that were true. But military history suggests it is not quite accurate. In fact, there was a finite number of SS diehards and kamikaze suicide bombers even in fanatical Nazi Germany and imperial Japan. When they were attrited, not only were their acts of terror curtailed, but it turned out that far fewer than expected wanted to follow the dead to martyrdom. The Israeli war in Gaza is considered by the global community to be a terrible failure — even though the number of rocket attacks against Israeli border towns is way down. That reduction may be due to international pressure, diplomacy, and Israeli goodwill shipments of food and fuel to Gaza — or it may be due to the hundreds of Hamas killers and rocketeers who died, and the thousands who do not wish to follow them, despite their frequently loud rhetoric about a desire for martyrdom. Insurgencies, of course, are complex operations, but in general even they are not immune from eternal rules of war. Winning hearts and minds is essential; providing security for the populace is crucial; improving the economy is critical to securing the peace. But all that said, we cannot avoid the pesky truth that in war — any sort of war — killing enemy soldiers stops the violence. For all the much-celebrated counterinsurgency tactics in Afghanistan, note that we are currently in an offensive in Helmand province to “secure the area.” That means killing the Taliban and their supporters, and convincing others that they will meet a violent fate if they continue their opposition. Perhaps the most politically incorrect and Neanderthal of all thoughts would be that the American military’s long efforts in both Afghanistan and Iraq to kill or capture radical Islamists has contributed to the general safety inside the United States. Modern dogma insists that our presence in those two Muslim countries incited otherwise non-bellicose young Muslims to suddenly prefer violence and leave Saudi Arabia, Yemen, or Egypt to flock to kill the infidel invader. A more tragic view would counter that there was always a large (though largely finite) number of radical jihadists who, even before 9/11, wished to kill Americans. They went to those two theaters, fought, died, and were therefore not able to conduct as many terrorist operations as they otherwise would have, and also provided a clear example to would-be followers not to emulate their various short careers. That may explain why in global polls the popularity both of bin Laden and of the tactic of suicide bombing plummeted in the Middle Eastern street — at precisely the time America was being battered in the elite international press for the Iraq War. Even the most utopian and idealistic do not escape these tragic eternal laws of war. Barack Obama may think he can win over the radical Islamic world — or at least convince the more moderate Muslim community to reject jihadism — by means such as his Cairo speech, closing Guantanamo, trying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York, or having General McChrystal emphatically assure the world that killing Taliban and al-Qaeda terrorists will not secure Afghanistan. Of course, such soft- and smart-power approaches have utility in a war so laden with symbolism in an age of globalized communications. But note that Obama has upped the number of combat troops in Afghanistan, and he vastly increased the frequency of Predator-drone assassination missions on the Pakistani border. Indeed, even as Obama damns Guantanamo and tribunals, he has massively increased the number of targeted assassinations of suspected terrorists — the rationale presumably being either that we are safer with fewer jihadists alive, or that we are warning would-be jihadists that they will end up buried amid the debris of a mud-brick compound, or that it is much easier to kill a suspected terrorist abroad than detain, question, and try a known one in the United States. In any case, the president — immune from criticism from the hard Left, which is angrier about conservative presidents waterboarding known terrorists than liberal ones executing suspected ones — has concluded that one way to win in Afghanistan is to kill as many terrorists and insurgents as possible. And while the global public will praise his kinder, gentler outreach, privately he evidently thinks that we will be safer the more the U.S. marines shoot Taliban terrorists and the more Hellfire missiles blow up al-Qaeda planners. Why otherwise would a Nobel Peace Prize laureate order such continued offensive missions? Victory is most easily obtained by ending the enemy’s ability to resist — and by offering him an alternative future that might appear better than the past. We may not like to think all of that entails killing those who wish to kill us, but it does, always has, and tragically always will — until the nature of man himself changes. </span></span><br />

To an increasing extent, <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">people are congregating in the world’s great urban centers, creating megacities with populations exceeding 10 million individuals</span></span>. At the same time, <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">advanced technology has designed nuclear explosives of such small size they can be easily transported in a car</span></span>, small plane or boat <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">to the heart of a city</span></span>. We demonstrate here that <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">a single detonation in the 15 kiloton range can produce urban fatalities approaching one million</span></span> in some cases, <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">and casualties exceeding one million</span></span>. Thousands of small weapons still exist in the arsenals of the U.S. and Russia, and there are at least six other countries with substantial nuclear weapons inventories. In all, thirty-three countries control sufficient amounts of highly enriched uranium or plutonium to assemble nuclear explosives. A conflict between any of these countries involving 50-100 weapons with yields of 15 kt has the potential to create fatalities rivaling those of the Second World War. Moreover, <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">even a single surface nuclear explosion</span></span>, or an air burst in rainy conditions, <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">in a city center is likely to cause the entire metropolitan area to be abandoned at least for decades</span></span> owing to infrastructure damage and radioactive contamination. As the aftermath of hurricane Katrina in Louisiana suggests, <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">the economic consequences of even a localized nuclear catastrophe would most likely have severe national and international economic consequences</span></span>. Striking effects result even from relatively small nuclear attacks because low yield detonations are most effective against city centers where business and social activity as well as population are concentrated. Rogue nations and <span class="boldunderline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">terrorists would be most likely to strike there</span></span>. Accordingly, an organized <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">attack on the U.S. by a small nuclear state, or terrorists</span></span> supported by such a state, <span class="boldunderline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">could generate casualties comparable to those</span></span> once <span class="boldunderline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">predicted for a full-scale nuclear “counterforce” exchange in a superpower conflict</span></span>. Remarkably, the <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">estimated quantities of smoke generated by attacks totaling about one megaton of nuclear explosives could lead to </span></span><span class="boldunderline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">significant global climate perturbations</span></span> (Robock et al., 2007). While we did not extend our casualty and damage predictions to include potential medical, social or economic impacts following the initial explosions, such analyses have been performed in the past for large-scale nuclear war scenarios (Harwell and Hutchinson, 1985). Such a study should be carried out as well for the present scenarios and physical outcomes. <br />

In our military, the danger of accepting the traditional wisdom has become part of the traditional wisdom. Despite our lip service to creativity and innovation, we rarely pause to question fundamentals. Partly, of course, this is because officers in today's Army or Marine Corps operate at a wartime tempo, with little leisure for reflection. Yet, even more fundamentally, deep prejudices have crept into our military--as well as into the civilian world-that obscure elementary truths. There is no better example of our unthinking embrace of an error than our rejection of the term &quot;war of attrition.&quot; The belief that attrition, as an objective or a result, is inherently negative is simply wrong. A soldier's job is to kill the enemy. All else, however important it may appear at the moment, is secondary. And to kill the enemy is to attrit the enemy. All wars in which bullets--or arrows--fly are wars of attrition. Of course, the term &quot;war of attrition&quot; conjures the unimaginative slaughter of the Western Front, with massive casualties on both sides. Last year, when journalists wanted to denigrate our military's occupation efforts in Iraq, the term bubbled up again and again. The notion that killing even the enemy is a bad thing in war has been exacerbated by the defense industry's claims, seconded by glib military careerists, that precision weapons and technology in general had irrevocably changed the nature of warfare. But the nature of warfare never changes--only its superficial manifestations. The US Army also did great harm to its own intellectual and practical grasp of war by trolling for theories, especially in the 1980s. Theories don't win wars. Well-trained, well-led soldiers in well-equipped armies do. And they do so by killing effectively. Yet we heard a great deal of nonsense about &quot;maneuver warfare&quot; as the solution to all our woes, from our numerical disadvantage vis-a-vis the Warsaw Pact to our knowledge that the &quot;active defense&quot; on the old inner-German border was political tomfoolery and a military sham--and, frankly, the best an Army gutted by Vietnam and its long hangover could hope to do. Maneuver is not a solution unto itself, any more than technology is. It exists in an ever-readjusting balance with fires. Neither fires nor maneuver can be dispensed with. This sounds obvious, but that which is obvious is not always that which is valued or pursued. Those who would be theorists always prefer the arcane to the actual. Precious few military campaigns have been won by maneuver alone-at least not since the Renaissance and the days of chessboard battles between corporate condottieri. Napoleon's Ulm campaign, the Japanese march on Singapore, and a few others make up the short list of &quot;bloodless&quot; victories. Even campaigns that appear to be triumphs of maneuver prove, on closer inspection, to have been successful because of a dynamic combination of fire and maneuver. The opening, conventional phase of the Franco-Prussian War, culminating in the grand envelopment at Sedan, is often cited as an example of brilliant maneuver at the operational level--yet the road to Paris was paved with more German than French corpses. It was a bloody war that happened to be fought on the move. Other campaigns whose success was built on audacious maneuvers nonetheless required attrition battles along the way or at their climax, from Moltke's brilliant concentration on multiple axes at Koenigsgraetz (urgent marches to a gory day), to the German blitzkrieg efforts against the Poles, French, and Russians, and on to Operation Desert Storm, in which daring operational maneuvers positioned tactical firepower for a series of short, convincingly sharp engagements. Even the Inchon landing, one of the two or three most daring operations led by an American field commander, failed to bring the Korean War to a conclusion. More often than not, an overreliance on bold operational maneuvers to win a swift campaign led to disappointment, even disaster. One may argue for centuries about the diversion of a half dozen German divisions from the right flank of the Schlieffen Plan in 1914, but the attempt to win the war in one swift sweep led to more than four years of stalemate on the Western Front. In the same campaign season, Russian attempts at grand maneuver in the vicinity of the Masurian lakes collapsed in the face of counter-maneuvers and sharp encounter battles--a German active defense that drew on Napoleon's &quot;strategy of the central position&quot;--while, in Galicia, aggressive maneuvering proved to be exactly the wrong approach for the Austro-Hungarian military-which was ill-prepared for encounter battles. <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">There is no substitute for shedding the enemy's blood</span>. Despite initial maneuver victories against Russia and in the Western Desert, a German overreliance on maneuver as a substitute for adequate firepower ultimately led to the destruction of Nazi armies. Time and again, from Lee's disastrous Gettysburg campaign to the race to the Yalu in Korea, overconfidence in an army's capabilities to continue to assert its power during grand maneuvers led to stunning reverses. The results were not merely a matter of Clausewitzian culminating points, but of fundamentally flawed strategies. Operation Iraqi Freedom, one of the most successful military campaigns in history, was intended to be a new kind of war of maneuver, in which aerial weapons would &quot;shock and awe&quot; a humbled opponent into surrender while ground forces did a little light dusting in the house of war. But instead of being decided by maneuvered technologies, the three-week war was fought and won--triumphantly--by soldiers and marines employing both aggressive operational maneuvers and devastating tactical firepower. The point is not that maneuver is the stepbrother of firepower, but that there is no single answer to the battlefield, no formula. The commander's age-old need to balance incisive movements with the application of weaponry is unlikely to change even well beyond our lifetimes. It's not an either-or matter, but about getting the integration right in each specific case. Although no two campaigns are identical, the closest we can come to an American superpower model of war would be this: strategic maneuver, then operational maneuver to deliver fires, then tactical fires to enable further maneuver. Increasingly, strategic fires play a role--although they do not win wars or decide them. Of course, no battlefield is ever quite so simple as this proposition, but any force that loses its elementary focus on killing the enemy swiftly and relentlessly until that enemy surrenders unconditionally cripples itself. Far from entering an age of maneuver, we have entered a new age of attrition warfare in two kinds: First, the war against religious terrorism is unquestionably a war of attrition--if one of your enemies is left alive or unimprisoned, he will continue trying to kill you and destroy your civilization. Second, Operation Iraqi Freedom, for all its dashing maneuvers, provided a new example of a postmodern war of attrition--one in which the casualties are overwhelmingly on one side. Nothing says that wars of attrition have to be fair. It's essential to purge our minds of the cliched images the term &quot;war of attrition&quot; evokes. Certainly, we do not and will not seek wars in which vast casualties are equally distributed between our own forces and the enemy's. But a one-sided war of attrition, enabled by our broad range of superior capabilities, is a strong model for a 21st-century American way of war. No model is consistently applicable. That is or should be--a given. Wars create exceptions, to the eternal chagrin of military commanders and the consistent embarrassment of theorists. One of our greatest national and military strengths is our adaptability. Unlike many other cultures, we have an almost-primal aversion to wearing the straitjacket of theory, and our independence of mind serves us very well, indeed. But the theorists are always there, like devils whispering in our ears, telling us that airpower will win this war, or that satellite &quot;intelligence&quot; obviates the need for human effort, or that a mortal enemy will be persuaded to surrender by a sound-and-light show. Precision weapons unquestionably have value, but they are expensive and do not cause adequate destruction to impress a hardened enemy. The first time a guided bomb hits the deputy's desk, it will get his chief's attention, but if precision weaponry fails both to annihilate the enemy's leadership and to somehow convince the army and population it has been defeated, it leaves the job to the soldier once again. Those who live in the technological clouds simply do not grasp the importance of graphic, extensive destruction in convincing an opponent of his defeat. <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Focus on killing the enemy</span>. With fires. With maneuver. With sticks and stones and polyunsaturated fats. In a disciplined military, aggressive leaders and troops can always be restrained. But it's difficult to persuade leaders schooled in caution that their mission is not to keep an entire corps' tanks on line, but to rip the enemy's heart out. We have made great progress from the ballet of Desert Storm--&quot;spoiled&quot; only by then-Major General Barry McCaffrey's insistence on breaking out of the chorus line and kicking the enemy instead of thin air--to the close-with-the-enemy spirit of last year's race to Baghdad. In the bitter years after Vietnam, when our national leaders succumbed to the myth that the American people would not tolerate casualties, elements within our military--although certainly not everyone--grew morally and practically timid. By the mid-1990s, the US Army's informal motto appeared to be &quot;We won't fight, and you can't make us.&quot; There were obvious reasons for this. Our military--especially the Army and Marine Corps--felt betrayed by our national leadership over Vietnam. Then President Reagan evacuated Beirut shortly after the bombing of our Marine barracks on the city's outskirts--beginning a long series of bipartisan retreats in the face of terror that ultimately led to 9/11. We hit a low point in Mogadishu, when Army Rangers, Special Operations elements, and line troops delivered a devastating blow against General Aideed's irregulars--only to have President Clinton declare defeat by pulling out. One may argue about the rationale for our presence in Somalia and about the dangers of mission creep, but once we're in a fight, we need to win it--and remain on the battlefield long enough to convince our enemies they've lost on every count. Things began to change less than two weeks into our campaign in Afghanistan. At first, there was caution--would the new President run as soon as we suffered casualties? Then, as it dawned on our commanders that the Administration would stand behind our forces, we saw one of the most innovative campaigns in military history unfold with stunning speed. Our military, and especially our Army, has come a long way. But we're still in recovery--almost through our Cold War hangover, but still too vulnerable to the nonsense concocted by desk-bound theoreticians. Evaluating lessons learned in Iraq, a recent draft study for a major joint command spoke of the need for &quot;discourses&quot; between commanders at various levels and their staffs. Trust me. We don't need discourses. We need plain talk, honest answers, and the will to close with the enemy and kill him. And to keep on killing him until it is unmistakably clear to the entire world who won. When military officers start speaking in academic gobbledygook, it means they have nothing to contribute to the effectiveness of our forces. They badly need an assignment to Fallujah. Consider our enemies in the War on Terror. Men who believe, literally, that they are on a mission from God to destroy your civilization and who regard death as a promotion are not impressed by elegant maneuvers. You must find them, no matter how long it takes, then kill them. If they surrender, you must accord them their rights under the laws of war and international conventions. But, as we have learned so painfully from all the mindless, leftwing nonsense spouted about the prisoners at Guantanamo, <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">you are much better off killing them before they have a chance to surrender</span>. We have heard no end of blather about network-centric warfare, to the great profit of defense contractors. If you want to see a superb--and cheap example of &quot;net-war,&quot; look at al Qaeda. The mere possession of technology does not ensure that it will be used effectively. And effectiveness is what matters. It isn't a question of whether or not we want to fight a war of attrition against religion-fueled terrorists. We're in a war of attrition with them. We have no realistic choice. Indeed, our enemies are, in some respects, better suited to both global and local wars of maneuver than we are. They have a world in which to hide, and the world is full of targets for them. They do not heed laws or boundaries. They make and observe no treaties. They do not expect the approval of the United Nations Security Council. They do not face election cycles. And their weapons are largely provided by our own societies. We have the technical capabilities to deploy globally, but, for now, we are forced to watch as Pakistani forces fumble efforts to surround and destroy concentrations of terrorists; we cannot enter any country (except, temporarily, Iraq) without the permission of its government. We have many tools--military, diplomatic, economic, cultural, law enforcement, and so on--but we have less freedom of maneuver than our enemies. But we do have superior killing power, once our enemies have been located. Ultimately, the key advantage of a superpower is super power. Faced with implacable enemies who would kill every man, woman, and child in our country and call the killing good (the ultimate war of attrition), we must be willing to use that power wisely, but remorselessly. We are, militarily and nationally, in a transition phase. Even after 9/11, we do not fully appreciate the cruelty and determination of our enemies. We will learn our lesson, painfully, because the terrorists will not quit. The only solution is to kill them and keep on killing them: a war of attrition. But a war of attrition fought on our terms, not theirs. Of course, we shall hear no end of fatuous arguments to the effect that we can't kill our way out of the problem. Well, until a better methodology is discovered, killing every terrorist we can find is a good interim solution. The truth is that even if you can't kill yourself out of the problem, you can make the problem a great deal smaller by effective targeting. And we shall hear that killing terrorists only creates more terrorists. <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">This is sophomoric nonsense</span>. The surest way to swell the ranks of terror is to follow the approach we did in the decade before 9/11 and do nothing of substance. <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Success breeds success. Everybody loves a winner</span>. The cliches exist because they're true. Al Qaeda and related terrorist groups metastasized because they were viewed in the Muslim world as standing up to the West successfully and handing the Great Satan America embarrassing defeats with impunity. Some fanatics will flock to the standard of terror, no matter what we do. But it's far easier for Islamic societies to purge themselves of terrorists if the terrorists are on the losing end of the global struggle than if they're allowed to become triumphant heroes to every jobless, unstable teenager in the Middle East and beyond. Far worse than fighting such a war of attrition aggressively is to pretend you're not in one while your enemy keeps on killing you. Even the occupation of Iraq is a war of attrition. We're doing remarkably well, given the restrictions under which our forces operate. But no grand maneuvers, no gestures of humanity, no offers of conciliation, and no compromises will persuade the terrorists to halt their efforts to disrupt the development of a democratic, rule-of-law Iraq. On the contrary, anything less than relentless pursuit, with both preemptive and retaliatory action, only encourages the terrorists and remaining Baathist gangsters. With hardcore terrorists, it's not about PSYOP or jobs or deploying dental teams. It's about killing them. Even regarding the general population, which benefits from our reconstruction and development efforts, the best thing we can do for them is to kill terrorists and insurgents. Until the people of Iraq are secure, they are not truly free. The terrorists know that. We pretend otherwise. This will be a long war, stretching beyond many of our lifetimes. And it will be a long war of attrition. We must ensure that the casualties are always disproportionately on the other side. Curiously, while our military avoids a &quot;body count&quot; in Iraq--body counts have at least as bad a name as wars of attrition--the media insist on one. Sad to say, the body count cherished by the media is the number of our own troops dead and wounded. With our over-caution, we have allowed the media to create a perception that the losses are consistently on our side. By avoiding an enemy body count, we create an impression of our own defeat. In a war of attrition, numbers matter. Regarding the other postmodern form of wars of attrition--the high-velocity conventional operations in which maneuver and firepower, speed and violent systemic shock, combine to devastate an opposing force-the Army and Marine Corps need to embrace it, instead of allowing the technical services, the Air Force and Navy, to define the future of war (which the Air Force, especially, is defining wrongly). We will not live to see a magical suite of technologies achieve meaningful victories at no cost in human life. We need to oppose that massive lie at every opportunity. The 21st century's opening decades, at least, will be dominated by the up-gunned Cain-and-Abel warfare we have seen from Manhattan to Bali, from Afghanistan's Shamali Plain to Nasiriyeh, from Fallujah to Madrid. The problem is that the Department of Defense combines two fundamentally different breeds of military services. In the Air Force and the Navy, people support machines. In the Army and Marine Corps, machines support people. While expensive technologies can have great utility--and Air Force and Navy assets made notable contributions to the Army-Marine victory in Operation Iraqi Freedom--the technical services have a profoundly diminished utility in the extended range of operations we are required to perform, from urban raids to extended occupations, from foot patrols in remote environments to peacemaking. The Navy is struggling hard with these issues, but the Air Force is the strongest opponent of admitting that we face wars of attrition, since it has invested overwhelmingly in precision weapons designed to win a war by &quot;deconstructing&quot; the enemy's command networks. But the only way you can decisively cripple the command networks of terrorist organizations is by killing terrorists. Even in Operation Iraqi Freedom, airpower made an invaluable contribution, but attacking military and governmental infrastructure targets proved no substitute for destroying enemy forces. When, in mid-war, the focus of the air effort shifted from trying to persuade Saddam Hussein to wave a white handkerchief (which he had no incentive to do) to destroying Iraqi military equipment and killing enemy troops, the utility of airpower soared. It cannot be repeated often enough: Whatever else you aim to do in wartime, never lose your focus on killing the enemy. A number of the problems we have faced in the aftermath of Operation Iraqi Freedom arose because we tried to moderate the amount of destruction we inflicted on the Iraqi military. The only result was the rise of an Iraqi Dolchstosslegende, the notion that they weren't really defeated, but betrayed. Combined with insufficient numbers of Coalition troops to blanket the country-especially the Sunni triangle--in the weeks immediately following the toppling of the regime, crucial portions of the population never really felt America's power. It is not enough to materially defeat your enemy. You must convince your enemy that he has been defeated. You cannot do that by bombing empty buildings. You must be willing to kill in the short term to save lives and foster peace in the long term. This essay does not suppose that warfare is simple: &quot;Just go out and kill' era.&quot; Of course, incisive attacks on command networks and control capabilities, well-considered psychological operations, and humane treatment of civilians and prisoners matter profoundly, along with many other complex factors. But at a time when huckster contractors and &quot;experts&quot; who never served in uniform prophesize bloodless wars and sterile victories through technology, it's essential that those who actually must fight our nation's wars not succumb to the facile theories or shimmering vocabulary of those who wish to explain war to our soldiers from comfortable offices. It is not a matter of whether attrition is good or bad. It's necessary. Only the shedding of their blood defeats resolute enemies. Especially in our struggle with God-obsessed terrorists--the most implacable enemies our nation has ever faced there is no economical solution. Unquestionably, our long-term strategy must include a wide range of efforts to do what we, as outsiders, can to address the environmental conditions in which terrorism arises and thrives (often disappointingly little--it's a self-help world). But, for now, all we can do is to impress our enemies, our allies, and all the populations in between that we are winning and will continue to win. <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">The only way to do that is through killing</span>. <br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">But do the conditions that made non-violence a successful strategy in these three historical cases pertain to the present confrontation between the civilized world and </span></span>international <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">terrorism? In particular, do such conditions exist in the present confrontation between, on one side, the fundamentalist Muslim terrorist organization al Qaeda and their allies in the Taliban government of Afghanistan and, on the other side, the United States, the United Kingdom, and their allies in the civilized world? This is a question worth considerable thought and analysis, and I do not pretend to have all the answers. My formal degrees are in the field of political science (I particularly studied international affairs), and I have a modest reputation as an amateur historian, especially as regards 20th Century military history. I like to think that I also have a smidgen of intelligence, and some small talent for logical analysis. Whether I do, here are my observations about pacifism and the current war on terrorism. After some thought I have concluded that for pacifist </span></span>tactics <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">to succeed, at the minimum, the following conditions must pertain. One, the pacifist's opponents must be rational (capable of understanding the logic of the pacifist's position). Two, the opponents must have moral values and ideals that are not inimical to the pacifist's. Three, the opponents must respect basic human rights. And four, the pacifist's opponents must not </span></span>necessarily <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">equate non-violence with weakness. Looking at our historical pacifist models, Jesus was a rabbi saving souls and teaching people in the (Jewish) culture in which he was raised. Dr. King was a Christian minister leading a movement for the rights of his people in the (American) culture in which he was raised. And Gandhi was leading his people in their struggle for independence from the British (a rational and moral people with a long democratic tradition of self-rule). The fundamental ingredients for successful pacifism were in place in all three instances. Of the three historical examples, I am most familiar with the American Civil Rights movement of the 1950's and early 1960's, because it took place during my lifetime, and because I gave it my support. In that case, the American population was literate and well educated, basically rational, and had a long democratic tradition. Furthermore, all of the participants were Americans and were raised in the same culture, there was widespread respect for human rights, the Judeo/Christian ethic was the cultural norm, and virtually no one wanted violence. Also, in that case, the vast majority of Caucasian Americans had (and have) no desire to oppress Negro Americans. All of the conditions required for successful pacifism were indeed fulfilled. Unfortunately, at least one (and usually more) of the required conditions are always missing when opposing totaliarian regimes (due to the nature of totaliarian regimes). Nor can they be present in any struggle against international terrorism (the fundamental tenents of terrorism preclude points two and three). In fact, none of the requisite conditions for successful pacifism are fufilled in the present struggle against </span></span>Islamic <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">terrorists. Throughout history, pacifism and non-violence has encouraged those with a totalitarian bent (whether religious or secular) to ever-greater crimes against their own people, their neighbors, and the rest of humanity. They have historically interpreted it as weakness, which they invariably attempt to exploit for their own demented purposes. This is clear from the writings and statements of modern totalitarian leaders. For example: The vast majority of European Jews responded non-violently to the Nazi pogrom. They went peacefully to the concentration camps, and ultimately to their deaths, a fact that has puzzled historians for years. This pacifistic approach did nothing to slow down the &quot;Final Solution,&quot; and in fact increased its efficiency. Which is the history behind the slogan popular in modern Israel: &quot;Never again!&quot; Another example: Non-violence was simply not a viable option when the forces of the Imperial Japanese Empire attacked the US, the UK, and their allies in December of 1941. Had the Western Allies not resisted with armed force, the Japanese would clearly have gone on to occupy, and exploit by force, all of Southeast Asia and the entire Pacific basin, as well as China. Had they not been opposed by armed force Germany, Japan, and the other Axis nations would have eventually built a power base that made them literally unstoppable. War was the only viable way to prevent this and, with 20-20 hindsight, clearly the correct decision. (Paradoxically, had the Axis succeeded in world domination, international terrorism would probably not be a problem today. Axis [state] terrorism would have systematically executed all of the dissidents in the occupied territories, and long since crushed the independent states of the Middle East. The entire region would be under the boot heel of the Axis, and the people there would be slaves. Terrorism is effective only where there are moral and innocent people to terrorize.) The United States of America had, </span></span>until <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the events of 11 September 2001, largely ignored terrorism. This was especially true during the 8 years of the Clinton Administration. You could even make the argument that the terrorist acts of 11 September 2001 were, at least in part, the result of President Clinton's legacy of inaction. The Clinton Administration took no effective action when the al Qaeda terrorist organization attacked the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people, and again did nothing when al Qaeda attacked the United States Ship Cole. Both of those assaults were ipso-facto declarations of war, acts that historically require a declaration of war from the aggrieved state. But the Clinton Administration chose not to take decisive action. At the end of his administration, in a move cynically designed to garner Puerto Rican votes for Hillary Clinton's senate bid, President Clinton pardoned 16 terrorists convicted of bombing attacks against New York city, over the vociferous objections of the entire law enforcement community. President Clinton evidently believed that terrorists would leave America alone if America did not respond to, even forgave, terrorist provocation. Clearly, American restraint did not convince the al Qaeda terrorists to leave America alone. (Neither, for that matter, did America's </span></span>repeated <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">attempts to save Moslem people from violence and starvation in various parts of the world.) The leaders and members of al Qaeda did not become more amenable to reason, their ethics and morality did not improve, they steadfastly rejected the concept of human rights, and they did not abandon violence. (Unlikely in any case, as their &quot;culture&quot; views pacifism as weakness.) Instead, they were emboldened to greater acts of terrorism, which resulted in the suicide attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. These fanatics have stated that, If they could, they would kill everyone in America and every American anywhere in the world to achieve their goals. (Interestingly, this would include almost all American Muslims, who are not proper &quot;fundamentalists&quot; by al Qaeda standards.) The notorious al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, among others, has made this clear in his speeches and recent statements. So have the leaders of the totalitarian theocracy in Afghanistan known as the Taliban, who support al Qaeda and international terrorism. Personally, I have serious reservations about the practicality of any &quot;war&quot; against intangibles, whether poverty, drugs, or terrorism. But, one way or another, I am convinced that international terrorists and the regimes that support them must be rooted out and brought to justice--which means killed--because they will not stop killing us. (As I understand it, the theology of the Islamic terrorists promises them rewards in heaven for killing us.) I have reluctantly accepted the necessity for a broad based campaign on the economic, political, and military fronts against the terrorists themselves and the nation states that support them, as outlined by President Bush. No citizen of the civilized world should expect a quick victory over international terrorism. Understand that the terrorists who attacked the United States on 11 September 2001 have drawn us into a long series of wars. We have embarked on a process that will take many years to bring to a successful conclusion. Want it or not, the United States in particular and the Western democracies in general, are involved in a war to the death with these terrorists and their supporters. A war in which there are no real front lines, and in which the terrorist &quot;fighters&quot; would much rather attack defenseless civilians than engage our troops. Since terrorists have forced civilized people everywhere to be on the &quot;front lines&quot; of this battle, my first suggestion to decent people on the home front is to arm themselves. In the United States, federal and state governments should encourage those Americans who so desire to arm themselves, in accordance with our individual Constitutional right &quot;to keep and bear arms.&quot; (That means to own and carry guns, without superfluous government restrictions on law-abiding citizens.) And I would suggest that the governments of the other democratic nations of the world ease their draconian restrictions on the private ownership of firearms (especially handguns). It is time for the leaders of democratic governments worldwide to trust their own citizens. Permit those people of the civilized world, who are willing to do so, to accept responsibility for their own safety, on the Israeli model. Islamic terrorists claim that they are willing to die to the last man for their cause; unfortunately, we must be ready and willing to help them do just that. On the home front, this has become a battle between fanatical terrorists fighting to die and decent people fighting to live. To paraphrase General Patton: Our job is not to die for our beliefs, it is to make the other poor bastard die for his.</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="tab-stops: .25in;">Agamben contends that biopolitics has be­come intensified today. This intensification translates the paradox of sovereignty into a potential disaster. The analysis that he offers at this point seems not so much wrong to me as overly formal. It reflects a classical liberal and Arendtian assumption that there was a time when politics was restricted to public life, and biocultural life was kept in the private realm. What a joke. Every way of life in­volves the infusion of norms, judgments, and standards into the affective life of participants at both private and public levels. Every way of life is biocultural and biopolitical. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="tab-stops: .25in;">For Negri, the danger of Agamben’s thought lies not in its Aristotelian rigour or formal elegance but in its inability to open a panorama of revolutionary struggle that can oppose the modern order of sovereignty and the transcendental ideal of power that backs it up. As long as constituent power remains caught in the paradox of sovereignty and the constituted order produces bare life as the limit condition of an exception that has become the rule, there can be no hope of questioning the transcendentalism of sovereign power or imagining a form of political conduct that remains free of the impositions of the modern state. </span><br />

<strong>Modern-day biopolitics expand freedom and solve totalitarian genocides</strong><br />
<strong>Dickinson 4 –</strong> Prof History, Cincinnati (Edward, Biopolitics, Fascism, Democracy, Central European History 31.1, AG) <br />
<br />
<span style="tab-stops: .25in;">In an important programmatic statement of 1996 Geoff Eley celebrated the fact that Foucault’s ideas have “fundamentally directed attention away from institutionally centered conceptions of government and the state . . . and toward a dispersed and decentered notion of power and its ‘microphysics.’”48 The “broader, deeper, and less visible ideological consensus” on “technocratic reason and the ethical unboundedness of science” was the focus of his interest.49 But the “power-producing effects in Foucault’s ‘microphysical’ sense” (Eley) of the construction of social bureaucracies and social knowledge, of “an entire institutional apparatus and system of practice” ( Jean Quataert), simply do not explain Nazi policy.50 The destructive dynamic of Nazism was a product not so much of a particular modern set of ideas as of a particular modern political structure, one that could realize the disastrous potential of those ideas. What was critical was not the expansion of the instruments and disciplines of biopolitics, which occurred everywhere in Europe. Instead, it was the principles that guided how those instruments and disciplines were organized and used, and the external constraints on them. In National Socialism, biopolitics was shaped by a totalitarian conception of social management focused on the power and ubiquity of the volklsch state. In democratic societies, biopolitics has historically been constrained by a rights-based strategy of social management. This is a point to which I will return shortly. For now, the point is that what was decisive was actually politics at the level of the state. A comparative framework can help us to clarify this point. Other states passed compulsory sterilization laws in the 1930s — indeed, individual states in the United States had already begun doing so in 1907. Yet they did not proceed to the next steps adopted by National Socialism — mass sterilization, mass “eugenic” abortion and murder of the “defective.” Individual figures in, for example, the U.S. did make such suggestions. But neither the political structures of democratic states nor their legal and political principles permitted such policies actually being enacted. Nor did the scale of forcible sterilization in other countries match that of the Nazi program. I do not mean to suggest that such programs were not horrible; but in a democratic political context they did not develop the dynamic of constant radicalization and escalation that characterized Nazi policies. &lt;Continues p 24-5…&gt; Like Fritzsche's essay, Eley's accurately reflected the tone of most of those it introduced. In the body of the volume, Elizabeth Domansky, for example, pointed out that biopolitics &quot;did not 'automatically' or 'naturally' lead to the rise of National soctausrn,&quot; but rather &quot;provided ... the political Right in Weimar with the opportunity to capitalize on a discursive strategy that could successfully compete with liberal and socialist strategles.&quot;63 This Is correct; but the language of biopolitics was demonstrably one on which liberals, socialists, and advocates of a democratic welfare state could also capitalize. 'and did. Or again, Jean Quataert remarked-quite rightly, I believe - that &quot;the most progressive achievements of the Weimar welfare state were completely embedded&quot; in biopolitical discourse. She also commented that Nazi policy was &quot;continuous with what passed as the ruling knowledge of the time&quot; and was a product of &quot;an extreme form of technocratic reason&quot; and &quot;early twentieth-century modernity's dark side.&quot; The implication seems to be that &quot;progressive&quot; welfare policy was fundamentally &quot;dark&quot;; but it seems more accurate to conclude that biopolitics had a variety of potentials. 54 Again, the point here is not that any of the interpretations offered in these pieces are wrong; instead, it is that we are, collectively, so focused on unmasking the negative potentials and realities of modernity that we have constructed a true, but very one-sided picture. &lt;Continues p 35-8…&gt; Democratic biopolitical regimes require, enable, and incite a degree of self-direction and participation that is functionally incompatible with authoritarian or totalitarian structures. And this pursuit of biopolitical ends through a regime of democratic citizenship does appear, historically, to have imposed increasingly narrow limits on coercive policies, and to have generated a &quot;logic&quot; or imperative of increasing liberalization. Despite limitations imposed by political context and the slow pace of discursive change, I think this is the unmistakable message of the really very impressive waves of legislative and welfare reforms in the 1920s or the 1970s in Germany.90 Of course it is not yet clear whether this is an irreversible dynamic of such systems. Nevertheless, such regimes are characterized by sufficient degrees of autonomy (and of the potential for its expansion) for sufficient numbers of people that I think it becomes useful to conceive of them as productive of a strategic configuration of power relations that might fruitfully be analyzed as a condition of &quot;liberty,&quot; just as much as they are productive of constraint, oppression, or manipulation. At the very least, totalitarianism cannot be the soie orientation point for our understanding of biopolitics, the only end point of the logic of social engineering. This notion is not at all at odds with the core of Foucauldian (and Peukertian) theory. Democratic welfare states are regimes of power/knowledge no less than early twentieth-century totalitarian states; these systems are not &quot;opposites,&quot; in the sense that they are two alternative ways of organizing the same thing. But they are two very different ways of organizing it. The concept &quot;power&quot; should not be read as a universal stifling night of oppression, manipulation, and entrapment, in which all political and social orders are grey, are essentially or effectively &quot;the same.&quot; Power is a set of social relations, in which individuals and groups have varying degrees of autonomy and effective subjectivity. And discourse is, as Foucault argued, &quot;tactically polyvalent.&quot; Discursive elements (like the various elements of biopolitics) can be combined in different ways to form parts of quite different strategies (like totalitarianism or the democratic welfare state); they cannot be assigned to one place in a structure, but rather circulate. The varying possible constellations of power in modern societies create &quot;multiple modernities,&quot; modern societies with quite radically differing potentials. Biopolitics: Who Is Doing What To Whom? This understanding of the democratic and totalitarian potentials of biopolitics at the level of the state needs to be underpinned by a reassessment of how biopolitical discourse operates in society at large, at the &quot;prepolitical&quot; level. I would like to try to offer here the beginnings of a reconceptualization of biopolitical modernity, one that focuses less on the machinations of technocrats and experts, and more on the different ways that biopolitical thinking circulated within German society more broadly. It is striking, then, that the new model of German modernity is even more relentlessly negative than the old Sonderweg model. In that older model, premodern elites were constantly triumphing over the democratic opposition. But at least there was an opposition; and In the long run, time was on the side of that opposition, which In fact embodied the historical movement of modernization. In the new model, there is virtually a biopolitical consensus. 92 And that consensus is almost always fundamentally a nasty, oppressive thing, one that partakes in crucial ways of the essential quality of National Socialism. Everywhere biopolitics is intrusive, technocratic, top-down, constraining, limiting. Biopolitics is almost never conceived of- or at least discussed in any detail- as creating possibilities for people, as expanding the range of their choices, as empowering them, or indeed as doing anything positive for them at all. Of course, at the most simple-minded level, it seems to me that an assessment of the potentials of modernity that ignores the ways in which biopolitics has made life tangibly better is somehow deeply flawed. To give just one example, infant mortality in Germany in 1900 was just over 20 percent; or, in other words, one in five children died before reaching the age of one year. By 1913, it was 15 percent; and by 1929 (when average real purchasing power was not significantly higher than in 1913) it was only 9.7 percent.93 The expansion of Infant health programs- an enormously ambitious, bureaucratic, medicalizing, and sometimes Intrusive, social engineering project- had a great deal to do with that change. It would be bizarre to write a history of biopolitical modernity that ruled out an appreciation for how absolutely wonderful and astonishing this achievement- and any number of others like it - really was. There was a reason for the &quot;Machbarkeitswahn&quot; of the early twentieth century: many marvelous things were in fact becoming machbar. In that sense, it is not really accurate to call it a &quot;Wahn&quot; (delusion, craziness) at all; nor is it accurate to focus only on the &quot;inevitable&quot; frustration of &quot;delusions&quot; of power. Even In the late 1920s, many social engineers could and did look with great satisfaction on the changes they genuinely had the power to accomplish. Concretely, moreover, I am not convinced that power operated In only one direction - from the top down- In social work. Might we not ask whether people actually demanded welfare services, and whether and how social workers and the state struggled to respond to those demands? David Crew and Greg Eghlglan, for example, have given us detailed studies of the micropolitlcs of welfare In the Weimar period In which It becomes clear that conflicts between welfare administrators and their &quot;clients&quot; were sparked not only by heavyhanded Intervention, but also by refusal to help.94 What Is more, the specific nature of social programs matters a great deal, and we must distinguish between the different dynamics (and histories) of different programs. The removal of children from their families for placement In foster families or reformatories was bitterly hated and stubbornly resisted by working-class families; but mothers brought their children to Infant health clinics voluntarily and In numbers, and after 1945 they brought their older children to counseling clinics, as well. In this Instance, historians of the German welfare state might profit from the &quot;demand side&quot; models of welfare development that are sometimes more explicitly explored un some of the International literature. 95 In fact, even where social workers really were attempting to limit or subvert the autonomy and power of parents, I am not sure that their actions can be characterized only and exclusively as part of a microphysics of oppression. Progressive child welfare advocates in Germany, particularly in the National Center for Child Welfare, waged a campaign in the 1920s to persuade German parents and educators to stop beating children with such ferocity, regularity, and nonchalance. They did so because they feared the unintended physical and psychological effects of beatings, and Implicitly because they believed physical violence could compromise the development of the kind of autonomous, self-reliant subjectivity on which a modern state had to rely In Its cltlzenry.96 Or, to give another common example from the period, children removed from their families after being subjected by parents or other relatives to repeated episodes of violence or rape were being manipulated by biopolitical technocrats, and were often abused in new ways in institutions or foster families; but they were also being liberated. Sometimes some forms of the exercise of power in society are in some ways emancipatory: and that is historically significant. &lt;Continues p 40…&gt; At its simplest, this view of the politics of expertise and professionalization is certainly plausible. Historically speaking, however, the further conjecture that this &quot;micropolitical&quot; dynamic creates authoritarian, totalitarian, or homicidal potentials at the level of the state does not seem very tenable. Historically, it appears that the greatest advocates of political democracy -in Germany, left liberals and Social Democrats - have been· also the greatest advocates of every kind of biopolitical social engineering, from public health and welfare programs through social insurance to city planning and, yes, even eugenics.102 The state they built has intervened in social relations to an (until recently) ever-growing degree; professionalization has run ever more rampant in Western societies; the production of scientistic and technocratic expert knowledge has proceeded at an ever more frenetic pace. And yet, from the perspective of the first years of the millennium, the second half of the twentieth century appears to be the great age of democracy in precisely those societies where these processes have been most in evidence. What is more, the interventionist state has steadily expanded both the rights and the resources of virtually every citizen - including those who were stigmatized and persecuted as biologically defective under National Socialism. </span><br />

 <strong>Epistemology not first</strong><br />
<strong>Owen 2</strong>—Reader of Political Theory, U Southampton (David, Millennium Vol 31 No 3 2002 p. 655-7) <br />
<br />
Commenting on the ‘philosophical turn’ in IR, Wæver remarks that ‘[<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">a] frenzy for words like “epistemology” and “ontology” </span></span>often <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">signals this philosophical turn</span></span>’, although he goes on to comment that these terms are often used loosely.4 However, loosely deployed or not, it is clear that debates concerning ontology and epistemology play a central role in the contemporary IR theory wars. In one respect, this is unsurprising since it is a characteristic feature of the social sciences that periods of disciplinary disorientation involve recourse to reflection on the philosophical commitments of different theoretical approaches, and there is no doubt that such reflection can play a valuable role in making explicit the commitments that characterise (and help individuate) diverse theoretical positions. Yet, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">such a</span></span> philosophical <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">turn is not without its dangers</span></span> and I will briefly mention three before turning to consider a confusion that has, I will suggest, helped to promote the IR theory wars by motivating this philosophical turn. The first danger with the philosophical turn is that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">it has an inbuilt tendency to prioritise</span></span> issues of <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">ontology and epistemology over explanatory and/or interpretive power as if the latter two were merely a simple function of the former</span></span>. But <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">while the explanatory</span></span> and/or interpretive <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">power of a theoretical account is not</span></span> wholly <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">independent of its ontological and/or epistemological commitments</span></span> (otherwise criticism of these features would not be a criticism that had any value), <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">it is by no means </span></span>clear that it is, in contrast, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">wholly dependent on these philosophical commitments. Thus, for example, one need not be sympathetic to rational choice theory to recognise that it can provide powerful accounts of certain kinds of problems, such as the tragedy of the commons in which dilemmas of collective action are foregrounded. It may</span></span>, of course, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">be the case that the advocates of rational choice theory cannot give a good account of why this type of theory is powerful in accounting for this class of problems</span></span> (i.e., how it is that the relevant actors come to exhibit features in these circumstances that approximate the assumptions of rational choice theory) <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">and</span></span>, if <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">this </span></span>is the case, it <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">is a philosophical weakness</span></span>—<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">but this does not undermine the point that, for a certain class of problems, rational choice theory may provide the best account available to us</span></span>. In other words, while the critical judgement of theoretical accounts in terms of their ontological and/or epistemological sophistication is one kind of <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">critical judgement</span></span>, it <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">is not</span></span> the only or even necessarily <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the most important kind. The </span></span>second danger run by the philosophical turn is that because <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">prioritisation of ontology and epistemology promotes theory-construction from philosophical first principles, it cultivates a theory-driven rather than problem-driven approach to IR</span></span>. Paraphrasing Ian Shapiro, the point can be put like this: <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">since </span></span>it is the case that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">there is always a plurality of possible true descriptions of a given action,</span></span> event or phenomenon, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the challenge is to decide which is the most apt in terms of getting a perspicuous grip on the action, </span></span>event or phenomenon in question given the purposes of the inquiry; yet, from this standpoint,<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"> ‘theory-driven work is part of a reductionist program’ in that it ‘dictates always opting for the description that calls for the explanation that flows from the preferred model or theory’</span></span>.5 The justification offered for this strategy rests on the mistaken belief that it is necessary for social science because general explanations are required to characterise the classes of phenomena studied in similar terms. However, as Shapiro points out, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">this is to misunderstand the enterprise of science since ‘whether there are general explanations for classes of phenomena is a question for social-scientific inquiry, not to be prejudged before conducting that inquiry</span></span>’.6 Moreover, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">this strategy easily slips into the promotion of the pursuit of generality over that of empirical validity. </span></span>The third danger is that the preceding two combine to encourage the formation of a particular image of disciplinary debate in IR—what might be called (only slightly tongue in cheek) ‘the Highlander view’—namely, an image of warring theoretical approaches with each, despite occasional temporary tactical alliances, dedicated to the strategic achievement of sovereignty over the disciplinary field. It encourages this view because the turn to, and <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">prioritisation of, ontology and epistemology stimulates the idea that there can only be one theoretical approach which gets things right, namely, the theoretical approach that gets its ontology and epistemology right.</span></span> This image feeds back into IR exacerbating the first and second dangers, and so a potentially vicious circle arises. <br />

As long ago as 1981, Yale Ferguson and Richard Mansbach effectively laid the influence of the dogmatic behaviouralism of the 1960s to rest in their book <em>The Elusive Quest</em>, signaling the profound disillusionment of mainstream IR with the idea that a cumulative science of IR would ever be possible (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ip/journal/v45/n2/full/8800222a.html#bib6%23bib6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ferguson and Mansbach, 1988</a>). The popularity of the ‘naïve’ form of positivism, wed to a view of inexorable scientific progress and supposedly practiced by wide-eyed scholars during the 1960s, has long been a thing of the past. Postmodernists hence do the discipline a disservice when they continue to attack the overly optimistic and dogmatic form of positivism as if it still represented a dominant orthodoxy, which must somehow be overthrown. Equally, supporters of the contemporary or ‘neo-’ version of positivism perform a similar disservice when they fail to articulate their epistemological assumptions clearly or at all. Indeed, the first error is greatly encouraged by the second, since by failing to state what they stand for, neo-positivists have allowed postmodernists to fashion a series of straw men who burn rapidly at the slightest touch. Articulating a full list of these assumptions lies beyond the scope of this article, but contemporary neo-positivists are, I would suggest, committed to the following five assumptions, none of which are especially radical or hard to defend: (1) That explaining the social and political world ought to be our central objective, (2) That — subjective though our perceptions of the world may be — many features of the political world are at least potentially explainable. What remains is a conviction that there are at least some empirical propositions, which can be demonstrably shown to be ‘true’ or ‘false’, some underlying regularities that clearly give shape to IR (such as the proposition that democracies do not fight one another), (3) That careful use of appropriate methodological techniques can establish what patterns exist in the political world, (4) That positive and normative questions, though related, are ultimately separable, although both constitute valid and interesting forms of enquiry. There is also a general conviction (5) that careful use of research design may help researchers avoid logical pitfalls in their work. Doubtless, there are some who would not wish to use the term ‘positivism’ as an umbrella term for these five assumptions, in which case we probably require a new term to cover them. But to the extent that there exists an ‘orthodoxy’ in the field of IR today, this is surely it. Writing in 1989, Thomas Biersteker noted that ‘the vast majority of scholarship in international relations (and the social sciences for that matter) proceeds without conscious reflection on its philosophical bases or premises. In professional meetings, lectures, seminars and the design of curricula, we do not often engage in serious reflection on the philosophical bases or implications of our activity. Too often, consideration of these core issues is reserved for (and largely forgotten after) the introductory weeks of required concepts and methods courses, as we socialize students into the profession’ (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ip/journal/v45/n2/full/8800222a.html#bib2%23bib2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Biersteker, 1989</a>). This observation — while accurate at the time — would surely be deemed incorrect were it to be made today. Even some scholars who profess regret at the philosophically self-regarding nature of contemporary of IR theory, nevertheless feel compelled to devote huge chunks of their work to epistemological issues before getting to more substantive matters (see for instance<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ip/journal/v45/n2/full/8800222a.html#bib21%23bib21" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wendt, 1999</a>). The recent emphasis on epistemology has helped to push IR as a discipline further and further away from the concerns of those who actually practice IR. The consequent decline in the policy relevance of what we do, and our retreat into philosophical self-doubt, is ironic given the roots of the field in very practical political concerns (most notably, how to avoid war). What I am suggesting is not that IR scholars should ignore philosophical questions, or that such ‘navel gazing’ is always unproductive, for questions of epistemology surely undergird every vision of IR that ever existed. Rather, I would suggest that the existing debate is sterile and unproductive in the sense that the various schools of thought have much more in common than they suppose; stated more specifically, postpositivists have much more in common than they would like to think with the positivists they seek to condemn. Consequently, to the extent that there is a meaningful dialogue going on with regard to epistemological questions, it has no real impact on what we do as scholars when we look at the world ‘out there’. Rather than focusing on epistemology, it is inevitably going to be more fruitful to subject the substantive claims made by positivists (of all metatheoretical stripes) and postpositivists to the cold light of day. My own view, as the reader may have gathered already, is that the empirical claims of scholars like Der Derian and Campbell will not often stand up to such harsh scrutiny given the inattention to careful evidence gathering betrayed by both, but this is a side issue here; the point is that substantive theoretical and empirical claims, rather than metatheoretical or epistemological ones, ought to be what divides the international relations scene today.<br />

<strong>We control empirics</strong><br />
<strong>Wohlforth</strong> <strong>8</strong>—Daniel Webster Professor of Government, Dartmouth. BA in IR, MA in IR and MPhil and PhD in pol sci, Yale (William, Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War, October 2008, World Politics Vol. 61, Iss. 1; pg. 28, 31 pgs, Proquest, AMiles) <br />
<br />
Despite increasingly compelling findings concerning the importance of status seeking in human behavior, research on its connection to war waned some three decades ago.38 Yet empirical studies of the relationship between both systemic and dyadic capabilities distributions and war have continued to cumulate. If the relationships implied by the status theory run afoul of well-established patterns or general historical findings, then there is little reason to continue investigating them. The clearest empirical implication of the theory is that status competition is unlikely to cause great power military conflict in unipolar systems. If status competition is an important contributory cause of great power war, then, ceteris paribus, unipolar systems should be markedly less war-prone than bipolar or multipolar systems. And this appears to be the case. As Daniel Geller notes in a review of the empirical literature: &quot;The only polar structure that appears to influence conflict probability is unipolarity.&quot;39 In addition, a larger number of studies at the dyadic level support the related expectation that narrow capabilities gaps and ambiguous or unstable capabilities hierarchies increase the probability of war.40 These studies are based entirely on post-sixteenth-century European history, and most are limited to the post-1815 period covered by the standard data sets. Though the systems coded as unipolar, near-unipolar, and hegemonic are all marked by a high concentration of capabilities in a single state, these studies operationalize unipolarity in a variety of ways, often very differently from the definition adopted here. An ongoing collaborative project looking at ancient interstate systems over the course of two thousand years suggests that historical systems that come closest to the definition of unipolarity used here exhibit precisely the behavioral properties implied by the theory. 41 As David C. Kang's research shows, the East Asian system between 1300 and 1900 was an unusually stratified unipolar structure, with an economic and militarily dominant China interacting with a small number of geographically proximate, clearly weaker East Asian states.42 Status politics existed, but actors were channeled by elaborate cultural understandings and interstate practices into clearly recognized ranks. Warfare was exceedingly rare, and the major outbreaks occurred precisely when the theory would predict: when China's capabilities waned, reducing the clarity of the underlying material hierarchy and increasing status dissonance for lesser powers. Much more research is needed, but initial exploration of other arguably unipolar systems-for example, Rome, Assyria, the Amarna system-appears consistent with the hypothesis.43 Status Competition and Causal Mechanisms Both theory and evidence demonstrate convincingly that competition for status is a driver of human behavior, and social identity theory and related literatures suggest the conditions under which it might come to the fore in great power relations. Both the systemic and dyadic findings presented in large-N studies are broadly consistent with the theory, but they are also consistent with power transition and other rationalist theories of hegemonic war. <br />

<span style="tab-stops: .25in;"><strong>Criticizing Western “imperialism” obscures more insidious practices by regional powers</strong> </span><br />

<br />
Nor have many considered the possibility that if the concept of imperialism has a relevance today, it applies to certain aggressive, authoritarian regimes of the non-Western world rather than to the contemporary West. In this paper I fully accept that there is a concentration of much world power - economic, cultural, political and military - in the hands of Western elites. In my recent book, Theory of the Global State, I discuss the development of a 'global-Western state conglomerate' (Shaw 2000). I argue that 'global' ideas and institutions, whose significance characterizes the new political era that has opened with the end of the Cold War, depend largely - but not solely - on Western power. I hold no brief and intend no apology for official Western ideas and behaviour. And yet I propose that the idea of a new imperialism is a profoundly misleading, indeed ideological concept that obscures the realities of power and especially of empire in the twenty-first century. This notion is an obstacle to understanding the significance, extent and limits of contemporary Western power. It simultaneously serves to obscure many real causes of oppression, suffering and struggle for transformation against the quasi-imperial power of many regional states. I argue that in the global era, this separation has finally become critical. This is for two related reasons. On the one hand, Western power has moved into new territory, largely uncharted -- and I argue unchartable -- with the critical tools of anti-imperialism. On the other hand, the politics of empire remain all too real, in classic forms that recall both modern imperialism and earlier empires, in many non-Western states, and they are revived in many political struggles today. Thus the concept of a 'new imperialism' fails to deal with both key post-imperial features of Western power and the quasi-imperial character of many non-Western states. The concept overstates Western power and understates the dangers posed by other, more authoritarian and imperial centres of power. Politically it identifies the West as the principal enemy of the world's people, when for many of them there are far more real and dangerous enemies closer to. <br />

<strong>A weak military doesn’t prevent US aggression – it encourages miscalculation</strong><br />
<span class="addmd"><strong>Feaver, 5</strong> - </span><span style="color: black;">Professor of Political Science at Duke (Peter, </span>Armed servants: agency, oversight, and civil-military relations, p. 4-5) <br />
<br />
The civil-military problematique is so vexing because it involves balancing two vital and potentially conflicting societal desiderata. On the one hand, the military must be strong enough to prevail in war. One purpose behind establishing the military in the first place is the need, or perceived need, for military force, either to attack other groups or to ward off attacks. The military primarily exists as a guard against disaster and should always be ready even if it is never used. Moreover, its strength should be sized appropriately to meet the threats confronting the polity. It serves no purpose to establish a protection force and then to vitiate it to the point where it can no longer protect. Indeed, an inadequate military institution may be worse than none at all. It could be a paper tiger inviting outside aggression: strong enough in appearance to threaten powerful enemies, but not strong enough in fact to defend against their predations. Alternatively, it could lull leaders into a false confidence, leading them to rash behavior and then failing in the ultimate military contest. <br />

<strong>Empiricism is adequate to make claims about the world—Jackson’s critique makes interpreting any type of reality impossible</strong><br />
<strong>Rodwell 5</strong>—PhD candidate, Manchester Met. (Jonathan, Trendy But Empty: A Response to Richard Jackson, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4871:http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/rodwell1.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/rodwell1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/rodwell1.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4871 -->, AMiles) <br />
<br />
The larger problem is that without clear causal links between materially identifiable events and factors any assessment within the argument actually becomes nonsensical. Mirroring the early inability to criticise, if we have no traditional causational discussion how can we know what is happening? For example, Jackson details how the rhetoric of anti-terrorism and fear is obfuscating the real problems. It is proposed that the real world killers are not terrorism, but disease or illegal drugs or environmental issues. The problem is how do we know this? It seems we know this because there is evidence that illustrates as much – Jackson himself quoting to Dr David King who argued global warming is a greater that than terrorism. The only problem of course is that discourse analysis has established (as argued by Jackson) that King’s argument would just be self-contained discourse designed to naturalise another arguments for his own reasons. Ultimately it would be no more valid than the argument that excessive consumption of Sugar Puffs is the real global threat. It is worth repeating that I don’t personally believe global terrorism is the world’s primary threat, nor do I believe that Sugar Puffs are a global killer. But without the ability to identify real facts about the world we can simply say anything, or we can say nothing. This is clearly ridiculous and many post-structuralists can see this. Their argument is that there “are empirically more persuasive explanations.”[xi] The phrase ‘empirically persuasive’ is however the final undermining of post-structural discourse analysis. It is a seemingly fairly obvious reintroduction of traditional methodology and causal links. It implies things that can be seen to be right regardless of perspective or discourse. It again goes without saying that logically in this case if such an assessment is possible then undeniable material factors about the word are real and are knowable outside of any cultural definition. Language or culture then does not wholy constitute reality. How do we know in the end that the world not threatened by the onslaught of an oppressive and dangerous breakfast cereal? Because empirically persuasive evidence tells us this is the case. The question must then be asked, is our understanding of the world born of evidential assessment, or born of discourse analysis? Or perhaps it’s actually born of utilisation of many different possible explanations. <br />

<strong>Other states won’t follow your transition—they will just exploit US weakness</strong><br />

<br />
This highlights the central difficulty with Wendt's constructivism. It is not any form of unfounded idealism about the possibility of effecting a change in international politics. Wendt accepts that the intersubjective character of international institutions such as self-help render them relatively hard social facts. Rather, What is problematic is his faith that such chance, if it could be achieved, implies progress. Wendt's entire approach is governed by the belief that the problematic elements of international politics can be transcended, that the competitive identities which create these elements can be reconditioned, and that the predatory policies which underlie these identities can be eliminated. Everything in his account, is up for gabs: there is no core of recalcitrance to human conduct which cannot be reformed, unlearnt, disposed of. This venerates a stance that so privileges the possibility of a systemic transformation that it simply puts aside the difficulties which it recognises to be inherent in its achievement. Thus, even though Wendt acknowledges that the intersubjective basis of the self-help system makes its reform difficult, this does not dissuade him. He simply demands that states adopt a strategy of 'altercasting', a strategy which 'tries to induce alter to take on a new identity (and thereby enlist alter in ego's effort to change itself) by treating alter as if it already had that identity'. Wendt's position effectively culminates in a demand that the state undertake nothing less than a giant leap of faith. The fact that its opponent might not take its overtures seriously. might not be interested in reformulating its own construction of the world. or might simply see such an opening as a weakness to be exploited. are completely discounted. The prospect of achieving a systemic transformation simply outweighs any adverse consequences which might arise from the effort to achieve it. Wendt ultimately appears, in the final analysis, to have overdosed on 'Gorbimania'. <br />

 <strong>We control uniqueness—violence and conflict are decreasing globally as a result of Western modernity</strong><br />
<strong>Pinker 7</strong> (Steven, Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology – Harvard University, “A History of Violence”, Edge: The Third Culture, 3-28, <span style="color: black;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/pinker07/pinker07_index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/pinker07/pinker07_index.html</a></span>, CAT) <br />

In sixteenth-century Paris, a popular form of entertainment was cat-burning, in which a cat was hoisted in a sling on a stage and slowly lowered into a fire. According to historian Norman Davies, &quot;[T]he spectators, including kings and queens, shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized.&quot; Today, such sadism would be unthinkable in most of the world. This change in sensibilities is just one example of perhaps the most important and most underappreciated trend in the human saga: Violence has been in decline over long stretches of history, and today we are probably living in the most peaceful moment of our species' time on earth. In the decade of Darfur and Iraq, and shortly after the century of Stalin, Hitler, and Mao, the claim that violence has been diminishing may seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene. Yet recent studies that seek to quantify the historical ebb and flow of violence point to exactly that conclusion. Some of the evidence has been under our nose all along. Conventional history has long shown that, in many ways, we have been getting kinder and gentler. Cruelty as entertainment, human sacrifice to indulge superstition, slavery as a labor-saving device, conquest as the mission statement of government, genocide as a means of acquiring real estate, torture and mutilation as routine punishment, the death penalty for misdemeanors and differences of opinion, assassination as the mechanism of political succession, rape as the spoils of war, pogroms as outlets for frustration, homicide as the major form of conflict resolution—all were unexceptionable features of life for most of human history. But, today, they are rare to nonexistent in the West, far less common elsewhere than they used to be, concealed when they do occur, and widely condemned when they are brought to light. At one time, these facts were widely appreciated. They were the source of notions like progress, civilization, and man's rise from savagery and barbarism. Recently, however, those ideas have come to sound corny, even dangerous. They seem to demonize people in other times and places, license colonial conquest and other foreign adventures, and conceal the crimes of our own societies. The doctrine of the noble savage—the idea that humans are peaceable by nature and corrupted by modern institutions—pops up frequently in the writing of public intellectuals like José Ortega y Gasset (&quot;War is not an instinct but an invention&quot;), Stephen Jay Gould (&quot;Homo sapiens is not an evil or destructive species&quot;), and Ashley Montagu (&quot;Biological studies lend support to the ethic of universal brotherhood&quot;). But, now that social scientists have started to count bodies in different historical periods, they have discovered that the romantic theory gets it backward: Far from causing us to become more violent, something in modernity and its cultural institutions has made us nobler. To be sure, any attempt to document changes in violence must be soaked in uncertainty. In much of the world, the distant past was a tree falling in the forest with no one to hear it, and, even for events in the historical record, statistics are spotty until recent periods. Long-term trends can be discerned only by smoothing out zigzags and spikes of horrific bloodletting. And the choice to focus on relative rather than absolute numbers brings up the moral imponderable of whether it is worse for 50 percent of a population of 100 to be killed or 1 percent in a population of one billion. Yet, despite these caveats, a picture is taking shape. The decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon, visible at the scale of millennia, centuries, decades, and years. It applies over several orders of magnitude of violence, from genocide to war to rioting to homicide to the treatment of children and animals. And it appears to be a worldwide trend, though not a homogeneous one. The leading edge has been in Western societies, especially England and Holland, and there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the Age of Reason in the early seventeenth century. At the widest-angle view, one can see a whopping difference across the millennia that separate us from our pre-state ancestors. Contra leftist anthropologists who celebrate the noble savage, quantitative body-counts—such as the proportion of prehistoric skeletons with axemarks and embedded arrowheads or the proportion of men in a contemporary foraging tribe who die at the hands of other men—suggest that pre-state societies were far more violent than our own. It is true that raids and battles killed a tiny percentage of the numbers that die in modern warfare. But, in tribal violence, the clashes are more frequent, the percentage of men in the population who fight is greater, and the rates of death per battle are higher. According to anthropologists like Lawrence Keeley, Stephen LeBlanc, Phillip Walker, and Bruce Knauft, these factors combine to yield population-wide rates of death in tribal warfare that dwarf those of modern times. If the wars of the twentieth century had killed the same proportion of the population that die in the wars of a typical tribal society, there would have been two billion deaths, not 100 million. Political correctness from the other end of the ideological spectrum has also distorted many people's conception of violence in early civilizations—namely, those featured in the Bible. This supposed source of moral values contains many celebrations of genocide, in which the Hebrews, egged on by God, slaughter every last resident of an invaded city. The Bible also prescribes death by stoning as the penalty for a long list of nonviolent infractions, including idolatry, blasphemy, homosexuality, adultery, disrespecting one's parents, and picking up sticks on the Sabbath. The Hebrews, of course, were no more murderous than other tribes; one also finds frequent boasts of torture and genocide in the early histories of the Hindus, Christians, Muslims, and Chinese. At the century scale, it is hard to find quantitative studies of deaths in warfare spanning medieval and modern times. Several historians have suggested that there has been an increase in the number of recorded wars across the centuries to the present, but, as political scientist James Payne has noted, this may show only that &quot;the Associated Press is a more comprehensive source of information about battles around the world than were sixteenth-century monks.&quot; Social histories of the West provide evidence of numerous barbaric practices that became obsolete in the last five centuries, such as slavery, amputation, blinding, branding, flaying, disembowelment, burning at the stake, breaking on the wheel, and so on. Meanwhile, for another kind of violence—homicide—the data are abundant and striking. The criminologist Manuel Eisner has assembled hundreds of homicide estimates from Western European localities that kept records at some point between 1200 and the mid-1990s. In every country he analyzed, murder rates declined steeply—for example, from 24 homicides per 100,000 Englishmen in the fourteenth century to 0.6 per 100,000 by the early 1960s. On the scale of decades, comprehensive data again paint a shockingly happy picture: Global violence has fallen steadily since the middle of the twentieth century. According to the Human Security Brief 2006, the number of battle deaths in interstate wars has declined from more than 65,000 per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 per year in this decade. In Western Europe and the Americas, the second half of the century saw a steep decline in the number of wars, military coups, and deadly ethnic riots. Zooming in by a further power of ten exposes yet another reduction. After the cold war, every part of the world saw a steep drop-off in state-based conflicts, and those that do occur are more likely to end in negotiated settlements rather than being fought to the bitter end. Meanwhile, according to political scientist Barbara Harff, between 1989 and 2005 the number of campaigns of mass killing of civilians decreased by 90 percent. <br />

Government is politics: Whenever you turn anything over to the government, it ceases to be a financial, medical, commercial, educational, or human-rights matter, and becomes a political issue — to be decided by whoever has the most political influence. And that will never be you or I. Why should military matters be any different? Should we be surprised that companies like Bechtel and Halliburton have already received hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts to rebuild Iraq without competitive bidding? Did you really think this war would be fought with no regard for political gain or abuse? 7. You don't control the government: You can look at the previous six items and say you would have handled some things differently. But who asked you? No one. And no one ever will.

To get it enacted you’ll need political allies, since alone you have only limited influence. But other people will support your plan and work for it only if you modify it in dozens of ways that further their goals and satisfy their opinions. Suppose you make the necessary compromises and amass enough support to pressure the politicians to vote for your revised program. Who will write the actual law? You? Of course not. It will be written by the same legislators and aides who created all the laws, programs, and problems you object to now. Each of them will compromise your program still further to satisfy his political supporters. And if the law passes, who will administer it? You? Of course not. It will be implemented by bureaucrats — many of whom will use it to pursue goals quite different from what you had in mind. They won’t care what your purpose was. It’s their law now, and they’ll use it to suit their objectives. And, lastly, the new law probably will generate many disputes — cases that must be settled in a courtroom. Who will decide those cases? You? Of course not. It will be the same judges who today rule according to their own beliefs, rather than by reference to the written law. A judge may even rule that your law means exactly the opposite of what you had intended. By the time your program has run this gauntlet, it will be far bigger and far more expensive (in money and disrupted lives) than you had imagined. And it will have been twisted to satisfy many factions. In fact, your program may end up being the opposite of what you had intended<strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span></strong><br />

The drawdown of American forces in Iraq is the first step. As U.S. power declines in Iraq, Iranian power increases. Last week, Muqtada al-Sadr returned to Iraq from Iran. Al-Sadr was the leader of a powerful pro-Iranian, anti-American militia in Iraq, and he left Iraq four years ago under heavy pressure from American forces. His decision to return clearly was not his alone. It was an Iranian decision as well, and the timing was perfect. With a nominally independent government now in place in Iraq under the premiership of Nouri al-Maliki, who is by all accounts pro-Iranian, the reinsertion of al-Sadr while the U.S. withdrawal is under way puts pressure on the government from the Iranians at the same time that resistance from the United States, and the confidence of its allies in Iraq, is decreasing. U.S. options The United States now faces a critical choice. If it continues its withdrawal of forces from Iraq, Iraq will be on its way to becoming an Iranian satellite. Certainly, there are anti-Iranian elements even among the Shiites, but the covert capability of Iran and its overt influence, coupled with its military presence on the border, will undermine Iraq’s ability to resist. If Iraq becomes an Iranian ally or satellite, the Iraqi-Saudi and Iraqi-Kuwaiti frontier becomes, effectively, the frontier with Iran. The psychological sense in the region will be that the United States has no appetite for resisting Iran. Having asked the Americans to deal with the Iranians — and having failed to get them to do so, the Saudis will have to reach some accommodation with Iran. In other words, with the most strategically located country in the Middle East — Iraq — Iran now has the ability to become the dominant power in the Middle East and simultaneously reshape the politics of the Arabian Peninsula<strong>.</strong><br />

Critics of U.S. global dominance should pause and consider the alternative. If the United States retreats from its hegemonic role, who would supplant it? Not Europe, not China, not the Muslim world—and certainly not the United Nations. Unfortunately, the alternative to a single superpower is not a multilateral utopia, but the anarchic nightmare of a new Dark Age. We tend to assume that power, like nature, abhors a vacuum. In the history of world politics, it seems, someone is always the hegemon, or bidding to become it. Today, it is the United States; a century ago, it was the United Kingdom. Before that, it was France, Spain, and so on. The famed 19th-century German historian Leopold von Ranke, doyen of the study of statecraft, portrayed modern European history as an incessant struggle for mastery, in which a balance of power was possible only through recurrent conflict. The influence of economics on the study of diplomacy only seems to confirm the notion that history is a competition between rival powers. In his bestselling 1987 work, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000, Yale University historian Paul Kennedy concluded that, like all past empires, the U.S. and Russian superpowers would inevitably succumb to overstretch. But their place would soon be usurped, Kennedy argued, by the rising powers of China and Japan, both still unencumbered by the dead weight of imperial military commitments. In his 2001 book, The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, University of Chicago political scientist John J. Mearsheimer updates Kennedy's account. Having failed to succumb to overstretch, and after surviving the German and Japanese challenges, he argues, the United States must now brace for the ascent of new rivals. “[A] rising China is the most dangerous potential threat to the United States in the early twenty-first century,” contends Mearsheimer. “[T]he United States has a profound interest in seeing Chinese economic growth slow considerably in the years ahead.” China is not the only threat Mearsheimer foresees. The European Union (EU) too has the potential to become “a formidable rival.” Power, in other words, is not a natural monopoly; the struggle for mastery is both perennial and universal. The “unipolarity” identified by some commentators following the Soviet collapse cannot last much longer, for the simple reason that history hates a hyperpower. Sooner or later, challengers will emerge, and back we must go to a multipolar, multipower world. But what if these esteemed theorists are all wrong? What if the world is actually heading for a period when there is no hegemon? What if, instead of a balance of power, there is an absence of power? Such a situation is not unknown in history. Although the chroniclers of the past have long been preoccupied with the achievements of great powers—whether civilizations, empires, or nation-states—they have not wholly overlooked eras when power receded. Unfortunately, the world's experience with power vacuums (eras of “apolarity,” if you will) is hardly encouraging. Anyone who dislikes U.S. hegemony should bear in mind that, rather than a multipolar world of competing great powers, a world with no hegemon at all may be the real alternative to U.S. primacy. Apolarity could turn out to mean an anarchic new Dark Age: an era of waning empires and religious fanaticism; of endemic plunder and pillage in the world's forgotten regions; of economic stagnation and civilization's retreat into a few fortified enclaves. Pretenders to the Throne Why might a power vacuum arise early in the 21st century? The reasons are not especially hard to imagine. The clay feet of the U.S. colossus | Powerful though it may seem—in terms of economic output, military might, and “soft” cultural power—the United States suffers from at least three structural deficits that will limit the effectiveness and duration of its quasi-imperial role in the world. The first factor is the nation's growing dependence on foreign capital to finance excessive private and public consumption. It is difficult to recall any past empire that long endured after becoming so dependent on lending from abroad. The second deficit relates to troop levels: The United States is a net importer of people and cannot, therefore, underpin its hegemonic aspirations with true colonization. At the same time, its relatively small volunteer army is already spread very thin as a result of major and ongoing military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Finally, and most critically, the United States suffers from what is best called an attention deficit. Its republican institutions and political traditions make it difficult to establish a consensus for long-term nation-building projects. With a few exceptions, most U.S. interventions in the past century have been relatively short lived. U.S. troops have stayed in West Germany, Japan, and South Korea for more than 50 years; they did not linger so long in the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, or Vietnam, to say nothing of Lebanon and Somalia. Recent trends in public opinion suggest that the U.S. electorate is even less ready to sacrifice blood and treasure in foreign fields than it was during the Vietnam War. “Old Europe” grows older | Those who dream the EU might become a counterweight to the U.S. hyperpower should continue slumbering. Impressive though the EU's enlargement this year has been—not to mention the achievement of 12-country monetary union—the reality is that demography likely condemns the EU to decline in international influence and importance. With fertility rates dropping and life expectancies rising, West European societies may, within fewer than 50 years, display median ages in the upper 40s. Europe's “dependency ratio” (the number of non-working-age citizens for every working-age citizen) is set to become cripplingly high. Indeed, Old Europe will soon be truly old. By 2050, one in every three Italians, Spaniards, and Greeks is expected to be 65 or older, even allowing for ongoing immigration. Europeans therefore face an agonizing choice between Americanizing their economies, i.e., opening their borders to much more immigration, with the cultural changes that would entail, or transforming their union into a fortified retirement community. Meanwhile, the EU's stalled institutional reforms mean that individual European nation-states will continue exercising considerable autonomy outside the economic sphere, particularly in foreign and security policy. China's coming economic crisis | Optimistic observers of China insist the economic miracle of the past decade will endure, with growth continuing at such a sizzling pace that within 30 or 40 years China's gross domestic product will surpass that of the United States. Yet it is far from clear that the normal rules for emerging markets are suspended for Beijing's benefit. First, a fundamental incompatibility exists between the free-market economy, based inevitably on private property and the rule of law, and the Communist monopoly on power, which breeds corruption and impedes the creation of transparent fiscal, monetary, and regulatory institutions. As is common in “Asian tiger” economies, production is running far ahead of domestic consumption—thus making the economy heavily dependent on exports—and far ahead of domestic financial development. Indeed, no one knows the full extent of the problems in the Chinese domestic banking sector. Those Western banks that are buying up bad debts to establish themselves in China must remember that this strategy was tried once before: a century ago, in the era of the Open Door policy, when U.S. and European firms rushed into China only to see their investments vanish amid the turmoil of war and revolution. Then, as now, hopes for China's development ran euphorically high, especially in the United States. But those hopes were dashed, and could be disappointed again. A Chinese currency or banking crisis could have earth-shaking ramifications, especially when foreign investors realize the difficulty of repatriating assets held in China. Remember, when foreigners invest directly in factories rather than through intermediaries such as bond markets, there is no need for domestic capital controls. After all, how does one repatriate a steel mill? The fragmentation of Islamic civilization | With birthrates in Muslim societies more than double the European average, the Islamic countries of Northern Africa and the Middle East are bound to put pressure on Europe and the United States in the years ahead. If, for example, the population of Yemen will exceed that of Russia by 2050 (as the United Nations forecasts, assuming constant fertility), there must either be dramatic improvements in the Middle East's economic performance or substantial emigration from the Arab world to aging Europe. Yet the subtle Muslim colonization of Europe's cities—most striking in places like Marseille, France, where North Africans populate whole suburbs—may not necessarily portend the advent of a new and menacing “Eurabia.” In fact, the Muslim world is as divided as ever, and not merely along the traditional fissure between Sunnis and Shiites. It is also split between those Muslims seeking a peaceful modus vivendi with the West (an impulse embodied in the Turkish government's desire to join the EU) and those drawn to the revolutionary Islamic Bolshevism of renegades like al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Opinion polls from Morocco to Pakistan suggest high levels of anti-American sentiment, but not unanimity. In Europe, only a minority expresses overt sympathy for terrorist organizations; most young Muslims in England clearly prefer assimilation to jihad. We are a long way from a bipolar clash of civilizations, much less the rise of a new caliphate that might pose a geopolitical threat to the United States and its allies. In short, each of the potential hegemons of the 21st century—the United States, Europe, and China—seems to contain within it the seeds of decline; and Islam remains a diffuse force in world politics, lacking the resources of a superpower. Dark and Disconnected Suppose, in a worst-case scenario, that U.S. neoconservative hubris is humbled in Iraq and that the Bush administration's project to democratize the Middle East at gunpoint ends in ignominious withdrawal, going from empire to decolonization in less than two years. Suppose also that no aspiring rival power shows interest in filling the resulting vacuums—not only in coping with Iraq but conceivably also Afghanistan, the Balkans, and Haiti. What would an apolar future look like? The answer is not easy, as there have been very few periods in world history with no contenders for the role of global, or at least regional, hegemon. The nearest approximation in modern times could be the 1920s, when the United States walked away from President Woodrow Wilson's project of global democracy and collective security centered on the League of Nations. There was certainly a power vacuum in Central and Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Romanov, Habsburg, Hohenzollern, and Ottoman empires, but it did not last long. The old West European empires were quick to snap up the choice leftovers of Ottoman rule in the Middle East. The Bolsheviks had reassembled the czarist empire by 1922. And by 1936, German revanche was already far advanced. One must go back much further in history to find a period of true and enduring apolarity; as far back, in fact, as the ninth and 10th centuries. In this era, the remains of the Roman Empire—Rome and Byzantium—receded from the height of their power. The leadership of the West was divided between the pope, who led Christendom, and the heirs of Charlemagne, who divided up his short-lived empire under the Treaty of Verdun in 843. No credible claimant to the title of emperor emerged until Otto was crowned in 962, and even he was merely a German prince with pretensions (never realized) to rule Italy. Byzantium, meanwhile, was dealing with the Bulgar rebellion to the north. By 900, the Abbasid caliphate initially established by Abu al-Abbas in 750 had passed its peak; it was in steep decline by the middle of the 10th century. In China, too, imperial power was in a dip between the T'ang and Sung dynasties. Both these empires had splendid capitals—Baghdad and Ch'ang-an—but neither had serious aspirations of territorial expansion. The weakness of the old empires allowed new and smaller entities to flourish. When the Khazar tribe converted to Judaism in 740, their khanate occupied a Eurasian power vacuum between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. In Kiev, far from the reach of Byzantium, the regent Olga laid the foundation for the future Russian Empire in 957 when she converted to the Orthodox Church. The Seljuks—forebears of the Ottoman Turks—carved the Sultanate of Rum as the Abbasid caliphate lost its grip over Asia Minor. Africa had its mini-empire in Ghana; Central America had its Mayan civilization. Connections between these entities were minimal or nonexistent. This condition was the antithesis of globalization. It was a world broken up into disconnected, introverted civilizations. One feature of the age was that, in the absence of strong secular polities, religious questions often produced serious convulsions. Indeed, religious institutions often set the political agenda. In the eighth and ninth centuries, Byzantium was racked by controversy over the proper role of icons in worship. By the 11th century, the pope felt confident enough to humble Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV during the battle over which of them should have the right to appoint bishops. The new monastic orders amassed considerable power in Christendom, particularly the Cluniacs, the first order to centralize monastic authority. In the Muslim world, it was the ulema (clerics) who truly ruled. This atmosphere helps explain why the period ended with the extraordinary holy wars known as the Crusades, the first of which was launched by European Christians in 1095. Yet, this apparent clash of civilizations was in many ways just another example of the apolar world's susceptibility to long-distance military raids directed at urban centers by more backward peoples. The Vikings repeatedly attacked West European towns in the ninth century—Nantes in 842, Seville in 844, to name just two. One Frankish chronicler lamented “the endless flood of Vikings” sweeping southward. Byzantium, too, was sacked in 860 by raiders from Rus, the kernel of the future Russia. This “fierce and savage tribe” showed “no mercy,” lamented the Byzantine patriarch. It was like “the roaring sea … destroying everything, sparing nothing.” Such were the conditions of an anarchic age. Small wonder that the future seemed to lie in creating small, defensible, political units: the Venetian republic—the quintessential city-state, which was conducting its own foreign policy by 840—or Alfred the Great's England, arguably the first thing resembling a nation-state in European history, created in 886. Superpower Failure Could an apolar world today produce an era reminiscent of the age of Alfred? It could, though with some important and troubling differences. Certainly, one can imagine the world's established powers—the United States, Europe, and China—retreating into their own regional spheres of influence. But what of the growing pretensions to autonomy of the supranational bodies created under U.S. leadership after the Second World War? The United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization (formerly the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) each considers itself in some way representative of the “international community.” Surely their aspirations to global governance are fundamentally different from the spirit of the Dark Ages? Yet universal claims were also an integral part of the rhetoric of that era. All the empires claimed to rule the world; some, unaware of the existence of other civilizations, maybe even believed that they did. The reality, however, was not a global Christendom, nor an all-embracing Empire of Heaven. The reality was political fragmentation. And that is also true today. The defining characteristic of our age is not a shift of power upward to supranational institutions, but downward. With the end of states' monopoly on the means of violence and the collapse of their control over channels of communication, humanity has entered an era characterized as much by disintegration as integration. If free flows of information and of means of production empower multinational corporations and nongovernmental organizations (as well as evangelistic religious cults of all denominations), the free flow of destructive technology empowers both criminal organizations and terrorist cells. These groups can operate, it seems, wherever they choose, from Hamburg to Gaza. By contrast, the writ of the international community is not global at all. It is, in fact, increasingly confined to a few strategic cities such as Kabul and Pristina. In short, it is the nonstate actors who truly wield global power—including both the monks and the Vikings of our time. So what is left? Waning empires. Religious revivals. Incipient anarchy. A coming retreat into fortified cities. These are the Dark Age experiences that a world without a hyperpower might quickly find itself reliving. The trouble is, of course, that this Dark Age would be an altogether more dangerous one than the Dark Age of the ninth century. For the world is much more populous—roughly 20 times more—so friction between the world's disparate “tribes” is bound to be more frequent. Technology has transformed production; now human societies depend not merely on freshwater and the harvest but also on supplies of fossil fuels that are known to be finite. Technology has upgraded destruction, too, so it is now possible not just to sack a city but to obliterate it. For more than two decades, globalization—the integration of world markets for commodities, labor, and capital—has raised living standards throughout the world, except where countries have shut themselves off from the process through tyranny or civil war. The reversal of globalization—which a new Dark Age would produce—would certainly lead to economic stagnation and even depression. As the United States sought to protect itself after a second September 11 devastates, say, Houston or Chicago, it would inevitably become a less open society, less hospitable for foreigners seeking to work, visit, or do business. Meanwhile, as Europe's Muslim enclaves grew, Islamist extremists' infiltration of the EU would become irreversible, increasing trans-Atlantic tensions over the Middle East to the breaking point. An economic meltdown in China would plunge the Communist system into crisis, unleashing the centrifugal forces that undermined previous Chinese empires. Western investors would lose out and conclude that lower returns at home are preferable to the risks of default abroad. The worst effects of the new Dark Age would be felt on the edges of the waning great powers. The wealthiest ports of the global economy—from New York to Rotterdam to Shanghai—would become the targets of plunderers and pirates. With ease, terrorists could disrupt the freedom of the seas, targeting oil tankers, aircraft carriers, and cruise liners, while Western nations frantically concentrated on making their airports secure. Meanwhile, limited nuclear wars could devastate numerous regions, beginning in the Korean peninsula and Kashmir, perhaps ending catastrophically in the Middle East. In Latin America, wretchedly poor citizens would seek solace in Evangelical Christianity imported by U.S. religious orders. In Africa, the great plagues of AIDS and malaria would continue their deadly work. The few remaining solvent airlines would simply suspend services to many cities in these continents; who would wish to leave their privately guarded safe havens to go there? For all these reasons, the prospect of an apolar world should frighten us today a great deal more than it frightened the heirs of Charlemagne. If the United States retreats from global hegemony—its fragile self-image dented by minor setbacks on the imperial frontier—its critics at home and abroad must not pretend that they are ushering in a new era of multipolar harmony, or even a return to the good old balance of power. Be careful what you wish for. The alternative to unipolarity would not be multipolarity at all. It would be apolarity—a global vacuum of power. And far more dangerous forces than rival great powers would benefit from such a not-so-new world disorder. <br />

<span style="tab-stops: center .75in;"><strong>Worse forms of imperialism dominate absent US intervention—they’re complicit with genocide</strong> </span><br />
<span style="tab-stops: center .75in;"><strong>Shaw 2 –</strong> Sussex IR Professor (Martin, The Problem of the Quasi-Imperial State, www.martinshaw.org/empire.htm) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="tab-stops: center .75in;">It is worth asking how the politics of anti-imperialism distorts Western leftists' responses to global struggles for justice. John Pilger, for example, consistently seeks to minimise the crimes of Milosevic in Kosovo, and to deny their genocidal character - purely because these crimes formed part of the rationale for Western intervention against Serbia. He never attempted to minimise the crimes of the pro-Western Suharto regime in the same way. The crimes of quasi-imperial regimes are similar in cases like Yugoslavia and Indonesia, but the West's attitudes towards them are undeniably uneven and inconsistent. To take as the criterion of one's politics opposition to Western policy, rather than the demands for justice of the victims of oppression as such, distorts our responses to the victims and our commitment to justice. We need to support the victims regardless of whether Western governments take up their cause or not; we need to judge Western power not according to a general assumption of 'new imperialism' but according to its actual role in relation to the victims. The task for civil society in the West is not, therefore to oppose Western state policies as a matter of course, à la Cold War, but to mobilise solidarity with democratic oppositions and repressed peoples, against authoritarian, quasi-imperial states. It is to demand more effective global political, legal and military institutions that genuinely and consistently defend the interests of the most threatened groups. It is to grasp the contradictions among and within Western elites, conditionally allying themselves with internationalising elements in global institutions and Western governments, against nationalist and reactionary elements. The arrival in power of George Bush II makes this discrimination all the more urgent. In the long run, we need to develop a larger politics of global social democracy and an ethic of global responsibility that address the profound economic, political and cultural inequalities between Western and non-Western worlds. We will not move far in these directions, however, unless we grasp the life-and-death struggles between many oppressed peoples and the new local imperialisms, rather than subsuming all regional contradictions into the false synthesis of a new Western imperialism. </span><br />

The security umbrella provided by the U.S. military has enabled the United States to maintain a level of influence with Saudi Arabia, which often exercises predominant influence on the global supply of oil. If the Saudis replace their CSS-2 missile system with a more modern, nuclear missile system, the region could spiral into a new arms race at a time when one of the region’s primary proliferators [Iraq] has been suppressed. A new arms race could potentially destabilize the global supply of oil just as the United States and the global economy are rebounding from the attacks of September 11, 2001. This U.S.-Saudi relationship would face tremendous strain if the Saudis acquired a nuclear capability. In the event of a coup, Saudi nuclear capability could potentially fall into the hands of a new and unstable leadership. In the event of a failed Saudi state following a “coup gone wrong,” the effects would be even more catastrophic for the United States and the Gulf region. The purported nuclear weapons could also fall into the hands of Al-Qaeda members or other radical fundamentalist groups, which could attempt to hold the United States hostage, levy demands, and further hamper U.S. efforts in the war on terrorism. <br />

<br />
How would the Middle East be affected by numerous states armed with nuclear weapons? The good news is that some international security experts argue that the spread of such weapons would actually stabilize the region. In fact, they argue that international relations would be enhanced if nuclear weapons proliferated slowly, if states had time to become accustomed to them, and if nuclear arsenals were immune from preemptive strikes. They argue that nuclear deterrence is easy to under- stand and to put into practice: states- men would realize that the costs of going to war with nuclear weapons would be prohibitive, which would reduce the risk of war between states to nearly zero. To support their argument, these analysts cite the fact that two nuclear-armed states have never waged war against one another.3 The bad news is that these experts probably are dead wrong. The theory is appealing, but theory rarely, if ever, conforms to reality. States armed with nuclear weapons in the Middle East might well wage war against one another under a variety of strategic circumstances. Iran might undertake conventional military operations against neighboring states calculating that its nuclear deterrent would prevent a retaliatory American or Arab Gulf state response. Saudi Arabia, in turn, fearing its conventional forces are inferior, could resort to the tactical use of nuclear weapons to blunt Iranian conventional assaults in the Gulf, much as NATO had planned to do against Warsaw Pact forces in cold-war Europe. Egypt had no nuclear weapons in 1973, but this did not stop it from attack- ing Israeli forces in the Sinai. Along with other Arab states, Egypt could use conventional forces in saber rattling against Israel, and conventional clashes could erupt into a general war. Right now, American forces cannot deter a Syria without nuclear weapons from sponsoring jihadist operations against U.S. forces in Iraq. A Syria armed with a nuclear deterrent might be emboldened to undertake even more aggressive sponsorship of guerrilla war against U.S. and Israeli forces, and this could tip a crisis into open warfare. Sitting on hair triggers in the narrow geographic confines of the Middle East, states armed with nuclear weapons would be under strong incentives to use them or lose them and to fire nuclear ballistic missiles in a crisis. At the height of a regional crisis, Iran, for example, might launch huge salvos of ballistic missiles armed with nuclear weapons against Israel in order to overwhelm Israeli ballistic missile defenses, decapitate the Israeli civilian and military leadership, and reduce the chances of Israeli nuclear retaliation. During the cold war, the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates and the Soviet Union had about 30 minutes of breathing time from the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles to their impact. That was 30 potential minutes of precious time to determine whether warnings of launches were real. In the Middle East, there would be only a handful of such warning minutes, and regimes would feel even more vulnerable than the United States and the Soviet Union did during the cold war. Many nation-states in the Middle East resemble city-states more than industrialized nations; they have much less time to hide their leaders from enemy attack and fewer places to hide them. Nuclear-armed states in the Middle East could also transfer nuclear weapons to terrorist groups. Iran is the top concern on this score. Over the past two decades, Tehran has nurtured Hezbollah with arms, training, logistics, ideological sup- port, and money to enable it to serve as an appendage of Iranian foreign policy. Iranian support helped Hezbollah destroy the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon in the early 1980s and kill about 250 Marines.4 According to a former director of the FBI, senior Iranian government of icials ordered Saudi Hezbollah to bomb Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in 1996.5 The explosion killed 19 U.S. airmen. Iran has used Hezbollah to do its dirty work and maintain “plausible deniability” to reduce the chances of American retaliatory actions. The strategy worked because the United States has yet to retaliate militarily against Iran. Calculating that its nuclear weapons would deter conventional retaliation against it, a nuclear-armed Iran would be emboldened to sponsor even more aggressive and devastating attacks to push American forces out of the Middle East. A Middle East loaded with states armed with nuclear weapons also would increase the odds of “loose nukes.” We worry today—and probably not enough—about Russia losing control of its nuclear weap- ons, but nuclear worries about Russia today might pale in compari-son to those about the Middle East tomorrow. Saudi Arabia already has a slow- boiling insurgency on its hands with Al-Qaeda, which might someday manage to take over a Saudi nuclear weapons depot. The Saudi regime in the future might have to face a civil war with Iranian- or even Iraqi-inspired Shi’ites in eastern Saudi Arabia. The Saudi royal family could even fall victim to internal power struggles between warring Saudi princes, and control of the Saudi nuclear arsenal might determine the winner.6 Militant Islamists inside Egypt’s military ranks assas-sinated President Anwar Sadat. Egyptian Islamic extremists might again organize within Egypt’s mili-tary to take over Egyptian nuclear weapons stocks or to topple the regime itself. The Iranian revolution in 1979 blindsided the United States and converted a security partner into a bitter foe virtually overnight. A similar watershed event could occur in Egypt or Saudi Arabia in the next 25 years. In short, in the Middle East of the future, numer-ous nuclear weapons stores will sit atop potentially explosive political powder kegs like the one that exists in Pakistan today. <br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Bolstering Internal Stability Flowing from the preeminent American interest in preventing an internal crisis that could trigger a civil war in Iraq, by far the most important mission is to support Iraq’s internal stability . The sectarian war in Iraq has ended, and new conflicts (between Arabs and Kurds, various Shi’i groups, or the Sunni and the Shi’ah) have been averted—so far . But because states torn by civil war are prone to relapse, particularly in the absence of external forces, it is critical that this set of missions be the United States’ highest priority . Peacekeeping American troops continue to play a critical role as peacekeepers in Iraq . This is true both generally for the country writ large, and for several important specific cases . Most Iraqis, even those who dislike the American military presence, tend to regard it as a necessary evil . 17 Used correctly, U .S . troops are potentially a crucial substitute for the trust that undergirds stable societies . Trust will also be a critical element in allowing a shift from the Iraqi Army to national and local police responsibility for internal security . But, rebuilding trust in Iraq, as in all societies broken by intercommunal conflict, will take years, and in the meantime, the Iraqis need some powerful external force to reassure them that their rivals (including rivals in the government) will not be able to use force against them . Realistically, that external force can only be American . There are a variety of important, smoldering conflicts that American troops have shown themselves able to police, thereby ensuring that they have not ignited and consumed the entire country . There are still tens of thousands of “Sons of Iraq” (SOIs)— former Sunni insurgents—who switched sides as part of the Sahwa, the “Awakening” movement . The SOIs have become an important bellwether for the Sunni community, demonstrating the willingness of the Shi’i-dominated government to reconcile with Iraq’s tribal Sunnis . American forces continue to serve as liaison, guardians, and even something like parole officers for many of the SOI groups who have not yet been integrated into Iraq’s sputtering economy, who fear the government, and who have at times fallen prey to both terrorist attack and government mistreatment . These groups still trust the American military to defend their interests, and it is unclear what their fears might drive them to do absent the U .S . presence . Similarly, despite American hopes for asymmetric federalism and an “oil-for-soil” compromise between Baghdad and Irbil, it seems unlikely that the Arab-Kurd dispute will be settled anytime soon . The leaders in Irbil and Baghdad all remain deeply suspicious of one another, and over the past two years, at places like Khanaqin and Mosul Dam, small reckless moves have nearly led to wider conflict . Such skirmishes along the so-called “trigger line”—a line of control separating Kurdish Peshmerga forces from federal army forces—could escalate into wider battles, endangering Iraq’s stability and potentially expanding to include Turkey and even Iran . American forces along the trigger line significantly reduce the likelihood both of bad decision-making in Irbil or Baghdad and of the escalation of local security incidents into major conflicts . Former U .S . Forces-Iraq Commander General Ray Odierno established a series of tripartite security checkpoints along the trigger line, combining American, ISF, and Peshmerga forces . He also established procedures and mechanisms for clear communication between the ISF and the Peshmerga, and between Irbil and Baghdad, via American forces that both sides accept as honest brokers . These Combined Security Mechanisms (CSMs) have dramatically reduced the likelihood of incidents along the boundary and have even more dramatically reduced the chances that any incident will escalate . American forces have been improving the ability of both the ISF and the Peshmerga to patrol the disputed areas and they ensure transparency that allows both sides to understand each other’s movements and intentions The presence of American forces in Iraq can also reduce the likelihood of more deliberate aggressive behavior by the Kurdistan Regional Government or Baghdad . Kurdish leaders have repeatedly made clear their desire for real, direct guarantees of their security from the United States, which from their perspective should include weapons sales, training for the Kurdish Peshmerga, formal statements by American officials, and an expanded, long-term American military presence in the KRG . They see such a partnership with the U .S . military as a strong deterrent against Arab adventurism and therefore the foundation of their own long-term well-being and prosperity . Both the Bush and Obama administrations have been wise to refrain from promising the Kurds too much in these areas, both because any such arrangements would have to be agreed to by the national government, and because doing so could also encourage the Kurds to overreach in their negotiations with Baghdad . Consequently, any such arrangements on security for the KRG need to be part of an American package of incentives to the Kurds and should only be provided as part of either an all-encompassing “grand bargain” or a series of interlinked deals between Irbil and Baghdad that resolve all of their key differences . </span></span><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Iraq cannot be allowed to descend into civil war. Iraq is an extremely important nation in one of the most economically vital and geo-strategically sensitive regions of the world . If it were to be consumed by a new civil war, this alone would have important consequences . However, the history of intercommunal wars like that which Iraq began to experience in 2005-2006 demonstrates that there is an inevitable tendency for such conflicts to spill over into neighboring states . At its worst, such spillover can cause civil wars in the neighboring states and/or trigger regional conflicts among the neighbors as they seek to protect their interests, secure resources in the carcass of the state in civil war, and prevent their rivals from doing the same . Consequently, the absolute minimum that the United States must seek to achieve in Iraq is to prevent the outbreak of a new civil war . Unfortunately, this is no easy feat . Although it is clearly the case that the vast majority of the Iraqi people do not want to return to violence, comprehensive scholarship on the causes and drivers of civil war has demonstrated that popular opinion is largely irrelevant . What causes civil wars to occur and recur is the breakdown of the state’s capacity to govern and secure its society, coupled with elites who believe that their goals are best served by resorting to violence . In Iraq today, the state’s capacity to control Iraqi society has greatly improved since the summer of 2003—or even the dark days of 2006—but it remains fragile and uncertain . It is clear that a number of important Iraqi political leaders only agreed to stop using violence in favor of the political process because the events of 2007-2009 demonstrated that continuing to pursue a violent course of action would lead to their defeat at the hands of American military forces and American-backed Iraqi military forces . As in countless other intercommunal civil conflicts, there is every reason to fear that if those leaders feel that their aspirations are not being fulfilled through the political process and changed circumstances make them believe that a return to violence would pay greater dividends, they would take up arms again, regardless of what “the people” wanted . It is in part for this reason that intercommunal civil wars have a dangerous tendency to recur . Extensive academic work on intercommunal civil wars akin to what Iraq experienced in 20052006 demonstrates that roughly half of the time a country falls back into civil war within five years of a ceasefire . Moreover, when the country in question possesses valuable natural resources, like diamonds, gold, or oil, the likelihood rises even higher . 2 Thus, Iraq is highly vulnerable to a resurgence of civil war, and the forces that could drag it back into conflict are omnipresent, floating just below the surface of Iraqi politics . Specifically, the militias and insurgents are down, but not out; fear and anger remains pervasive; and it is impossible to know how many Iraqi leaders still believe that they would be better off with a return to violence than a continuation of peace—or the conditions under which they might take up arms again . If Iraq slips into all-out civil war, it will be disastrous for the security of the Gulf . As history has demonstrated, major intercommunal civil wars inevitably generate large-scale refugee flows, secessionist movements, terrorism, economic disruption, the radicalization of neighboring populations, and foreign military interventions throughout the wider region . Indeed, Iraq in 2005-2007 was generating every single one of these manifestations of spillover among its neighbors, and examples of worse abound from Congo to Lebanon to Yugoslavia to Somalia to Afghanistan . In many cases, the spillover from a major intercommunal civil war in one country can cause civil war in another country, and/ or spark a regional war over the carcass of that state . 3 All of this would be devastating to the Persian Gulf region and America’s vital interests . As disconcerting as the history of recurrent civil wars and their impact on their neighbors may be, there is an important silver lining . What the academic literature also demonstrates is that when a major, external great power is willing to serve as peacekeeper and mediator in an intercommunal civil war, the likelihood of a recurrence falls considerably . 4 This, of course, is the crucial role played by the United States in Iraq today . The key is that the United States needs to be able to continue to play that role for some time to come—until Iraq is fully able to handle its own security and diplomacy—while preserving the space for its economy and politics to continue to develop. </span></span><br />

Israel is especially dangerous because its leaders and supporters have made clear for years that if Israel was ever<span style="font-size: 4pt;">y</span> devastated by any kind of war or attack it would retaliate <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">in indiscriminate “Samson Option” attacks against n</span></span>ot just on Muslim cities, but against European and even Russian targets. (See “Israeli Nuclear Threats and Blackmail ” .) Russia, of course, would retaliate with thousands of nuclear bombs against the United States. Given suspected U.S. nuclear primacy plans, Russia could feel compelled to attack the United States for acts like a U.S. nuclear attack on Iran, which is just a few hundred miles from its border. On January 25, 1995 Boris Yeltsin, then President of Russia, came within three minutes of initiating a full nuclear strike on the United States because of one Norwegian scientific rocket Russians could not identify. (Details ) And U.S. leaders also could be spooked by a nuclear incident, as the 2002 movie “Sum of All Fears” illustrates. Once there is any use of nuclear weapons, it will be like giving permission for anyone to use them. Compare it to a room full of people embarrassed to cough, but once one does, everyone else feels free to do so. Any use of nuclear weapons probably will lead to a rapid escalation, “out of control spiral,” to nuclear war among most or all nuclear nations–”world nuclear war.” The U.N. cannot stop it. U.S. imperialism and pre-emptive strikes cannot stop it. Only a worldwide disarmament movement can stop it. <br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Most significantly, Afghanistan has substantial deposits of rare earth minerals, estimated to be worth $7.4 billion. And why is this so important? At present, China has a near monopoly over them. It possesses about 36% of world reserves, by far the biggest share for any nation, and accounts for around 97% of global production. Five years ago Beijing substantially tightened export controls on these minerals. At this moment, officials are building a strategic reserve of them. Last August China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced it would prohibit exports of some heavy rare earth minerals and restrict exports of other rare earths to levels far below current global needs. The complete prohibition may go into effect by 2015. Beijing, unfortunately, is not content to control just its own rare earth resources. The Chinese are buying deposits around the world, including those in the U.S. and Canada. And that brings us back to Afghanistan. Beijing, not surprisingly, has already shown great interest in the resources of its troubled neighbor to the west. In 2007 a Chinese company won the concession to the Aynak copper mine in Afghanistan's Logar province--after paying, according to American officials, a bribe of $30 million to the now-former minister of mines. As the New York Times reports, the Chinese want to buy up even more of Afghanistan's resources. They will surely succeed in exploiting most of the trillion dollars of minerals if the Taliban fighters take back control of the country, as they will if President Obama adheres to his plan to begin withdrawing troops next July. The Taliban, in short, could become a minerals superpower in a few years time. That will surely mean an even larger portion of the world's rare earth deposits will be under Chinese control. Beijing has traditionally maintained strong ties to the Taliban, continuing relations even after Sept. 11. Since that horrible event, for instance, China went through with the sale of a telephone system for Kabul and, after the group's ouster, has supplied it with weapons used against NATO forces. The Pentagon, in September, is scheduled to complete its report identifying “national security risks due to rare earth material dependencies.” Yet we don't have to wait until then to know what it will say. The U.S. is not mining any rare earth minerals at the moment, and there is only one American company with commercially significant deposits of heavy rare earths. It is not entirely clear what defense planners will do when China's export ban on these minerals goes into effect. Rare earth minerals are used in every major weapons system the U.S. fields today, from M1A2 Abrams tanks to Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. There is not a plane in the American inventory that will fly tomorrow without some mineral that is now mined in China. Lasers, radar and missile-guidance systems? Yes, they all require rare earth minerals, as do the military's hard drives. So the stakes just went up in Afghanistan with the release of the information this week. The U.S. has a critical reliance on what is in the ground in that war-torn land. <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Kabul can undercut Beijing's virtual monopoly on rare earths--or it can help the Chinese tighten their grip over global markets.</span> </span></span><br />

In Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Alexander Portnov, a professor specializing in geological and mineral sciences, wrote, “There can be no talk of developing nanotechnology if the country does n<span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">o</span>t produce and use rare elements.” Portnov argues that a country’s extraction, production, and use of rare metals needed for technological innovation are “a precise indicator of its scientific and technical development.”32 It is possible that suitable alternatives to REEs could one day be discovered. In the meantime, however, REEs are critical to many modern technologies. China has recognized the value of REEs for over five decades. While the United States today leads in technological innovation, China’s position in the rare earth industry and its vast reserves and ability to mine and produce them, coupled with its intense research and development efforts, could one day give it a decisive advantage in military-based technologies. The U.S. military must plan for this eventuality and take appropriate actions today if it expects to maintain its lead in military technology. JFQ <br />

This exponential progress in the power of information technology goes back more than a century to the data-processing equipment used in the 1890 census, the first U.S. census to be automated. It has been a smooth -- and highly predictable -- phenomenon despite all the vagaries of history through that period, including two world wars, the Cold War and the Great Depression. I say highly predictable because, thanks to its exponential power, only technology possesses the scale to address the major challenges -- such as energy and the environment, disease and poverty -- confronting society. That, at least, is the major conclusion of a panel, organized by the National Science <br />
Foundation and the National Academy of Engineering, on which I recently participated. Take energy. Today, 70 percent of it comes from fossil fuels, a 19th-century technology. But if we could capture just one ten-thousandth of the sunlight that falls on Earth, we could meet 100 percent of the world's energy needs using this renewable and environmentally friendly source. We can't do that now because solar panels rely on old technology, making them expensive, inefficient, heavy and hard to install. But a new generation of panels based on nanotechnology (which manipulates matter at the level of molecules) is starting to overcome these obstacles. The tipping point at which energy from solar panels will actually be less expensive than fossil fuels is only a few years away. The power we are generating from solar is doubling every two years; at that rate, it will be able to meet all our energy needs within 20 years. Nanotechnology itself is an information technology and therefore subject to what I call the &quot;law of accelerating returns,&quot; a continual doubling of capability about every year. Venture capital groups and high-tech companies are investing billions of dollars in these new renewable energy technologies. I'm confident that the day is close at hand when we will be able to obtain energy from sunlight using nano-engineered solar panels and store it for use on cloudy days in nano-engineered fuel cells for less than it costs to use environmentally damaging fossil fuels. It's important to understand that exponentials seem slow at first. In the mid-1990s, halfway through the Human Genome Project to identify all the genes in human DNA, researchers had succeeded in collecting only 1 percent of the human genome. But the amount of genetic data was doubling every year, and that is actually right on schedule for an exponential progression. The project was slated to take 15 years, and if you double 1 percent seven more times you surpass 100 percent. In fact, the project was finished two years early. This helps explain why people underestimate what is technologically feasible over long periods of time -- they think linearly while the actual course of progress is exponential. We see the same progression with other biological technologies as well. Until just recently, medicine -- like energy -- was not an information technology. This is now changing as scientists begin to understand how biology works as a set of information processes. The approximately 23,000 genes in our cells are basically software programs, and we are making exponential gains in modeling and simulating the information processes that cracking the genome code has unlocked. We also have new tools, likewise just a few years old, that allow us to actually reprogram our biology in the same way that we reprogram our computers. For example, when the fat insulin receptor gene was turned off in mice, they were able to eat ravenously yet remain slim and obtain the health benefits of being slim. They didn't get heart disease or diabetes and lived 20 percent longer. There are now more than a thousand drugs in the pipeline to turn off the genes that promote obesity, heart disease, cancer and other diseases. We can also turn enzymes off and on, and add genes to the body. I'm an adviser to a company that removes lung cells, adds a new gene, reproduces the gene-enhanced cell a million-fold and then injects it back into the body where it returns to the lungs. This has cured a fatal disease, pulmonary hypertension, in animals and is now undergoing human trials. The important point is this: Now that we can model, simulate and reprogram biology just like we can a computer, it will be subject to the law of accelerating returns, a doubling of capability in less than a year. These technologies will be more than a thousand times more capable in a decade, more than a million times more capable in two decades. We are now adding three months every year to human life expectancy, but given the exponential growth of our ability to reprogram biology, this will soon go into high gear. According to my models, 15 years from now we'll be adding more than a year each year to our remaining life expectancy. This is not a guarantee of living forever, but it does mean that the sands of time will start pouring in rather than only pouring out. What's more, this exponential progression of information technology will affect our prosperity as well. The World Bank has reported, for example, that poverty in Asia has been cut in half over the past decade due to information technologies and that at current rates it will be cut by another 90 percent over the next decade. That phenomenon will spread around the globe. <br />

<strong>Withdrawing TNWs will crush U.S.-Turkey relations</strong><br />
<strong>Kibaroglu, 05</strong> – Assistant professor in the department of international relations at Bilkent University (Dec 05, Mustafa, European Security, “Isn’t it Time to Say Farewell to Nukes in Turkey?” Vol. 14, No. 4, 443-457, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4882:http://mustafakibaroglu.com/db1/00032/mustafakibaroglu.com/_download/Kibaroglu-EuropeanSecurity-USnukesTurkey-December2005.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://mustafakibaroglu.com/db1/00032/mustafakibaroglu.com/_download/Kibaroglu-EuropeanSecurity-USnukesTurkey-December2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://mustafakibaroglu.com/db1/00032/mustafakibaroglu.com/_download/Kibaroglu-EuropeanSecurity-USnukesTurkey-December2005.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4882 -->) <br />
<br />
‘Nukes Should Stay’ <br />
Turkish officials consider nuclear weapons more as political weapons than as having a significant military value; they do not seriously think of contingencies where nuclear weapons could or even should be used. Having said that, they do believe in the deterrent value of US nuclear weapons stationed in Turkey. It is true that the Middle East and adjacent regions are far from being peaceful or stable; this situation is unlikely to change soon. Adding to the unrest arising from the political situation in Iraq, and the Palestine-Israel conflict, is Iran’s substantial nuclear development program that may have weapons development potential. Uncertainty about Iran’s capabilities as well as its intentions further complicate threat assessments by Turkish officials. Hence, retaining US nukes in Turkey ‘to be on the safe side’ sounds like a better option to them. <br />
However, the fundamental reason why Turkish officials want to keep the weapons has more to do with the nature and the scope of Turkish-American relations in particular, and Turkey’s place in the Western alliance in general. First and foremost, the deployment of the remaining tactical nuclear weapons in Turkey is believed to strengthen the bonds between the US and Turkey<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">;</span> these bonds were severely strained during and after the crisis in Iraq in late 2002 and neither party got what it wanted.24 Withdrawing the US nuclear weapons from Turkey during such a delicate period could weaken the bonds in the longstanding strategic alliance (or the ‘partnership’ as many Turkish and American analysts would prefer to term it). <br />

<br />
Turkish-American cooperation in the broader Eurasian region (I) <br />
Eurasia is now the premier competition ground for all major international actors vying for power, influence and resources. The importance and the meaning of the magnitudes of broader Eurasia, which for the purpose of this article refers to Asia, Europe plus the Middle East put together, need no elaboration. Most of the world’s population, wealth and energy resources are there. <br />
Russia and China are contenders for super-power status. In addition to France, Germany and the United Kingdom, other states such as India, Iran, Pakistan and Turkey have joined the competition for spheres of influence. Issues of security, economy and energy beset the region. There are ongoing conflicts, so-called frozen conflicts and potential conflicts. Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote in 1997, &quot;Eurasia is the world's axial super continent. A power that dominated Eurasia would exercise decisive influence over two of the world's three most economically productive regions, Western Europe and East Asia.&quot; Clearly, the stakes are high, making future balances and power relationships in the region of critical importance for the overall stability and prosperity of the entire globe. <br />
It is therefore important to explore the subject of whether and how Turkey and the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates can join their assets toward common ends in this vast region. This would also enable us to understand the meaning of U.S. President Barrack Obama’s concept of the &quot;model partnership&quot; he used in describing his country’s relationship with Turkey. <br />
Let us first establish why Turkey and the U.S. are suitable partners. Their suitability, I propose, emanates from the foundational pillars of their relationship. One pillar is their bond of shared values and principles of society: namely democracy, the rule of law, human rights, gender equality and separation of religion and state. Turkey is still unique in espousing and nurturing these standards in its region and among Muslim countries. Undoubtedly, neither Turkey nor the U.S. has perfect scores in any of these domains, but they both commit to these ideals as the norms they want to attain. The similarity of their aspirations provides a functional capacity for them to join their resources for common ends. This allows them to similarly perceive, analyze and approach the challenges they face. <br />
Another pillar of Turkish-American relations is somewhat uneven, but still stable and established. This is the general convergence of their interests, concerns and priorities. Their agendas invariably comprise mostly the same items, whether it is terrorism or energy, Iraq, Iran or Afghanistan, the Middle East, the Caucasus or the Balkans or the future of NATO, just to mention a few. This is not to say that they see eye to eye on any given issue, but their margin of agreement is mostly large enough for them to act together on most matters. They are allies in NATO and have a tested friendship. <br />
In the past, these foundations have enabled Turkey and the U.S. to join hands. Their soldiers fought together in Korea in the early 1950s. They have contributed to stability and security operations over a vast geography extending from the Balkans to Indonesia, from Georgia to Somalia. Most recently, the joint declaration issued at the end of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s March visit to Turkey reaffirmed these strong bonds of alliance, solidarity and strategic partnership and their commitment to the principles of peace, democracy, freedom, and prosperity. The timing and substance of President Obama’s April visit to Turkey confirmed there are meeting points of values, interests and goals between the two nations. His &quot;model partnership&quot; reference emphasized the relationship’s distinctive character and potential. <br />
As we test the validity of our proposition, I suggest that there are at least five broad areas for Turkish-American cooperation in the broader Eurasia region. These are: a) regional and transnational issues, b) security, c) sociopolitical issues, d) economy and e) energy. <br />
Regional and transnational issues <br />
The Euro-Atlantic community is still the leading entity that has the power and influence to shape the evolution of the broader Eurasian region. This is why it is critically important to strengthen the cohesion of the community and its institutions, and bolster its claim for moral and ethical leadership. As its two outermost poles, Turkey and the U.S. have a special responsibility, and the strategic depth, to help NATO pursue its transformation into the premier security provider of the 21st century. The two must also help the European Union evolve from its current standing as a Judeo-Christian club into a genuine union of civilizations. The first step required is to make Turkey an EU member. A related objective is the strengthening linkages of the rest of Eurasia with Euro-Atlantic institutions. <br />
The Balkans is still unstable and prone to renewed violence. Kosovo, Bosnia and Macedonia are in need of continuing assistance and attention from the Euro-Atlantic community. Turkey has been a significant contributor to the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">N</span>ations, NATO and EU operations in the region. Turkey and the U.S. can help by maintaining their cooperation there. <br />
Regarding Russia, Turkish-American collaboration can focus on the limitation and control of weapons of mass destruction as well as of conventional forces, given that their policies on the matter coincide. Turkey is also poised to become a stable, secure and viable hub for oil and natural gas transmission and distribution from Central Asia, the Caspian region and the Middle East to the rest of the world. A U.S. lead in this respect would help reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas and enforce the independence of the former Soviet satellites. <br />
In the Caucasus, helping Georgia stabilize and restore its territorial integrity and the resolution of the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia are issues on which Turkey and the U.S. have long collaborated. There is need for a better coordination and focusing of their ongoing efforts, whether bilaterally or in multilateral forums, to achieve the resolution of these thorny problems. <br />
Afghanistan and Pakistan, however, have become the new fulcrum of international concern. President Obama has made these issues top priority. Turkey enjoys close relations with both and is highly active on the front. Turkey is organizing a new summit in November with the leaders of the two countries. Turkey and the U.S. already collaborate extensively in this regard and should continue to do so in the near future. <br />

<strong>Conflict in the Balkans will escalate to a nuclear World War III</strong><br />
<strong>Chicago Daily Herald, 99</strong> (5/9/1999, Lexis) <br />
<br />
We need to stop the war and return to the negotiating table to end the suffering in Kosovo before the &quot;dogs of war&quot; are unleashed and there is no controlling the catastrophic - we're near that point. Most of us realize that in war the unexpected is often the rule, often resulting in chaos. There must be an end to military operations and the ethnic cleansing against Kosovo civilians. Something has gone wrong; the very people we were supposed to be saving are suffering thousands of dead and millions homeless. Dialogue must be aimed at reaching a peaceful settlement that respects the wishes of the inhabitants of Kosovo, while respecting history, international law and minority rights. It seems to me the Clinton administration embarked on a military adventure that has not been thought through. The administration has been dealing with Milosevic for six years. We hear the grim rationale for sending in ground troops &quot;to salvage the credibility of the NATO Alliance.&quot; I don't want any American servicemen/women to die for the idea that once you have embarked on a disastrous course of action, you can only continue on ... that's nonsense. On a recent news program the Italian and German foreign ministers stated troop deployment is not acceptable as part of their national defense - the French representative waffled. Both France and Germany have large Muslim populations. The German official said the NATO Alliance weapons, planes, missiles are primarily American with minimum involvement of NATO allies. Let's not forget that Russia has warned NATO countries that this action could culminate in a third world war. The war in the Balkans could easily become the flash point of world conflict resulting in nuclear war and incalculable self-destruction.<br />

<strong>US extended deterrent to South Korea strong now – key to credible assurance</strong><br />
<strong>Kim, 10</strong> – Fellow @ CSIS (7-2-10, Seung Taek, Colonel, Rethinking Extended Deterrence, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4884:http://csis.org/publication/rethinking-extended-deterrence --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://csis.org/publication/rethinking-extended-deterrence" rel="nofollow">http://csis.org/publication/rethinking-extended-deterrence</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4884 -->) <br />
<br />
<span style="margin-right: .2in;">The Republic of Korea (ROK) and the United States are allies that signed the Mutual Defense Treaty. The primary mission of the Mutual Defense Treaty is to prevent war and maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. The experience from the past sixty years shows that this security alliance has successfully served its purpose. For the U.S., it has effectively dissuaded and deterred North Korea from taking overt military actions on the Korean Peninsula by providing the ROK with “extended deterrence, including the nuclear umbrella” and displaying its overwhelming military force and political will to defend its ally from the North’s aggression. The ROK, confident in U.S. extended deterrence and security commitment to its defense, has also been assured of its security and has believed that the deterrence would hold effective. Such belief has been affirmed as the relative peace and status quo on the Korean Peninsula has lasted over the past sixty years<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span> </span><br />

<strong>Withdrawal will crush U.S.-South Korean relations</strong><br />
<strong>Dujarric, 04</strong> – Visiting Scholar at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (7/12/04, International Herald Tribune, “Japan's Security Needs U.S. Troops in S. Korea,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rieti.go.jp/en/papers/contribution/dujarric/02.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rieti.go.jp/en/papers/contribution/dujarric/02.html</a>, JMP)<br />
<br />
<br />
Though it is possible that these moves will be reversed, as things change right now the United States is poised to permanently downgrade its presence on the Korean Peninsula. <br />
If these changes do take place, they will have a dramatic impact on Japan. <br />
The Seoul-Washington military relationship is a critical element of the ties that bind South Korea to the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates. A decline in the U.S. presence on the peninsula will weaken the alliance between Seoul and Washington. The militaries of the two countries will stop enjoying the close relationship that a large U.S. presence creates and South Koreans will doubt the credibility of the American commitment. <br />
The U.S. ability to influence South Korea will decline while the South Korean capacity to make itself heard in Washington will also diminish. American deterrence will also decline. <br />
A North Korean attack is unlikely but one must be ready for low-probability events. North Korea will interpret the U.S. move as a sign that the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates does not care about North Korea. Moreover, as events in Iraq have demonstrated, heavy ground forces are still very relevant to fighting a war. A USFK shorn of most of its army forces will be less potent. <br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Turns the case – key to solve North Korean aggression and regional stability </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Levin, 4</span> – Senior Analyst at the RAND Corporation, (Norman D, “Do the Ties Still Bind?: The US-ROK Security Relationship After 9/11,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2004/RAND_MG115.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2004/RAND_MG115.pdf</a>) </span><br />
<br />
In short, security cooperation with the ROK advances a wide range of U.S. defense policy goals and strategic objectives. It is critical to rolling back North Korea’s WMD activities. It is essential for dealing with the twin dangers of North Korean aggression and violent collapse. And it not only deters North Korean attacks and reassures key U.S. allies but also inhibits arms races that could undermine regional stability. In addition, the military-to-military relationship ensures U.S. access and provides a basis for expanding both intelligence cooperation and military interoperability. It also links South Korea’s own military transformation to that of the U.S., while creating the potential over time for reallocating more tailored U.S. forces to other missions. <br />
U.S.-ROK security cooperation advances many broader goals of current U.S. strategy as well. It aids in projecting U.S. power by ensuring access to and through Korea, while reducing pressures on U.S. bases and facilities elsewhere in the region. It also increases options for countering coercive threats and favorably prosecuting war on U.S. terms by reinforcing South Korean confidence and resolve, enhancing ROK capabilities and responsibilities in its own defense, and facilitating expanded South Korean roles in regional and global security. If or as inter-Korean reconciliation takes place, U.S.-ROK security cooperation will support the spread of democratic institutions and freemarket economies to North Korea and beyond. It also will help reduce potential suspicions between Korea and its neighbors, while ensconcing the U.S. at the core of a critical region. <br />

<strong>U.S.</strong> ground forces <strong>key to maintain a</strong> credible <strong>nuclear guarantee for Seoul</strong><br />
<strong>Payne, et. al, 10</strong> – Professor in Defense and Strategic Studies at Missouri State University (March 2010, Dr. Keith Payne, Study Director Thomas Scheber Kurt Guthe, “U.S. Extended Deterrence and Assurance for Allies in Northeast Asia,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nipp.org/National%20Institute%20Press/Current%20Publications/PDF/US%20Extend-Deter-for%20print.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nipp.org/National%20Institute%20Press/Current%20Publications/PDF/US%20Extend-Deter-for%20print.pdf</a>, JMP) <br />
<br />
Forward deployment of forces, then, is one of the principal ways in which the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates assures the South Koreans of its commitment to their defense. Forward-deployed forces are the embodiment of that commitment and the mechanism by which the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates would become engaged in any new Korean war. In certain circumstances, the direct engagement of American conventional forces in such a conflict could increase the prospect of U.S. nuclear use. This connection reinforces the nuclear guarantee to Seoul. For these purposes, the presence of some not-insignificant U.S. ground force in South Korea is more important than the specific number of troops or their disposition. While U.S. nuclear weapons in the past were forward deployed in South Korea, a nuclear presence on the peninsula has not been essential to the nuclear guarantee. <br />

<strong>Causes nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Cirincione, 2000</strong> – Director of Non-prolif @ Carnegie (Joseph, Director of the Non-Proliferation Project – Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Foreign Policy, “The Asian nuclear reaction chain”, Issue 118, Spring, Proquest) <br />
<br />
The blocks would fall quickest and hardest in Asia, where proliferation pressures are already building more quickly than anywhere else in the world. If a nuclear breakout takes place in Asia, then the international arms control agreements that have been painstakingly negotiated over the past 40 years will crumble. Moreover, the United States could find itself embroiled in its fourth war on the Asian continent in six decades--a costly rebuke to those who seek the safety of Fortress America by hiding behind national missile defenses. Consider what is already happening: North Korea continues to play guessing games with its nuclear and missile programs; South Korea wants its own missiles to match Pyongyang's; India and Pakistan shoot across borders while running a slow-motion nuclear arms race; China modernizes its nuclear arsenal amid tensions with Taiwan and the United States; Japan's vice defense minister is forced to resign after extolling the benefits of nuclear weapons; and Russia-whose Far East nuclear deployments alone make it the largest Asian nuclear power-struggles to maintain territorial coherence. Five of these states have nuclear weapons; the others are capable of constructing them. Like neutrons firing from a split atom, one nation's actions can trigger reactions throughout the region, which in turn, stimulate additional actions. These nations form an interlocking Asian nuclear reaction chain that vibrates dangerously with each new development. If the frequency and intensity of this reaction cycle increase, critical decisions taken by any one of these governments could cascade into the second great wave of nuclear-weapon proliferation, bringing regional and global economic and political instability and, perhaps, the first combat use of a nuclear weapon since 1945<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span><br />

At this stage, it would be difficult to persuade the United States to alter its ballistic missile defense plans, as the GMD system is already being deployed. The United States would, no doubt, refuse such a broad ban. In fact, it is unrealistic to expect that the United States will accept any negotiations on space weapons in the near future. The United States is unlikely to return to anything like the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty – instead, it will seek to retain the right to build and operate at least a ground-based missile defense system. If China wants to move beyond mere complaints towards an actual agreement, then it will have to consider proposals that might conceivably be acceptable to the United States. To overcome the deadlock at CD and to reduce the concerns of both the United States and China, a minimum-scope space weapons ban (the “focused approach”) with some bilateral confidence-building measures could be a practical first step. This approach could include the following two core elements: Banning the testing and deployment of any weapons in outer space, including space-based kinetic energy weapons, space-based directed energy weapons, and any other space-based weapons for attacking space-, ground-, sea-, or air-based targets. This would rule out space-based missile defense and ASAT systems. Banning the testing and deployment of any “dedicated” ASAT weapons. This would include any strike system – whether ground-based, sea-based, air-based or space-based – against orbiting satellites. Subsequently, what is the likelihood of both the United States and China considering a “focused approach” to space weapons? The U.S. Side The United States would likely find a focused approach more acceptable than a broad approach. While it bans space-based weapons and ASATs, the former would allow deployment of the GMD system that composes the central part of the Missile Defense Agency’s current budget and development efforts. In practice, as a number of studies show, there is no rationale for the U.S. to deploy space weapons and ASATs.28 For example, an enormously expensive space-based interceptor system for missile defense would be intrinsically vulnerable to a number of cost-effective ASAT attacks and be overwhelmed by the simultaneous launch of several missiles from a compact area.29 Moreover, the negative impacts of using space weapons for other military missions – protecting satellites, denying the hostile use of space to adversaries and projecting force – would far outweigh the benefits, since the utility of space weapons is limited by three main factors: high cost, considerable susceptibility to countermeasures, and the availability of cheaper, more effective alternatives.30 Furthermore, a space-based BMD system would inevitably encourage other countries to pursue ASATs as countermeasures. Thus, a space weapon ban would reduce the proliferation of ASATs. It would reduce the risk of a “space Pearl Harbor” for other military and civilian satellites. As many experts in the U.S. point out, given the heavy dependence of the United States on its space assets, “the United States has more to lose than to gain by opening the way to the testing and deployment of ASATs and space weapons.”31 The United States is now more dependent on satellites to perform important military functions than any other state. By placing weapons in space, the United States could stimulate others to balance symmetrically and asymmetrically against U.S. space assets. It would be very difficult for the United States to maintain unchallenged hegemony once space is weaponized. The current U.S. military advantage in space instead would be lost, or at a minimum degraded, by weaponization. Further, space weaponization would threaten U.S. civilian and commercial assets by making them far more vulnerable than they are today. The U.S. economy and society are highly dependent on the applications of commercial satellites. In short, as Richard Garwin and his co-authors point out: “A regime that effectively prohibits the deployment of space weapons and the use of destructive ASATs before they can destroy U.S. or other satellites would be a smart, hardnosed investment in U.S. national security, but would require U.S. leadership.”32 It is clear that the United States still has time for serious re-consideration of its space activities. While current funding requests from the Bush administration show continued interest in space-based weapons systems, the actual level of funding is small and these weapons remain in the conceptual and research stages. At the current speed of development, for example, the planned space-based BMD system would not reach fruition until around 2020. China’s Point Of View From the Chinese perspective, a non-space-based BMD system would be less threatening to national security than a space-based one. Countermeasures for mid-course missile defense systems would be less expensive and easier for China to develop. These include decoys, anti-simulation measures33 and an increase in warheads capable of penetrating such a defense system. However, as many scientists point out, a robust, global-coverage BMD system would have to include boost-phase missile defense.34 From the Chinese perspective, a U.S. space-based, boost-phase missile defense system would pose the greatest threat of all. This is due to the fact that at boost phase, the missile defense system would have fewer targets; the target ICBM would be much larger than the normal re-entry vehicle; the target would be much more fragile than a re-entry vehicle; and the target would be easily detectable due to the bright plumes of the burning booster. A non-space-based, boost-phase missile defense system would not be able to cover China’s ICBMs. In fact, an ICBM at an altitude of 200km can be detected within a range of 1,600km by a sensor on the ground, and within 2,000km by a sensor at an altitude of 15km. Because of China’s vast area, the United States would have to destroy a Chinese missile in boost-phase from space.35 As such, even a limited ban on space weapons would significantly reduce the threat for China from U.S. missile defense systems, assuming that Chinese military planners have confidence in countermeasures for midcourse missile defense systems. Other bilateral confidence-building measures between the United States and China would facilitate China’s consideration of a “focused approach” to space weapons negotiations. These measures might include: (1) A U.S. acknowledgment of the seriousness of China’s concerns, including an assurance that a U.S. missile defense system will not target China; (2) A U.S. pledge to adopt a bilateral no-first-use policy toward China, following the example of similar Chinese and Russian policies; such a policy would ease China’s major concern about the possibility of a U.S. preemptive strike; (3) The clear exclusion of Taiwan in the U.S.-Japan joint theater missile defense plan, and a U.S. move to block the sale of such systems to Taiwan; (4) A limitation on the scale and scope of the envisioned U.S. non-space-based BMD architecture, including placing a limit on the number of missile defense interceptors and restricting the scope of the overall system to the minimum required for dealing with rogue threats. This latter measure would ensure that China’s current stock of fissile materials would be sufficient to fill the number of new warheads needed to balance U.S. missile defense interceptors. In the absence of any limitations on U.S. missile defense systems, China harbors concerns about whether its current fissile material stocks are extensive enough to supply the warheads needed to counter the U.S. threat to its nuclear deterrent. This directly affects China’s willingness to participate in the Fissile Material Cut- Off Treaty. Restrictions on the U.S. BMD system would also ensure that China builds its nuclear arsenal in a predictable way – until it has the capacity to balance the U.S. defensive capabilities – which the United States would acknowledge and understand.<br />

<strong>China believes the counterplan is the best way to prevent space mil and miscalc</strong><br />
<strong>Zhang ‘6</strong> (Hui Zhang, Research Associate at the Project on Managing the Atom in the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, Project on Managing the Atom, &quot;Space Weaponization and Space Security: A Chinese Perspective&quot;, China Security, Vol 2, Issue 1)<br />
China’s position In China’s view, the most effective way to secure space assets would be to agree on a space weaponization ban. Ambassador Hu stated, “If any country is really worried about possible menace to its space interests, this could certainly be alleviated through the negotiation and conclusion of a treaty on the prevention of space weaponization, as suggested by China… Such a legally binding international treaty will be the best tool to safeguard the interests of all sides.”23 China’s stance on banning weapons in outer space has been consistent since 1985, when it first introduced a working paper to the U.N. Conference on Disarmament (CD). China’s most recent working paper on the issue, introduced in June 2002, emphasizes three basic obligations: (1) Not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying any kind of weapons, not to install such weapons on celestial bodies, and not to station such weapons in outer space in any other manner; (2) Not to resort to the threat or use of force against outer space objects; and (3) Not to assist or encourage other States, groups of States, international organizations to participate in activities prohibited by this Treaty.24 In recent years, the U.N. General Assembly has adopted resolutions calling for the CD to begin negotiations on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) with an overwhelming majority of support. However, John Bolton, then U.S. undersecretary of state for arms control and non-proliferation, told the CD: “the current international regime regulating the use of space meets all our purposes. We see no need for new agreements.”25 Many Chinese leaders believe Bolton is wrong. There are no existing treaties that effectively prevent the testing, deployment and use of weapons, other than those of mass destruction, in outer space. In addition, none of these instruments covers the threat or use of force from Earth (land, sea and air) against objects in outer space. The history of proliferation has taught us that banning the testing and deployment of weapons from the outset is much more effective than attempting disarmament and nonproliferation after the fact.

 <strong>U.S. commitment to region increasing</strong><br />

When I last stood before you, I did so only a few months after a new administration had taken office. President Obama’s policies toward this region were still evolving, but I noted that he had a very personal connection to this part of the world, and that, regardless of new initiatives, or different areas of emphasis under his administration, the underlying themes of continuity and engagement in Asia would hold true. The United States has responsibilities to friends and allies, and will not waver in its longstanding commitments here. Indeed, we will continue to deepen and expand our alliances and partnerships. In the next few minutes, I would like to provide an overview of how the United States sees its responsibilities in the Asia-Pacific region within the context of broader U.S. defense priorities and events over the past year. As a starting point, it is important to remember that the success this region has enjoyed over the past several decades – its unprecedented economic growth and political development – was not a foregone conclusion. Rather, it was enabled by clear choices about the enduring principles that we all believe are essential to peace, prosperity, and stability. These include our commitment to: * Free and open commerce; * A just international order that emphasizes rights and responsibilities of nations and fidelity to the rule of law; * Open access by all to the global commons of sea, air, space, and now, cyberspace; and * The principle of resolving conflict without the use of force. Simply put, pursuing our common interests has increased our common security. Today, the Asia-Pacific region is contending with new and evolving challenges – from rising powers and failing states, to the proliferation of nuclear and ballistic missiles, extremist violence, and new technologies that have the ability to disrupt the foundations of trade and commerce on which Asia’s economic stability depends. Confronting these threats is not the task of any one nation acting alone. Rather, our collective response will test our commitment to the principles I just mentioned – principles that are key to the region’s continued prosperity. In this, all of us have responsibilities we must fulfill, since all will bear the costs of instability as well as the rewards of international cooperation. My government’s overriding obligation to allies, partners, and the region is to reaffirm America’s security commitments in this region. Over the last year, the Obama administration has begun to lay out the architecture of America’s future defense posture through a series of strategy reviews. These reviews were shaped by a bracing dose of realism, and in a very sober and clear-eyed way assessed risks, set priorities, made tradeoffs, and identified requirements based on plausible, real-world threats, scenarios, and potential adversaries. It has become clear to us that an effective, affordable, and sustainable U.S. defense posture requires a broad portfolio of military capabilities with maximum versatility across the widest possible spectrum of conflict. Fielding these capabilities, and demonstrating the resolve to use them if necessary, assures friends and potential adversaries alike of the credibility of U.S. security commitments through our ability to defend against the full range of potential threats.<br />

<strong>Plan Collapses global hegemony and causes rapid Japan remilitarization, Taiwan conflict and instability in India-Pakistan and Korea</strong><br />
<strong>Goh, 8</strong> – Lecturer in International Relations in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the Univ of Oxford (Evelyn, International Relations of the Asia-Pacific, “Hierarchy and the role of the United States in the East Asian security order,” 2008 8(3):353-377, Oxford Journals Database, JMP)<br />
The centrality of these mutual processes of assurance and deference means that the stability of a hierarchical order is fundamentally related to a collective sense of certainty about the leadership and order of the hierarchy. This certainty is rooted in a combination of material calculations – smaller states' assurance that the expected costs of the dominant state conquering them would be higher than the benefits – and ideational convictions – the sense of legitimacy, derived from shared values and norms that accompanies the super-ordinate state's authority in the social order. The empirical analysis in the next section shows that regional stability in East Asia in the post-Second World War years can be correlated to the degree of collective certainty about the US-led regional hierarchy. East Asian stability and instability has been determined by U.S. assurances, self-confidence, and commitment to maintaining its primary position in the regional hierarchy; the perceptions and confidence of regional states about US commitment; and the reactions of subordinate states in the region to the varied challengers to the regional hierarchical order. <br />
4. Hierarchy and the East Asian security order<br />
Currently, the regional hierarchy in East Asia is still dominated by the United States. Since the 1970s, China has increasingly claimed the position of second-ranked great power, a claim that is today legitimized by the hierarchical deference shown by smaller subordinate powers such as South Korea and Southeast Asia. Japan and South Korea can, by virtue of their alliance with the United States, be seen to occupy positions in a third layer of regional major powers, while India is ranked next on the strength of its new strategic relationship with Washington. North Korea sits outside the hierarchic order but affects it due to its military prowess and nuclear weapons capability. <br />
Apart from making greater sense of recent history, conceiving of the US' role in East Asia as the dominant state in the regional hierarchy helps to clarify three critical puzzles in the contemporary international and East Asian security landscape. <br />
First, it contributes to explaining the lack of sustained challenges to American global preponderance after the end of the Cold War. Three of the key potential global challengers to US unipolarity originate in Asia (China, India, and Japan), and their support for or acquiescence to, US dominance have helped to stabilize its global leadership. Through its dominance of the Asian regional hierarchy, the United States has been able to neutralize the potential threats to its position from Japan via an alliance, from India by gradually identifying and pursuing mutual commercial and strategic interests, and from China by encircling and deterring it with allied and friendly states that support American preponderance. <br />
Secondly, recognizing US hierarchical preponderance further explains contemporary under-balancing in Asia, both against a rising China, and against incumbent American power. I have argued that one defining characteristic of a hierarchical system is voluntary subordination of lesser states to the dominant state, and that this goes beyond rationalistic bandwagoning because it is manifested in a social contract that comprises the related processes of hierarchical assurance and hierarchical deference. Critically, successful and sustainable hierarchical assurance and deference helps to explain why Japan is not yet a ‘normal’ country. Japan has experienced significant impetus to revise and expand the remit of its security forces in the last 15 years. Yet, these pressures continue to be insufficient to prompt a wholesale revision of its constitution and its remilitarization. The reason is that the United States extends its security umbrella over Japan through their alliance, which has led Tokyo not only to perceive no threat from US dominance, but has in fact helped to forge a security community between them (Nau, 2003). Adjustments in burden sharing in this alliance since the 1990s have arisen not from greater independent Japanese strategic activism, but rather from periods of strategic uncertainty and crises for Japan when it appeared that American hierarchical assurance, along with US' position at the top of the regional hierarchy, was in question. Thus, the Japanese priority in taking on more responsibility for regional security has been to improve its ability to facilitate the US' central position, rather than to challenge it.13 In the face of the security threats from North Korea and China, Tokyo's continued reliance on the security pact with the United States is rational. While there remains debate about Japan's re-militarization and the growing clout of nationalist ‘hawks’ in Tokyo, for regional and domestic political reasons, a sustained ‘normalization’ process cannot take place outside of the restraining framework of the United States–Japan alliance (Samuels, 2007; Pyle, 2007). Abandoning the alliance will entail Japan making a conscience choice not only to remove itself from the US-led hierarchy, but also to challenge the United States dominance directly. <br />
The United States–ROK alliance may be understood in a similar way, although South Korea faces different sets of constraints because of its strategic priorities related to North Korea. As J.J. Suh argues, in spite of diminishing North Korean capabilities, which render the US security umbrella less critical, the alliance endures because of mutual identification – in South Korea, the image of the US as ‘the only conceivable protector against aggression from the North,’ and in the United States, an image of itself as protector of an allied nation now vulnerable to an ‘evil’ state suspected of transferring weapons of mass destruction to terrorist networks (Suh, 2004). Kang, in contrast, emphasizes how South Korea has become less enthusiastic about its ties with the United States – as indicated by domestic protests and the rejection of TMD – and points out that Seoul is not arming against a potential land invasion from China but rather maritime threats (Kang, 2003, pp.79–80). These observations are valid, but they can be explained by hierarchical deference toward the United States, rather than China. The ROK's military orientation reflects its identification with and dependence on the United States and its adoption of US' strategic aims. In spite of its primary concern with the North Korean threat, Seoul's formal strategic orientation is toward maritime threats, in line with Washington's regional strategy. Furthermore, recent South Korean Defense White Papers habitually cited a remilitarized Japan as a key threat. The best means of coping with such a threat would be continued reliance on the US security umbrella and on Washington's ability to restrain Japanese remilitarization (Eberstadt et al., 2007). Thus, while the United States–ROK bilateral relationship is not always easy, its durability is based on South Korea's fundamental acceptance of the United States as the region's primary state and reliance on it to defend and keep regional order. It also does not rule out Seoul and other US allies conducting business and engaging diplomatically with China. <br />
India has increasingly adopted a similar strategy vis-à-vis China in recent years. Given its history of territorial and political disputes with China and its contemporary economic resurgence, India is seen as the key potential power balancer to a growing China. Yet, India has sought to negotiate settlements about border disputes with China, and has moved significantly toward developing closer strategic relations with the United States. Apart from invigorated defense cooperation in the form of military exchange programs and joint exercises, the key breakthrough was the agreement signed in July 2005 which facilitates renewed bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation (Mohan, 2007). Once again, this is a key regional power that could have balanced more directly and independently against China, but has rather chosen to align itself or bandwagon with the primary power, the United States, partly because of significant bilateral gains, but fundamentally in order to support the latter's regional order-managing function. <br />
Recognizing a regional hierarchy and seeing that the lower layers of this hierarchy have become more active since the mid-1970s also allows us to understand why there has been no outright balancing of China by regional states since the 1990s. On the one hand, the US position at the top of the hierarchy has been revived since the mid-1990s, meaning that deterrence against potential Chinese aggression is reliable and in place.14 On the other hand, the aim of regional states is to try to consolidate China's inclusion in the regional hierarchy at the level below that of the United States, not to keep it down or to exclude it. East Asian states recognize that they cannot, without great cost to themselves, contain Chinese growth. But they hope to socialize China by enmeshing it in peaceful regional norms and economic and security institutions. They also know that they can also help to ensure that the capabilities gap between China and the United States remains wide enough to deter a power transition. Because this strategy requires persuading China about the appropriateness of its position in the hierarchy and of the legitimacy of the US position, all East Asian states engage significantly with China, with the small Southeast Asian states refusing openly to ‘choose sides’ between the United States and China. Yet, hierarchical deference continues to explain why regional institutions such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN + 3, and East Asian Summit have made limited progress. While the United State has made room for regional multilateral institutions after the end of the Cold War, its hierarchical preponderance also constitutes the regional order to the extent that it cannot comfortably be excluded from any substantive strategic developments. On the part of some lesser states (particularly Japan and Singapore), hierarchical deference is manifested in inclusionary impulses (or at least impulses not to exclude the United States or US proxies) in regional institutions, such as the East Asia Summit in December 2005. Disagreement on this issue with others, including China and Malaysia, has stymied potential progress in these regional institutions (Malik, 2006). <br />
Finally, conceiving of a US-led East Asian hierarchy amplifies our understanding of how and why the United States–China relationship is now the key to regional order. The vital nature of the Sino-American relationship stems from these two states' structural positions. As discussed earlier, China is the primary second-tier power in the regional hierarchy. However, as Chinese power grows and Chinese activism spreads beyond Asia, the United States is less and less able to see China as merely a regional power – witness the growing concerns about Chinese investment and aid in certain African countries. This causes a disjuncture between US global interests and US regional interests. Regional attempts to engage and socialize China are aimed at mediating its intentions. This process, however, cannot stem Chinese growth, which forms the material basis of US threat perceptions. Apprehensions about the growth of China's power culminates in US fears about the region being ‘lost’ to China, echoing Cold War concerns that transcribed regional defeats into systemic setbacks.15 On the other hand, the US security strategy post-Cold War and post-9/11 have regional manifestations that disadvantage China. The strengthening of US alliances with Japan and Australia; and the deployment of US troops to Central, South, and Southeast Asia all cause China to fear a consolidation of US global hegemony that will first threaten Chinese national security in the regional context and then stymie China's global reach. <br />
Thus, the key determinants of the East Asian security order relate to two core questions: (i) Can the US be persuaded that China can act as a reliable ‘regional stakeholder’ that will help to buttress regional stability and US global security aims;16 and (ii) can China be convinced that the United States has neither territorial ambitions in Asia nor the desire to encircle China, but will help to promote Chinese development and stability as part of its global security strategy? (Wang, 2005). But, these questions cannot be asked in the abstract, outside the context of negotiation about their relative positions in the regional and global hierarchies. One urgent question for further investigation is how the process of assurance and deference operate at the topmost levels of a hierarchy? When we have two great powers of unequal strength but contesting claims and a closing capabilities gap in the same regional hierarchy, how much scope for negotiation is there, before a reversion to balancing dynamics? This is the main structural dilemma: as long as the United States does not give up its primary position in the Asian regional hierarchy, China is very unlikely to act in a way that will provide comforting answers to the two questions. Yet, the East Asian regional order has been and still is constituted by US hegemony, and to change that could be extremely disruptive and may lead to regional actors acting in highly destabilizing ways. Rapid Japanese remilitarization, armed conflict across the Taiwan Straits, Indian nuclear brinksmanship directed toward Pakistan, or a highly destabilized Korean peninsula are all illustrative of potential regional disruptions. <br />
5. Conclusion<br />
To construct a coherent account of East Asia's evolving security order, I have suggested that the United States is the central force in constituting regional stability and order. The major patterns of equilibrium and turbulence in the region since 1945 can be explained by the relative stability of the US position at the top of the regional hierarchy, with periods of greatest insecurity being correlated with greatest uncertainty over the American commitment to managing regional order. Furthermore, relationships of hierarchical assurance and hierarchical deference explain the unusual character of regional order in the post-Cold War era. <br />
However, the greatest contemporary challenge to East Asian order is the potential conflict between China and the United States over rank ordering in the regional hierarchy, a contest made more potent because of the inter-twining of regional and global security concerns. Ultimately, though, investigating such questions of positionality requires conceptual lenses that go beyond basic material factors because it entails social and normative questions. How can China be brought more into a leadership position, while being persuaded to buy into shared strategic interests and constrain its own in ways that its vision of regional and global security may eventually be reconciled with that of the United States and other regional players? How can Washington be persuaded that its central position in the hierarchy must be ultimately shared in ways yet to be determined? <br />
The future of the East Asian security order is tightly bound up with the durability of the United States' global leadership and regional domination. At the regional level, the main scenarios of disruption are an outright Chinese challenge to US leadership, or the defection of key US allies, particularly Japan. Recent history suggests, and the preceding analysis has shown, that challenges to or defections from US leadership will come at junctures where it appears that the US commitment to the region is in doubt, which in turn destabilizes the hierarchical order. At the global level, American geopolitical over-extension will be the key cause of change. This is the one factor that could lead to both greater regional and global turbulence, if only by the attendant strategic uncertainly triggering off regional challenges or defections. However, it is notoriously difficult to gauge thresholds of over-extension. More positively, East Asia is a region that has adjusted to previous periods of uncertainty about US primacy. Arguably, the regional consensus over the United States as primary state in a system of benign hierarchy could accommodate a shifting of the strategic burden to US allies like Japan and Australia as a means of systemic preservation. The alternatives that could surface as a result of not doing so would appear to be much worse. <br />

6. Interstate War, Down but Far from Out Logically, the reverse side of the coin which proclaims a trend favoring political violence internal to states is the claim that interstate warfare is becoming, or has become, a historical curiosity. Steven Metz and Raymond Millen assure us that “most armed conflicts in coming decades are likely to be internal ones.”21 That is probably a safe prediction, though one might choose to be troubled by their prudent hedging with the qualifier “most.” Their plausible claim would look a little different in hindsight were it to prove true except for a mere one or two interstate nuclear conflicts, say between India and Pakistan, or North Korea and the United States and its allies. The same authors also offer the comforting judgment that “decisive war between major states is rapidly moving toward history’s dustbin.”22 It is an attractive claim; it is a shame that it is wrong. War, let alone “decisive war,” between major states currently is enjoying an off-season for one main reason: So extreme is the imbalance of military power in favor of the United States that potential rivals rule out policies that might lead to hostilities with the superpower. It is fashionable to argue that major interstate war is yesterday’s problem—recall that the yesterday in question is barely 15 years in the past—because now there is nothing to fight about and nothing to be gained by armed conflict. Would that those points were true; unfortunately they are not. The menace of major, if not necessarily decisive, interstate war will return to frighten us when great-power rivals feel able to challenge American hegemony. If you read Thucydides, or Donald Kagan, you will be reminded of the deadly and eternal influence of the triad of motives for war: “fear, honor, and interest.”23 <br />

<strong>East Asian arms race goes nuclear</strong><br />
<strong>Jackson, 9 – Exec. Ed. Of Asia Chronicle</strong> (5/8/09, Van, “Can U.S. Nuclear Plan Prevent Asian Arms Race?” YPFP, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4888:http://www.ypfp.org/content/can-us-nuclear-plan-prevent-asian-arms-race --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ypfp.org/content/can-us-nuclear-plan-prevent-asian-arms-race" rel="nofollow">http://www.ypfp.org/content/can-us-nuclear-plan-prevent-asian-arms-race</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4888 --><br />
One of the myriad fears associated with North Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons is the potential for it to spark a nuclear arms race in Asia. The doomsday scenario plays out rather intuitively: 1) North Korea confirms unequivocally that it will be keeping its existing nuclear weapons or possibly adding to its stockpile; 2) Japan, which has repeatedly mentioned its belief that a nuclear North Korea is a threat to Japanese security, dramatically builds up its defensive and offensive military capability, possibly developing its own nuclear program while it pushes for greater involvement in transnational security issues such as terrorism; 3) China, continuing to see Japan as the only near-peer realistically capable of challenging its regional leadership, is threatened by Japan’s remilitarization and responds by increasing its own military spending; 4) Partly in response to China’s increased military expenditures and partly in response to nagging historically based concerns over Japan’s remilitarization, both South Korea and Taiwan build up their own conventional armaments, potentially engaging in secret nuclear programs as well. Under such circumstances, political risk indicators would shoot through the roof and foreign direct investment inflows of capital would quickly dry up as multinational corporations seek a safer, more stable region in which to do business. The region’s resulting economic contraction would place increasing pressure on national governments to pander to xenophobic and nationalistic sentiments, as has been done many times before, thus stoking the fire of conflict. The region, in sum, would become a powder keg. This is not overly pessimistic hyperbole but a realistic scenario according to the classic literature on security dilemmas.[1] Just imagine a world where the most powerful countries in Asia all either possess nuclear weapons or are engaged in covert programs to develop a nuclear weapons capability, each in the name of its own security. Such a dreadful possibility is exactly what the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was designed to prevent.<br />

<span class="Underline">China's Asian Rival: A Resurgent Japan</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The depth of Chinese nationalist sentiment towards Taiwan has a parallel, though not an exact one, in anti-Japanese feeling. Like the Taiwan issue, these feelings run both deep and broad in Chinese society. The memory of Japan's invasion during the Second World War is particularly poignant; one 1996 survey reported that the word &quot;Japan&quot; made 81.3% of Chinese youth think most easily of the &quot;war of resistance against Japanese aggression.&quot;[44] The strength of anti-Japanese sentiment suggests that the Chinese government may take an aggressive stance on major increases in Japan's military capability in general, and the acquisition of nuclear weapons in particular.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Anti-Japanese nationalism has been described as &quot;the stomach-burning passion of Chinese patriots.&quot;[45] In April 2005, large protests erupted in many Chinese cities after United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged a plan intended to give Japan a permanent seat on the Security Council.[46] An online petition that allegedly garnered 42 million signatures in opposition to a permanent Security Council seat for Japan[47] suggests the popular resonance of these protests. Additional protests were organized in a grassroots, popular campaign largely conducted via the Internet, a feat accomplished because of the strength of anti-Japanese sentiment.[48] This phenomenon is particularly notable because much of this online protest occurred without direction by the government; an example is Japanpig.com, which simply features a sword piercing the Japanese flag.[49]</span><br />
<span class="Underline">This hyper-nationalism is at odds with official policy, most particularly with regards to the Diaoyu/Senkaku, a group of islands claimed by both China and Japan in the East China Sea. One internal Chinese government poll suggested that 82% of mainland citizens opposed the government's policy towards Japan and favored a more aggressive one.[50] The gap between popular opinion and elite policy suggests that under current circumstances a hyper-nationalist nexus is unlikely to form between elite and popular interests. However, if Japan pursues a policy of nuclearization, these circumstances may change. It also bodes ill for the cause of moderation in the case of conflict.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Some already regard Japan as a &quot;de facto nuclear weapons state&quot; because it possesses stockpiles of plutonium, the necessary technological base to produce nuclear weapons, and because it possesses advanced space launch technology that could easily be applied to intercontinental ballistic missiles.[51] Furthermore, although Japan has a strong political tradition renouncing nuclear weapons, there are some signs this may be changing. In April 2002, Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of Japan's opposition Liberal Party, warned that &quot;if China gets too inflated, the Japanese people will become hysterical,&quot; and claimed it would be easy for Japan to produce nuclear weapons.[52]</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Although the Chinese Foreign Ministry response to Ozawa's statements was muted,[53] there appears to be some perception that Japan is embarked on a long-term path of aggression towards China. In an article published in the Shanghai Journal of Social Studies, one analyst claimed that &quot;all-out strategic precautions against China have become one of the main contents of Japan's strategy towards China.&quot;[54] If such a policy were seen to threaten China with Japanese nuclear weapons capabilities, hyper-nationalist elite and popular interests may converge to advocate an aggressive response.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Despite the depth of anti-Japanese sentiment, there is no direct link between a nuclearized Japan and a nuclear conflict with China. Thus the threat of a nuclear-armed Japan is more one of instability. Given the resonance of anti-Japanese feeling, there may be significant potential for a hyper-nationalist nexus to form against Japan than against the United States, including the threatened use of nuclear weapons. Acquisition of nuclear weapons by Japan would probably at a minimum induce Chinese decision makers to reconsider the NFU policy, particularly if Japan also acquired a ballistic missile capability.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Any such situation would also involve the United States. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security obligates the United States to &quot;act to meet the common danger&quot; in the event of an attack on Japanese territory.[55] Chinese analysts, moreover, emphasize strong U.S.-Japan ties,[56] suggesting that were a conflict to develop, all parties expect the involvement of the United States. The implications of any such conflict are enormous, involving as it would three of the world's most powerful militaries, all of which, in this scenario, would have a mature or putative nuclear weapons capability. The specter of this kind of confrontation is worth considering as one</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Japan’s International Reputation</span><br />
<span class="Underline">If Japan decided to go nuclear, its international reputation as a principled advocate for nonproliferation would erode. Many observers say this would rule out Japan’s ambition of eventually holding a seat on the United Nations Security Council. Japan, of course, would bear the brunt of these consequences, but it could be harmful to U.S. interests as well. Japan is generally viewed overwhelmingly positively by the international community, and its support for U.S.-led international issues can lend credibility and legitimacy to efforts such as democracy promotion, peacekeeping missions, environmental cooperation, and multilateral defense exercises, to name a few.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">OTHER THREATS </span><br />
<span class="Underline">This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security and well-being in the coming years and decades. In the former Yugoslavia nationalist aggression tears at the stability of Europe and could easily spread. The flow of illegal drugs intensifies through increasingly powerful international crime syndicates that have made common cause with authoritarian regimes and have utterly corrupted the institutions of tenuous, democratic ones. Nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons continue to proliferate. The very source of life on Earth, the global ecosystem, appears increasingly endangered. Most of these new and unconventional threats to security are associated with or aggravated by the weakness or absence of democracy, with its provisions for legality, accountability, popular sovereignty, and openness. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">LESSONS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The experience of this century offers important lessons. Countries that govern themselves in a truly democratic fashion do not go to war with one another. They do not aggress against their neighbors to aggrandize themselves or glorify their leaders. Democratic governments do not ethnically &quot;cleanse&quot; their own populations, and they are much less likely to face ethnic insurgency. Democracies do not sponsor terrorism against one another. They do not build weapons of mass destruction to use on or to threaten one another. Democratic countries form more reliable, open, and enduring trading partnerships. In the long run they offer better and more stable climates for investment. They are more environmentally responsible because they must answer to their own citizens, who organize to protest the destruction of their environments. They are better bets to honor international treaties since they value legal obligations and because their openness makes it much more difficult to breach agreements in secret. Precisely because, within their own borders, they respect competition, civil liberties, property rights, and the rule of law, democracies are the only reliable foundation on which a new world order of international security and prosperity can be built.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">While concern over catastrophic accidents and long-term waste management are perhaps better known, the largest single vulnerability associated with an expansion of nuclear power is likely to be its potential connection to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This is due both to the impact of proliferation on world security as well as to the terrible destruction that accompany the use of nuclear weapons. The bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki sixty years ago were responsible for an estimated 170,000 to 200,000 immediate deaths. The global economic consequences that would follow a nuclear attack on cities like New York, Tokyo, New Delhi are difficult to predict, but would almost certainly be catastrophic. For example the U.N. High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change concluded that the total economic impact following the detonation of even a simple nuclear weapon in a major city would be “at least one trillion dollars.” </span><br />

What if the global economy stagnates—or even shrinks? In that case, we will face a new period of international conflict: South against North, rich against poor.

<span class="Underline">MUELLER IS entitled to his opinion that the threat of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism is &quot;exaggerated&quot; and &quot;overwrought.&quot; But analysts of various political persuasions, in and out of government, are virtually unanimous in their judgment to the contrary. As the national-security community learned during the Cold War, risk = likelihood x consequences. Thus, even when the likelihood of nuclear Armageddon was small, the consequences were so catastrophic that prudent policymakers felt a categorical imperative to do everything that feasibly could be done to prevent that war. Today, a single nuclear bomb exploding in just one city would change our world. Given such consequences, differences between a 1 percent and a 20 percent likelihood of such an attack are relatively insignificant when considering how we should respond to the threat. Richard Garwin, a designer of the hydrogen bomb who Enrico Fermi once called &quot;the only true genius I had ever met&quot;, told Congress in March that he estimated a &quot;20 percent per year probability [of a nuclear explosion-not just a contaminated, dirty bomb-a nuclear explosion] with American cities and European cities included.&quot; My Harvard colleague Matthew Bunn has created a model in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science that estimates the probability of a nuclear terrorist attack over a ten-year period to be 29 percent-identical to the average estimate from a poll of security experts commissioned by Senator Richard Lugar in 2005. My book, Nuclear Terrorism, states my own best judgment that, on the current trend line, the chances of a nuclear terrorist attack in the next decade are greater than 50 percent. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry has expressed his own view that my work may even underestimate the risk. Warren Buffet, the world's most successful investor and legendary odds-maker in pricing insurance policies for unlikely but catastrophic events, concluded that nuclear terrorism is &quot;inevitable.&quot; He stated, &quot;I don't see any way that it won't happen.&quot;</span><br />

<strong>Payne ‘7</strong> (Keith, Prof. and Chair Defense and Strategic Studies – Missouri State U., CQ Congressional Testimony, “U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy”, 7-18, L/N)<br />
<span class="Underline">Some see an incongruity in the U.S. maintaining a nuclear arsenal for deterrence while simultaneously advocating nuclear non- proliferation. I have heard this seeming incongruity likened to a drunkard advocating abstinence. In reality, this seeming incongruity is not hard to see through; indeed, the U.S. deployment of nuclear capabilities makes an essential contribution to nuclear non-proliferation. This positive linkage may be counterintuitive, but it is unquestionable. How so? It is on the basis of the U.S. nuclear &quot;umbrella&quot; that allied countries such as Japan have chosen to remain non-nuclear: the continued credibility of our nuclear umbrella is critical to their decisions to remain non-nuclear, and their decisions to remain non-nuclear have been and continue to be critical to non- proliferation. It is hard to imagine a greater stimulus to nuclear proliferation than decisions by U.S. allies and friends to &quot;go nuclear&quot; themselves as a result of their loss of confidence in the U.S. nuclear umbrella. A detailed review of specific countries by noted regional experts reaches a similar conclusion: &quot;The case studies suggest that the perceived reliability of U.S. security assurances will be a critical factor, if not the critical factor, in whether such countries as Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey reconsider their nuclear options.&quot;</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The United States has scaled back plans to deploy a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe. While that decision reflects a new assessment of the Iranian threat to Europe, most attention is being paid to its impact on relations with Russia. But the decision has equally important implications for Asia. It underscores two critical facts: first, the notion of discrete “theaters” is a fiction; second, the U.S. has to closely engage its Asian allies as it develops its strategic doctrine.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">In a response to an Iranian missile threat, the Bush administration had planned to deploy ground-based interceptors in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic. The program became a major irritant in U.S-Russia relations: Moscow complained that the missile defense shield could be used to neutralize its own deterrent and that it undermined Russian influence in its “near abroad.”</span><br />
<span class="Underline">According to President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, the new deployments better respond to Iranian capabilities. (The original plan was best against long-range missiles, while the Pentagon believes the real threat comes from short- and medium-range missiles.) Announcing the new plans, Mr. Obama said, “Our new missile defense architecture in Europe will provide stronger, smarter and swifter defenses of American forces and America's allies.” He added that Russian “concerns about our previous missile defense programs were entirely unfounded.”</span><br />
<span class="Underline">There is intense speculation about what this decision “really” means. For some, it is as advertised: a better response to the Iranian threat. To others, it reflects a deeper skepticism about the efficacy of missile defense in general and is a more rational use of limited defense dollars. Yet others see it as part of continuing effort to “reset” relations with Moscow. In particular, it aims to win Russian backing for U.S. policy in Afghanistan or to get Moscow to agree to tighten the screws on Iran and get Tehran to rein in its nuclear ambitions.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Little attention has been paid to the Asian dimension of this decision. That isn’t new. In the 1980s, when the U.S. and the Soviet Union were sparring over deployment of intermediate-range missiles in Europe, a Soviet pitch to move its missiles east of the Urals triggered a mini-crisis with Japan (which is remembered in Tokyo as a big deal). In recent discussions with Japanese experts, we were warned that any U.S. decision on missile defense in Europe that appears to accommodate Russian concerns could send the wrong signal to China, which has its own concerns about the aim of missile defense deployments by the U.S. and its allies in Asia. Beijing’s concerns look a lot like those of Moscow.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Two lessons are clear. First, U.S. strategists have to think globally about doctrine and force deployments. There is an inclination to think about regions, discrete theaters, and their particular circumstances, but decisions involving one can impact another. North Korea learned from the global response to the 1998 decisions by India and Pakistan to detonate nuclear weapons; Pyongyang’s demand that its nuclear capability be accepted by the rest of the world is an aspiration to match Pakistan’s status, if not that of Delhi. And Iran is surely using Pyongyang’s nuclear negotiations as a benchmark for its own talks with the West.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">U.S. nuclear decision makers need to be more alert to these connections and anticipate the more distant effects of their policies.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Despite this litany of problems both real and perceived, the U.S.-Japan alliance, and the broader relationship it embodies, remains the keystone of U.S. policy in the Asia-Pacific region. There is little doubt that America and Japan share certain core values that tie us together, including a belief in democracy, the rule of law, and civil and individual rights, among others, which should properly inform and inspire our policies abroad. Moreover, after the cataclysm of World War II, we have worked together to maintain stability in the western Pacific, throughout the Cold War and after. Without the continued Japanese hosting of U.S. forces, our forward-based posture is untenable, particularly in a period of growing Chinese military power in which the acquisition of advanced weapons systems indicates increased vulnerability of U.S. forces over time. There are over 35,000 U.S. military personnel in Japan, and another 11,000 afloat as part of the 7th Fleet, while three-quarters of our military facilities are in Okinawa. Maintaining this presence is a full-time job for officials on both sides of the Pacific. Both Washington and Tokyo have revised the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) governing the U.S. military in Japan to respond to local concerns over judicial access to U.S. service members, and domestic pressures to reduce Japan's $4 billion annual Host Nation Support (HNS) are a continuing feature of bilateral discussions. The new Japanese government has indicated its desire to consider further revision of SOFA and HNS, which portends continued, sometimes difficult negotiations between both sides, though I would be surprised by any significant changes in either. It is clear, however, that the presence of U.S. military forces is welcomed by nearly all nations in the Asia-Pacific region and sends a signal of American commitment to the region. From a historical standpoint, the post-war American presence in the Asia-Pacific has been one of the key enablers of growth and development in that maritime realm. And today, for all its dynamism, the Asia-Pacific remains peppered with territorial disputes and long-standing grievances, with few effective multilateral mechanisms such as exist in Europe for solving interstate conflicts. Our friends and allies in the area are keenly attuned to our continued forward-based posture, and any indications that the United States was reducing its presence might be interpreted by both friends and competitors as a weakening of our long-standing commitment to maintain stability in the Pacific. The shape of Asian regional politics will continue to evolve, and while I am skeptical of what can realistically be achieved by proposed U.S.-Japan-China trilateral talks, it seems evident that we must approach our alliance with Japan from a more regionally oriented perspective, taking into account how our alliance affects the plans and perceptions of other nations in the region.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Japan officially endorses the objective of a non-nuclear world, but it relies on America's extended nuclear deterrent, and wants to avoid being subject to nuclear blackmail from North Korea (or China). The Japanese fear that the credibility of American extended deterrence will be weakened if the U.S. decreases its nuclear forces to parity with China. It is a mistake, however, to believe that extended deterrence depends on parity in numbers of nuclear weapons. Rather, it depends on a combination of capability and credibility. During the Cold War, the U.S. was able to defend Berlin because our promise to do so was made credible by the NATO alliance and the presence of American troops, whose lives would be on the line in the event of a Soviet attack. Indeed, the best guarantee of American extended deterrence over Japan remains the presence of nearly 50,000 American troops (which Japan helps to maintain with generous host-nation support). Credibility is also enhanced by joint projects such as the development of regional ballistic missile defense.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Q: Some experts are concerned about the DPJ's view of extended deterrence [deterrence provided through the threat of a nuclear response to an attack on an ally]. It's unclear. How do you see it? A: Well, I think as the DPJ ministers take over their portfolios and start looking carefully at the situation, first there'll be talks between Americans and the new Japanese government about details of extended deterrence, but I think the new ministers will find that extended deterrence is very important for Japan and that the credibility of extended deterrence depends very much upon the forward presence of American troops.</span><br />

<strong><span class="Underline">Withdrawal magnifies threat from North Korean nukes – leads to Asian arms race</span></strong><br />
<strong>Jiji Press Ticker, 10</strong> (U.S. Commander Stresses Importance of Okinawa Base, Lexis)<br />
<span class="Underline">A U.S. Marines commander on Wednesday emphasized the significance of the Marines staying in Okinawa, the southernmost prefecture in Japan, in terms of quick reactions to contingencies in East Asia. In a speech in Tokyo, Lt. Gen. Keith Stalder, commanding general for U.S. Marine Corps Forces Pacific, said that the U.S. military &quot;must be based in Okinawa&quot; to maintain security in a region where there are potential threats to Japan, including North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. Regarding the controversial relocation of the Marines' Futenma airfield in Ginowan, Okinawa, he stressed that &quot;it is not just about a local base issue,&quot; given the importance of the Japan-U.S. alliance for regional stability and economic prosperity. The Japanese government has been looking into an alternative site, as part of a review to the 2006 bilateral agreement to move the Futenma base to the Marines' Camp Schwab in Nago in the same prefecture. Regarding calls by some members of Japan's ruling coalition for the Futenma military facility to be moved out of the prefecture, or even out of Japan, Stalder warned that if countries in the region begin to see the U.S. military presence in Japan receding, they would &quot;drastically increase their defense budgets...leading to a regional arms race.&quot;</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Threat Reduction and Nonproliferation Effect: As a side benefit, a BMD system protecting U.S. allies could contribute to nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles If coupled with U.S. extended deterrence. BMD could reduce the motivations of other regional states to acquire nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles which would be less effective after the deployment of BMD. TMD could also enable the United States to reduce its reliance on nuclear deterrence in a regional contingency, thereby further marginalizing the significance of nuclear weapons.</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Missile defense plays an important role in the broader U.S. international security strategy. Missile defense supports diplomacy and defense, two of the three pillars of our international security strategy (the third pillar being development). Missile defense assures our allies and partners that the United States has the will and the means to deter and, if necessary, defeat a ballistic missile attack against our allies and our forward deployed troops and assets. Missile defense also provides U.S. and allied forces with freedom of maneuver by helping to negate the ability of regional actors to inhibit or disrupt U.S. military access and operations in the region. Less obvious, perhaps, is the role of missile defense in supporting our diplomatic objectives. Our potential adversaries use ballistic missiles in peacetime as tools to support their diplomatic objectives, and sometimes to intimidate or coerce their regional neighbors. By offering missile defense as a means of regional protection, we enhance the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence commitments for our allies and friends. This, in turn, enables us to build coalitions for accomplishing shared objectives. For example, our friends and allies are therefore free to respond diplomatically to these threats because they have confidence that an effective missile defense strategy is in place.The presence of missile defense also provides more options for the peaceful resolution of disputes, thereby enhancing regional stability and extended deterrence. Finally, missile defense also provides us the ability and time to pursue diplomatic solutions to crises that we do not want to allow to escalate.</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">There is also some uncertainty about how China would respond to the introduction of theater missile defense in the Asia-Pacific region, despite all of the many official Chinese statements suggesting that the transfer of TMD to Taiwan would precipitate a major crisis. Actual Chinese responses are difficult to predict. Although there has been some discussion of possible countermeasures to U.S. NMD, there seems to be far less in the open Chinese literature about the development of military capabilities to defeat TMD. Instead, articles in Chinese military publications tend to discount the effects of TMD on the military situation in the Taiwan Straits, arguing that it will not substantially improve Taiwanese defensive capabilities.149 Nevertheless, as noted earlier, the Chinese military has already undertaken a substantial build-up of its theater ballistic missile force.</span><br />

The deployment of advanced missile defense interceptors and the airborne laser could provide additional capabilities against satellites. These residual capabilities do not, however, constitute the weaponization of space because they have not been used for this purpose. The acquisition of new military capabilities that could be applied to space warfare increases the necessity to prevent their flight-testing in “an ASAT mode,” if the distinction between militarization and weaponization is to be maintained. Cooperative monitoring arrangements are essential for this purpose.</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Space Warfare and the Taiwan Scenario. More definition can be provided to these abstractions by analyzing the scenario of a possible crisis between the United States and China over the future of Taiwan.42 If China possessed imaging satellites capable of locating forward-deployed U.S. aircraft carriers, this targeting information could then be relayed to platforms carrying long-range, anti-ship missiles. As a consequence, U.S. aircraft carriers could be placed at acute risk. Heavy U.S. casualties could result, and depending on the status of forces in the theater, China might initially secure some military gains against Taiwan. Based on this scenario, a U.S. ASAT capability might be viewed as necessary to protect carrier operations in high-threat environments along China’s periphery. By extension, just as surface combatants and submarines provide a defensive screen for carriers on the high seas, ASAT capabilities might provide a defensive screen in space. In this view, the United States might be willing to tolerate an ASAT arms competition in which its own satellites were placed at greater risk in order to ensure incapacitation of the potential enemy’s ability to strike high-value American targets at sea.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">In this scenario, the potential benefits of space warfare are far greater when initiated by the stronger adversary than by the weaker foe. A preemptive U.S. strike against Chinese satellites could increase the prospect of a decisive military victory with minimum casualties. A preemptive U.S. strike limited to Chinese space assets would, however, leave much to chance. If the United States were serious about limiting casualties and pursuing damage limitation in the event of a war with China across the Taiwan Strait, preemptive strikes would need to extend to other Chinese targets that could do harm to American military forces and the U.S. homeland. These strikes could also be executed from space, as well as by terrestrial means.</span><br />

<strong>The Marines in Futenma play a vital role in deterrence and rapid response capabilities—the plan only kills the rest of the alliance and results in Kadena closing—collapses U.S. regional credibility</strong><br />

<br />
The opinion piece entitled &quot;Putting Okinawa Air Base in Perspective&quot; by Michael O'Hanlon carried in The Daily Yomiuri on Feb. 3 is a thoughtful discussion of the U.S.-Japan alliance. We fully agree with the &quot;need to lift our sights above bickering over bases and put strategy and [dealing with] the world's real problems back at the center of our alliance,&quot; but we believe Mr. O'Hanlon does not fully appreciate the importance of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma or understand the complex dynamics of the so-called &quot;Okinawa problem.&quot; Moreover, he downplays the vital role that forward-deployed United States Marines fulfill in meeting the obligations of the 1960 United States-Japan Treaty of Mutual Security and Cooperation. <br />
There is much to rebut in his op-ed, but we will concentrate on the following four faulty premises: 1) that the functions of MCAS Futenma are less important than Kadena Air Base (KAB) and thus can be forfeited as a political pawn; 2) that sacrificing MCAS Futenma would make KAB less of a political target and thus satisfy anti-base activists in Okinawa and elsewhere; 3) that the U.S. government has not regularly &quot;factored in local sensitivities&quot; into alliance management issues and has done nothing in the past to alleviate local concerns; and 4) that a contingency basing formula in which civilian airports are used is an operationally practical solution. <br />
While both KAB and MCAS Futenma are co-located in central Okinawa, they have fundamentally different roles and missions. Yet, there is an important synergy between the two airfields in daily operations as well as in a contingency if deterrence failed. A loss of the capabilities of either airfield could significantly impact operations during a crisis. When discussing them, it is not an either/or choice but a clear requirement for both. While scholars can hope for the best, planners need to prepare for the worst. One airfield reduces contingency options and creates a military planner's worst nightmare: a single point of failure. <br />
We disagree that this option is a &quot;tolerable one,&quot; as he suggests, by any means, regardless of whether contingency access to other airfields is improved or not. There are numerous political and operational challenges to the concept of contingency use but the bottom line up front is: moving or spreading the functions of Futenma outside of the main island of Okinawa not only would critically affect the ability of the Marine Corps to perform its daily operations and training to sustain combat readiness as well as to ably and quickly respond to crises, but could also impair the deterrence functions and credibility of our alliance and thus security in the entire region. <br />
The USMC takes seriously &quot;local sensitivities&quot; in all aspects of our training and operations, and it was the U.S. and Japanese governments' efforts to address these concerns that were behind the 1996 and 2006 agreements to return Futenma, which were conditioned on a replacement site being found within the prefecture. A replacement facility then and now remains important because the capabilities Futenma possesses are vital to the mission of the Marine Corps and other U.S. forces in Okinawa, as well as being a United Nations Command (Rear) Airfield and a diversion airfield for civilian aircraft. Not only do the Marines provide significant contributions to deterrence and defense of Japan and peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region, but are also actively involved in HA/DR missions and Theater Security Cooperation (TSC), which is designed to build transparency and trust in this region. Significantly, there have been hundreds of thousands of lives saved in the region by U.S. Marines, such as during the 12 significant HA/DR operations in the past five years alone, including the 2004 tsunami and the disastrous tropical cyclones in 2007 in Bangladesh and 2008 in Burma in which units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa either directly led or significantly contributed to response efforts. <br />
The implied argument in the op-ed--that the forfeiting of MCAS Futenma and removal of all Marines from Okinawa would &quot;preserve local support for Kadena&quot;--is misplaced. Regrettably, the fact is anti-base, anti-alliance activists will only pocket concessions and continue to press for the next one. Following the closure of MCAS Futenma without a replacement, as recommended by Mr. O'Hanlon, the activists will likely turn their attention next to closing Kadena Air Base, which would further degrade alliance capabilities. <br />
Fortunately, there has been a realization that the United States and Japan need to do more at the political level to help ensure the smooth implementation of the bilateral security treaty as well as to educate our respective publics more on the importance of the alliance. <br />
Equally important is that Japan's SDF be allowed to play a larger operational role in the alliance and in the region. The proposal by Mr. O'Hanlon for Japan to send &quot;substantial numbers of peacekeeping troops to Sudan and the Congo&quot; is also good, but has no bearing on the strategic situation in Northeast Asia or even the Asia-Pacific. Having only recently adopted a &quot;joint&quot; approach to operations, the SDF is trying to operate more closely with the military forces of its only ally to develop these capabilities. Working with the U.S. and increasingly with the militaries of other countries, the SDF is gaining experience and confidence. While it was given a mandate to participate in more international HA/DR operations abroad, the SDF is faced with a declining budget and decreasing personnel numbers. In the interim, the U.S. Marines, being the only truly rapidly deployable ground troops in Northeast Asia, will continue to be the first responders--the 911 force--to any crisis and continue to represent, along with the Navy, Air Force, and Army service components of U.S. Forces Japan and U.S. Pacific Command, the American commitment to the region. The Marines' capabilities, experience, and proven record of success are hard to replicate, something the SDF, particularly the Ground Self-Defense Forces, look to as they further develop their capabilities and jointness. <br />
At the end of his opinion piece, the author refers to the late Ambassador Mike Mansfield's description of the U.S.-Japan alliance as being the most important, bar none. We entirely agree. But we would also remind him that out of all of Mr. Mansfield's accomplishments including educator, senator, majority leader, and ambassador, he was most proud of his service as a United States Marine and had written on his tombstone in Arlington National Cemetery after his death in October 2001 the following simple epitaph: &quot;Michael Joseph Mansfield, Pvt. U.S. Marine Corps.&quot; <br />

Japan's annual defense report released on Friday underlined the vital role played by U.S. military forces stationed in Japan in protecting Japan and its neighbors in the region. <br />
The 488-page Defense of Japan 2010 report also stressed Japan 's bilateral security alliance with the United States, noting that U.S. military presence in Japan was significant in providing deterrence against a possible attack on Japan. <br />
The report document said the U.S. Marines stationed in Japan need to be positioned at a strategic place to ensure this deterrence. It hinted that the southwestern prefecture of Okinawa is a better geographic location for the Marines to respond to emergencies in East Asia than Hawaii, Guam or the U.S. mainland. <br />
Tokyo and Washington agreed in May to move the U.S. Marine Corps' Futenma Air Station from the densely populated residential area of Ginowan in Okinawa to the less crowded Henoko district at the Marines' Camp Schwab in Nago within the prefecture by 2014. <br />
The report reviewed defense-related developments in the past year ending mid-August. It was the first defense white paper unveiled by the government led by the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ). <br />
In addition, the document said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) nuclear programs and missile activities are an &quot;extremely destabilizing factor&quot; for the security of Japan and other countries in the Northeast Asian region. <br />

<br />
TOKYO—When President Barack Obama arrives in Yokohama for an Asian-Pacific summit Friday, he will find some welcome news: a marked improvement in the recently testy security relationship with Japan, America's most important ally in the region. <br />
While the two countries remain prominently at loggerheads over the relocation of a U.S. Marine base on the island of Okinawa, officials on both sides of the Pacific say that, behind the scenes, they have seen a subtle but swift improvement in ties on a number of fronts. <br />
The two governments have resumed a stalled dialogue to define military roles, missions and capabilities. After floating the idea of cutting the amount it spends to support U.S. troops in Japan last year, Tokyo has now ruled out any reduction in what is known as host-nation support, or HNS, even as the rest of its budget faces spending cuts to rein in its massive outstanding debt. <br />
&quot;In this environment of uniform budget cuts, HNS is being given special protection,&quot; said Jun Azumi, Japan's senior parliamentary vice minister of defense. &quot;That should send an important message to the U.S.&quot; <br />
HNS pays for various labor, facilities, utilities and other costs for U.S. forces in Japan, which help protect the country. Under Japan's postwar constitution, its military is limited to self-defense. However, it has become one of Asia's most powerful armed forces. <br />
Prime Minister Naoto Kan's government is moving toward easing a ban on arms exports in order to foster cross-border weapons development with the U.S. That initiative, Japanese officials say, will likely be included in a five-year defense-spending plan and a set of strategic defense guidelines due out in December. Officials say those initiatives may eventually lead to the purchase of U.S.-made F-35 stealth jet fighters and unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles to upgrade and expand Japan's military capabilities. <br />
Although the Okinawa base debate is mired in local politics, there has been a significant shift in how the national Japanese government views the matter. Tokyo says it is now committed to keeping the base on the island in some form. <br />
&quot;Maintaining the bilateral alliance is like gardening,&quot; said Takashi Shiraishi, a Cabinet Office adviser to Mr. Kan and a member of the Japanese government's advisory panel setting up the defense guidelines. &quot;If you don't tend to it frequently, it will go to seed.&quot; <br />
Not all Japanese officials are as sanguine. Critics blame Mr. Kan's center-left Democratic Party of Japan—which took power for the first time a year ago after defeating the long-ruling center-right Liberal Democratic Party—for sending mixed messages to the U.S. and inviting a recent Chinese incursion into Japanese-administered waters. <br />
In September, Japan detained a Chinese captain for several weeks after his fishing trawler collided with a Japanese coast-guard cutter near a chain of disputed islands. <br />
&quot;They kept sending wrong messages to our ally, the U.S.,&quot; said Takeshi Iwaya, an opposition LDP member and former parliamentary vice minister of defense. &quot;China saw that the U.S.-Japan relationship was on shaky ground and took advantage of it.&quot; <br />
A year ago, under Mr. Kan's predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama, the U.S. and Japan appeared to be drifting apart due to a combination of mistrust and misunderstanding. Messrs. Kan and Hatoyama are both members of the DPJ, but the foreign-policy contrast between them has been striking. <br />
In October 2009, the newly elected Mr. Hatoyama openly mulled a reduction in funding for U.S. troops in Japan during parliamentary debate and called for a &quot;comprehensive review&quot; of military ties with the U.S. His foreign-policy agenda sought to upgrade ties within Asia by taking up a long-dormant initiative for an East Asian Community excluding the U.S., with which he sought a more &quot;equal alliance&quot; bilaterally. The Japanese media dubbed the new policy direction &quot;datsubei-nyua,&quot; which roughly translates as &quot;Exit America, Enter Asia.&quot; <br />
Now, Asia experts note an improvement in the tone of bilateral relations. They credit policy makers on both sides of the Pacific. <br />
&quot;After this real worry in the region that the U.S.-Japan alliance was coming off the rails, they've shifted it out of reverse,&quot; said Michael Green, a Japan specialist with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and former special adviser to President George W. Bush. &quot;The Kan cabinet came in with some real realists and the Obama administration deserves credit for smart engagement and patience&quot; with Japan. <br />
The recent standoff between China and Japan over the handful of uninhabited islands served as a wake-up call to policy makers and has led to a broad-based reaffirmation of support for the bilateral defense relationship. While Washington officially remains neutral, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in October reasserted the U.S.'s commitment to defend all Japanese-administered territory—including the disputed islands claimed by China. Mrs. Clinton's vocalization of that implicit stance was warmly received in Tokyo and symbolized the new level of bilateral engagement. <br />
At a time of continual budget cuts, Japan's Defense Ministry has requested a 0.6% increase in spending next year for a total of 4.71 trillion yen ($57.3 billion), including 189 billion yen in funding earmarked for U.S. forces in Japan. <br />
In an interview last week, Mr. Kan called the U.S.-Japan alliance &quot;extremely important&quot; and indicated the tone had improved in recent months, saying &quot;I do believe the bilateral relationship is currently in a very good condition.' <br />

<strong>Their ev is old news—DPJ political victories and Chinese aggression have swung the favor of both the public and the government towards sustaining the alliance</strong><br />

<br />
Two events brought this period of drift in the alliance to an end. The first was the Democratic Party of Japan’s maturation. While the DPJ has a long way to go toward transitioning from an opposition to a governing party, the intraparty election two months ago provided a turning point. By winning a convincing victory over Ichiro Ozawa (the man who created the party), Naoto Kan solidified his authority. <br />
In addition, the election accelerated the ascendance of a younger generation of politicians, including but by no means limited to foreign minister Seiji Maehara, who take a pragmatic stance on security issues, strongly support the alliance, and are determined for Japan to make a greater contribution in the world. The election dispelled much of the political uncertainty overhanging Tokyo and refashioned the DPJ into a more effective US partner. <br />
The second event was a maritime confrontation between Japan and China. On September 7, as video footage demonstrates, a Chinese fishing trawler rammed two Japanese Coast Guard vessels patrolling near the Senkakus – an island group administered by Tokyo but also claimed by Beijing. When Japan took the trawler captain into custody, China retaliated by cutting off exports of rare-earth elements, minerals vital to Japan’s high-tech industry. For the DPJ as well as the Japanese public, this crisis underscored the value of the alliance. <br />

<strong>Giving up Futenma now will just spur more movements to push us out of the region—we access the bigger internal link to deterrence collapse</strong><br />
<strong>Feffe</strong>r, co-director of Foreign Policy In Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies, <strong>10</strong> (John, Mar. 6, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/LC06Dh02.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/LC06Dh02.html</a>, twm) <br />
<br />
Wherever the US military puts down its foot overseas, movements have sprung up to protest the military, social, and environmental consequences of its military bases. This anti-base movement has notched some successes, such as the shut-down of a US navy facility in Vieques, Puerto Rico, in 2003. In the Pacific, too, the movement has made its mark. On the heels of the eruption of Mt Pinatubo, democracy activists in the Philippines successfully closed down the ash-covered Clark Air Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Station in 1991-1992. Later, South Korean activists managed to win closure of the huge Yongsan facility in downtown Seoul. <br />
Of course, these were only partial victories. Washington subsequently negotiated a Visiting Forces Agreement with the Philippines, whereby the US military has redeployed troops and equipment to the island, and replaced Korea's Yongsan base with a new one in nearby Pyeongtaek. But these not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) victories were significant enough to help edge the Pentagon toward the adoption of a military doctrine that emphasizes mobility over position. The US military now relies on &quot;strategic flexibility&quot; and &quot;rapid response&quot; both to counter unexpected threats and to deal with allied fickleness. <br />
The Hatoyama government may indeed learn to say no to Washington over the Okinawa bases. Evidently considering this a likelihood, former deputy secretary of state and former US ambassador to Japan Richard Armitage has said that the United States &quot;had better have a plan B&quot;. But the victory for the anti-base movement will still be only partial. US forces will remain in Japan, and especially Okinawa, and Tokyo will undoubtedly continue to pay for their maintenance. <br />
Buoyed by even this partial victory, however, NIMBY movements are likely to grow in Japan and across the region, focusing on other Okinawa bases, bases on the Japanese mainland, and elsewhere in the Pacific, including Guam. Indeed, protests are already building in Guam against the projected expansion of Andersen Air Force Base and Naval Base Guam to accommodate those Marines from Okinawa. And this strikes terror in the hearts of Pentagon planners. <br />
In World War II, the United States employed an island-hopping strategy to move ever closer to the Japanese mainland. Okinawa was the last island and last major battle of that campaign, and more people died during the fighting there than in the subsequent atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined: 12,000 US troops, more than 100,000 Japanese soldiers, and perhaps 100,000 Okinawan civilians. This historical experience has stiffened the pacifist resolve of Okinawans. <br />
The current battle over Okinawa again pits the United States against Japan, again with the Okinawans as victims. But there is a good chance that the Okinawans, like the Na'vi in that great NIMBY film Avatar, will win this time. <br />
A victory in closing Futenma and preventing the construction of a new base might be the first step in a potential reverse island hop. NIMBY movements may someday finally push the US military out of Japan and off Okinawa. It's not likely to be a smooth process, nor is it likely to happen any time soon. But the kanji (a form of Japanese writing) is on the wall. Even if the Yankees don't know what the Japanese characters mean, they can at least tell in which direction the exit arrow is pointing. <br />

<strong>US China Relations are resilient—military dialogue is high now to prevent miscalculation</strong><br />

<br />
Senior U.S. officials concluded a three-day visit to Beijing on Wednesday with both sides declaring that the talks have helped to steady the recently rocky U.S.-China relationship. <br />
Among the most tangible outcomes of this week's talks are signs that exchanges between the two countries' militaries may resume in coming months. China suspended most military exchanges at the beginning of this year after the United States sold arms to Taiwan. <br />
Both sides issued statements Wednesday that indicate a thaw in the chilly silence leading up to President Hu Jintao's planned visit to Washington at the beginning of next year. <br />
Xu Caihou, vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission, met with deputy national security adviser Thomas E. Donilon on Wednesday and said that China values its military relations with the United States and that he hopes to keep dialogue open and improve exchanges with the U.S. military. <br />
On the U.S. side, National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer said in a statement, &quot;The United States seeks to expand cooperation in the many areas where our countries' interests coincide while we will speak frankly and with respect when we disagree.&quot; <br />
Quoting an unidentified Chinese diplomat, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post said that officials on both sides have finalized an agreement to work toward restoring military exchanges ahead of Hu's planned visit to Washington in January. <br />
The U.S. delegation also met with Hu on Wednesday, the final day of the talks. While reporters were in the room, Hu told the U.S. officials: &quot;I've heard your discussions have gone well. I'm sure that this visit will certainly enhance mutual communication and mutual trust.&quot; <br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"> Meanwhile, America’s capacity to maintain its regional position is starting to erode. The global financial crisis of 2008 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have served to drive home the point that US wealth is not inexhaustible, and its military power has limits. US policy makers and the public are increasingly concerned about a spiraling national debt that could exceed 100 percent of GDP by 2020 and its effects on American standards of living. The US political climate is defined by anxiety over lackluster economic growth at home and apathy towards ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that have likely sapped enthusiasm for major overseas initiatives; at the same time, a coming budget crunch will likely have a negative impact on the ability of the US to maintain its massive overseas military presence. A prominent debt review commission has recommended significant cuts to the Defense Department budget.1 Because the US has for so long defined its role in Asia as an external balancer and security guarantor (and taken on substantial costs for doing so in Japan and South Korea), reductions in America’s military presence would constitute a major power shift both in perception and in fact.</span></span><br />
