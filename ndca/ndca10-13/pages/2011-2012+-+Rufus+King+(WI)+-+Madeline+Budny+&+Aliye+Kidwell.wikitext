Contention One is The Status Quo
1. NASA is lacking funding for asteroid detection and can only identify 1/3 of possible threats.

Roeten 10 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">~~[Kevin, Conservative Columnist, Nolan ~’Chart, "Asteroid coming to a location close to you," February 14, 2010, SM, Accessed: 7/11/11, [[</span><span style="color: blue; font-size: 8pt;">http://www.nolanchart.com/article7376_Asteroid_Coming_to_a_Location_Too_Close_to_You.html-http:www.nolanchart.com/article7376_Asteroid_Coming_to_a_Location_Too_Close_to_You.html]]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">~~]</span>
The writer had been under the perception an asteroid collision with the earth was an
AND
only 1/3 of the asteroids that could be threats to earth.

2. No nation has a space-based observatory and projects in development fail – WISE ineffective

National Academy of Science, 10. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(National Academy of Science is comprised of the top scientists based on their individual work and achievements, no date, 2010, "Defending Planet Earth: Near-Earth-Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation Strategies," pdf document, CALLAHAN)</span>

No nation has had or currently operates a space-based observatory dedicated to the
AND
detect fainter or smaller objects than those detected by ground-based telescopes.

Thus the plan: The United States Federal Government should deploy a space-based, infrared telescope, having an aperture of 50 centimeters, operating on a Venus-like orbit for the detection of Near Earth Objects.

Contention Two is Hegemony

1. Hegemony on the brink
Ferguson 10<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Niell, Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University, Complexity and Collapse: Empires on the Edge of Chaos, Foreign Affairs March/April 2010, http://www.signallake.com/innovation/FergusonMar10.pdf , KR)</span>
If empires are complex systems that sooner or later succumb to sudden and catastrophic malfunctions
AND
is in big trouble when its component parts lose faith in its viability.

2. US decline causes Anarchy and War
Kromah 9 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Lamii, International Relations Department, University of the Whitwatersrand, The Institutional Nature of U.S. Hegemony: Post 9/11, 6/3/09, http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/7301/MARR%2009.pdf?sequence=1, KR)</span>
Especially after the cold war America can be described as trying to keep its position
AND
. It would be ~’apolarity~’ –a global vacuum of power.53

3. Strong US power projection is a critical check on the escalation of conflict
Kagan 2011 The Price of Power The benefits of U.S. defense spending far outweigh the costs Jan 24, 2011, Vol. 16, No. 18 • By ROBERT KAGAN Robert Kagan is a contributing editor to The Weekly Standard and a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.
Today the international situation is also one of high risk. • The terrorists who
AND
leg out from under a table and the table will not fall over.

4. US Leadership on Planetary Defense is Key to Hegemony

This is why any planning effort that leans to heavily on international institutions may endanger
AND
"global governance" could end up setting the stage for a disaster.

5. Now is key — China and Russia are looking to outpace the US
Wolf<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> US Representative and Ranking Member – House Appropriations Committee </span>2010<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Frank, "Don~’t Forsake US Leadership in Space", Space News, 4-25, http://spacenews.com/commentaries/100425-dont-forsake-leadership-space.html</span>
Space exploration has been the guiding star of American innovation. The Mercury, Gemini
AND
. Our international competitors are not slowing down, and neither should we.


Contention Three is Asteroid Collision

1. An asteroid strike is inevitable and will cause extinction – detection systems are key – the government has an obligation to protect its people from a collision
Roach, 03. (John is a contributor to National Geographic News and a member of the National Association of Science Writers, the Northwestern Science Writer~’s Association, and the Society of Environmental Journalists, June 19, 2003, "Killer Asteroids: A Real but Remote Risk?" <span style="font-size: 8pt;">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/06/0619_030619_killerasteroids.html)</span>
It is almost certain that Earth will be hit by an asteroid large enough to
AND
split there~’s less stew for the rest of the astronomical/scientific community."

2. A collision from a large asteroid makes the globe uninhabitable – economies will collapse, anarchy will ensue, rocks will rain from the sky, gravitational tidal waves will kill billions – any survivors will be killed by the runaway global warming that will follow
Paine, 99
(Michael, writer for the Planetary Society,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> "</span>How an Asteroid Impact Causes Extinction" Space.com, 5/11/99, [[<span style="color: blue; font-size: 8pt;">http://idisk.mac.com/mpaineau-Public/rocks_from_space/asteroid_extinction.pdf-http:</span>idisk.mac.com/mpaineau-Public/rocks_from_space/asteroid_extinction.pdf]]<span style="font-size: 8pt;">) ~~[JHegyi14~~]</span>
NASA scientists announce they have detected a 10-mile-wide asteroid on a
AND
impacts and climatic effects suggest that this devastating sequence of events could happen.

3. NEOs have caused minor extinctions before, a larger asteroid would cause total extinction. Confirmed risk in 2036.
Easterbrook 2008
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">(Gregg, contributing editor of The Atlantic and The New Republic, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, and the author, most recently, of The Progress Paradox (2003), June 2008, "The Sky Is Falling", The Atlantic, [[</span>http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/06/the-sky-is-falling/6807/-http:www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/06/the-sky-is-falling/6807/]], <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">DA: 27 December 2011, mjb)</span>
There~’s still more bad news. Earth has experienced several mass extinctions—the dinosaurs
AND
the geologist Walter Alvarez on his path-breaking theory about the dinosaurs~’ demise

4. Policymakers have a responsibility to utilize the precautionary principle when making a decision about asteroid policy – one must err on the size of magnitude even if the probability is proven small – default to worst-case predictions
Seamone 04 (Evan R., J.D., University of Iowa College of
AND

The precautionary principle governs responses to unknown types of harm. In many international agreements
AND
prompt action and not merely proclamations of good will that have little force.

5. Prefer our impacts – an intervening actor cannot prevent a natural disaster that goes undetected – their impacts of nuclear war and terrorism always have an inherent check of an intervening actor
Seamone 03<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Evan R., J.D., University of Iowa College of Law; M.P.P. and B.A., University of California, Los Angeles. Evan Seamone is an attorney and a Judge Advocate in the U.S. Army stationed at Fort Polk, Louisiana, "The Duty to ~’Expect the Unexpected~’: Mitigating Extreme Natural Threats to the Global Commons Such as Asteroid and Comet Impacts with the Earth," Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, 2003, Lexis ~~[Iuliano~~]</span>
This Article addresses "extreme" n7 natural threats that endanger multiple countries simultaneously,
AND
and international law, historical precedents, and various aspects of risk analysis.


6. Err affirmative – one should always be skeptical of optimistic reports that downplay the probability of a massive impact – you should err that their optimism is naïve and overstated
Ord et al, 10.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Toby Ord and Anders Sandberg are with the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, and Rafaela Hillerbrand is with the Human Technology Center at RWTH Aachen University, March 2010, "Probing the Improbable: Methodological Challenges for Risks with Low Probabilities and High Stakes," [[</span>http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0810/0810.5515.pdf-http:arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0810/0810.5515.pdf]]<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, CALLAHAN)</span>
Suppose you read a report which examines a potentially catastrophic risk and concludes that the
AND
field would thus provide a lower bound for the rate of serious flaws.


7. Timeframe calculations are unethical — We have a moral obligation to prevent extinction no matter when it happens.
Matheny 7
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">(Jason G., "Reducing the Risk of Human Extinction", Risk Analysis Volume 27 Number 5, Center for Biosecurity of UPMC, [[</span>http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/resources/publications/2007/2007-10-15-reducingrisk.html-http:www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/resources/publications/2007/2007-10-15-reducingrisk.html]]<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">, DA: 8 January 2012, mjb)</span>
An extinction event today could cause the loss of thousands of generations. This matters
AND
,000 years hence than it does to a person 10 years hence.


Contention Four is Long-Period Comets

Long-Period Comets will be seen with no time for deflection, deliberation, or preparation.

Gerrard 2K <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Michael B., Risk Analysis Vol. 20 No.6, 2000, Risks of Hazardous Waste Sites versus Asteroid and Comet Impacts: Accounting for the Discrepancies in U.S. Resource Allocation, ~~[insert URL~~], DA: 20 February 2012, mjb)</span>

A qualitatively different problem is posed by long-period comets—those with almost
AND
that one will land here in the next several centuries are exceedingly remote.

Long-Period Comets are they~’re likely, evade current defenses, and risk extinction
IAA 9<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (International Academy of Astronautics, "Dealing With The Threat To Earth From Asteroids And Comets", http://iaaweb.org/iaa/Scientific%20Activity/Study%20Groups/SG%20Commission%203/sg35/sg35finalreport.pdf)</span>
Detection of Long-Period Comets Long-period comets (LPCs) tend to
AND
deflecting, disrupting, or mitigating the effects before one impacts the Earth.


Contention Five is Solvency

1. Plan~’s design key – Detects 90% of NEOs in 7 years – key internal link to mitigation

Arentza et al 2010<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> NEO Survey: An Efficient Search for Near-Earth Objects by an IR Observatory in a Venus-like Orbit Robert Arentza, Harold Reitsemaa, Jeffrey Van Cleveb and Roger Linfielda a Ball Aerospace %26 Technologies Corp. 1600 Commerce St. Boulder, CO 80301 303-939-6140; rarentz@ball.com; hreitsema@aol.com; [[mailto:rlinfiel@ball.com|rlinfiel@ball.com]] b SETI Institute NASA Ames Research Center NS 244-30, Room 107G Moffett Field, CA 94035 650-604-1370 Space, Propulsion %26 Energy Sciences International Forum</span>

The key to mitigation is discovery. And the fastest possible method for finding NEOs
AND
outcome will yield a very large data set about NEOs for future work.


2. Space-based telescopes key to solve long-period comets
IAA 9<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (International Academy of Astronautics, "Dealing With The Threat To Earth From Asteroids And Comets", http://iaaweb.org/iaa/Scientific%20Activity/Study%20Groups/SG%20Commission%203/sg35/sg35finalreport.pdf)</span>

5) Impact prediction and warning The Palermo Scale was developed in order for the
AND
Comets would be possible if a large space-based telescope is developed.

3. Deflection technology exists now but early detection is key in every scenario

Stone 08 (Richard, Asia News Editor of Science, the international weekly magazine, "The State of Our Planet~’s Defense," Science, vol. 319, no. 5868, p. 1329, 3/7/08, [[<span style="font-size: 8pt;">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5868/1329-http:</span>www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5868/1329]], mjb)

Experts can~’t say exactly when the next Earth-bound asteroid will heave into view
AND
time is only days, I really don~’t know what we would do."

4. Deflection tech exists – All methods besides the nuclear option require decades of lead time

Watson 10 (Traci, National Geographic News, 13 October 2010, "Bombing Earth-bound Asteroids a Viable Option, Experts Say", [[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101013-science-space-asteroids-near-earth-nuclear-bombs/-http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101013-science-space-asteroids-near-earth-nuclear-bombs/]], DA: 3 March 2012, mjb)

Space Rock Science "Still Taking Baby Steps" Aside from total annihilation, several
AND
he added. "We~’re still taking baby steps in this whole field."

5. Nuclear deflection either fails or causes space militarization

O~’Neill 2008 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(IAN O~’NEIL, O~’Neill is a British solar physics doctor with nearly a decade of physics study and research experience, November 27th, 2008, " Apollo Astronaut Highlights Threat of Asteroid Impact", Astroengine.com, accessed 6/22/11, [[http://www.astroengine.com/2008/11/apollo-astronaut-highlights-threat-of-asteroid-strike/-http://www.astroengine.com/2008/11/apollo-astronaut-highlights-threat-of-asteroid-strike/]], JK)</span>

Unfortunately, the commonly held opinion is to dispense an incoming asteroid or comet with
AND
), and we will need to work on novel deflection techniques.

Contention One is The Status Quo
1. NASA is lacking funding for asteroid detection and can only identify 1/3 of possible threats.

Roeten 10 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">~~[Kevin, Conservative Columnist, Nolan ~’Chart, "Asteroid coming to a location close to you," February 14, 2010, SM, Accessed: 7/11/11, [[</span><span style="color: blue; font-size: 8pt;">http://www.nolanchart.com/article7376_Asteroid_Coming_to_a_Location_Too_Close_to_You.html-http:www.nolanchart.com/article7376_Asteroid_Coming_to_a_Location_Too_Close_to_You.html]]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">~~]</span>

Contention Three is Asteroid Collision

1. An asteroid strike is inevitable and will cause extinction – detection systems are key – the government has an obligation to protect its people from a collision
Roach, 03. (John is a contributor to National Geographic News and a member of the National Association of Science Writers, the Northwestern Science Writer~’s Association, and the Society of Environmental Journalists, June 19, 2003, "Killer Asteroids: A Real but Remote Risk?" <span style="font-size: 8pt;">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/06/0619_030619_killerasteroids.html)</span>
It is almost certain that Earth will be hit by an asteroid large enough to
AND
split there~’s less stew for the rest of the astronomical/scientific community."






2. A collision from a large asteroid makes the globe uninhabitable – economies will collapse, anarchy will ensue, rocks will rain from the sky, gravitational tidal waves will kill billions – any survivors will be killed by the runaway global warming that will follow
Paine, 99
(Michael, writer for the Planetary Society,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> "</span>How an Asteroid Impact Causes Extinction" Space.com, 5/11/99, [[<span style="color: blue; font-size: 8pt;">http://idisk.mac.com/mpaineau-Public/rocks_from_space/asteroid_extinction.pdf-http:</span>idisk.mac.com/mpaineau-Public/rocks_from_space/asteroid_extinction.pdf]]<span style="font-size: 8pt;">) ~~[JHegyi14~~]</span>
NASA scientists announce they have detected a 10-mile-wide asteroid on a
AND
impacts and climatic effects suggest that this devastating sequence of events could happen.

3. NEOs have caused minor extinctions before, a larger asteroid would cause total extinction. Confirmed risk in 2036.

4. Policymakers have a responsibility to utilize the precautionary principle when making a decision about asteroid policy – one must err on the size of magnitude even if the probability is proven small – default to worst-case predictions

The precautionary principle governs responses to unknown types of harm. In many international agreements
AND
prompt action and not merely proclamations of good will that have little force.

5. Prefer our impacts – an intervening actor cannot prevent a natural disaster that goes undetected – their impacts of nuclear war and terrorism always have an inherent check of an intervening actor
Seamone 03<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Evan R., J.D., University of Iowa College of Law; M.P.P. and B.A., University of California, Los Angeles.

This Article addresses "extreme" n7 natural threats that endanger multiple countries simultaneously,
AND
and international law, historical precedents, and various aspects of risk analysis.


6. Err affirmative – one should always be skeptical of optimistic reports that downplay the probability of a massive impact – you should err that their optimism is naïve and overstated
Ord et al, 10.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Toby Ord and Anders Sandberg are with the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, and Rafaela Hillerbrand is with the Human Technology Center at RWTH Aachen University, March 2010, "Probing the Improbable: Methodological Challenges for Risks with Low Probabilities and High Stakes," [[</span>http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0810/0810.5515.pdf-http:arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0810/0810.5515.pdf]]<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, CALLAHAN)</span>
Suppose you read a report which examines a potentially catastrophic risk and concludes that the
AND
field would thus provide a lower bound for the rate of serious flaws.


7. Timeframe calculations are unethical — We have a moral obligation to prevent extinction no matter when it happens.

Contention Four is Long-Period Comets

Long-Period Comets will be seen with no time for deflection, deliberation, or preparation.

deflecting, disrupting, or mitigating the effects before one impacts the Earth.


Contention Five is Solvency

1. Plan~’s design key – Detects 90% of NEOs in 7 years – key internal link to mitigation

outcome will yield a very large data set about NEOs for future work.


2. Space-based telescopes key to solve long-period comets

5) Impact prediction and warning The Palermo Scale was developed in order for the
AND
Comets would be possible if a large space-based telescope is developed.

3. Deflection technology exists now but early detection is key in every scenario

Stone 08 (Richard, Asia News Editor of Science, the international weekly magazine, "The State of Our Planet~’s Defense," Science, vol. 319, no. 5868, p. 1329, 3/7/08, [[<span style="font-size: 8pt;">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5868/1329-http:</span>www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5868/1329]], mjb)

Experts can~’t say exactly when the next Earth-bound asteroid will heave into view
AND
time is only days, I really don~’t know what we would do."



4. Deflection tech exists – All methods besides the nuclear option require decades of lead time

Watson 10 (Traci, National Geographic News, 13 October 2010, "Bombing Earth-bound Asteroids a Viable Option, Experts Say", [[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101013-science-space-asteroids-near-earth-nuclear-bombs/-http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101013-science-space-asteroids-near-earth-nuclear-bombs/]], DA: 3 March 2012, mjb)

5. Nuclear deflection either fails or causes space militarization
