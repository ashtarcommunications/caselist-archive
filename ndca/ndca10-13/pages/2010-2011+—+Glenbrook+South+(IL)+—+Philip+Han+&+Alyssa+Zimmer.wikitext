3). The 1ac’s denoting Okinawa as a prefecture and conflating Okinawan-Japanese identities are the two reasons we ignore the historical violence committed against Okinawa.

===PREFECTURE PIC - 2NC (CR WASH)=== 
**ROOT CAUSE:**
The Affirmative’s logic of a dual identity for Okinawans – seeking heterogeneity and homogeneity with the Japanese sovereign – is the root cause of the harms. This floating subset of an identity will always get sacrificed for the good of the center.
