We need persistent staring RSTA systems that are as well tailored to cities as our current RSTA systems are to the traditional battlefield. If you are on an open plain you can see what is going on miles away, but in a city, you may not know what's going on a block away. We have to change that.<br />
We need a network, or web, of sensors to better map a city and the activities in it, including inside buildings, to sort adversaries and their equipment from civilians and their equipment, including in crowds, and to spot snipers, suicide bombers, or IEDs (improvised explosive devices). We need to watch a great variety of things, activities, and people over a wide area and have great resolution available when we need it. And this is not just a matter of more and better sensors, but just as important, the systems needed to make actionable intelligence out of all the data. Closely related to this are tagging, tracking, and locating (TT&amp;L) systems that help us watch and track a particular person or object of interest. These systems will also help us detect the clandestine production or possession of weapon of mass destruction in overseas urban areas. There was a recent incident in Iraq where one of our UAVs spotted some insurgents firing a mortar. Then the insurgents climbed back into their car and drove away. The good news was that the UAV was able to track the car so U.S. helicopters could go after it and destroy it. The bad news was that, at one point, some of the passengers got out. Then we had to decide whether to follow those individuals or the car because we simply did not have enough coverage available. If we'd had other sensors available, we would have had a better chance of getting all of those insurgents.<br />
If we could quickly track-back where a vehicle came from, it would greatly help us deal with suicide car bombers. It is difficult, if not impossible, to deter the bombers themselves, just as you cannot deter a missile that has already been launched. But, one key to deterrence that has been missing is reliable attribution, or a &quot;return address.&quot; If we knew where the car came from, using for example RSTA systems that allowed us to quickly trace the car carrying the explosives back to the house or shop it came from, we could then attack that place and those people.<br />
Once people realize that whoever helps launch a suicide attack will themselves be targeted (and since it's unlikely that everyone in a suicide bombing organization has a suicide wish) we would start to deter attacks. At a minimum, we would destroy more of the people and infrastructure behind the attacks, and make subsequent attacks more difficult. We are pursuing this sort of capability with our Combat Zones That See program.<br />

<strong>Combat zones that see solves Iraqi stability</strong><br />
<strong>Aerospace Daily 10-23-03</strong><br />
Although not ready for fielding, DARPA's Combat Zones that See (CTS) technology would be ideal for countering unrest in Iraq, according to Tether. The CTS system would collect and process video data from hundreds of inexpensive cameras distributed throughout an area of concern.<br />
&quot;The technology was to bring that data back to a computer system, and have that computer system basically make a log, and be able to say, here's a vehicle that was in this camera [view], and it passed to another camera system,&quot; Tether said. &quot;I'll tell you, if we had it in Baghdad today, we'd probably have fewer bombings. Why? Because the car that came up and blew up - we couldn't stop that, but [CTS] could track it back to where it came from.&quot;<br />

<span class="Heading4Char1">What makes the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">escalating civil war in Iraq</span> so disturbing is that it <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">has the potential to spill over into neighboring countries</span>.</span> <span class="Heading5Char">The Iranian government is already taking more than a casual interest in the politics of post-Saddam Iraq. And yet Iran, with its Sunni and Kurdish minorities, is no more homogeneous than Iraq. Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Syria cannot be expected to look on insouciantly if the Sunni minority in central Iraq begins to lose out to what may seem to be an Iranian-backed tyranny of the majority. The recent history of Lebanon offers a reminder that in the Middle East there is no such thing as a contained civil war.

Although such an outcome may seem to be a low-probability, nightmare scenario, it is already more likely than the scenario of enduring peace in the region. If the history of the twentieth century is any guide, only economic stabilization and a credible reassertion of U.S. authority are likely to halt the drift toward chaos. Neither is a likely prospect. On the contrary, the speed with which responsibility for security in Iraq is being handed over to the predominantly Shiite and Kurdish security forces may accelerate the descent into internecine strife. Significantly, the audio statement released by Osama bin Laden in June excoriated not only the American-led &quot;occupiers&quot; of Iraq but also &quot;certain sectors of the Iraqi people -- those who refused [neutrality] and stood to fight on the side of the crusaders.&quot; His allusions to &quot;rejectionists,&quot; &quot;traitors,&quot; and &quot;agents of the Americans&quot; were clearly intended to justify al Qaeda's policy of targeting Iraq's Shiites.

<strong>Aggressive military action against terrorists and their sponsors is the only way to end their jihad against the west - embrace of nonviolence makes future attacks inevitable.</strong><br />
<strong>Mcinerney and vallely, 2k4-</strong> (Thomas and Paul, Lt. General USAF (Retired) and Maj. General US Army (Retired), both analysts for Fox News, Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror, p. 167-8)<br />
<br />
After the axis powers declared war on the United States in December 1941, the United States did not limit its response to fortifying the Hawaiian Islands, increasing antisubmarine patrols along the Atlantic Coast, and upgrading the efforts of the FBI to crack rings of domestic Axis sympathizers and capture saboteurs. Osama bin Laden has openly and repeatedly declared war on the United States. The radical Islamists see themselves in jihad against the West, and they see the United States as the leading “Crusader” power. They see moderate Muslims who wish live in peace as traitors. Backed by state sponsors of terror like Iran they have become a global threat just as much as the National Socialists were. Though militarily puny their dreams and their potential danger are grandiose: inflaming a billion Muslims worldwide and creating a radical Islamist empire. To that end they will cooperate with rogue states like North Korea. They will do everything they can to acquire weapons of mass destruction. The bottom line is that they must be stopped. End their state sponsorship, and they wither. Buttress the forces of moderate Islam, encourage freedom and tolerance in Islamic societies grant Muslims in Iraq and Iran the opportunity to vote against tyranny and the mullahs, then the radicals do more than wither, they disappear to the fringes of Muslim society. If we are to stop the spread of radical Islam we cannot be satisfied with the conviction of a failed terrorist bomber, dismantling a terrorist cell, or freezing the bank account of a terrorist front – however necessary all these things are. To rely purely on defensive measures cedes the initiative to the radical Islamists. Instead, we need to take the battle to them. The counteroffensives in Afghanistan and Iraq were first steps to the endgame, they are not the endgame itself. The endgame is taking down the Web of Terror entirely so that the global terror threat dissolves. We have laid out the broad parameters of an active strategy for this war. Despite the best wishes of some, the Web of Terror cannot be talked to death, no “peace process” will work, no foreign aid will suffice unless the countries involved make a commitment – as Libya has apparently done – to forgo jihad, forgo terrorism, forgo weapons of mass destruction. Countries that will not do this willingly must be compelled to do it. Terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are not something we have to live with; they are something that the rogue states of the Web of Terror have to live without.<br />

<strong>Terrorists have religious motivations that make discourse and compromise meaningless. The only way to win the war we are in is to kill them before they kill us.</strong><br />
<strong>Peters, 2k4 -</strong> (Ralph, Retired Army Officer, “In Praise of Attrition,” <em>Parameters</em>, Summer)<br />
<br />
Trust me. We don’t need discourses. We need plain talk, honest answers, and the will to close with the enemy and kill him. And to keep on killing him until it is unmistakably clear to the entire world who won. When military officers start speaking in academic gobbledygook, it means they have nothing to contribute to the effectiveness of our forces. They badly need an assignment to Fallujah. Consider our enemies in the War on Terror. Men who believe, literally, that they are on a mission from God to destroy your civilization and who regard death as a promotion are not impressed by elegant maneuvers. You must find them, no matter how long it takes, then kill them. If they surrender, you must accord them their rights under the laws of war and international conventions. But, as we have learned so painfully from all the mindless, left-wing nonsense spouted about the prisoners at Guantanamo, you are much better off killing them before they have a chance to surrender. We have heard no end of blather about network-centric warfare, to the great profit of defense contractors. If you want to see a superb—and cheap—example of “net-war,” look at al Qaeda. The mere possession of technology does not ensure that it will be used effectively. And effectiveness is what matters. It isn’t a question of whether or not we want to fight a war of attrition against religion-fueled terrorists. We’re in a war of attrition with them. We have no realistic choice. Indeed, our enemies are, in some respects, better suited to both global and local wars of maneuver than we are. They have a world in which to hide, and the world is full of targets for them. They do not heed laws or boundaries. They make and observe no treaties. They do not expect the approval of the United Nations Security Council. They do not face election cycles. And their weapons are largely provided by our own societies. We have the technical capabilities to deploy globally, but, for now, we are forced to watch as Pakistani forces fumble efforts to surround and destroy concentrations of terrorists; we cannot enter any country (except, temporarily, Iraq) without the permission of its government. We have many tools—military, diplomatic, economic, cultural, law enforcement, and so on—but we have less freedom of maneuver than our enemies. But we do have superior killing power, once our enemies have been located. Ultimately, the key advantage of a superpower is superpower. Faced with implacable enemies who would kill every man, woman, and child in our country and call the killing good (the ultimate war of attrition), we must be willing to use that power wisely, but remorselessly. We are, militarily and nationally, in a transition phase. Even after 9/11, we do not fully appreciate the cruelty and determination of our enemies. We will learn our lesson, painfully, because the terrorists will not quit. The only solution is to kill them and keep on killing them: a war of attrition. But a war of attrition fought on our terms, not theirs. Of course, we shall hear no end of fatuous arguments to the effect that we can’t kill our way out of the problem. Well, until a better methodology is discovered, killing every terrorist we can find is a good interim solution. The truth is that even if you can’t kill yourself out of the problem, you can make the problem a great deal smaller by effective targeting. And we shall hear that killing terrorists only creates more terrorists. This is sophomoric nonsense. The surest way to swell the ranks of terror is to follow the approach we did in the decade before 9/11 and do nothing of substance. Success breeds success. Everybody loves a winner. The clichés exist because they’re true. Al Qaeda and related terrorist groups metastasized because they were viewed in the Muslim world as standing up to the West successfully and handing the Great Satan America embarrassing defeats with impunity. Some fanatics will flock to the standard of terror, no matter what we do. But it’s far easier for Islamic societies to purge themselves of terrorists if the terrorists are on the losing end of the global struggle than if they’re allowed to become triumphant heroes to every jobless, unstable teenager in the Middle East and beyond. Far worse than fighting such a war of attrition aggressively is to pretend you’re not in one while your enemy keeps on killing you. Even the occupation of Iraq is a war of attrition. We’re doing remarkably well, given the restrictions under which our forces operate. But no grand maneuvers, no gestures of humanity, no offers of conciliation, and no compromises will persuade the terrorists to halt their efforts to disrupt the development of a democratic, rule-of-law Iraq. On the contrary, anything less than relentless pursuit, with both preemptive and retaliatory action, only encourages the terrorists and remaining Baathist gangsters.<br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The risk of bioterrorsim is high and increasing exponentially – new technology gives it great potential - a successful attack risks extinction </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A looming danger confronts the world—the threat of bioviolence. It is a danger that will only grow in the future, yet we are increasingly failing to confront it. With every passing day, committing a biocatastrophe becomes a bit easier, and this condition will perpetuate for as long as science progresses. Biological warfare is as old as conflict, of course, but in terms of the objectives of traditional warfare— gaining territory or resources, compelling the surrender of an opposing army—biological weapons weren’t very effective. If the objective is to inflict mass death and panic on a mixed population, however, emerging bioweapons offer remarkable potential. We would be irresponsible to presume that radical jihadists like al- Qaeda have ignored said potential. What’s New in Bioviolence? Bioviolence refers to the many ways to inflict disease as well as the many people who might choose to do so, whether heads of states, criminals, or fanatics. Fortunately, doing bioviolence is technically far more difficult than using conventional explosives. Natural pathogens like anthrax are difficult to weaponize. Smallpox remains unavailable (presumably); plague is readily treatable; Ebola kills too quickly to ignite a pandemic. But emerging scientific disciplines— notably genomics, nanotechnology, and other microsciences— could alter these pathogens for use as weapons. These scientific disciplines offer profound benefits for humanity, yet there is an ominous security challenge in minimizing the danger of their hostile application. For example, highly dangerous agents can be made resistant to vaccines or antibiotics. In Australia, scientists introduced a gene into mousepox (a cousin of smallpox) to reduce pest populations—it worked so well that it wiped out 100% of affected mice, even those that had immunity against the disease. Various bacterial agents, such as plague or tularemia (rabbit fever), could be altered to increase their lethality or to evade antibiotic treatment. Diseases once thought to be eradicated can now be resynthesized, en- abling them to spread in regions where there is no natural immunity. The polio virus has been synthesized from scratch; its creators called it an “animate chemical.” Soon, it may be resynthesized into a form that is contagious even among vaccinated populations. Recreation of long-eradicated livestock diseases could ravage herds severely lacking in genetic diversity, damage food supplies, and cause devastating economic losses. Perhaps the greatest biothreat is the manipulation of the flu and other highly contagious viruses, such as Ebola. Today, scientists can change parts of a virus’s genetic material so that it can perform specific functions. The genomic sequence of the Spanish flu virus that killed upwards of 40 million people nearly a century ago has been widely published; any savvy scientist could reconstruct it. The avian flu is even more lethal, albeit not readily contagious via casual aerosol delivery. A malevolent bioscientist might augment its contagiousness. The Ebola virus might be manipulated so that it kills more slowly, allowing it to be spread farther before its debilitating effects altogether consume its carrier. A bit further off is genetic manipulation of the measles virus—one of the great killers in human history—rendering useless the immunizations that most of us receive in early childhood. Soon, laboratory resynthesis of smallpox may be possible. Advanced drug delivery systems can be used to disseminate lethal agents to broad populations. Bioregulators— small organic compounds that modify body systems— could enhance targeted delivery technologies. Some experts are concerned that new weapons could be aimed at the immune, neurological, and neuroendocrine systems. Nanotechnology that lends itself to mechanisms for advanced disease detection and drug delivery—such as gold nanotubes that can administer drugs directly into a tumor—could also deliver weaponized agents deep into the body, substantially raising the weapon’s effectiveness. Altogether, techniques that were on the frontiers of science only a decade or two ago are rapidly mutating as progress in the biological sciences enables new ways to produce lethal catastrophe. Today, they are on the horizon. Within a decade, they will be pedestrian. According to the National Academies of Science, “The threat spectrum is broad and evolving— in some ways predictably, in other ways unexpectedly. In the future, genetic engineering and other technologies may lead to the development of pathogenic organisms with unique, unpredictable characteristics.” For as far into the future as we can possibly see, every passing day it becomes slightly easier to commit a violent catastrophe than it was the day before. Indeed, the rapid pace of advancing science helps explain why policies to prevent such a catastrophe are so complicated. Bioviolence Jihad? Some experts argue that terrorists and fanatics are not interested in bioviolence and that the danger might therefore be overblown. Since there have been no catastrophic bioviolence attacks, these experts argue, terrorists lack the intention to make bioweapons. Hopefully, they are correct. But an enormous amount of evidence suggests they are wrong. From the dawn of biology’s ability to isolate pathogens, people have pursued hostile applications of biological agents. It is perilous to ignore this extensive history by presuming that today’s villains are not fervent about weaponizing disease. Not a single state admits to having a bioweapons program, but U.S. intelligence officials assert that as many as 10 states might have active programs, including North Korea, Iran, and Syria. Moreover, many terrorist organizations have expressed interest in acquiring biological weapons. Whatever weight the taboo against inflicting disease might have for nation-states, it is obviously irrelevant to terrorists, criminals, and lunatics. Deterrence by threat of retaliation is essentially meaningless for groups with suicidal inclinations who are likely to intermingle with innocent civilians. Al-Qaeda and affiliated Islamic fundamentalist organizations have overtly proclaimed their intention to develop and use bioweapons. The 11th volume of al-Qaeda’s Encyclopedia of Jihad is devoted to chemical and biological weapons. Indeed, al- Qaeda has acknowledged that “biological weapons are considered the least complicated and easiest to manufacture of all weapons of mass destruction.” Al-Qaeda is widely reported to have acquired legal pathogens via publicly available scientific sources.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Before 9/11, al-Qaeda operatives reportedly purchased anthrax and plague from arms dealers in Kazakhstan, and the group has repeatedly urged followers to recruit microbiology and biotechnology experts. Following the Taliban’s fall, five al- Qaeda biological weapons labs in Afghanistan tested positive for anthrax. Documents calculating aerial dispersal methods of anthrax via balloon were discovered in Kabul, along with anthrax spore concentrate at a nearby vaccine laboratory. According to a lengthy fatwa commissioned by Osama bin Laden, jihadists are entitled to use weapons of mass destruction against the infidels, even if it means killing innocent women, children, and Muslims. No matter that these weapons cannot be specifically targeted. “[N]othing is a greater duty, after faith itself, than repelling an enemy attacker who sows corruption to religion and the world.” According to the fatwa, “No conditions limit this: one repels the enemy however one can.” The sentiment might be reprehen- sible, but it is certainly not irrational. Even the most passionate terrorists must realize that conventional attacks are not bringing the West to its knees. The 9/11 strikes, the bombing of the Madrid and London subways, and numerous smaller attacks have all put civilization on edge, but history marches inexorably forward. A few thousand people can be killed, yet Western armies still traverse the world, and Western economies still determine winners and losers. From this perspective, the stakes must be raised. Bioviolence is perhaps the most dire, easiest means to execute existential danger. What Might Bioviolence Accomplish? Envision a series of attacks against capitals of developing states that have close diplomatic linkages with the United States. The attacks would carry a well-publicized yet simple warning: “If you are a friend of the United States, receive its officials, or support its policies, thousands of your people will get sick.” How many attacks in how many cities would it take before international diplomacy, to say nothing of international transit, comes to a crashing halt? In comparison to use of conventional or chemical weapons, the potential death toll of a bioattack could be hugeIn comparison to. Although the number of victims would depend on where an attack takes place, the type of pathogen, and the sophistication of the weapons maker, there is widespread consensus among experts that a heightened attack would inflict casualties exceedable only by nuclear weapons. In comparison to, nuclear weapons, bioweapons are far easier and cheaper to make and transport, and they can be made in facilities that are far more difficult to detect. The truly unique characteristic of certain bioweapons that distinguishes them from every other type of weapon is contagion. No other type of weapon can replicate itself and spread. Any other type of attack, no matter how severe, occurs at a certain moment in time at an identifiable place. If you aren’t there, you are angry and upset but not physically injured by the attack. An attack with a contagious agent can uniquely spread, potentially imperiling target populations far from where the agents are released. A bio-offender could infect his minions with a disease and send them across borders before symptoms are obvious. Carriers will then spread it to other unsuspecting victims who would themselves become extended bioweapons, carrying the disease indiscriminately. There are challenges in executing such an attack, but fanatical terrorist organizations seem to have an endless supply of willing suicide attackers. All this leads to the most important characteristic of bioviolence: It raises incomparable levels of panic. Contagious bioviolence means that planes fly empty or perhaps don’t fly at all. People cancel vacation and internatravel plans and refuse to interact with each other for fear of unseen affliction. Public entertainment events are canceled; even going to a movie becomes too dangerous. Ultimately, bioviolence is about hiding our children as everyone becomes vulnerable to our most fundamental terror: the fear of disease. For people who seek to rattle the pillars of modern civilization and perhaps cause it to collapse, effective use of disease would set in motion political, economic, and health consequences so severe as to call into question the ability of existing governments to maintain their citizens’ security. In an attack’s wake, no one would know when it is over, and no government could credibly tell an anxious population where and when it is safe to resume normal life. While it is difficult to specify when this danger will strike, there should be no doubt that we are vulnerable to a rupture. Just as planes flying into the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, instantly became a historical marker dividing strategic perspectives before from after, the day that disease is effectively used as an instrument of hate will profoundly change everything. If you want to stop modern civilization in its tracks, bioviolence is the way to go. The notion that no one will ever commit catastrophic bioviolence is simply untenable.</span><br />

The worst of it is that <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">government would not have to impose tyranny on a cowed populace. We would demand it for our own protection. And if the institutions of our democracy were unable to protect us from our enemies, we might go even further, taking the law into our own hands. We have a history of lynching in this country</span></span>, and by the time fear and paranoia settled deep in our bones, we might repeat the worst episodes from our past, killing our former neighbors, our onetime friends. <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">That is what defeat in a war on terror looks like. We would survive, but we would no longer recognize ourselves</span></span>. We would endure, but we would lose our identity as free peoples. Alarmist? Consider where we stand after two years of a war on terror. We are told that Al Qaeda's top leadership has been decimated by detention and assassination. True enough, but as recently as last month bin Laden was still sending the Europeans quaint invitations to surrender. Even if Al Qaeda no longer has command and control of its terrorist network, that may not hinder its cause. After 9/11, Islamic terrorism may have metastasized into a cancer of independent terrorist cells that, while claiming inspiration from Al Qaeda, no longer require its direction, finance or advice. These cells have given us Madrid. Before that, they gave us Istanbul, and before that, Bali. There is no shortage of safe places in which they can grow. <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Where terrorists need covert support, there are Muslim communities, in the diasporas of Europe and North America, that will turn a blind eye to their presence. If they need raw recruits, the Arab rage that makes for martyrs is still incandescent</span></span>. Palestine is in a state of permanent insurrection. Iraq is in a state of barely subdued civil war. Some of the Bush administration's policies, like telling Ariel Sharon he can keep settlements on the West Bank, may only be fanning the flames. So anyone who says &quot;Relax, more people are killed in road accidents than are killed in terrorist attacks&quot; is playing games. <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The conspiracy theorists who claim the government is manufacturing the threat in order to foist secret government upon us ought to wise up. Anyone who doesn't take seriously a second major attack on the United States just isn't being serious</span></span>. In the Spanish elections in March, we may have had a portent of what's ahead: a terrorist gang trying to intimidate voters into altering the result of a democratic election. We can confidently expect that terrorists will attempt to tamper with our election in November. Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, said in a recent television interview that the Bush administration is concerned that terrorists will see the approaching presidential election as &quot;too good to pass up.&quot; <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Thinking the worst is not defeatist. It is the best way to avoid defeat. Nor is it defeatist to concede that terror can never be entirely vanquished. Terrorists will continue to threaten democratic politics wherever oppressed or marginalized groups believe their cause justifies violence. But we can certainly deny them victory. We can continue to live without fear inside free institutions. To do so</span></span>, however, <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">we need to change the way we think, to step outside the confines of our cozy conservative and liberal boxes</span></span>.<br />

<strong>Our impact is about more than just body counts. Terrorism inflicts a toll on the spirit as well. In a world of terrorism, there can be no value to life.</strong><br />

<br />
What, exactly, does the Palestinian suicide bomber really seek? Above all, he wants to transform Jewish pain into Arab power. In maiming and burning Jewish men, women and children, this terrorist reasons that pain, to be purposeful, must point convincingly toward the victim's death but that even survivors must suffer terribly. In the fashion of the torturer, the Palestinian suicide bomber takes what is usually private and incommunicable--the pain contained within the boundaries of the sufferer's body--and exploits it to affect the behavior of others. Consider the personal horror. During the routine rotation of a radiologist in a busy city hospital, a broad variety of patient problems is seen. But things are now very different in Israeli hospitals. With the wave of suicide bombings, unique and hideous trauma has become a regular part of the Israeli physician's daily practice. X-rays of suicide bombing victims often show hundreds of metallic fragments, ranging in size from millimeters to whole nails, grotesquely embedded in the victims' bodies--literally from head to foot. Like so many others across history's killing fields, Arab terrorists have transformed simple devices created for constructive purposes--in this case, nails--into the deadliest of destructive projectiles. Nails, screws, nuts and ball bearings are packed by the suicide bombers into their explosive vests to maximize lethal effects and to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on innocent Jewish bodies. These maliciously transformed objects are propelled with the force of bullets, penetrating skin, flesh and bone with a furious indifference to civilized human behavior. The nails fly head first, presenting themselves in a strangely surreal yet orderly arrangement within the victims' bodies. Many are embedded shallowly. Others burrow their way in more deeply and lodge under the skin, where the examining physician can actually touch and feel their alien presence. Some take hours of meticulous exploration to remove. Still others violate the body deeper, perforating and lacerating vital organs. CT scans of these victims' heads show blood, air, metal and bone fragments displacing normal brain tissue. The &quot;lucky&quot; patient who survives the initial explosive insult may often require extensive surgery to repair damaged organs. Others may sustain fractures, burns, amputations, vascular injuries, paralysis, blindness or brain damage. A collapsed lung or perforated colon-- ordinarily considered a major injury--is taken as a blessing for such victims of terrorism. Although some of the victims recover physically and return to a &quot;normal&quot; life, many more require a lifetime of rehabilitation. Some are impaired permanently. And all suffer serious psychological harm that needs to be treated. Post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety affect not only the victims of the attack but all of Israeli society. Anecdotal reports have indicated a dramatic rise in the use of prescription antidepressants and sedatives. How could it be otherwise, in a society living under constant attack by those who cry out, &quot;When the martyr dies a martyr's death, he attains the height of bliss ... &quot;? The Palestinian &quot;martyr's&quot; unheroic weapon has now literally and figuratively penetrated the hearts and souls as well as the bodies of an entire nation. Too often, unfortunately, television and print media are unable or unwilling to transmit the full human measure of such penetration to viewers and readers. The result is that too few people around the world are able to understand the true horror of the Palestinian suicide bomber. For them, Israeli &quot;wounded&quot; are little more than an anesthetized statistic, an abstract list of numbers that elicits barely a nodding sigh of concern.<br />

<strong>The willingness to use violence against the evil of terrorism is a moral obligation. The judge must choose between becoming an honorable executioner, or standing by as murderers move to destroy everything that is sacred.</strong><br />
<strong>Beres 05 -</strong> (Louis Rene, Professor of International Law, Department of Political Science, Purdue University. Ph.D., Princeton University, 1977 “Terrorism's Executioner” The Washington Times May 31, 2005L/N)<br />
Our world is &quot;normally&quot; silent in the face of evil. At worst, many are directly complicit in the maimings and slaughters. At best, the murderers are ignored. In this unchanging world Israel must soon decide whether to face the evil of Palestinian terrorism as a pitiable victim or to use whatever reasonable force is needed to remain alive. The use of force is not inherently evil. Quite the contrary; in opposing terrorist mayhem, force is indispensable to all that is good. In the case of Israel, Palestinian terrorism is unique for its cowardice, its barbarism and its genocidal goal. Were Israel to depend upon the broader international community for relief - upon the so-called road map - its plea would be unheard. All states have a right of self-defense. Israel has every lawful authority to forcibly confront the still-growing evil of Palestinian terror. Facing even biological and nuclear forms of terrorism, it now has the clear legal right to refuse to be a victim and to become an executioner. From the standpoint of providing security to its own citizens, this right even becomes an obligation. Albert Camus would have us all be &quot;neither victims nor executioners,&quot; living not in a world in which killing has disappeared (&quot;we are not so crazy as that&quot;), but one wherein killing has become illegitimate. This is a fine expectation, yet the celebrated French philosopher did not anticipate another evil force for whom utter extermination of &quot;the Jews&quot; was its declared object. Not even in a world living under the shadow of recent Holocaust did Camus consider such an absurd possibility. But Israel lacks the quaint luxury of French philosophy. Were Israel to follow Camus' genteel reasoning, perhaps in order to implement Mr. Sharon's disengagement, the result would be another boundless enlargement of Jewish suffering. Before and during the Holocaust, for those who still had an opportunity to flee, Jews were ordered: &quot;Get out of Europe; go to Palestine.&quot; When they complied (those who could), the next order was: &quot;Get out of Palestine.&quot; For my Austrian-Jewish grandparents, their deaths came on the SS- killing grounds at Riga, Latvia. Had they made it to Palestine, their sons and grandsons would likely have died in subsequent genocidal wars intended to get the Jews &quot;out of Palestine.&quot; Failure to use force against murderous evil is invariably a stain upon all that is good. By declining the right to act as a lawful executioner in its struggle with terror, Israel would be forced by Camus' reasoning to embrace its own disappearance. Barring Mr. Sharon's disengagement, the Jewish state would never accept collective suicide. Why was Camus, who was thinking only in the broadest generic terms, so mistaken? My own answer lies in his presumption of a natural reciprocity among human beings and states in the matter of killing. We are asked to believe that as greater numbers of people agree not to become executioners, still greater numbers will follow upon the same course. In time, the argument proceeds, the number of those who refuse to accept killing will become so great that there will be fewer and fewer victims. But Camus' presumed reciprocity does not exist, indeed, can never exist, especially in the jihad-centered Middle East. Here the Islamist will to kill Jews remains unimpressed by Israel's disproportionate contributions to science, industry, medicine and learning. Here there are no Arab plans for a &quot;two- state solution,&quot; only for a final solution. In counterterrorism, Jewish executioners must now have an honored place in the government of Israel. Without them, evil would triumph again and again. For Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and Fatah, murdered Jews are not so much a means to an end as an end in themselves. In this unheroic Arab Islamist world, where killing Jews is both a religious mandate and sometimes also a path to sexual ecstasy and personal immortality, an Israeli unwillingness to use necessary force against terror will invite existential terror. Sadly, killing is sometimes a sacred duty. Faced with manifest evil, all decent civilizations must rely, in the end, on the executioner. To deny the executioner his proper place would enable the murderers to leer lasciviously upon whole mountains of fresh corpses.<br />

<strong>West inevitable: resilient and constantly produces new and better forms of knowledge production to respond to crises</strong><br />
<strong>Kors, ’01</strong> – Prof history @ U Penn (Summer 2001, Alan, American Foreign Relations, “America and the West: Triumph Without Self Belief”, pg. 348-349)<br />
The view that Western civilization has ended has had various incarnations, with the most sensitive souls of many epochs imagining themselves to be the last bearers of the Western torch. One needs perspective in such things. The question, in many ways, was more compelling when Athens fell: when Christian Rome was sacked by barbarians: when the Norsemen ravaged settled Europe when feudal warlords reigned unchecked; when, at the end of the first millennium, all signs indicated a divine disfavor that seemed to presage the end of the world when the Black Death of the fourteenth century left, soul and society without mooring. Indeed, imagine the question posed to Catholic and Protestant apologists of the sixteenth century, viewing each other’s religion as the Antichrist and seeing Western Christendom rent first in two and then into a multitude of competing sects. How fragile, if not spent. The Nest seemed during, the religious civil wars culminating in the devastation of the Thirty Years' War. There were lamentations in profusion during the Terror of the French Revolution and the decades of revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars that followed, and again, with gravitas. There were the inward and outward sermons on the West uttered on the slaughterfields of World War 1, and at Auschwitz, and in the gulag. The West is resilient beyond all seeming possibility, and something gives it that resiliency. The West has survived its barbarians without and—more dreadful yet—its own barbaric offspring within. If it could outlast Attila the Hun and the armed ideologies of the Third Reich and Stalin's Russia, it surely can outlast Jacques Derrida, Stanley Fish, and Michel Foucault. At each moment of seeming dissolution, there were diverse profound voices that compellingly analyzed the depths to which we had fallen: the almost infinite remove we were from any light: the loss of something that we never could recover—and yet the West survived. There was something about its mind and spirit. Greece fell, but its philosophers conquered the minds of the Romans who conquered its soil, and its conceptual categories still organize our understanding of reality and knowledge. Rome fell, but its language became the lingua franca and thus the definitional universe of Christendom, while its history became the great drama by which to understand the glory and the baseness of political life. The barbarian tribes believed that they had conquered Rome, but Rome in greater part had conquered them. Their descendants called their realm the Holy Roman Empire, terms that were not, until much later, bereft of meaning. When the Norsemen came, learning fled to monasteries, and that learning and even those monasteries eventually conquered the Norse, whose Norman descendants in Britain founded universities that live to this day. It is the last thing that any frightened monk taking desperate shelter in the eighth century ever could have imagined. The Thirty Years' War seemed to sensitive and moral observers the end of civilization, but its battles are mostly forgotten, and what is it that remains of the seventeenth century? Bacon, Galileo, Descartes, Hobbes, Pascal, Bayle, Boyle, Fenelon, Harvey, Huyghens, Newton, Locke. Louis XIV is a tourist attraction at Versailles: his wars changed precious little. The conceptual revolution of the West, however, changed a great deal in that same century. It arose from the very dynamics of the West's models of learning-disputation, accounting for appearances, refining inductive and deductive logic-now linked to expanded education and printing. What happened in the minds of the graduates of Europe's Christian universities changed the human relationship to nature, to knowledge, to the rights of inquiry and conscience, and to political and economic life. The Christian West kept the traditions of the Greek mind alive, and thus, through its own debates, it overthrew the presumptive authority of the past in matters of natural knowledge and its application. The West believed that we were not cast fatally adrift in this world, but that we could learn new things and that we could alter the sorry scheme of experience closer to the heart's desire for knowledge, order, and well-being. It was not Faust, who dreamed of occult knowledge that would make him a demigod, but Bacon, who commanded that knowledge proceed from humility and charity, who becarne the prophet of the great scientific revolution of the West. Louis XIV is a statue; Bacon is a living force wherever the West touches m<br />

<strong>“The West” is not a monolith that can be rejected as a whole. The left condemns itself political irrelevancy when they refuse to recognize differences between policies.</strong><br />
<strong>Wolin, 06</strong> (The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism, Richard Wolin, <span style="color: black;">Professor of History and Comparative Literature at the Graduate Center, City University). </span><br />
<br />
With a self defeating Nietzschean glibness, postmodernism has burned its bridges to a traditional rhetoric of moral evaluation. Hence, Baudrillard and Zizek pointedly fad to mention that the West, in addition to being an epicenter of imperialism (conveniently, instances of genocide or conquest that originate outside the West always go unmentioned), is also the birthplace of a moral discourse that has given birth to international law, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the 1948 Convention against Genocide. For postmodernist hipsters like Zizek and Baudrillard, however, such precepts remain woefully &quot;foundationalist&quot; and are, consequently, simply irrelevant. Amid the fog of postmodern relativism disseminated by Baudrillard, Zizek, and others, something essential is missing. Going back to the Thucydides' Melian Dialogue, the massacre of civilian innocents has been a touchstone of civilized moral judgment. It remains today the cornerstone of human rights law and just war theory. Yet for the cultural left, slavishly following the &quot;genealogical&quot; approach recommended by Nietzsche and Foucault, moral reasoning is merely another one of civilization's clever &quot;normalizing ruses”- hence, an intellectual weakness to be avoided at all costs. Once again, postmodernism's right-wing intellectual pedigree- Nietzsche, Spengler, and Heidegger-has left it morally impotent and politically clueless. For years the left has demonstrated a predilection to romanticize the &quot;other”- Ho Chi Minh, Che, Fidel, as well as countless other apostles of Third World revolution-in the hope that the Wretched of the Earth would provide a remedy for the West's intractable political impasse. At a conference I attended recently, a friend with impeccable left-wing credentials who until communism's recent collapse had been an ardent champion of the proletarian cause, jumped on the pan-Arab bandwagon, reciting the names of obscure Muslim intellectuals who, he claimed, offered a promising political alternative to the debilities of Western liberalism. Plus ca change . . . . The left can ignore the imperatives of morality and international law only at its own peril. By romanticizing the lifestyles and mores of non-Western peoples, it suspends critical judgment, destroys its own credibility, and guarantees its own political irrelevance.<br />

<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">It is odd that conservatives question whether Western civilization has survived the twentieth century at the very time that so many academics on the cultural Left define that civilization as a singular hegemon that stands astride the globe. What, after all, is the &quot;multiculturalism&quot; so ardently but desperately proclaimed in higher education but the belief that there is a hegemonic Western civilization that, unchallenged, frames all issues and provides almost all modes of understanding? For the so-called multiculturalists, the question is not whether what they see without complexity as Western civilization will survive into the twenty-first century, but whether anything other than Western civilization will so survive. What do they mean by the hegemony of the West? It is not physical colonialism and imperialism that concern them anymore. No, they see as far more ominous what they term the cultural colonialism and imperialism of the West, a triumphant colonialism of the mind by a civilization that believes in universal categories that transcend itself. The West believes its values to be accessible to all human souls. The West believes its science to be a method bv which ail human beings everywhere can rise above ignorance, superstition, helplessness, and prejudice. The West believes that there are rights and obligations that belong to humanity qua humanity, beyond the power of governments and political wills. Conservatives despair at the disappearance of the West: the cultural Left despairs at its transcendent success. There are profound ironies about the multiculturalists, so many of which testify to the dynamism and inescapable appeal of precisely that Western civilization to whose dismemberment they are in theory committed. In theory, they are all moral relativists, but in reality, they tend to sound like Biblical prophets, calling power to categorical moral duty, or like traditional Western social critics who in this case have not thought out either their facts or their logic terribly well. Their self-contradictions betray their inability to escape from the civilization they claim so to despise. In their epistemology, they are the third-rate heirs of the Greek skeptics and historians—without, to their shame, even knowing that fact. Their assaults upon dogmatism, at their best, never rise above the level of the subtleties and paradoxes handed down to us by Sextus Empiricus, chronicler and compiler of the Greek skeptical tradition. The works of Sextus Empiricus were best sellers during the sixteenth century and widely translated in the seventeenth. I lis writings intellectually delighted European men of letters, including clerics, many of whom embraced him as a tonic antidote to the pride of human reason. Many philosophers modified their views of the claims of metaphysics in the face of such skepticism. The West has always been concerned with the limits of reason and knowledge, the role of received prejudice and custom, the appropriateness or arrogance of its metaphysical conclusions, and the phenomenon of paradox. Indeed, the West has authored the formal exposition and mental fireworks of such concerns. The heirs of the least subtle forms of that tradition do not even know their parentage. It was the Greeks and their heirs—not any postmodern critics of postcolonialism—who obsessed so creatively about the role of King Nomas, of received opinion, of education and prejudgment, and of the seeming relativity of values, beliefs, and taste to time, place, and accident of birth. Montesquieu, in the eighteenth century, was profoundly struck by the malleability of the human condition and by the relativity of what might seem the most foundational aspects of human existence to geography, time, and historical vicissitudes. He also saw, however, what our current social constructionists do not see: that as undeniable as that malleability may be, there is a natural reality that underlies, conditions, and sets limits to it, and that the relationship of human malleability and natural reality is a proper subject of deep objective study. For Montesquieu, certain forms of human association may persist for a wide variety of reasons—including terror and despotism— but there is a real human nature and a set of real human needs, and these will out toward their true ends because there is an ultimate reality in which our human forms nave consequences. Postmodern canon, despite its proclaimed alienation from Western thought and values, derives not from any non-Western culture, but from the internal debates of the West and the products of its educational vitality: from Marcuse, Gramsci, Marx, Hegel, and Rousseau—from, in short, the debates that the West has always had with itself. Postmodernists, when the issue is involuntary female circumcision, for example, seek asylum in America for the victims of such customary rites, citing notions of legal equality and of universal human dignity, not their alleged commitments to the relativity of all human values and cultures. They seek tenure at universities with medieval traditions of what the West called &quot;philosophical liberty.&quot; In the first and in the final analysis, so-called multiculturalists are simply Western radicals, in the Western radical tradition, with the most imperial, dogmatic, and absolutist aspirations of all. Further, they are the beneficiaries of the Western commitment to intellectual debate instead of coerced intellectual conformity in the Republic of Letters. They are the beneficiaries of the Western tradition, from Aristotle's insistence that we overcome all possible arguments against our beliefs, to the medieval insistence upon seek contra objections in formal disputations, to Mill's insistence that beliefs untested by free criticism are no longer truly alive. The radical dissenters are thus the unwitting and ungrateful beneficiaries of the West's own philosophical pluralism, and, indeed, of its constant extension. The current barbarians within also remind us that the West is, again and again, the author of its own worst follies and abuses, compared to most of which the postmodernists pale into virtual insignificance. We are the authors of our own religious wars and persecutions, our own enthusiastic superstitions, our own conquests of lands and peoples over which and whom we had no rights, our own ultimate nightmares of National or Leninist Socialism, which drowned our world in blood unimaginable in any century but the twentieth, and which truly threatened to bring this civilization to an awful end. We have had the will, however, to learn from depravity and from reality, and to bear ultimate witness to the higher sides of our being. What civilization has ever engaged in more searing analysis and soul searching of its own sins? Having defeated the National Socialists and the communists within, the bearers of the best of this civilization have reason for a moment of optimistic pride. </span></span><br />

The combined territories of South and North Korea is similar in size of Britain (244,100 square kilometers) and Guyana (215,000 square kilometers). South Korea along is about the size of Hungary (93,000 square kilometers) and Jordan (97.700 square kilometers). There are about 3,000 islands belonging to Korea. The islands are located mostly around the Yellow Sea; only a handful of them lie of the East Sea. Ullungdo, the largest island in the East Sea, serves as a major fishery base as does Tokdo island. Important islands within South Korea's territory include Chejudo, the largest island, which lies off the southwest corner of the peninsula. Until the 11th century, the territory of Korea had encompassed most of Manchuria, but by the 15th century, due to repeated conflicts with China, Koreans retreated southward and the Amnokkang and Tuman-gang rivers became the permanent Sino-Korean border. At the end of World War II, the peninsula was divided into a northern zone occupied by Soviet forces and a southern zone occupied by US forces, the boundary between the two zones being formed at the 38th parallel. In 1953, at the end of the Korean War, this boundary became semi-permanently fixed at the DMZ, a 4 kilometer wide strip of land than runs along the lines of cease-fire from the east to the west coast for a distance of about 241 kilometers. Back to Top ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS There are three administrative tiers in South Korea. The highest tier includes seven metropolitan cities and nine provinces (do). Metropolitan cities refer to those urban areas with a population of over 1 million. Seoul, the capital of South Korea, is the largest urban center, having over 10 million residents. Pusan is the second largest city, with a population of over 4 million. Taegu, Inch'eon, Kwangju, Taejon and Ulsan, in descending order, are each home to over 1 million people. At the second administrative tier, provinces (do) are subdivided into small cities (shi) and counties (gun). A small city (shi) comprises those areas with populations of more than 50,000. A county (gun) consists of one town (up) and five to ten townships (myon). Although they are administrative units, provinces (do) also play an important role in the regional identification of the people and many Koreans often identify themselves by the province in which they were born and raised. The last administrative tier consists of subdivisions of shi which are called dong. In rural areas however, counties (gun) are subdivided into towns (up) and townships (myon). A town (up) has a population of 20,000 people or less. In the last several decades, South Korea has witnessed a rapid growth of its urban centers. The population of these areas now constitutes over 85 percent of the national total. Urban growth has been particularly spectacular along the Seoul-Pusan corridor, the Seoul metropolitan area and the Kyongsang-do area. By contrast, the southwestern and northeastern peripheral regions have sustained a considerable loss in population. North Korea also has a similar jurisdictional heiarchy. Back to Top GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS Mountain ranges have traditionally served as natural boundary markers between regions. Because these natural boundaries inhibited frequent interactions between people living on either side of the range, subtle, and sometimes substantial, regional differences developed in both the spoken language and customs of the people. These regional distinctions also correspond to the traditional administrative units devised during the Choson Dynasty (1392-1910). The Korean Peninsula, located in Northeast Asia, is bordered on the north by China and Russia and juts toward Japan to the southeast. The northernmost point is Yup'ojin in Onsong-gun, Hamgyongbuk-do Province, and the southernmost point is Marado island, Cheju-do Province. The westernmost point of Maando island in Yongch'on-gun, Pyonganbuk-do Province, and the easternmost is Tokdo island in Ullung-gun, Kyongsangbukdo Province. The Korean Peninsula is 222,154 square kilometers, almost the same size as the UK or Romania. The administrative area of the Republic of Korea is 99,392 square kilometers, slightly larger than Hungary or Portugal and a little smaller than Iceland.<br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>JAMES 1967</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Preston E., Honorary President of the Association of American Geographers, “On the Origin and Persistence of Error in Geography,” Annals of the Association of American Geographers, March)</span></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">ABSTRACT. Human error concerning the geography of the earth has been recurrent throughout historic time. Some kinds of error arise because of the problems of dealing with phenomena in the three-dimensional zone forming earth-space. The broad curvature of the earth, the sheer diversity of earth-space, and the patterns of change through time all form pitfalls for the geographer who is, thereby, liable to error in his descriptive analyses. The problems of placing percepts (things perceived) against concepts (mental abstractions ) make for difficulties in analyzing the three-dimensional spatial zone in which geographers work. Among the kinds of error committed there are avoidable varieties, such as the inexact use of descriptive and analytical language, the uncritical use of statistical data, the acceptance of unreliable data, and the confusion of the several kinds of spatial distributions. Less avoidable error derives from the formulation of hypotheses accounting for phenomena which, when critically examined against accurate data, turn out to be inadequate, incomplete, or wrong. Such early hypotheses may actually become stimulants to progress in research; the Huttonian theory of the observable causation for landforms in time produced all of modern landform theory while at the same time producing many errors in analytical explanation. The construct of a model, per conceptualization, risks dangers of obscuring effective explanation owing to the fact that models normally can originally be only caricatures of reality. The Davisian cycle of erosion so obscured progress for a long period by its overacceptance. Social Darwinism, similarly, obstructed effective explanation for a period. The persistence of error becomes an obstruction to progress in geography. The overlong employment of Maury’s simple model of the earths wind systems was such a persistence. Currently the dichotomy of the dualism phrased as physical geography and human geography constitutes an error of persistence. The elimination of avoidable error and the replacement of inadequate to erring hypotheses require a continuing process of critical review, lest avoidable error continue into persistent error. However, on the present errors of inadequate hypotheses may be built the progress of geography in the future.</span></span><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The information also indicates that the right of North Koreans to enter and reside permanently in South Korea is one which is more than simply a potential right. As noted, it arises through a provision of the South Korean Constitution under which those, like the Applicant, who were born in North Korea are held to have been born in the territory of the Republic of Korea The territory of the Republic of Korea is defined as the Korean peninsula and its adjoining islands, and no distinction is made in Article 3 between those born south of the Military Demarcation Line which presently divides the two countries or those born north of it. The information indicates that the South Korean authorities have, unsurprisingly, developed administrative procedures to deal with North Korean citizens who wish to avail themselves of their right of entry and residence. These involve screening procedures to determine whether those claiming the right genuinely are from North Korea The nature of the Constitutional provision, and its later support by the Republic of Korea Supreme Court, indicates that these procedures simply recognise an already existing right rather then conferring the right once an applicant’s bona fides have been established. In either case, however, the record clearly indicates that those who can demonstrate to the authorities that their origins lie in North Korea are able to access the right to enter and reside permanently in South Korea. As noted, no person found to be genuinely from North Korea has been denied citizenship in South Korea.</span></span><br />

<br />
Japan's annexation of Corea didn't become formal until 1910, but for all practical purposes Japan had become the power that regulated Corea's relations with the outside world in 1897 when it defeated China in a war over Japan's ambition to exercise control over Corea. The only other power willing to contest Japan's supremacy in the Corean peninsula was Russia. When it was easily defeated by Japan at Port Arthur in 1905, the annexation of Corea became a fait accompli. Anxious to avoid a costly Pacific conflict, President Wilson ignored the pleas of a delegation of Corean patriots and their American missionary supporters and turned a blind eye to Japan's acts of formal annexation and colonization of Corea. During that period Japan mounted a campaign to push for the &quot;Korea&quot; useage by the American press. Why? For one of Japan's prospective colonies to precede its master in the alphabetical lineup of nations would be unseemly, Japanese imperialists decided. Japan's colonial rule over Corea ended on August 15, 1945 when it lost World War II. Now that Corea is eagerly shedding the last vestiges of the colonial period, even demolishing public buildings erected by the Japanese (for example, the monstrously immense colonial governor's mansion), forward-thinking Corean and Corean American journalists, intellectuals and scholars are urging the American media to revert to the original, more natural rendering of Corea. The changeover will pose a problem only in English-speaking nations as other western nations never accepted the &quot;K&quot; spelling. For example, France, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, among many others, use the &quot;C&quot; rendering. English convention, too, is on the side of the Corea rendering. Non-European names are romanized with a &quot;C&quot; (Cambodia, Canada, cocoa, Comanche, Congo, and even old Canton, for example) except where the first letter is followed by an &quot;e&quot; or an &quot;i&quot;, (as in Kenya). Other than that, the &quot;K&quot; spelling is used only in connoting childlike ignorance of spelling conventions (&quot;Kitty Kat&quot; and &quot;Skool&quot;, for examples). Therefore, the American &quot;K&quot; spelling is 1. offensive from a historical standpoint (remember &quot;Peking&quot; and &quot;Canton&quot;?); 2. violates western rendering conventions; 3. suggests a lack of sophistication toward Corea; and 4. by connoting naiveté, imputes a lack of sophistication to Corea and its people. The Corea rendering will ultimately become universal when more Americans are educated as to the offensive and relatively recent origin of the &quot;Korea&quot; rendering. The English-speaking world was responsible for agreeing to Japanese efforts to change the spelling of Corea's name in English useage. Who better than concerned Asian Americans to help change it back?<br />

<strong>Language is critical—colonialist language shapes our thinking and traps us in a cycle of violence</strong><br />
<strong>SHAHADAH 2005</strong> (Owen ‘Alik, Filmmaker and Writer, “Linguistics for a New African Reality,” December, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:2711:http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/language%20new%20reality.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/language%20new%20reality.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/language%20new%20reality.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:2711 -->)<br />

Words play a critical role in articulating our reality within an Indo-European linguistic framework. We must, as long as we speak non-African languages, find ways to control word usage when it speaks to our condition through a process of assimilating and normalizing words that serve in our interest. It is ignorant to ignore the significance of making a universal Pan-Africanist lexicon, which is adopted across the board. And just like as there is a body which, monitors, controls the English language we need such a body for serving our linguistic interest. There is no denying the billion dollar linguistic industry of the capitalist system; correct wording for marketing is a serious activity in fashioning consumer responses. In politics the careful wording by politicians to avoid liability testifies to the delicate, yet critical, significance of words. In media arena the neologism created to marry Islam to terror, show the power words have on sculpturing perception. There thus can be no denying that in the area of African reality words are an area which requires a full discourse. Language and thought There can be no undermining how both philosophies of language influences thought and vice-versa. Thus language is a key aspect of culture and culture is key in determining ones language. The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis suggested that language limited the extent to which members of a &quot;linguistic community&quot; can think about certain subjects. The interdependence of thought and speech makes it clear that languages are not so much a means of expressing truth that has already been established, but are a means of discovering truth that was previously unknown. Their diversity is a diversity not of sounds and signs but of ways of looking at the world. Karl Kerenyi The complicated dynamics behind word usage is solely rooted in a battle of self-interest. Many times we find ourselves trapped with popular anti-African sentiments such as “Africans enslaved other Africans,” “Egyptians weren't black,” etc. We are trapped fighting battles from a strategic disadvantage because the terms and definitions we employ serve solely in a Eurocentric reality that have been sculpted to destroy our historical foundation. If we speak of the African Holocaust then facts of so-called “Slavery by Africans” becomes redundant as the African Holocaust does not focus on systems of imprisonment, but moreover, the wholesale inhumane destruction visited upon African people. In addition, African Holocaust is not limited to the Transatlantic Slave Trade but the broader horror that also encompasses Colonial rule and more over the legacies of those systems.<br />

<strong>Words implicate the effectiveness of the plan; the affirmatives claim that the counterplans minor shift is meaningless relies on a masculinized view of politics that ignores the words that really implicates policy.</strong><br />
<strong>Thrift, 2000</strong> - Nigel, It’s the Little Things, A Century of Geopolitical Thought. London, Routledge, 380-387<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Let us finally come to one more arena: the arena of words. After all, here we might be thought to have the clearest example of representation at work, the word. Yet, what we do not get from critical geopolitics is a clear enough sense of how words function to bring about geopolitical change and it is not possible to do so as long as geopolitical forces continue to be framed as ‘big’ and ‘commanding’ (with all the masculine overtones). Some of the most potent geopolitical forces are, I suspect, lurking in the ‘little’ ‘details’ of people’s lives, what is ‘“carried” in the specific variabilities of their activities’ (Shotter and Billig 1998:23), in the context of utterances. And these variabilities have immediate consequences. Thus, As Bakhtin notes, and as is confirmed by the work in conversational analysis, ‘we sensitively catch the smallest shift in intonation, the slightest interruption of voices in anything of importance to us in another person’s practical everyday discourse. All those verbal sideward glances, reservations, loopholes, hints, thrusts do not slip past our ear, are not foreign to our own lips’ (Bakhtin 1984:201). And we in turn show our stance to what they do or say also in fleeting bodily reactions, facial expressions, sounds of approval or disapproval, etc. Indeed, even in the continuously responsive unfolding of non-linguistic activities between ourselves and others—in a dance, in a handshake, or even a mere chance collision on the street—we are actively aware of whether the other’s motives are, so to speak, ‘in tune’ or ‘at odds’ with ours. And in our sense of their attunement or lack of it, we can sense their attitude to us as intimate or distant, friendly or hostile, deferential or arrogant, and so on.

<strong>Challenging racist language is critical to cultural emancipation—no improvement can fully succeed without first critiquing language</strong><br />
<strong>SHAHADAH 2005</strong> (Owen ‘Alik, Filmmaker and Writer, “Linguistics for a New African Reality,” December, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/language%20new%20reality.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/language%20new%20reality.htm</a>)<br />
We must not walk on the outside of our own history and thus a challenge to systems, which remove us from this noble place within human history need to be critically and objectively re-evaluated. To continuously fight an opponent who makes the weapon we fight them with, means victory will always escape us. This is why no matter how close we come--we lose. Unlike other groups, we fail to institutionalize and control concepts and definitions relevant to our reality. We only need to look at the current anti-Islamic campaign to see the role of language usage in a battle for supremacy and mind control. Today terrorist might as well mean Muslim. They employed a strategy which started by saying Muslim and terrorist, Islam and terrorist. These words always accompanied one another. Once the marriage had been established, either word; may it be Muslim or terrorist conjured up the other, thus Muslim implied terrorist and terrorist implied Muslim. This is just a new example of the route and methodology in rerouting words to serve an objective. The Western controlling powers have the single most powerful weapon at their disposal: mass media. And thus concepts, precepts, ideas and ideologies can be communicated in the blink of an eye. Thus we must too find a way of communicating our new realities to our people and it must start with those in positions of mass interface with the public; writers, musicians, politicians, et al employing these terms. This is a key part in our path to self-determination and must not be under-estimated or over-looked if freedom and destiny are to be ours. There is no line drawn under words and the future of linguistics in articulating our reality, for our empowerment is a continuous journey. Its ultimate destination is when the African languages are completely used in our communicate. As African people, we must seek to redefine our reality, and part of this redefinition must begin with the terminologies we use to define ourselves and the terminologies others use to define us. And when we employ and integrate them into our conscious, we ultimately embark on a journey that has only one destination-- cultural emancipation.<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Perhaps nowhere in the world does the presence of a large-scale drug economy threaten U.S. primary security interests as much as in Afghanistan. There, the anti-American Taliban strengthens its insurgency campaign by deriving both vast financial profits and great political capital from sponsoring the illicit economy. The strengthened insurgency in turn threatens the vital U.S. objectives of counterterrorism and Afghan stability, as well as the lives of U.S. soldiers and civilians deployed there to promote these objectives. The opium poppy economy also undermines these goals by fueling widespread corruption in Afghanistan’s government and law enforcement, especially the police forces. A failure to prevail against the insurgency will result in the likely collapse of the national government and Taliban domination of Afghanistan’s south, possibly coupled with civil war. A failure to stabilize Afghanistan will in turn further destabilize Pakistan, emboldening jihadists and weakening the resolve of Pakistan’s military and intelligence services to take on Islamic militancy. Pakistan may once again calculate that it needs to cultivate its jihadi assets to counter India’s influence in Afghanistan—perceived or actual. But the seriousness of the threat, and strategic importance of the stakes, should not lead one to conclude that implementing aggressive counternarcotics suppression measures today will enhance U.S. objectives and global stability. Just the opposite is true: Premature and inappropriate counternarcotics efforts greatly complicate counterterrorism and counterinsurgency objectives, and hence also jeopardize economic reconstruction and state-building efforts. They are also unsustainable in the long term, and indeed counterproductive even for the narrow goal of narcotics suppression. At least until the new counternarcotics policy that the Obama administration indicated it would undertake in summer 2009—defunding and deemphasizing eradication and focusing on interdiction and rural development— counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan unfortunately had these undesirable effects.1 The new policy, if implemented well, promises to redress many of the deficiencies of previous efforts and synergistically enhance counterinsurgency and counterterrorism objectives. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">After years of such inappropriate focus on eradication of the poppy crop, the new counternarcotics strategy for Afghanistan, announced by U.S. government officials in summer 2009, promises to mesh well with the counterinsurgency and state-building effort. By scaling back eradication and emphasizing interdiction and development, it will help separate the population from the Taliban. If designed well, the interdiction effort can also contribute to establishing rule of law in Afghanistan and reducing the power of criminal groups, Taliban-linked or not. But there should be little expectation that the new interdiction effort can significantly constrain Taliban income, which comes from many sources other than drugs, including taxation of economic activity, illicit logging, illicit trade in gems and wildlife, and fundraising in Pakistan and the Middle East.15 On its own, a well-designed counternarcotics policy is not sufficient for success in Afghanistan. But it is indispensible.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We waited until 2009 to give the Afghan conflict the resources that success will require. While we focused on Iraq, the Taliban regained strength and reinstituted its previous reign of terror in much of southern and eastern Afghanistan. But with the war in Iraq winding down and a determined international focus on Afghanistan and Pakistan, it is possible over the next five years to build an Afghan government that can outperform the Taliban and an Afghan army that can outfight it, especially with the support of a Pakistani government that continues its own efforts on its side of the Durand Line. During his visit to Washington, President Karzai discussed with President Barack Obama how the political and military efforts are faring and what endstate America will be willing to accept from Taliban negotiators, who are beginning to seek reconciliation with the Afghan government. The fact that elements of the Taliban are contemplating reconciliation is the single best piece of evidence that a successful outcome is possible in an Afghanistan that will require long-term security assistance from the West, but that with that assistance can achieve a reasonable degree of stability.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">KABUL, Afghanistan, Aug. 25, 2010 – Intelligence reports indicate some pockets of low insurgent morale, with some insurgent fighters reluctant to keep fighting and some refusing to assume district commands when commanders are captured or killed, International Security Assistance Force officials in Afghanistan said today.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In a written statement, officials said the low morale among enemy fighters and insurgent leaders can be linked to successful security operations by Afghan and ISAF forces.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Coalition and Afghan forces conducted more than 2,800 counterterrorist operations over the past 90 days, the statement said, killing or capturing more than 365 insurgent leaders and 2,386 fighters. These counter-insurgency successes have also led to a growing sense of distrust among insurgent fighters, heightened fear of spies in their midst and increased suspicion among rival tribes, officials said.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&quot;While the coalition strength and capability of the [Afghan forces] are on the rise, we are seeing evidence of low insurgent morale, which is affecting their capability across the country,&quot; said German Brig. Gen. Josef Blotz, an ISAF spokesman. &quot;The coalition will continue to neutralize insurgents and eliminate their safe havens, expanding areas that are secure enough for improved governance and development.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The ISAF statement cited the Taliban commander in Helmand province’s Marja district as an example, noting that he openly acknowledged to his fellow insurgents that the Taliban are losing Marja and that their chances of winning are poor.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Obama Administration should be congratulated for having the courage in Afghanistan to break with ineffective, but entrenched supply-side policies that center on premature eradication. Eradication in conflict settings without legal alternative livelihoodC in place neither accomplishes its siren song of bankrupting belligerents, nor does it sustainably reduce illicit crops. Indeed, it is counterproductive by increasing the bonds between belligerents, such as the Taliban, and the local population, and thus intensifying conflict, and by strengthening the structural drivers of illicit crop cultivation, such as insecurity. The new U.S. strategy significantly scales back eradication, and instead focuses on interdiction (with a budget request of US$450 million) and rural development. The total request for economic assistance, which includes alternative livelihoods efforts, is US$ 3.3 billion. Although far from all economic programs necessarily impact the size of the drug trade in Afghanistan, including the level of illicit crop cultivation, it is important to understand that alternative livelihoods efforts require comprehensive rural development efforts and that job creation outside the rural sector may be critical for the reduction of the population’s economic dependence on illicit crop cultivation. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">However, the design of interdiction measures and alternative livelihoods efforts and the quality of their implementation will be critical for success. It is, for example, highly unlikely that interdiction measures can significantly reduce the Taliban’s income and greatly limit its operational capacity. Interdiction measures have rarely succeeded in such an undertaking, and the Taliban likely derives half of its income from fundraising and taxing all other legal and illegal economic activity in the areas where its presence is strong, such as trucking, illegal logging, and development projects. Between 2002 and 2004, the Taliban was able to rebuild itself largely without access to proceeds from poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. </span><br />

Despite forced eradication efforts, opium production in Afghanistan climbed to a staggering 8,200 metric tons in 2007. Afghanistan supplies 93% of the global illicit market for opiates, and more than 95% of the European market.2 </span><br />

Although some increase in production in Burma would take place, a wholesale transfer of Afghanistan’s opium economy is unlikely. First, because of climatic and soil conditions, Burmese opium has smaller yields and is of lesser quality (i.e., has less morphine content) than Afghan/Central Asian opium.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There is little evidence that today either the Afghan Taliban or the Pakistani Taliban (including Tehrik-i-Taliban and Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e-ShariaeMohammadi) has systematically penetrated the slightly resurgent opium poppy cultivation in FATA and NWFP, even though they may have penetrated trafficking in drugs and precursor agents in Pakistan. Instead, it appears that the main sources of the Pakistani Taliban’s income include smuggling in legal goods; charging tolls and protection fees; taxation of all economic activity in the areas they operate (some being highly profitable, such as marble mining); theft and resale of NATO supplies heading to Afghanistan via Pakistan; illicit logging; and fundraising in Pakistan the broader Middle East.42 While profits from such a diverse portfolio of activities can equal or even surpass profits from drugs, their main downside—from the perspective of belligerent actors—is that these economic activities are not labor-intensive. Jihadi groups undertaking these activities in Pakistan cannot present themselves as largescale providers of employment to the local population, unlike when they sponsor the highly labor-intensive cultivation of opium poppy. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Let’s imagine that eradication could somehow miraculously and rapidly wipe out opium cultivation in Afghanistan, and the campaign was executed in such a way that made replanting within the country impossible. For example, assume that despite the controversy about resorting to “biological warfare” and its potential negative effects on other crops, animals, and human health, a mycoherbicide was sprayed throughout the country and persisted in the soil for several years, destroying any poppy seeds that farmers attempted to plant. (Currently Kabul opposes any such spraying with any agent.) Immediately, Afghanistan’s GDP would be slashed by at least thirty percent, deepening the economic crisis of the very poor rural population. Without comprehensive economic development that addresses all structural drivers of illicit crop cultivation and licit crop underdevelopment, legal subsistence crops would struggle and potentially experience massive failures due to a lack of irrigation systems and fertilizers. Even wheat—intensively pushed since 2008 as the replacement crop in Afghanistan because of an unusually favorable (and unsustainable) wheat-to-opium price ratio—would fail to offset the individual income losses and the macroeconomic dislocation effects. Not only does the wheat program fail to address the multiple and complex drivers of opium poppy cultivation,16 but also most farmers do not have access to enough land to generate even necessary subsistence out of wheat. Moreover, as wheat is far less labor-intensive than opium poppy, even a wholesale replacement of the entire area currently cultivated with poppy by wheat would generate a massive rise in unemployment. Without robust and multifaceted development, forced poppy suppression would mean that farmers would not be able to obtain microcredit, access to land, and productive assets, thus becoming further indebted. Even in cities, much economic activity, such as construction and trade with durables, would greatly decrease, since these economic activities are now massively underwritten by drug money. Social strife and chaos would ensue, as well as massive migration to Pakistan. The Taliban insurgency would be strengthened. Vanda Felbab-Brown 96 But apart from these economic, political, and military effects, which are magnified consequences of any eradication that targets the rural poor without providing them with immediate and reliable access to legal alternatives, two other critical questions need to be asked regarding the “what then.” First, what illicit economy would replace the existing opium one in Afghanistan? And second, to what country would opium production shift? Illicit economies rarely simply disappear. A large illicit economy not only satisfies the socioeconomic needs of the population, but also generates widespread smuggling knowhow, extensive criminal networks, and numerous powerful actors with vested interests in the preservation of an illicit economy. These actors include criminal and belligerent groups, corrupt government officials, and political powerbrokers. This infrastructure of crime can easily be transferred from one illicit economy to another. In Colombia, the drug trade built on several decades of smuggling with cigarettes, household goods, marijuana and emeralds. Many of the original smugglers emerged as prominent Colombian drug capos.17 In Myanmar, the eradication of opium poppy since the late 1990s (crucially helped by overproduction in Afghanistan) gave rise to an extensive production of methamphetamines, rampant illicit logging, and a massive increase in the illegal trade of wildlife.18 In Afghanistan itself, the illegal drug economy had built on decades of smuggling of various sorts, including a very large illicit traffic of licit goods. In Afghanistan, the least dangerous and potentially most easily suppressible illicit replacement economy would be just such an increase in this illicit trade of licit goods. This traffic exists as a result of the Afghan Transit Trade Agreement, under which goods can be imported to Pakistan duty-free for re-export into Afghanistan. Goods billed for Afghanistan, arriving, for example, from Dubai, are then smuggled back from Afghanistan into Pakistan where both traders and consumers avoid having to pay customs. Although profits from the illicit traffic (at times over $1 billion per year)19 could rival those from drugs, if Pakistan and Afghanistan set their tariffs at the same level, this trade would disappear. Already today, as in the 1990s, the trade generates extensive revenues for the Taliban and others. A considerably more ominous illicit replacement economy would be the production of synthetic drugs, such as methamphetamines. Afghanistan would of course face stiff competition from Myanmar, Thailand, and Mexico, but the global market for synthetic drugs is rapidly growing; Afghanistan would likely be able to cut in on it. In that case, Afghanistan would still suffer The Drug-Conflict Nexus in South Asia: Beyond Taliban Profits and Afghanistan 97 from the same political, economic, and social vices of illegal drug production. But the rural population would now be left destitute since the production of synthetic drugs is less labor-intensive than the cultivation of opium, and hence could employ only a tiny fraction of the farmers and laborers of the opium economy. At the same time, large traffickers, corrupt government officials, and belligerent groups could easily maintain the level of income they have been obtaining from the opium economy. One effect of the lower labor-intensiveness of synthetic drug production would be a further tightening of control over the economy into the hands of few individuals, with a corresponding rise in their political influence. Moreover, the production of synthetic drugs would be considerably harder to detect and disrupt. Two other illicit economies already in existence in Afghanistan—illicit logging and wildlife smuggling—would be strengthened, further contributing to environmental and economic destruction of the countryside through soil erosion, overgrazing, and changes to water level. THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE’S UNLIKELY NEW HIGH The second what-then question of vital importance for the United States is to what country opium cultivation would shift. Given high world demand for illicit opiates, suppression of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan would not leave a highly lucrative market unsatiated, but would shift it elsewhere. Afghanistan itself first became a significant opium producer as a result of suppression policies and acts of nature elsewhere. Some level of opium poppy cultivation took place in Afghanistan for centuries, and in fact frustrated British counterinsurgency efforts during the 19th century and critically influenced state-building efforts in Afghanistan during the same period.20 But it was only in the mid-1950s, after poppy cultivation was banned in neighboring Iran, that Afghanistan really burst onto the international drug scene and became a place for Western hippies to “turn on, tune in, and drop out” inexpensively. Initially Iran was Afghanistan’s principal market, but in the mid-1970s, when Western demand for heroin greatly expanded and political instability and a prolonged drought disrupted the flow of drugs from Southeast Asia’s Golden Triangle, Afghanistan began to supply large quantities of illicit opiates to the global market.21 Just as in the 1950s and 1980s, poppy suppression in Afghanistan in the absence of a reduction in the global demand for opiates would simply shift cultivation to another locale. Unlike coca, whose cultivation is more Vanda Felbab-Brown 98 geographically limited by climate requirements, poppy can be cultivated in most of the world. Nonetheless, there are three likely candidates for a largescale poppy cultivation relocation from Afghanistan. From a U.S. strategic perspective, the most optimistic scenario would be an increase in opium cultivation in the Golden Triangle, specifically Burma. Recent production suppression there has left the ethnic populations in the hill periphery regions, such as the Wa, destitute.22 Although the ethnic elites—former rebels and now leaders of their semiautonomous regions—are cooking Ecstasy, large segments of their populations have food security for only eight months a year, relying on UN food aid for the remaining four. Critical poverty, disease, addiction, and outmigration are widespread—as are coping mechanisms such as illicit logging, trade in wildlife, and foraging in forests.23 The immiseration of the ethnic groups at the hands of both the regime in Naypyidaw and their local leadership has antagonized the population. Although they have no love for the abusive and discriminatory central government, after decades of war and now over ten years of economic deprivation as a result of poppy suppression in the absence of legal alternatives, they also have little commitment to their ethnic leaders and local representatives. One manifestation of this weakening of the bond between the ethnic populations and the ethnic-insurgent leaders who control the territories has been the resounding defeat of the ethnic groups by the junta’s forces during the flare-up of the country’s ethnic conflict in the summer and fall of 2009. The rebels’ defeats have many sources, including the strengthening of the junta’s military forces over the past fifteen years even as the rebel armies have become weakened and demobilized to some extent, the fractious nature of the anti-central-government alliances, and the high levels of internal infighting.24 But the failure of the groups’ leaders to mobilize the population even as the junta pushes for elections and referenda in 2010 threatens to further constrict the autonomy of the ethnic groups. If opium production returned to Burma, the immediate economic crisis would be somewhat lessened, even though the illegal narcotics economy creates its own trap of poverty and abuse. Both the central junta and the various now largely-disarmed rebel groups would again tap into the re-emergent opium economy,25 and would increase their physical resources and domestic political capital since they could provide livelihood for their populations. Thus violent conflict between the central junta and ethnic insurgencies may intensify. The Drug-Conflict Nexus in South Asia: Beyond Taliban Profits and Afghanistan 99 The strengthening of the junta and of the demobilized rebel groups would be adverse to U.S. interests in democracy and human rights—all the more painful after the junta’s brutalization of protesting Buddhist monks in fall 2007.26 It would not however pose a direct threat to U.S. security. Although they would be further weakened in effectiveness, U.S. sanctions on Myanmar for human rights violations are already critically undermined by China’s, India’s, and Thailand’s trade with the country. An increase in cultivation may further complicate the new U.S. effort to couple sanctions against the junta with a cautious engagement with the regime that the Obama administration began cautiously trying out in the fall of 2009;27 but poppy suppression undertaken by the junta during the Clinton and Bush administrations did not ease the U.S.-Myanmar relationship or domestic oppression in the country. China would be unhappy with the rise in Burma’s production of opiates. As in the 1990s, it would likely pressure the junta and the various ethnic groups to eradicate the poppy fields, both to arrest the increasing rate of addiction in China and to limit the power of Chinese crime organizations, many of which are closely linked to Burmese illicit economies. These crime organizations are undermining the centrality of power of the Chinese Communist Party in the periphery. Despite having the least negative impact on U.S. strategic interests, this scenario where the bulk of opiate production shifts to Burma is not likely to materialize. Although some increase in production in Burma would take place, a wholesale transfer of Afghanistan’s opium economy is unlikely. First, because of climatic and soil conditions, Burmese opium has smaller yields and is of lesser quality (i.e., has less morphine content) than Afghan/Central Asian opium. Second, important current heroin refining infrastructure and smuggling routes are now located in the territory of Afghanistan’s neighbors. CENTRAL ASIA: GETTING HOOKED Under a second scenario, opium cultivation and production would shift to Central Asia’s former Soviet republics. These countries have already become key smuggling routes for opium and heroin from Afghanistan to Russia and Turkey, and on to the rest of Europe. Many Afghan heroin laboratories have emerged on the border with Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. These countries’ border interdiction capabilities remain critically limited, with border patrol officials frequently on the payroll of drug traffickers.28 Government corruption is widespread, and counternarcotics efforts are frequently Vanda Felbab-Brown 100 manipulated to placate the United States, eliminate drug competition, and crack down against domestic political opposition. All of these countries have experienced a rampant increase in drug addiction rates, driven by both the ready availability of opiates and widespread poverty, including some of the worst living standards within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Apart from weak and corrupt law enforcement, climatic and soil conditions for cultivation in the Central Asia region are ideal for the production of the illicit crops. During the 1990s, illicit cultivation of both opium poppy and cannabis gradually emerged in many CIS countries.29 Already during the 1990s civil war in Tajikistan, the drug trade was almost the sole economic activity of the Gorno Badakshan region, and spread to other parts of the country as well.30 Large-scale cultivation in the region poses at least three dangers for the United States. The first is the emergence in CIS countries of a jihadist hub with access to drug profits. Since the demise of Afghanistan as a safe haven, many jihadists from Central Asia and the Middle East have been looking for a new base. Although the tribal territories of Pakistan are already pulling in jihadist terrorists, the shift of poppy cultivation to CIS countries would serve as a great magnet, with vast money to be obtained for jihad. During the 1990s, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) already profited from the Afghan drug trade, emerging as a major courier organization in the region. Motivated by religious extremism, it carried out military operations in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan.31 Although the group never posed a serious threat to regional governments, it developed networks interlocking with those of other militant Islamic groups, including the Taliban and al-Qaeda, and in fact absorbed extremist Arabs, Chechens, Dagestanis, Uighurs, and ex-Iraqi jihadists in Pakistan. It has since developed networks in Europe.32 Since 2004, it has been present and active in Pakistan, especially in South Waziristan, fueling the Salafi insurgency there. With opium production shifting to CIS countries, both law enforcement against the drug trade and efforts against the jihadists would become more difficult for the U.S. to conduct since it would not have the same military and intelligence assets there that it now has in Afghanistan. Apart from sensitive clandestine operations and strikes from air and other remote platforms, it would have to rely on regional governments for action against terrorists and against drugs. The U.S. would thus exercise much less control over policy against the drug-terror nexus in the region than it can in Afghanistan. The Drug-Conflict Nexus in South Asia: Beyond Taliban Profits and Afghanistan 101 The second danger would be official crackdowns on Islam and Islamists in Central Asia disguised as counternarcotics policy. Local governments’ heavy-handed measures against Islamists and other domestic opponents, while billed as crackdowns against the drug trade, would increase instability in the region and further radicalize the poor population grappling with its post-Soviet Communist and repressed Islamic identity. Already it has become common practice in the region to accuse political enemies of being drug dealers. Counternarcotics measures would also alienate the population from their governments and from the U.S. Unlike in Latin America, the balloon effect in Central Asia would involve not only a shift of drug production to a new area, but also the spread of antagonism against the United States among populations on the brink of falling into the hands of anti-U.S. Islamists. Finally, a shift of opium poppy cultivation to Central Asia may jeopardize U.S. oil interests in the region. With around 50 billion barrels of oil at stake,33 the U.S., Russia, China, and Iran have become involved in intense competition over the region’s potential resources. Large-scale opium cultivation in the CIS countries would be destabilizing—further increasing crime and terrorist presence, and thus jeopardizing potential economic investment and trade. China has an additional interest in preventing the spread of opium cultivation to the Xinjiang province, which would provide the rebellious Uighurs with access to drug profits and political capital. Instability would also increase as a result of repressive counterdrug policies, again complicating oil exploitation. Politically-sensitive counternarcotics operations would increase mutual blame among the Caspian countries for the drug problem, further weakening their already minimal cooperation. PAKISTAN: DRUGS, TRIBES, AND SALAFISTS By far the worst scenario from the U.S. strategic perspective would be the shift of poppy cultivation to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), or even Pakistan’s Punjab province. For over twenty years, Pakistan has been a major heroin refining and smuggling hub. It has an extensive hawala system that has been used for moving drug profits. Today, these territories also have extensive and wellorganized Salafi insurgent and terrorist groups that seek to limit the reach of the Pakistani state and topple Pakistan’s government. A relocation of poppy cultivation there would be highly detrimental to U.S. interests, since it would contribute to a critical undermining of the Pakistani state and fuel jihadist Vanda Felbab-Brown 102 insurgency. Such a shift would not only increase profit possibilities for Pakistani belligerents, but also provide them with significant political capital by allowing them to become significant local employers: FATA, NWFP, Baluchistan, and Punjab are all areas with minimal employment opportunities. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Economic development must be brought to locales where the Taliban is active. No progress against narcotics can be lasting and without negative repercussions unless integrated with prior rural development. In the Pashtun belt, this cannot be achieved until the Taliban is defeated. Without consistent security against Taliban attacks, economic projects will fall apart, the population will not be able to take advantage of them, and investments will not be viable. But the need for security as a precursor to sustainable development should not be used as an excuse to postpone all economic projects. Unless at least some immediate economic improvements are brought rapidly to the population in contested areas, counterinsurgency efforts cannot win hearts and minds. In the short term, the population must receive security improvements combined with a fast injection of visible economic aid, followed in the longer term by comprehensive, sustained, and well-funded economic development throughout the country. Rural development needs to address all structural drivers of poppy cultivation. It needs to focus not only on the farm, but also on value-added chains and assured markets. It needs to emphasize diversified high-value, labor intensive crops, and not center on wheat. Top drug traffickers in important positions of power should gradually be removed, to limit their political power if not to cripple the drug industry. But actions against them need to be ethnically balanced, and should be undertaken only once beefed-up police forces are in place to deal with the high potential of wars among the remaining traffickers over control of the industry—and also against the state. (Colombia during the 1980s and 1990s and Mexico today provide vivid examples of the debilitating effects of such drugs wars, and the state’s inability to cope with them.) Interdiction needs to focus on reducing the coercive and corrupting power of crime groups. Before interdiction measures are undertaken, an analysis of second- and third-order effects needs to be conducted. It needs to be carefully calibrated with the strength of law enforcement in Afghanistan to avoid provoking dangerous turf wars, ethnic violence, and cementing the relationship between the Taliban and the traffickers. It also needs to target top traffickers linked to the Afghan government. Interdiction needs to encompass building the justice and corrections system in Afghanistan and broad rule of law efforts. Reforming Afghanistan’s law enforcement is vital. The key metrics, though, should not be the number of interdiction raids and hectares eradicated, but rather the extent of security the police bring to the area and the growing confidence of the population that, overall, the police represent an impartial, honest, and competent organ of the state—and not predatory warlords dressed in state uniforms. Although such metrics are considerably more difficult to measure than the current simplistic ones, obtaining such information is possible if intelligence officers and development workers focus on collecting it. Such metrics will result in considerably more accurate and useful assessments of policy effectiveness.43</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">At the regional level, the United States should build cooperation among Afghanistan’s neighbors, and help them develop economically. This will hinge on the geopolitical situation in Central Asia unrelated to narcotics, but the U.S. should nonetheless nudge regional governments to move beyond declarative cooperation in counternarcotics to action, at least on border security and intelligence sharing. The U.S., China, and Russia have much to gain from cooperating in combating narcotics in Central Asia, which if done wisely could lead to state-building and economic development of the region. Moving Pakistan to serious cooperation on counternarcotics should production shift there will be a tall task as long as Islamabad continues to exercise only weak control over the regions where cultivation would likely take place. Accusations of sovereignty violations, similar to those that arose with respect to Kerry-Lugar, are easily exploitable by the political opposition to the government; the fact that a ready audience exists among the alienated population will make any such visible cooperation difficult and possibly counterproductive for other U.S. other interests. Thus, the best counternarcotics policy with respect to Pakistan is to foster state-building and help Islamabad to extend security and economic development to disaffected border areas. This includes quiet and below-the-radar counterinsurgency assistance, but also assistance in developing holding forces and police and law enforcement capacity, and advancing the rule of law.</span><br />

<strong>- Shift to a containment strategy in Afghanistan</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Solves the aff</strong><br />
<strong>Chipman 9-10</strong>, director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies - John, 2010, “A Strategy for Afghanisan”<br />
<br />
Containing the international threat from the Afghan/Pakistan border and deterring the reconstitution of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan would have political, diplomatic, economic and military elements.<br />
It would require political deals in Afghanistan and among key regional powers, including India, Pakistan, Iran and the Central Asian states. It would entail promises of economic and development support to those who embrace it, as well as the threat of military strikes against any re-concentration of international terrorist elements.<br />
Unlike the present counterinsurgency strategy, this new approach would not be so dependent on orchestrating near-ideal internal political and developmental outcomes in Afghanistan. Nor would it require the degradation of Taliban capacities to the point of near-surrender, a prospect that is by no means immediate.<br />
It would not depend on winning an ever-lengthening succession of local battles against an enemy that is motivated by the presence of foreign forces.<br />
Rather than signaling victory for the enemy, it would represent a policy that could meet the principal security goal over a longer period than the current approach, given the low support for the campaign among Western electorates.<br />
Indeed, it would underline the fact that the original goal of the combat has already been achieved.<br />
As a first step, foreign forces should be restructured to deter and prevent the reconstitution of a terrorist threat. This would mean redeployment to the north of Afghanistan and the arrangement of a status-of-forces agreement that would allow intervention in the south against any reconstitution of jihadist capacities.<br />
This could involve targeted operations, but not attacks on Taliban forces that posed no extra-provincial threat.<br />
Second, outside powers should seek to orchestrate a more federal Afghanistan, where the provinces accept that formal rule and external authority resides in the capital, and the capital cedes practical sovereignty on most issues to the provinces.<br />
However paradoxical it may sound, a balance of weakness between the capital and the provinces may be more conducive to stability. International cooperation would continue, but not to the extent of investing more power in a central government that cannot deliver.<br />
Third, the new strategy should accept that the Afghan National Army will need to have a federal character, co-opting local forces with local roots.<br />
Coalition military leaders have already discussed with President Hamid Karzai the creation of uniformed local security forces: Afghan Army badging could follow.<br />
Fourth, the United States and others will have to further deepen the engagement with Pakistan, persuading Islamabad that contact with a wide variety of actors in Afghanistan is necessary, and engage more fully with other regional actors, including India.<br />

<br />
The nation mourns the men and women in uniform who are killed or wounded in Iraq, one by one. But the public needs to be aware, and be worried, about the larger picture too. Our military and our military readiness have been strained and risk real, permanent damage.<br />
Twenty-five years ago, America's Army was a lot larger and had a lot less to do. Now, a substantially smaller force is struggling to cope with the demands placed on it by Iraq, where boots on the ground are in chronically short supply. For much of the past two years, the bulk of America's frontline ground forces have been tied down in an open-ended counterinsurgency war they were not expected, or given the resources, to fight. These soldiers and marines, active-duty and Reserve, have shown courage and determination, despite shortages of armor and other equipment, involuntarily extended enlistments and accelerated rotations back into combat.<br />
Their fortitude has allowed the Pentagon to sustain a situation that everyone recognizes cannot go on indefinitely, even though no end to the Iraqi conflict is yet in sight. The extended unplanned deployment of American forces is taking a heavy cumulative toll, especially on the Army and Army National Guard. It is undermining readiness and morale, and limiting America's ability to send substantial ground forces elsewhere to back up its diplomacy or respond to emerging threats.<br />
The Pentagon is beginning to resemble a desperate farmer who feeds his starving family the seed corn meant for sowing next year's crop. To keep enough boots on the ground now, it is sacrificing the ability to retain the leaders of tomorrow. As overdeployment has become chronic, promising young officers are opting not to re-enlist. When new crops of young people graduate from school, they will be less willing to combine their civilian careers with service in the Army National Guard; recruitment is already down almost 30 percent. The Regular Army is hurting too. Despite enlistment bonuses, it has had to speed up its reporting schedules, sending new recruits straight into basic training.<br />
This growing crisis is not due to a lack of preparedness on the part of military brass, but to the ideology on which preparedness was based. Before Iraq, Pentagon dogma -- supported by most Republican politicians and many conservative Democrats -- held that United States troops were war fighters. Peacekeeping and nation-building were jobs for Old Europe. Well, that was then.<br />
Now, more than half of the Regular Army's fighting forces have either served in Iraq, are currently there or can expect to be on their way soon, along with a substantial fraction of the Marine Corps and historically high proportions of the Army National Guard and Reserves. Rotations are being accelerated, with units that have already served in Iraq returning for second tours. These faster rotations are degrading readiness, wearing down equipment and leaving less time for normal training exercises. Reservists, including police, firefighters and other homeland defenders, are spending lengthy tours overseas. Four out of 10 Americans now serving in Iraq come from Reserve or National Guard units.<br />
None of this should lead Americans to worry that the United States -- with the world's premier Air Force, Navy and nuclear strike force fully intact -- is defenseless. If a new threat suddenly arose -- if, for example, Al Qaeda threatened Saudi oil fields, radical Islamist officers got control of Pakistani nuclear weapons or China attacked Taiwan -- Washington could respond forcefully and decisively. But that does not mean that broader American security interests are not paying a price. Any additional foreign engagement that dragged on beyond a few months and required large numbers of ground troops would require a wider call-up of reserves and perhaps a return to the draft.<br />
Many potential enemies overseas doubt that the public would have the appetite for that kind of sacrifice. As a result, America's diplomatic clout is being subtly undermined. Iranian mullahs weighing whether to give up their nuclear programs may conclude that Washington is in no position to face them down. North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong Il, may also feel freer to proceed with his nuclear plans and move troops closer to the South Korean border. Chinese leaders may see this as an opportune time to escalate their bullying of Taiwan.<br />
Listing all the dangers is much easier than coming up with solutions. But there are some obvious short-term answers. Barring any unexpected breakthroughs in Iraq, Washington needs to increase its recruitment quotas sharply for active-duty service in the Army and Marine Corps. The current Army recruitment ceiling of just above 500,000 ought to go up to nearly 600,000, still substantially below the levels of the late 1980's. The Marines' ceiling should go up from the current 178,000 to around 200,000. Attracting those recruits will require offering financial and other inducements on top of the added payroll costs.<br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In this time of economic stagnation, increasing taxes to pay for higher defense spending would not be helpful in facilitating an economic turnaround. Moreover, given the fact that Congress has approved the FY2010 Defense Appropriations Act, it will be impossible to include funding for the Afghan troop escalation in the regular appropriations budget this fiscal year. At least the first nine months of this escalation (through the end of the fiscal year on September 30th, 2010) will therefore have to be funded through a one-time defense supplemental budget in FY2010. Rather than allow the supplemental and additional costs of the escalation for FY2011 to add to the large and growing national deficit, the Obama administration should look to the base defense budget for programs and weapons platforms that can be eliminated or scaled back without jeopardizing our national defense strategy or capabilities. Our allies in Great Britain have adopted such a policy. In order to pay for the cost of sending an additional 500 troops and supporting equipment to the front lines in Afghanistan, the British government is currently “reprioritizing” existing Ministry of Defense spending, including domestic cuts in civilian staff, and a commitment to improve procurement. We recommend a similar approach for the United States. Given that defense investment funds—including procurement, research, and development—have grown by approximately 75 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars over the past decade, and that the Obama administration’s FY 2010 defense budget represented an approximately $4 billion increase over even the outgoing Bush administration’s projected funding for this fiscal year, and that the total increase for the regular defense budget for FY2011 is now projected to be another $14 billion above the administration’s earlier projections for that year, Obama should certainly be able to find the funding for his troop increase within the baseline budget in FY2011. Adjustments to nine costly and outmoded weapons platforms and programs and an across-the-board reduction in research, development, test and evaluation funding could more than pay for the additional 30,000 troops for Afghanistan for one year. These ten budget cuts would include: * Ballistic Missile Defense * The Virginia-Class Submarine * The DDG-1000 Destroyer * The V-22 Osprey * The Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle * The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter * Offensive Space-based Weapons * Future Combat Systems * Scaling back the number of our nation’s nuclear forces * Scaling back Research, Development, Test and Evaluation funding Together these changes could save some $40 billion in the next fiscal year, from which Obama can select the more than $30 billion required to fund 30,000 troops for their first year in Afghanistan (see Table 1). None of these Cold War-era weapons platforms really provide the urgent capabilities needed for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan nor likely future threats. By cutting or scaling back these programs, the Obama administration can both pay for the escalation of the war in Afghanistan and continue its pledge to create a more realistic defense budget in line with both our needs and our means. Ensuring that the $30 billion per year price tag for the escalation in Afghanistan will not add to the federal deficit will not make up for the hundreds of billions of dollars already spent on this war by the Bush administration, but it will be a step in the right direction. In righting the ship, President Obama can learn from President Lyndon B. Johnson’s successful effort to balance the federal budget in 1969 at the height of the war in Vietnam. Through a combination of tax increases, reductions in the regular defense budget, and domestic spending cuts, the Johnson administration was able to produce a budget surplus in its last year in office and keep regular defense spending under control. We do not believe tax increases or domestic spending cuts are necessary at this time to offset the increased cost of operations in Afghanistan for FY 2010. Nor do the American people. In a recent survey conducted by the New York Times, the majority of Americans (53 percent) stated that they would prefer that the government fund the most recent escalation in Afghanistan by implementing spending cuts as compared to adding to the budget deficit (19 percent) or increasing taxes (10 percent). As will be outlined below, adequate funds can be found by cutting or eliminating unnecessary programs in the Defense Department’s base budget. Moreover, the United States already spends more money on research, development, test and evaluation—as measured in constant dollars of total obligational authority, or TOA—of weapons systems than the United States did at the height of the defense spending buildup under President Ronald Reagan in FY 1987. Obama should be able to trim these costs by at least $10 billion, to help cover new operations in Afghanistan.8 Finally, as tens of thousands of service members begin to redeploy from Iraq next year, funds can be reprogrammed from Iraq to fund continued operations in Afghanistan. In the pages that follow, we’ll detail precisely how these ten defense spending programs can be cut or reined in significantly to pay for the increase in troop strength in Afghanistan. The United States can pay for the wars we fight, just as we have done in the past. We need only the political will to do so.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Afghanistan has not been a stable, unified state with a strong centralized government in three decades. The cultural and political institutions for a single national force may simply no longer exist. But Afghanistan, owing in part to necessity and in part to the tumultuous processes that have shaped the country, retains functional, if weak, security infrastructure at the provincial level. In the post-Soviet power vacuum and throughout periods of civil war, warlords arose to lead local militias. Many of them still remain in place--they were among our strongest allies in routing the Taliban's hold on the government--and have settled into more stationary roles somewhere between warlord and governor. Local rule has become the Afghan way. Local leaders who operate their own provincial forces, after all, stake their very lives on the security of their realm. By working with these leaders to establish and train local militias and police, rather than troubled and mistrusted national forces, the U.S. could find its route to Afghan stability and exit. In parts of Afghanistan, strong provincial leadership has already developed security separate from national leadership. In the relatively peaceful and prosperous northern region of Mazar-E-Sharif, Governor Atta Mohammad Noor, himself a former warlord who fought against the Soviets and Taliban, commands authority <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125745832585731891.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" rel="nofollow">rivaling</a> that of President Karzai. Unlike Karzai, Noor is popular among his constituents and his province enjoys remarkable stability. The local military officials are loyal to him before Karzai, if they are loyal to Karzai at all. By promoting local governance and directing our military training and assistance to forces loyal to that governance, the U.S. could promote other strong provincial leaders like Noor. Like Noor, many of these are likely to be former or current warlords. Warlords, despite their scary name, can be our strongest allies. They tend to be non-ideological and fervently anti-Taliban. Their fates are tied to the local populaces they govern. They're corrupt and tax heavily, but they provide real security and are trusted. Their ambitions are not for anti-Western war or fundamentalism, but sovereignty, security, and domination. None of these men is Thomas Jefferson, but in a country of many evil and exploitative forces, they are the best that Afghan civilians or American forces are likely to get. ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿</span><br />

I am too lazy to continue specific debates so I'll just say<br />
<br />
<strong>vs. Regular Affs</strong><br />
- probably will go for a Disad and Case<br />
- Multiplank advantage counterplans are cool too<br />
- I like to extend topicality - and also like going for it <br />
- Haven't really gone for a K much, i wouldn't worry about it <br />
vs. Kritk affs<br />
- usually go for a Word Pic, or Disad and case - ussually read impact turns in the 1nc though<br />
- if theres no fiat - i have always gone for framework
