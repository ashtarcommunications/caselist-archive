Thus the plan:

<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">
</span>

The United States federal government should develop a fleet of large-scale solar sails and deploy them beyond the Earth’s mesosphere.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">New mission opportunities applying solar-sail technologies are currently being addressed by NASA also. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), for instance, has recently completed a study of a proposed Solar Polar Sail Mission that would use solar-sail propulsion to place a spacecraft in a circular 4-month orbit at a distance of 0.48 AU from the Sun with an inclination of 90o. The mission would provide data on the solar corona to complement observations of the Sun’s disk and the solarwind data obtained near Earth. Another potential solar-sail mission, proposed by NOAA in cooperation with NASA as well as by European scientists, is a sailcraft to be stationed sunward of the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L1. Solar photon pressure on the sail would be required for the sailcraft to fly inside the L1 point whilst remaining on the Earth-Sun line (the outward radial force on the sail must compensate for the lower centrifugal force on the sailcraft). From this vantage point, the sailcraft would deliver a factor 2 improvement in solar-storm warning time (60 min compared to 30 min) over a conventional satellite stationed at L1. A similar mission concept called ‘Vigiwind’ was proposed in Europe by U3P and CNES in 1996. </span>
