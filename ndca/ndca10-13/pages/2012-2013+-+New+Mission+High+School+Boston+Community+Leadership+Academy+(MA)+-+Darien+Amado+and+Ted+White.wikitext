**Mass Transit**

<span style="text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Contention 1: Inherency</span></span>


1. Current transportation spending is heavily tilted towards highways
Milkowsky 2011(Brina Milikowsky, researcher, Building America’s Future Educational Fund, BUILDING AMERICA’S FUTURE: FALLING APART AND FALLING BEHIND, Transportation Infrastructure Report 2011, p. 16.)


2. Federal Funding on Mass Transit is decreasing and funds are currently being shifted towards funding highway projects
Milkowsky 2011(Brina Milikowsky, researcher, Building America’s Future Educational Fund, BUILDING AMERICA’S FUTURE: FALLING APART AND FALLING BEHIND, Transportation Infrastructure Report 2011, p. 16.)


Contention 2: Harms 

Scenario 1: Social Inequity

1. Transportation in the status quo disconnects the poor from job opportunities. Without access to reliable transportation, poor people have no ability to receive quality employment


__2. Furthermore, Lack of Public Transportation constrains students from attending school, which disincentives them from pursuing higher education__ 

Sanchez at al 03




3. Isolating the poor from the job markets and educational opportunities creates a gap between the wealthy and the poor that drags us to an unsustainable future.
Jean Mercier, 2009 (Author on social justice, Administrative Theory & Praxis31. 2, "Equity, Social Justice, and Sustainable Urban Transportation in the Twenty-First Century", :)


4. Failure to address transportation inequality guarantees cycles of poverty

====5. Poverty is a hidden evil that systematically targets the weak and poor, constantly causing harm. It is the biggest impact in this debate and should be preferred for moral reasoning.====

THUS MY PARTNER AND I PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING PLAN: 


**The United States federal government should substantially increase its investment in urban mass transit systems. We have the right to clarify our intent**


Contention 3: Solvency 


1. Increasing investment in mass transit is crucial to decrease social inequality and allow the poor to gain access to jobs, education, and social services

**2. Public transit helps strengthen local economies** **and reduces poverty by helping those without transportation obtain jobs that were previously out of reach.**

__**Socialism Aff**__

====The GOP is making it so that all transportation infrastructure plans passed in the status quo are carried out by private corporations who view the projects in terms of the procurement of capital. This takes away from how transportation infrastructure is supposed to be a social service and a stepping stone to socialism.====

===Contention 1 is Poverty=== 
====1. The reason poverty exists in the first place is because of structural dynamics of capitalism that require exclusion. Colonialism, neoliberalism, and resources exploitation are all symptoms of order that privileges profit over people. History is on our side capitalism has produced massive poverty in Africa because the functioning of the global economy require the subordination and exclusion of the vast majority of the population for the benefit of the wealthy – nature of capitalism requires winners and losers====
