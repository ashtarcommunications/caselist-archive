“Animal rights, also…of human beings”
Prefer this interp because it is the most predictable since it accounts for common usage. Predictability links to fairness.
Justice is no different from any other normative concept. Normative claims must be objective.
Normative claims must provide internal motivation. Justice must thus be based in agency.
No agent can reject the principles of reason and everything terminates in practical reason.
Contracts don’t answer the normative question.
Even trying to escape reasons concedes the authority of reasons.
It follows from reason that our judgments must be consistent. Moral knowledge follows the same principle of consistency that theoretical knowledge follows. **Reath:**
Andrews Reath, “Formal Approaches to Kant’s Formula of Humanity,” 2009 (To appear in Sorin Baiasu and Mark Timmons, eds, //Kant on Practical Justification: Interpretive Essays// (Oxford University Press)
“A formal principle…must be withdrawn.”
Util fails. We can’t predict net benefits.
Standard: endorsing non-contradictory claims.
Justice cannot aggregate individuals.
Intent is the morally relevant characteristic of action.
Consistency in reasoning demands respecting the freedom of others because willing the repression of another’s freedom is contradictory.**Engstrom:**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Stephen Engstrom, “Universal Legislation As the Form of Practical Knowledge,” Email me if you want the article. I have it but don’t know where it appears online. </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">“Now on the…the same freedom”</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Animals pursue things and express outer freedom in the same way as humans, so we are required to treat them as ends as well. **Korsgaard:**</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The resolution assumes animal rights. Challenging assumptions violates predictability and doesn’t negate.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">We have to respect animals because we respect humans.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">We can have moral obligations to things that aren’t capable of reason.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Presume aff and prefer aff interps because of time skew and adaptability. We need proactive reasons to exclude groups from justice.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Both debaters must impact all offense proving the resolution true or false to one necessary and sufficient standard when the AC only impacts to one necessary and sufficient standard. Key to reciprocity which links to fairness. Key to clash which links to education. Vote on fairness. Drop the debater.</span>

V: Justice

Justice is any other normative concept like morality.

Internalism is the meta-ethic; reasons can only be generated in an internal manner.

Paul Katstafanas [Boston University], “Deriving Ethics from Action: A Nietzschean Version of Constitutivism,” //Philosophy and Phenomenological Research//, 2011
[While externalism captures…direction of internalism]

Thus, the only coherent source of justice is contractarianism.

David Gauthier, //Morals by Agreement//, 1986
[Moral principles are…in their affairs]

Also, objective morality can’t take into account appeals to intuition.

Ayer, AJ, //Language, Truth, and Logic//, Pg. 106, 1952 Dover Publications
[A feature of… genuine synthetic proportions.]

Thus, the affirmative burden is to prove that animals can participate in a contractarian system of justice.

I contend that animals cannot reason practically at a level of contractarian decision-making, and they don’t have a system of regulations to bind them to contractarian justice.

Presume neg.
1.) Don’t assume justice exists without proving otherwise
2.) Affirmative speaks first and last, so they have a theoretical advantage coming into the round
3.) A statement is more often false than true
4.) To negate is to deny the truth of, so you default neg when there's doubt that the resolution is true
