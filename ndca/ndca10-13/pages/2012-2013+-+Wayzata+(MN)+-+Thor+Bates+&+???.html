Notes<br />
<br />
My partner varies so often I would appear 6 or 7 times if there was a link for each different partner I've had, hence the quesiton marks to save space and my time. I put the 1AC up, since I'm a 2A, and it's full text since some of my sources don't have URLs that I know of it. The text is really small so you can put it in a word doc to read or just check out the tags. I don't have 2AC blocks up, mainly because I rarely see 1NCs that are up to date, and leaving out of date junk on my page isn't helpful to negative teams either. If you volunteer 1NC cites and tags before round (to generic offcase), I'll give you 2AC block cites and tags - an ethic of reciprocity is what I ask. The same goes for when I'm on the neg (I'll give 1NC cites and tags if you give 2AC cites and tags.) I'm not enthused to disclose that much (being aff or neg), but willingly do so when these conditions are met. If you don't care about 1NC cites for generic offcase, then I won't ask to see your 2AC cites and tags either. I'm also a 1N, hence not much 1NC stuff or past strats. Questions about the aff, ask me. If you like full text, feel free to reciprocate on your wiki page.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8px;">If you live in Los Angeles, Orlando, Cincinnati, Chicago, Milwaukee, Raleigh, or any number of other U.S. cities, chances are you’ve read a news story that started something like this: “Imagine stepping on a train in [your city] and stepping off in [another major city] just two-and-a-half hours later. This dream could become a reality in the next [unrealistic number] years, thanks to plans for a national network of high-speed rail lines.” Well, you can stop imagining it now. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">High-speed rail isn’t happening in America. Not anytime soon. </span><span style="font-size: 8px;">Probably not ever. The questions now are (1) what killed it, and (2) should we mourn its passing? </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">There was a brief burst of enthusiasm around the future of high-speed rail in January 2010, when President Obama announced $8 billion in federal stimulus spending to start building “America’s first nationwide program of high-speed intercity passenger rail service.” Since then, however, the project’s chances of success have been heading</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> in one direction: </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">downhill.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> First, Tea Party conservatives in Florida and wealthy liberal suburbanites in the Bay Area began questioning their states’ plans. Then, just as Joe Biden was calling for $53 billion in high-speed-rail spending over the next six years, a crop of freshly elected Republican governors turned down billions in federal money for lines in Wisconsin, Ohio, and Florida. Finally, Republicans in Congress zeroed out the federal high-speed rail budget last month. (To understand why conservatives hate trains, see my colleague Dave Weigel’s story from earlier this year.) Advertisement Though Republicans’ outright rejection of high-speed rail is short-sighted, so were many of the plans themselves. Rather than focus on the few corridors that need high-speed rail lines the most, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the Obama administration doled out half a billion here and</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> half a billion </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">there, a strategy better-suited to currying political support than to addressing real infrastructure problems</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Spread across 10 corridors, each between 100 and 600 miles long, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Obama’s rail system would have been, at best, a disjointed patchwork.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> The nation’s most gridlocked corridor, along the East Coast between Washington, D.C. and Boston, was left out of the plans entirely. Worse, much of the money was allocated to projects that weren’t high-speed rail at all. The Europeans define high-speed trains as those that travel at speeds of 155 miles per hour or more (or 125 mph for tracks that are upgraded, rather than newly built). Wisconsin’s proposed $823 million Milwaukee-to-Madison line was to reach 110 mph, at most, in between stops in cities such as Brookfield and Oconomowoc. Ohio’s version was even slower, with trains on an upgraded freight-rail track topping out at 79 mph. With stops, the trip from Cincinnati to Cleveland would have been significantly slower by rail than by car. Who would ride such a thing? Former Ohio governor Ted Strickland, a Democrat, bemoaned the jobs that would be lost when his Republican successor killed the project. But at a cost of $400 million, this was job creation of the sort that John Maynard Keynes himself would have eyed skeptically. Florida’s $2.4 billion Tampa-to-Orlando line made more sense, but it was no surprise that Republican Gov. Rick Scott nixed it in February. By that time, high-speed rail had already become a punch line among fiscal conservatives. For all that, a line in California, connecting Los Angeles to San Francisco, still seemed to stand a chance. Unlike its counterparts elsewhere in the country, the California line would be true, dedicated high-speed rail, with trains running up to 220 mph. It would connect two metropolises of seven-million-plus people that are just far enough apart to make a drive unappetizing (six hours sans traffic) and a plane hop unwieldy. And the plans were already in place; the state had been working on a high-speed rail line for decades and lacked only the money to execute it. It was, it seemed, the perfect showcase for the Obama stimulus. This was more than just digging holes in the ground—it was putting people to work building something that the country needed anyway. Not only is California’s Interstate 5 congested and getting worse, but air traffic between San Francisco and Los Angeles is beginning to be a problem as well. Without high-speed trains, the state will need to build more highways, more airports, or both. But for a state that recently passed a law limiting greenhouse gas emissions, electric trains make far more environmental sense. And they’re popular—the state’s voters had approved a $10 billion bond issue for the rail line even before Obama announced his own high-speed plans. So what went wrong? The project was oversold from the beginning, with projections of 100 million riders per year and healthy operating profits—yes, profits, on a railroad—leading to skepticism even among those inclined to support it. Along with the usual conservative opponents, the wealthy liberals living along the railroad’s proposed path in Palo Alto and neighboring cities—sufficiently motivated by the prospect of trains roaring literally through their backyards—began to uncover holes in the financing scheme as well. Rather than take them seriously, the rail line’s bullheaded backers attempted to steamroll the opposition, branding them NIMBYs and “rotten apples.” Sure, they were NIMBYs, but it didn’t make them wrong. And when they leveraged their connections and media savvy to get state lawmakers, academics, and journalists like me to investigate, the findings that came back damaged the project’s credibility. Under pressure to come up with more realistic projections, state rail authorities admitted last month that the project would take twice as long to build as they’d originally claimed, attract fewer riders, and cost twice as much. The honesty was welcome, but it came too late: A poll released this week showed the public has turned against high-speed rail altogether, with nearly two-thirds saying they’d like a chance to reconsider. Some will point out that California’s high-speed rail plan still isn’t dead, exactly. (It’s “more of a zombie,” one blogger quipped.) State officials, backed by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, have concentrated their efforts on building just one leg, from agricultural Fresno to dusty Bakersfield, as a sort of desperate foot-in-the-door tactic. They still have the Obama adminstration’s support. “We are not going to be dissuaded by critics,” transportation secretary Ray LaHood said this week. &quot;We are only at the beginning of this multi-generational process—the simple fact is that the transportation challenges that are driving increased demand for rail are not going away.&quot; That’s true, but the chances that California—or the country—will meet those challenges now look dim. The modern federal government isn’t good at solving long-term problems (if it ever was). Most Republicans don’t believe the government should solve problems. They believe big government, in fact, is the one of the only problems that can’t be solved by the free market. Democrats, as seen in the failures of all of these railroad projects, err by assuming that the government can solve problems more effectively than it realistically can. Ultimately, high-speed rail’s backers weren’t as staunch as its detractors. Barack Obama and congressional Democrats put their political lives on the line for health care, addressing an immediate problem whose consequences were personal and visceral. The nation’s outdated infrastructure is a major dilemma but one that doesn’t feel as pressing to most voters and legislators. It’s our children’s problem now. If there’s a silver lining to high-speed rail’s spectacular failure, it’s that these trains were outdated years ago. Even if all went according to the Obama administration’s plans, the nation’s rail network would have remained meager and backward by comparison to those in Japan and China. Those countries are already building trains that run via magnetic levitation. Suspended a few inches above a guideway, maglev trains fly through the air at speeds greater than 300 mph, with minimal wear and tear. At this point in their development, maglev tracks are dauntingly expensive to build. But those costs might well come down by the time America is ready to get serious about its transportation infrastructure. At this rate, there seems to be plenty of time.</span><br />

<strong>1. Warming is real, anthropogenic, and the largest existential risk – vast international scientific evidence accumulates weekly</strong><br />
<u><strong>Deibel 7</strong></u> (Terry L, Professor of IR @ National War College, “Foreign Affairs Strategy: Logic for American Statecraft”, Conclusion: American Foreign Affairs Strategy Today)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8px;">Finally, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">there is one major existential threat</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> to American security (as well as prosperity) of a nonviolent nature, which, though far in the future, demands urgent action. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">It is</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> the threat of </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">global warming</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> to the stability of the climate upon which all earthly life depends. Scientists worldwide have been observing the gathering of this threat for three decades now, and what was once a mere possibility has passed through probability to near certainty. Indeed </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">not one of more than 900 articles on climate change published in refereed scientific journals</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> from 1993 to 2003 </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">doubted that anthropogenic warming is occurring</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. “In legitimate scientific circles,” writes Elizabeth Kolbert, “it is virtually impossible to find evidence of disagreement over the fundamentals of global warming.” Evidence from a vast international scientific monitoring effort accumulates almost weekly, as this sample of newspaper reports shows: </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">an international panel predicts</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> “brutal </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">droughts, floods and</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> violent </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">storms</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> across the planet over the next century”; climate change could “literally alter ocean currents, wipe away huge portions of Alpine Snowcaps and aid the spread of cholera and malaria”; “glaciers in the Antarctic and in Greenland are melting much faster than expected, and…worldwide, plants are blooming several days earlier than a decade ago”; “rising sea temperatures have been accompanied by a significant global increase in the most destructive hurricanes”; “NASA scientists have concluded from direct temperature measurements that 2005 was the hottest year on record, with 1998 a close second”; “</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Earth’s warming climate is estimated to contribute to more than 150,000 deaths and 5 million illnesses each year</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">” as disease spreads; “widespread bleaching from Texas to Trinidad…killed broad swaths of corals” due to a 2-degree rise in sea temperatures. “The world is slowly disintegrating,” concluded Inuit hunter Noah Metuq, who lives 30 miles from the Arctic Circle. “They call it climate change…but we just call it breaking up.” From the founding of the first cities some 6,000 years ago until the beginning of the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere remained relatively constant at about 280 parts per million (ppm). At present they are accelerating toward 400 ppm, and by 2050 they will reach 500 ppm, about double pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, atmospheric CO2 lasts about a century, so there is no way immediately to reduce levels, only to slow their increase, we are thus in for significant global warming; </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the only debate is how much and how serious the effects will be</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. As the newspaper stories quoted above show, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">we are already experiencing the effects of 1-2 degree warming in</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> more violent </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">storms</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, spread of </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">disease</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, mass die offs of plants and animals, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">species extinction, and</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> threatened </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">inundation of low-lying countries</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> like the Pacific nation of Kiribati and the Netherlands at a warming of 5 degrees or less the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could disintegrate, leading to a sea level of rise of 20 feet that would cover North Carolina’s outer banks, swamp the southern third of Florida, and inundate Manhattan up to the middle of Greenwich Village. Another catastrophic effect would be the collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation that keeps the winter weather in Europe far warmer than its latitude would otherwise allow. Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. But </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming,</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures. Past ice age transitions, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, took place in just decades, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “humankind’s continuing enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and humanity’s life support system. At worst, says physics professor Marty Hoffert of New York University, “we’re just going to burn everything up; we’re going to heat the atmosphere to the temperature it was in the Cretaceous when there were crocodiles at the poles, and then </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">everything will collapse</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">.” During the Cold War, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized a theory of nuclear winter to describe how a thermonuclear war between the Untied States and the Soviet Union would not only destroy both countries but possibly end life on this planet. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Global warming is the</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> post-Cold War era’s </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">equivalent of nuclear winter</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> at least as serious </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">and considerably better supported scientifically.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> Over the long run </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">it puts dangers from terrorism and</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> traditional </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">military challenges to shame. It is a threat</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> not only to the security and prosperity to the United States, but potentially </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">to the continued existence of life on this planet.</span><br />

<strong>2. Media skepticism and denier research should be rejected – they are paid off and don’t write in peer reviewed scientific journals</strong><br />
<br />
<u><strong>Lewandowsky and Ashley 11</strong></u> (6/24, Stephan, Professor of Cognitive Studies at the University of Western Australia, and Michael, Professor of Astrophysics at the University of New South Wales, “The false, the confused and the mendacious: how the media gets it wrong on climate change,” 6/24/11, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1188:http://theconversation.edu.au/the-false-the-confused-and-the-mendacious-how-the-media-gets-it-wrong-on-climate-change-1558 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://theconversation.edu.au/the-false-the-confused-and-the-mendacious-how-the-media-gets-it-wrong-on-climate-change-1558" rel="nofollow">http://theconversation.edu.au/the-false-the-confused-and-the-mendacious-how-the-media-gets-it-wrong-on-climate-change-1558</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1188 --><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8px;">Some people will be understandably sceptical about that last statement. But when they read up on the science, and have their questions answered by climate scientists, they come around. These people are true sceptics, and a degree of scepticism is healthy. Other people will disagree with the scientific consensus on climate change, and will challenge the science on internet blogs and opinion pieces in the media, but no matter how many times they are shown to be wrong, they will never change their opinions. These people are deniers. The recent articles in The Conversation have put the deniers under the microscope. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Some readers have asked us in the comments to address the scientific questions that the deniers bring up. This has been done. Not once. Not twice. Not ten times. Probably more like 100 or a 1000 times. Denier arguments have been dealt with by scientists, again and again and again</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. But like zombies, the deniers </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">keep coming back with the same long-falsified and nonsensical arguments</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. The </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">deniers</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> have seemingly endless enthusiasm to post on blogs, write letters to editors, write opinion pieces for newspapers, and even publish books. What they </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">rarely</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> do is </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">write coherent scientific papers on their theories and submit them to scientific journals. The few published papers that have been sceptical about climate change have not withstood the test of time</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. The phony debate on climate change So if the evidence is this strong, why is there resistance to action on climate change in Australia? At least two reasons can be cited. First, as The Conversation has revealed, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">there are a handful of individuals and organisations who, by avoiding peer review, have engineered a phony public debate about the science, when in fact that debate is absent from the one arena where our scientific knowledge is formed</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. These individuals and organisations have so far largely escaped accountability. But their free ride has come to an end, as the next few weeks on The Conversation will continue to show. The second reason, alas, involves systemic failures by the media. Systemic media failures arise from several presumptions about the way science works, which range from being utterly false to dangerously ill-informed to overtly malicious and mendacious. The false Let’s begin with what is merely false. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">A tacit presumption of many in the media and the public is that climate science is a brittle house of cards that can be brought down by a single new finding or the discovery of a single error</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Nothing could be further from the truth. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Climate science is a cumulative enterprise built upon hundreds of years of research.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> The heat-trapping properties of CO</span>₂<span style="font-size: 8px;"> were discovered in the middle of the 19th century, pre-dating even Sherlock Holmes and Queen Victoria. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The resulting robust knowledge will not be overturned by a single new finding.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> A further false presumption of the media is that scientific opinions must somehow be balanced by an opposing view. While balance is an appropriate conversational frame for the political sphere, it is wholly inappropriate for scientific issues, where what matters is the balance of evidence, not opinion. At first glance, one might be tempted to forgive the media’s inappropriate inclusion of unfounded contrarian opinions, given that its function is to stimulate broad debate in which, ideally, even exotic opinions are given a voice. But the media by and large do not report the opinions of 9/11 “truthers” who think that the attacks were an “inside job” of the Bush administration. The media also do not report the opinion of people who believe Prince Phillip runs the world’s drug trade. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The fact that equally outlandish pseudo-scientific nonsense about climate science can be sprouted on TV by a cat palmist is evidence not of an obsession with balance but of a striking and selective failure of editorial responsibility. What is needed instead of the false symmetry implied by “balance” is what the BBC calls impartiality – fact-based reporting that evaluates the evidence and comes to a reality-based conclusion. </span><br />

<strong>3. Global warming is proven real and dangerous – laundry list</strong><br />
<br />
<u><strong>Environmental Defense Fund 2009</strong></u> (a US-based nonprofit environmental advocacy group, “Global Warming Myths and Facts,” 1/13/2009, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1189:http://mrgreenbiz.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/global-warming-myths-and-facts-2/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://mrgreenbiz.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/global-warming-myths-and-facts-2/" rel="nofollow">http://mrgreenbiz.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/global-warming-myths-and-facts-2/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1189 -->)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8px;">There is no debate among scientists about the basic facts of global warming. The most respected scientific bodies have stated unequivocally that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">global warming is occurring, and people are causing it by burning fossil fuels</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (like coal, oil and natural gas) and cutting down forests. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences, which in 2005 the White House called &quot;the gold standard of objective scientific assessment,&quot; issued a joint statement with 10 other National Academies of Science saying &quot;the scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action. It is vital that all nations identify cost-effective steps that they can take now, to contribute to substantial and long-term reduction in net global greenhouse gas emissions.&quot; (Joint Statement of Science Academies: Global Response to Climate Change [PDF], 2005) The only debate in the science community about global warming is about how much and how fast warming will continue as a result of heat-trapping emissions. Scientists have given a clear warning about global warming, and we have more than enough facts — about causes and fixes — to implement solutions right now. MYTH Even if global warming is a problem, addressing it will hurt American industry and workers. FACT A well designed trading program will harness American ingenuity to decrease heat-trapping pollution cost-effectively, jumpstarting a new carbon economy. Claims that fighting global warming will cripple the economy and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs are unfounded. In fact, companies that are already reducing their heat-trapping emissions have discovered that cutting pollution can save money. The cost of a comprehensive national greenhouse gas reduction program will depend on the precise emissions targets, the timing for the reductions and the means of implementation. An independent MIT study found that a modest cap-and-trade system would cost less than $20 per household annually and have no negative impact on employment. Experience has shown that properly designed emissions trading programs can reduce compliance costs significantly compared with other regulatory approaches. For example, the U.S. acid rain program reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 30 percent from 1990 levels and cost industry a fraction of what the government originally estimated, according to EPA. Furthermore, a mandatory cap on emissions could spur technological innovation that could create jobs and wealth. Letting global warming continue until we are forced to address it on an emergency basis could disrupt and severely damage our economy. It is far wiser and more cost-effective to act now. MYTH Water vapor is the most important, abundant greenhouse gas. So if we’re going to control a greenhouse gas, why don’t we control it instead of carbon dioxide (CO2)? FACT Although water vapor traps more heat than CO2, because of the relationships among CO2, water vapor and climate, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">to fight global warming nations must focus on controlling CO2</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Atmospheric levels of CO2 are determined by how much coal, natural gas and oil we burn and how many trees we cut down, as well as by natural processes like plant growth. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Atmospheric levels of water vapor</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, on the other hand, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">cannot be directly controlled by people</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">; rather, they are determined by temperatures. The warmer the atmosphere, the more water vapor it can hold. As a result, water vapor is part of an amplifying effect. Greenhouse gases like CO2 warm the air, which in turn adds to the stock of water vapor, which in turn traps more heat and accelerates warming. Scientists know this because of satellite measurements documenting a rise in water vapor concentrations as the globe has warmed. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The best way to lower temperature and</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> thus </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">reduce water vapor levels is to reduce CO2 emissions. MYTH Global warming and extra CO2 will actually be beneficial</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> — they reduce cold-related deaths and stimulate crop growth. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">FACT Any beneficial effects will be far outweighed by damage and disruption. Even a warming in just the middle range of scientific projections would have devastating impacts on many sectors of the economy</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Rising seas would inundate coastal communities, contaminate water supplies with salt and increase the risk of flooding by storm surge, affecting tens of millions of people globally. Moreover, extreme weather events, including heat waves, droughts and floods, are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity, causing loss of lives and property and throwing agriculture into turmoil. Even though higher levels of CO2 can act as a plant fertilizer under some conditions, scientists now think that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the &quot;CO2 fertilization&quot; effect on crops has been overstated; in natural ecosystems, the fertilization effect can diminish after a few years as plants acclimate. Furthermore, increased CO2 may benefit undesirable, weedy species more than desirable species</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Higher levels of CO2 have already caused ocean acidification, and scientists are warning of potentially devastating effects on marine life and fisheries. Moreover, higher levels of regional ozone (smog), a result of warmer temperatures, could worsen respiratory illnesses. Less developed countries and natural ecosystems may not have the capacity to adapt. The notion that there will be regional “winners” and “losers” in global warming is based on a world-view from the 1950’s. We live in a global community. Never mind the moral implications — when an environmental catastrophe creates millions of refugees half-way around the world, Americans are affected. MYTH Global warming is just part of a natural cycle. The Arctic has warmed up in the past. FACT </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The global warming we are experiencing is not natural. People are causing it</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. People are causing global warming by burning fossil fuels (like oil, coal and natural gas) and cutting down forests. Scientists have shown that these </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">activities are pumping far more CO2 into the atmosphere than was ever released in hundreds of thousands of years.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> This buildup of CO2 is the biggest cause of global warming. Since 1895, scientists have known that CO2 and other greenhouse gases trap heat and warm the earth. As the warming has intensified over the past three decades, scientific scrutiny has increased along with it. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Scientists have considered and ruled out other, natural explanations</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> such as sunlight, volcanic eruptions and cosmic rays. (IPCC 2001) Though natural amounts of CO2 have varied from 180 to 300 parts per million (ppm), today's CO2 levels are around 380 ppm. That's 25% more than the highest natural levels over the past 650,000 years. Increased CO2 levels have contributed to periods of higher average temperatures throughout that long record. (Boden, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center) As for </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">previous Arctic warming</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, it is true that there were stretches of warm periods over the Arctic earlier in the 20th century. The limited records available for that time period indicate that the warmth did not affect as many areas or persist from year to year as much as the current warmth. But that episode, however warm it was, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">is not relevant</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> to the issue at hand. Why? For one, a brief regional trend does not discount a longer global phenomenon. We know that the planet has been warming over the past several decades and Arctic ice has been melting persistently. And unlike the earlier periods of Arctic warmth, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">there is no expectation that the current upward trend in Arctic temperatures will reverse</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">; the rising concentrations of greenhouse gases will prevent that from happening. MYTH We can adapt to climate change — civilization has survived droughts and temperature shifts before. FACT Although humans as a whole have survived the vagaries of drought, stretches of warmth and cold and more, entire societies have collapsed from dramatic climatic shifts. The </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">current warming of our climate will bring</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> major hardships and economic dislocations — untold human suffering, especially for our children and grandchildren. We are already seeing significant costs from today's global warming which is caused by greenhouse gas pollution. Climate has changed in the past and human societies have survived, but today six billion people depend on interconnected ecosystems and complex technological infrastructure. What's more, unless we limit the amount of heat-trapping gases we are putting into the atmosphere, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">we</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> will </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">face a warming trend unseen since human civilization began</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> 10,000 years ago. (IPCC 2001) The consequences of continued warming at current rates are likely to be dire. Many densely populated areas, such as low-lying coastal regions, are highly vulnerable to climate shifts. A middle-of-the-range projection is that the homes of 13 to 88 million people around the world would be flooded by the sea each year in the 2080s. Poorer countries and small island nations will have the hardest time adapting. (McLean et al. 2001) In what appears to be the first forced move resulting from climate change, 100 residents of Tegua island in the Pacific Ocean were evacuated by the government because rising sea levels were flooding their island. Some 2,000 other islanders plan a similar move to escape rising waters. In the United States, the village of Shishmaref in Alaska, which has been inhabited for 400 years, is collapsing from melting permafrost. Relocation plans are in the works. Scarcity of water and food could lead to major conflicts with broad ripple effects throughout the globe. Even if people find a way to adapt, the wildlife and plants on which we depend may be unable to adapt to rapid climate change. While the world itself will not end, the world as we know it may disappear. MYTH Recent cold winters and cool summers don’t feel like global warming to me. FACT </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">While different pockets of the country have experienced some cold winters here and there, the overall trend is warmer winters</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Measurements show that over the last century the Earth’s climate has warmed overall, in all seasons, and in most regions. Climate skeptics mislead the public when they claim that the winter of 2003–2004 was the coldest ever in the northeastern United States. That winter was only the 33rd coldest in the region since records began in 1896. Furthermore, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">a single year of cold weather in one region of the globe is not an indication of a trend in the global climate</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, which refers to a long-term average over the entire planet. MYTH Global warming can’t be happening because some glaciers and ice sheets are growing, not shrinking. FACT </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">In most parts of the world, the retreat of glaciers has been dramatic</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. The best available scientific data indicate that Greenland's massive ice sheet is shrinking. Between 1961 and 1997, the world’s glaciers lost 890 cubic miles of ice. The consensus among scientists is that rising air temperatures are the most important factor behind the retreat of glaciers on a global scale over long time periods. Some glaciers in western Norway, Iceland and New Zealand have been expanding during the past few decades. That </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">expansion is a result of regional increases in storm frequency and snowfall rather than colder temperatures</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> — not at all incompatible with a global warming trend. In Greenland, a NASA satellite that can measure the ice mass over the whole continent has found that although there is variation from month to month, over the longer term, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the ice is disappearing</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. In fact, there are worrisome signs that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">melting is accelerating</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">: glaciers are moving into the ocean twice as fast as a decade ago, and, over time, more and more glaciers have started to accelerate. What is most alarming is the prediction, based on model calculations and historical evidence, that an approximately 5.4 degree Fahrenheit increase in local Greenland temperatures will lead to irreversible meltdown and a sea-level rise of over 20 feet. Since the Arctic is warming 2-3 times faster than the global average, this tipping point is not far away. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The only study that has shown increasing ice mass in Greenland only looked at the interior of the ice sheet, not at the edges where melting occurs</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. This is actually in line with climate model predictions that global warming would lead to a short-term accumulation of ice in the cold interior due to heavier snowfall. (Similarly, scientists have predicted that Antarctica overall will gain ice in the near future due to heavier snowfall.) The scientists who published the study were careful to point out that their results should not be used to conclude that Greenland's ice mass as a whole is growing. In addition, their data suggested that the </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">accumulation of snow in the middle of the continent is likely to decrease over time as global warming continues.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> MYTH Accurate weather predictions a few days in advance are hard to come by. Why on earth should we have confidence in climate projections decades from now? FACT </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Climate prediction is fundamentally different from weather prediction, just as climate is different from weather</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. It is often more difficult to make an accurate weather forecast than a climate prediction. The accuracy of weather forecasting is critically dependent upon being able to exactly and comprehensively characterize the present state of the global atmosphere. Climate prediction relies on other, longer ranging factors. For instance, we might not know if it will be below freezing on a specific December day in New England, but we know from our understanding of the region's climate that the temperatures during the month will generally be low. Similarly, climate tells us that Seattle and London tend to be rainy, Florida and southern California are usually warm, and the Southwest is often dry and hot. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Today’s climate models can now reproduce the observed global average climates over the past century and beyond</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Such findings have reinforced scientist’s confidence in the capacity of models to produce reliable projections of future climate. Current climate assessments typically consider the results from a range of models and scenarios for future heat-trapping emissions in order to identify the most likely range for future climatic change.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8px;">Most Americans today believe that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the burning of fossil fuels is causing global warming</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, but not everybody agrees. Climate contrarians proclaim that global warming is not occurring at all, or that it is occurring but is entirely natural, i.e., that the anthropogenic (human) contribution to global warming is negligible. The contrarian ranks include the well-known radical journalist Alexander Cockburn, who forcefully proclaimed anthropogenic global warming to be a myth in three articles published in 2007 on the CounterPunch Web site and in The Nation.1 I have been reading Cockburn’s political writings with pleasure, and usually with agreement, for three decades, dating back to his career at The Village Voice. However, as a physics professor who has lectured on global warming since 2001, I emphatically disagree with Cockburn’s perspective on global warming.2 I am also dissatisfied with the quality of much of the response that Cockburn’s articles have evoked, as judged by the letters columns in The Nation.3 Most climate scientists believe that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the human contribution to today’s global warming is important,</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> and cannot by any means be dismissed as negligible. The consequences of global warming are potentially very dangerous. In view of the importance of the issue, and in view of Cockburn’s prominent (and well-deserved) role as a left intellectual and his formidable powers of persuasion, it is worthwhile restating the scientific case for modern anthropogenic global warming. The present article consists of (1) a summary of the scientific case for modern anthropogenic global warming, (2) a summary of the contrarian case advanced by Cockburn, (3) an assessment of global warming in greater depth, and (4) my detailed critique of the contrarian arguments advanced by Cockburn. The scientific case is not dependent on citation of authority, no matter how distinguished the authority may be. The case is dependent upon experimental evidence, logic, and reason. The present article does not touch on the impact of global warming, or on policy questions: what to do about global warming, whether the Kyoto treaty is a good idea or not, etc. Part 1: Summary of the Case for Modern Anthropogenic Global Warming </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">When sunlight strikes the earth, infrared radiation is emitted by the earth. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb this radiation, which results in a warming of the earth. The greenhouse effect is a very large effect: without greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the earth’s surface would likely be below the freezing point of water. Carbon dioxide</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (CO2) </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">in the atmosphere has been increasing since the Industrial Revolution began, due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels and to deforestation. This increase in greenhouse gases causes an enhanced greenhouse effect, which warms the earth. A straightforward calculation reveals that when the CO2 in the atmosphere reaches twice the pre-industrial level, the enhanced greenhouse effect alone</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (i.e., neglecting any response by the earth to the enhanced greenhouse effect) </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">will warm the earth by 1.2 to 1.3˚C</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. There is no significant controversy among scientists about this part of global warming. The earth will in fact respond to the increased temperature. This is called “feedback.” There is controversy about the magnitude of the feedback. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Analysis that takes feedback into account predicts global warming in the range of 1.5 to 4.5˚C</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (as indicated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC]). Controversies among climate scientists concern the magnitude of the warming, not whether or not it is occurring. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Climate is controlled by a number of factors, including changes in the earth’s orbit, possibly solar variability, possibly volcanoes, and the greenhouse effect. All but the last factor are entirely natural. Human activities are not the only contribution to the greenhouse effect</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Until the last two centuries, humanity had a negligible effect on climate, and </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">all climate change was naturally occurring. Some climate changes in the distant past have been very large</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (e.g., ice ages) and were not caused by humans. None of these statements refute the proposition that human activities (particularly burning fossil fuels) are an important contribution to the global warming that is occurring right now. Part 2: Summary of Alexander Cockburn’s Contrarian Arguments In his articles in The Nation and on the CounterPunch Web site, Alexander Cockburn makes six arguments against anthropogenic global warming: 1.During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the burning of fossil fuels plunged by 30 percent, but the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere did not decrease. Therefore, he contends, increased atmospheric CO2 does not come from the burning of fossil fuels. 2.Water vapor, not CO2, is the main greenhouse gas, and the portion of global warming attributable to CO2 is therefore tiny. 3.When the earth emerged from the most recent ice age some 10,000 years ago, the global temperature and the concentration of atmospheric CO2 both rose, but the temperature rise preceded a rise in atmospheric CO2. Therefore it was the warming that caused the rise in CO2 and not vice-versa. The warming was caused by a Milankovitch cycle, a small change in the earth’s motion. 4.The increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is caused by CO2 coming out of the oceans, not by the burning of fossil fuels. Hence the increase in atmospheric CO2 is natural, not anthropogenic. 5.The residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere is only a year or two before it dissolves in the ocean. This turns out to be important in supporting point 4 above. 6.The forecasts of anthropogenic global warming are entirely dependent on the results of large-scale computer models, which can be easily manipulated by the computer modelers to get any result they want by tweaking the variables in the computer models. Based on these scientific arguments, Cockburn goes on to argue that the computer modelers proclaim their unjustified doomsday forecasts in order to keep their grant funds flowing. He also argues that the nuclear power industry is supporting global warming hysteria in order to promote nuclear power. Part 3: Global Warming in More Depth </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The greenhouse effect warms the earth. The warming power of the sun is mostly in the visible and ultraviolet region of the spectrum. The surface of the earth re-radiates solar energy back toward space in the form of infrared light. Because of greenhouse gases in it, the atmosphere is transparent to the visible light coming from the sun, but opaque at many wavelengths in the infrared band, resulting in the trapping of thermal energy and the warming of the earth. This is the so-called greenhouse effect, which has been known for two centuries.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">4 The first scientist to realize that the atmosphere warms the earth may have been the French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier in the 1820s (who should not be confused with the journalist and utopian socialist Charles Fourier). </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The primary greenhouse gases are water vapor, CO2, and methane</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (natural gas, CH4). I don’t know any scientist who doubts that the greenhouse effect is a real effect. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Too many people fail to appreciate </span><span style="font-size: 8px;">how large the greenhouse effect really is. A simple calculation based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law shows that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">if there were no greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (and if nothing else about the earth changed as a result of removing the greenhouse gases), the average surface temperature of the earth would be –18˚C (–1˚F), which is below the freezing point of water</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">.5 The actual observed average surface temperature of the earth is 15˚C (59˚F). Thus </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the greenhouse effect raises the earth’s surface temperature by 33˚C (60˚F)</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. In this sense, global warming has already happened! Not only is the greenhouse effect a real effect, it is a large effect. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The greenhouse effect is intensifying as a result of the greenhouse gases building up in the atmosphere due primarily to CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (coal, oil, and natural gas) and deforestation. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Accurate data by direct experimental measurement was not available until 1959</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, when the geochemist C. D. Keeling started taking data at Mauna Loa, Hawaii. That measurement program has continued up to the present.6 Chart 1 shows the data from 1959 to the present. The data show a seasonal cycle that matches the growing season in the Northern Hemisphere, with a maximum in May and a minimum in October.7 </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Most significant is a long-term upward trend: from 315 ppm in 1958 to 387 ppm in 2008.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> While other aspects of global warming have been controversial, nobody has ever doubted the data from this measurement program. The data are rock solid. Several research teams have measured the atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the data from the different researchers are in agreement. Although the earliest data from direct measurement of CO2 in the atmosphere are from 1958, it is possible to extend the data earlier by examining air bubbles trapped in ice in Antarctica and Greenland. Data on the long-term CO2 trend show that the </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">CO2 level remained stable around 280 ppm during the last 10,000 years</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">.8 </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Then CO2 began to rise around the time of the Industrial Revolution, and is now 38 percent higher than pre-industrial levels. Climate scientists attribute the pre-industrial level of CO2</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (280 ppm) </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">to natural causes, and the rise since then to human activity, primarily due to the aforementioned causes</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">.

The question naturally arises, what will be the effect of increased greenhouse gases? Since the greenhouse effect is a real effect, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the buildup of greenhouse gases will result in an intensified greenhouse effect, resulting in increased global warming to some extent</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. In other words, the argument is over the amount of increased global warming, not over whether or not it is occurring. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The amount of increased global warming might be small or large, but it is a real effect. The important scientific question is whether or not increased global warming will be large enough to cause a problem.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> To answer this question, we need to understand in more detail how greenhouse gases absorb light in the infrared band. Different gases absorb light of different wavelengths. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Measurements from outside the earth’s atmosphere by a satellite show that CO2 has a particularly strong absorption of light around wavelengths of 15 micrometers.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">9 Gavin Schmidt in 2005, following work done by Ramanathan and Coakley in 1978, calculated the effect of greenhouse gases in the following way: </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">If you remove one gas from the atmosphere, while keeping all the other gases constant, what is the resulting percentage change in the infrared power that is absorbed by the atmosphere?</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">10 Schmidt obtained the following numbers, shown in table 1. Table 1. Contributions to the greenhouse effect by different greenhouse gases Source: Gavin Schmidt, (<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1192:http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=142 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=142" rel="nofollow">http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=142</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1192 -->). The data in table 1 were computed by assuming that one gas is removed from the atmosphere, leaving everything else unchanged. But since there is overlapping infrared absorption, the absorption from one species will interact with the absorption from another species. Some wavelengths of infrared light are absorbed by both water vapor and CO2. At these overlapping regions, if you remove water vapor alone (leaving the CO2), the CO2 will absorb the infrared light, while if you remove CO2 from the atmosphere (leaving the water vapor), the water vapor will absorb the infrared light. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Thus the absorption by one species depends on what other species are present in the atmosphere. This accounts for the otherwise puzzling fact that the numbers do not add up linearly: If you remove all water vapor from the atmosphere, the infrared absorption will decrease by 36 percent. If you remove all greenhouse gases</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (and clouds) </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">and leave only water vapor, the infrared absorption will decrease by 34 percent.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> The two do not add up to 100 percent, because of overlaps. All this is valuable background for the crucial question: How important is CO2 in the greenhouse effect? If you remove all the CO2 from the atmosphere, the infrared absorption decreases by 9 percent. If you remove all the greenhouse gases (including clouds) from the atmosphere except CO2, the absorption decreases by 74 percent, meaning that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">26 percent</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (= 100 percent – 74 percent) </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">of the absorption is still present if CO2 were the only greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. So the effect of CO2 can be either 9 percent or 26 percent of the greenhouse effect, depending on how it is defined.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> Undoubtedly the different definitions account, in part, for the different values cited in the literature for the importance of CO2 in the greenhouse effect. But whether it is 9 percent or 26 percent, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the effect of CO2 is not a negligible effect</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. For water vapor, the table above gives two numbers: 36 percent and 66 percent (= 100 – 34), depending on the definition. From the table above, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the water vapor contribution to the greenhouse effect is 36 to 66 percent, while the contribution of CO2 is 9 to 26 percent</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, depending on the definition. Taking the first numbers, water vapor is more important by a factor of 36/9 = 4.0, and taking the second numbers, water vapor is more important by a factor of 66/26 = 2.5. Note that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">water vapor is somewhat more important than CO2, but CO2 is by no means negligible.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> How Much Warming? A Naïve and Frightening Miscalculation </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Let’s ask what the result would be if the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were to double?</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> A naïve (and incorrect) calculation would be the following: Since the existing level of greenhouse gases resulted in a temperature increase of 33˚C (60˚F) compared to a hypothetical earth without greenhouse gases, then doubling of all the greenhouse gases would result in an additional increase of 33˚C (60˚F), giving an average surface temperature of the earth of 48˚C (119˚F). Fortunately, this frightening result stems from a misunderstanding of how greenhouse gases retain heat. The prediction of the IPCC is that doubling the level of CO2 will result in a temperature increase of a few degrees Celsius. It is at first glance surprising and welcome that the forecasted effects of global warming are smaller than this naïve calculation would expect. This naïve calculation is incorrect for two reasons. First, the effect of saturation. The atmosphere is already opaque in parts of the infrared spectrum. Increasing the level of greenhouse gases will not make any difference at those parts of the spectrum. If the absorption at a certain wavelength is close to 100 percent, doubling the CO2 level will not double the greenhouse effect. For example, suppose that at a certain wavelength, 90 percent of the infrared light from the earth is absorbed by CO2 in today’s atmosphere. If the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere were doubled, the absorption cannot go to 180 percent, which is an impossibility, but will go instead to nearly 100 percent. Second, the effect of spectral overlap. The absorption of infrared light by water vapor has areas of overlap with the absorption by CO2. In regions where infrared light is already strongly absorbed by water vapor, changing the concentration of CO2 will make little or no difference. These two effects (saturation and spectral overlap) explain why naïvely adding the effects of greenhouse gases is not correct, and overestimates the effect of increased greenhouse gases on the transmission of the atmosphere. An increasing concentration of CO2 will have little effect at the center of a strong absorption peak, because the atmosphere is opaque there already. Instead, an increasing concentration of CO2 will have its largest effect on the wings of a strong peak. The atmosphere is opaque in some parts of the infrared, with “windows” where the atmosphere is transparent or partially transparent. The effect of increasing concentrations of CO2 is to close the windows. Although this naïve calculation is mistaken, it illustrates an important point. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">People are often surprised at the thought that CO2, present in the atmosphere at only a few hundred parts per million, can result in a large enough change in the earth’s average temperature to make a difference. Instead, the real surprise is that global warming is as small as it is.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> How Much Warming? Climate scientists separate the climate problem into two parts: climate forcing and climate response. The forcing includes possible changes in the brightness of the sun, or changes in the greenhouse effect.11 The climate response is a resulting change in the equilibrium temperature. The climate sensitivity is the change in temperature divided by the climate forcing. A very simple calculation from a standard textbook shows that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">(if you make the assumption that nothing else in the system changes) a doubling of CO2 from the pre-industrial levels is estimated12 to produce a temperature rise of about 1.2 to 1.3˚C</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (2.2 to 2.3˚F). The calculation is straightforward enough that there is little controversy in the scientific community about it. The </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">logic is hard to dispute: the greenhouse effect is a real effect, the burning of fossil fuels leads to increasing concentrations of CO2, producing an enhanced greenhouse effect.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> The resulting temperature rise, if you assume that nothing else changes in the meantime, is only 1.2 to 1.3˚C. It’s All About the Feedback The real challenge in climate science comes with the assumption that when the greenhouse effect is intensified by increasing CO2 concentration, nothing else changes. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">This increase of 1.2 to 1.3˚C only takes into account the direct atmospheric warming associated with the enhanced greenhouse effect. It does not take into account any changes in the system.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> These changes are “feedback.” If the feedback is positive, then changes in the earth will enhance the change in temperature, and global warming arising from a doubling of pre-industrial CO2 will be more than 1.2 to 1.3˚C. If the feedback is negative, then changes in the earth will counteract the change in temperature, and global warming from a doubling of pre-industrial CO2 will be less than that. If the feedback is positive, then temperature change feeds on itself. If the feedback is negative, then temperature change will be self-limiting. If the feedback is positive, it does not imply that temperature changes would feed upon themselves forever. An enhanced greenhouse effect causes a rise in the average temperature of the earth, which in turn will increase the power radiated by the earth, as given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The average temperature of the earth will rise from the present value to a new, higher average temperature, “glowing” more brightly and re-radiating more energy into space until a new equilibrium is reached. Global warming is about the shift in the equilibrium temperature, arising from the enhanced greenhouse effect. The estimate of the IPCC is that doubling the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere will lead to an increase of 1.5 to 4.5˚C (2.7 to 8.1˚F). The predicted temperatures consist of 1.2 to 1.3˚C from the enhanced greenhouse effect that is multiplied by an “amplification factor” arising from positive feedback. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The calculated amplification factor is in the range from 1.2 to 3.75. If the amplification factor is 1.2, then the temperature will be 20 percent higher than it would be in the absence of feedback, while if the amplification factor is 3.75, the temperature rise will be nearly quadruple what it would be in the absence of feedback. The controversy is all about the feedback. That’s what the climate scientists are arguing about: How much is the feedback?</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> Two important examples of positive feedback are the ice-albedo effect and water vapor. The ice-albedo effect: If the temperature increases, ice and snow melt near the poles, replacing white snow with dark earth. Since snow reflects sunlight while earth absorbs sunlight, this decreases the reflectance (“albedo”) of the earth. Decreased reflectance means that a larger fraction of the sunlight falling on the earth is absorbed. This in turn leads to further warming. Thus a small warming leads to larger warming. The ice-albedo effect can also work in reverse: A small decrease in temperature will lead to increased snow cover, resulting in higher albedo, meaning that more of the sunlight falling on the earth is reflected and less is absorbed. Thus a small cooling leads to a larger cooling. Water vapor: Warmer air can hold more water vapor than cooler air. The so-called saturation vapor pressure of water rises with temperature. Thus, a small temperature rise can lead to an increased water vapor concentration, which in turn results in an enhanced greenhouse effect, and more warming. If the temperature decreases from 15˚C by 1˚C, the equilibrium vapor pressure of water decreases by 6 percent, while if the temperature increases by 1˚C, the equilibrium vapor pressure increases by 7 percent. This is quite significant given the importance of water vapor as a greenhouse gas. It is helpful to clarify an important point: Climate scientists believe that water vapor is a feedback, not a forcing.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;"> If you somehow removed all the water vapor from the atmosphere, it would restore itself in a matter of weeks.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> After all, most of the surface of the earth is covered by water. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Change in the water vapor in the air is one of the ways that the earth reacts to external forcings. And it’s a positive feedback.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> Possible Negative Feedback Mechanisms In addition to positive feedback mechanisms, there are possible negative feedback mechanisms. For example, if increased temperatures cause more clouds, and </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">if clouds have a net cooling effect (this is uncertain), then this would constitute a negative feedback mechanism</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Another suggested negative feedback mechanism was the “adaptive iris” proposed by MIT professor Richard Lindzen in the early 1980s. Lindzen proposed that increased sea-surface temperatures in the tropics lead to decreased cirrus cloud formation, leading in turn to increased “leakage” of infrared radiation, which amounts to a decreased greenhouse effect. The upshot is negative feedback. Lindzen, a global warming skeptic, agrees that increased atmospheric CO2 leads to an enhanced greenhouse effect, but does not believe that feedback is positive. The full complexity of modern climate science arises in attempting to grapple with the feedback. The number of possible feedbacks is quite complex.13 The crucial question is the sign and magnitude of the feedback. In view of the complexity of the system, it may very well not be possible to determine from first principles whether the feedback is positive or negative. However, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">there are other pieces of evidence that support positive feedback. In analyzing the past temperature record, the temperature changes are larger than would be expected if there were no feedback.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> This will be pointed out in several sections below. Climate Change in the Past If you look at the temperature record for a long span of time, you find that there have been changes in the temperature in the past, including big changes. During the Cretaceous Period 100 million years ago, the global mean surface temperature may have been as much as 6–8˚C (11–14˚F) higher than today. Obviously these temperature changes in the distant past had nothing to do with human activities, because there were no humans back then. Climate scientists do not contend that climate changes in the past were due to humans. They do maintain that the </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">global warming we are experiencing now is at least partially due to human activities.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> The Ice Ages In the past million years, the earth has undergone ten major and forty minor episodes of glaciation. The triggers for these events are believed to be changes in the motion of the earth, first investigated by Milutin Milanković in the 1920s. Specifically, the tilt of the axis goes from 22 degrees to 24.5 degrees and back again every 41,000 years. The month when the earth is closest to the sun varies in cycles of 19,000 years and 24,000 years. The shape of the orbit is observed to vary from elliptical to nearly circular, with a period of 100,000 years. These slow variations arise from the gravitational forces and torques exerted on the earth by the other planets (especially Jupiter and Saturn), the sun, and the moon. The climate science community almost unanimously believes that the Milankovitch cycles are the triggers for the beginning and ending of ice ages, because the timing of the climate changes agrees so well with the observed orbital changes of the earth and planets. (Nevertheless there are some unresolved problems in the frequencies of changes: the orbital changes predict a 400,000-year cycle, but no such cycle is observed in the climate record of the last million years.) Although the Milankovitch cycles get the period of the cycles (mostly) right, problems arise when attempting to calculate the intensity of the cooling that results from the changing sunlight. The “effect” (temperature change) is bigger than the “cause” (changing sunlight). A standard textbook remarks that “orbital changes alone appear not to have caused the vast climate shifts associated with glaciation and deglaciation.”14 This means that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the response of the earth to changing sunlight may increase the effect; i.e., this is evidence for positive feedback.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">15 Solar Variability In addition to Milankovitch cycles and the enhanced greenhouse effect, another possible cause of climate change is solar variability. Since 1979, spacecraft-borne instruments have recorded variations in the sun’s output, on time scales ranging from minutes to decades. The largest short-term dips of 0.3 percent last about a month, and are associated with sunspots that are carried across the face of the sun. (The sun’s rotation rate has a period of twenty-seven days.) The eleven-year sunspot cycle is associated with changes in the sun’s output of about 0.1 percent. There are no precise measurements of the solar output before 1979, and no direct measurements at all before about 1900. Instead, climate scientists rely on proxy indicators of solar activity, isotopes in cosmic rays, carbon-14 (14C) and beryllium-10 (10Be), which are found in tree rings and ice deposits, respectively. This record stretches back thousands of years. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The sun may make a contribution to climate change</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, at least in the period before 1800. Lean and Rind believe that in the period 1600–1800, the reconstructed solar radiation (from proxy indicators 14C and 10Be) correlates well with the surface temperature of the Northern Hemisphere. If you use that period to compute a climate sensitivity, you get </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">an increase in solar radiation of 0.14 percent</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, which </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">is too small by a factor of two to account for the observed temperature rise of 0.28˚C, in the absence of positive feedback</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. If the modest climate changes in the period 1600–1800 are attributed to solar variations, then this is another argument in favor of positive feedback. The climate fluctuations in the period 1600–1800 can perhaps be attributed to solar forcing, if you assume positive feedback. However, the warming in the twentieth century is a different story. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">solar changes can account for less than one third of the observed warming.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">16 Part 4: Scientific Rebuttal to Contrarian Arguments Contrarian Claim 1: The Great Depression Argument. Alexander Cockburn argues that during the Great Depression of the 1930s, worldwide anthropogenic production of CO2 fell by 30 percent, but the concentration of atmospheric CO2 didn’t fall by even one part per million, at a time when the atmospheric concentration was just over 300 ppm. Cockburn’s data indicate that worldwide annual CO2 production from fossil fuel plunged 30 percent, from 1.17 gigatons (Gt [1 Gt = 1012 kilograms, i.e., a billion metric tons]) in 1929 to 0.88 Gt in 1932, but the CO2 concentration did not fall by even 1 ppm. Cockburn cites the following figures: 306 ppm in 1928 and 1929, and 307 in 1932. Cockburn proclaimed that “a whopping 30 percent cut in man-made CO2 emissions didn’t even cause a 1 ppm drop in the atmosphere’s CO2. Thus it is impossible to assert that the increase in atmospheric CO2 stems from human burning of fossil fuels.”17 Cockburn does not specify how large an effect on the CO2 mixing ratio he expects to see, but clearly, in his mind, there ought to be a drop of at least 1 ppm, if anthropogenic CO2 were a significant contributor to the atmospheric CO2. Let’s calculate how large an effect should be expected, using Cockburn’s numbers. First, let’s distinguish between a reservoir of carbon and a flux of carbon. The atmosphere is a reservoir holding a certain amount of carbon, while the annual production of CO2 is a flux, transferring a certain amount of carbon to the atmosphere every year. The reservoir of carbon (as CO2) in the atmosphere is proportional to the concentration (expressed as parts per million), measured by the Mauna Loa observatory. The flux from burning fossil fuel (and other anthropogenic sources) is a certain amount of CO2 injected into the atmosphere every year. The pre-industrial level of CO2 in the atmosphere was about 280 ppm. As a result of the industrial revolution, the level crept up to just over 300 ppm by the onset of the Great Depression. The increase of 20 ppm (= 300 – 280) was primarily due to the accumulated emissions from fossil fuels since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">If the Great Depression had cut the burning of fossil fuels to zero, the result would have been the gradual decrease</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (over a long period) from 300 ppm back down to the pre-industrial level of 280 ppm. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Nobody should expect a 30 percent decrease in the 300 ppm level of atmospheric CO2, because 280 ppm is natural</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Instead you expect a 30 percent decrease in the rate at which CO2 is increasing in the atmosphere. In more detail: Even after cutting back the burning of fossil fuels in the Great Depression, the fluxes were still unbalanced, and atmospheric CO2 continued to increase. In the 1995 IPCC report, which covers the 1980s, the following numbers reveal the reservoir and fluxes to and from the atmosphere. The reservoir of carbon in the atmosphere was 750 Gt in the 1980s—this is the total mass of all carbon in the atmosphere. The atmospheric concentration was about 340 ppm. From these numbers, we can calculate that back in the early 1930s, when the atmospheric concentration was 300 ppm—i.e., 88 percent (300/340 x 100) of the value in the 1980s—the atmospheric reservoir was about 662 Gt., i.e., 88 percent of the value in the 1980s (662 = 750 x 300/340), since the concentration is proportional to the total amount (reservoir) of carbon. Cockburn’s estimate of the pre-Depression (1929) rate of carbon emissions (the flux) is 1.17 Gt/year. To simplify, let’s assume that all of the CO2 emitted were retained in the atmosphere and all other fluxes were balanced. This would be associated with an annual increase of 0.18 percent (1.17/662 x 100) in the atmospheric CO2 concentration. That’s an expected increase of 0.54 ppm (0.18 percent of 300 ppm) in the CO2 concentration. By 1932 the fossil fuel consumption rate had fallen from 1.17 Gt/year to 0.88 Gt/year. This is a 30 percent drop in the rate at which the CO2 level increases. But it just means that you expect the annual increase in atmospheric CO2 to be 0.13 percent (0.88/662 x 100) instead of 0.18 percent, or 0.39 ppm (0.13 percent of 300 ppm) instead of 0.54 ppm. It is the rate of increase that has fallen, from 0.18 to 0.13 percent or from 0.54 ppm to 0.39 ppm. Thus, the rate of increase has fallen by 0.15 ppm (= 0.54 – 0.39). To recap: </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">If the Depression hadn’t happened, you would expect an annual increase of 0.54 ppm. But since the Depression did happen, you expect an increase of 0.39 ppm</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. The difference is 0.15 ppm. Is it realistic to expect to be able to detect a change in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere from such a small change in the rate of flux over just a few years? The signal of 0.15 ppm should be compared with the year-to-year noise in the data. Looking at the data in the 1980s, where the high-quality post-1958 data from Mauna Loa is available, I examined the year-to-year fluctuations. There are ten years in the series 1980–1989. For each year, I obtained the CO2 concentration in ppm. By subtracting one year from the previous year I obtained the increase from the previous year. These ranged from 1.2 ppm to 2.55 ppm. Then I calculated the change from one year to the next of that increase. I had nine data points (= 10 – 1). Six of the nine data points had year-to-year fluctuations of more than 0.15 ppm, and three data points had less than 0.15 ppm year-to-year fluctuations. So, even in this favorable case, where the Mauna Loa has more reliable data than that which Cockburn cited from the air bubbles in the ice records, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">you would not expect to detect a change of 0.15 ppm</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Furthermore, I simplified the calculation by assuming that all the CO2 from fossil fuel burning was retained in the atmosphere. Today’s climate scientists believe that roughly half of the CO2 injected into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuel is retained in the atmosphere, with the other half dissolving in the ocean (over a period of decades to a century or two). My simplified calculation is, thus, an overestimate, by roughly a factor of two, of the increase expected in the CO2 mixing ratio. In conclusion, the Great Depression argument is not valid. The expected impact of the cutback of CO2 emissions that occurred between 1929 and 1932 is too small relative to the historical buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere to show up in Cockburn’s numbers. Contrarian Claim 2: Water Vapor Is Vastly More Important than CO2 as a Greenhouse Gas. Cockburn thinks18 water vapor is more important than CO2 as a greenhouse gas by a factor of 20. Cockburn did not cite any source for this number. It’s true that CO2 has a smaller greenhouse effect than water vapor, but only by a factor of 2.5 to 4.0 (as shown above), and it is the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere that has been changing rapidly due to anthropogenic forces. The effect of CO2 is appreciable. The numbers advanced by Cockburn, claiming that CO2 is negligible, are wrong. These numbers circulate among the contrarians. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The large absorption in the infrared band caused by CO2 is in and of itself clear evidence of the importance of CO2.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> Contrarian Claim 3: The rise in CO2 around 10,000 years ago happened after the beginning of the end of the last ice age, not before. Therefore the rise in atmospheric CO2 is a consequence of global warming, not a cause of global warming. Cockburn is entirely correct when he says that when the last ice age started to end about 10–12 thousand years ago, the triggering cause was not CO2. Instead, the trigger is believed to be a Milankovitch cycle. This topic is found in standard textbook treatments.19 Cockburn thinks this is a crushing blow against the claim of anthropogenic global warming. He thinks that there is one factor determining the climate, so if he can prove that increasing temperature caused increased CO2 and not vice-versa at any one time (10,000 years ago), then he has proven it for all times. Many decades ago, numerous scientists also thought that there was one overriding factor determining climate. They no longer think so. Instead, the current scientific thinking is that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">there are a number of factors that influence climate, including: greenhouse gases in the atmosphere</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, the reflection of light from the earth’s surface, the exact shape of the earth’s orbit (which varies according to the Milankovitch cycle), and changes in the sun’s intensity. Which factor is more important? That varies from one era to another. (a) The event that initiated the ending of the last ice age was a Milankovitch cycle. Once the process started, increasing CO2 levels caused further warming. (b) During the period 1600–1800, a plausible argument can be made that solar variations caused appreciable temperature changes. (c) The temperature rise during the last half of the twentieth century is caused by the enhanced greenhouse effect, resulting from the burning of fossil fuels. Cockburn lays great stress on the timing issue: 10,000 years ago, the rise in temperature preceded the rise in CO2 levels. This proves (and I agree) that CO2 didn’t cause the beginning of deglaciation (the end of the ice age). But in the last two centuries, the rise in CO2 preceded the rise in temperature. This strongly suggests that the rise in CO2 caused the rise in temperature. The CO2 in the atmosphere has risen since 1800 and especially since 1950, while it was steady for centuries until about 1800. In the modern era, the rise in CO2 came first, then the rise in temperature. Contrarian Claim 4: The rise in atmospheric CO2 comes from the ocean, not from burning fossil fuel. Thus the rise is natural and not anthropogenic. Climate scientists believe that CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation enriches the CO2 in the atmosphere. Cockburn believes that most of the increased CO2 in the atmosphere comes from the ocean instead. So where does the CO2 in the atmosphere come from, the burning of fossil fuels, or the ocean? Nature has performed an experiment to decide this question, by putting a label on CO2 molecules, and using one kind of label on CO2 from fossil fuels and deforestation, while putting another kind of label on CO2 from the ocean. We can examine the CO2 molecules in the atmosphere, and the labels will tell us whether the CO2 is coming from burning fossil fuels or from the oceans. The labels are carbon isotopes. Most carbon atoms have an atomic mass of 12, but about one percent have an atomic mass of 13. Carbon-12 atoms can be distinguished from carbon-13 atoms in the laboratory, and both kinds of carbon atoms can form CO2 molecules. So about 1 percent of the CO2 we exhale is 13CO2. The two types of CO2, 13CO2 and 12CO2, behave pretty much the same during most chemical reactions. However, some biological processes show “isotopic fractionation,” in which one isotope is more readily used than the other. For example, in photosynthesis, plants take in CO2 from the air to build up their biomass. Terrestrial plants have a preference to take in 12CO2 instead of 13CO2, so the CO2 in plants is richer in 12C and poorer in 13C than the surrounding atmosphere. In other words, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">while the abundance of 13C is about one percent of the abundance of 12C, it’s not exactly one percent.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> The ratio of abundances of 13C to 12C can be slightly higher or slightly lower than one percent depending on the source. Scientists compare the abundance of 13C relative to 12C using the so-called d13C scale. The 13C/12C ratio in a sample is compared to the ratio in a standard material. If the 13C/12C ratio in the sample is exactly the same as the ratio in the standard, then d13C = 0. If the sample is enriched in 13C relative to the standard, the sample is assigned a positive d13C value, while if the sample is depleted in 13C relative to the standard, the sample is assigned a negative d13C value. If the 13C/12C ratio in the sample is higher than the standard by 0.1 percent, then the d13C for that sample is +1. If the 13C/12C ratio in a sample is lower than the standard by 0.2 percent, the d13C for that sample is –2. The d13C values for fossil fuels/biomass, the atmosphere, and the oceans are shown in table 2. Notice that the value of d13C in the atmosphere is in between the level for fossil fuel/biomass and the value for the surface waters of the oceans. If the CO2 in the atmosphere (whose d13C is –8) comes from the surface of the oceans (whose d13C is positive) then the d13C of the atmosphere will increase with time. However, if CO2 in the atmosphere comes from burning fossil fuel (whose d13C is –27), then the d13C of the atmosphere will decrease. The result, from the Mauna Loa observatory, shows </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the 13C/12C ratio in atmospheric CO2 is decreasing with time</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">.20 </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">These data conclusively demonstrate that the increasing CO2 in the atmosphere comes from burning fossil fuels</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> and deforestation, and not from CO2 released by the oceans to the atmosphere. This conclusion does not depend on the validity of computer models. In a response to critics who raised exactly the issue of isotopic abundance ratios in CO2, Cockburn replied that burning fossil fuel is not the only way of introducing 13C-poor material into the atmosphere. Cockburn believed that “cold ocean waters absorb lightweight 12C preferentially, resulting in lots of 13C-deﬁcient carbon in the oceans. This low-13C carbon most certainly would have been released massively into the atmosphere over the course of the world’s warming trend since 1850….”21 Cockburn would have a valid point if the ocean surface waters were in fact depleted in 13C. Unfortunately for his argument, the ocean surface waters are enhanced in 13C, while the deep ocean is depleted in 13C. Clearly, Cockburn is wrong on this point. Contrarian Claim 5: A short atmospheric residence time for CO2. How long does CO2 stay in the atmosphere before permanently dissolving in the ocean? This may seem like an unimportant detail, but it turns out to be an important question. If atmospheric CO2 dissolved in the ocean in a short time (a year or two), then cutting back on emissions would promptly lower the atmospheric concentration of CO2. However, if the residence time is long (decades to centuries), then the human race will be stuck with the consequences of global warming for a long time. This was once the subject of an enormous amount of controversy. As recently as the 1950s, many scientists thought that atmospheric CO2 would dissolve almost immediately in the oceans. This was one important reason why many scientists paid little attention to global warming—they thought it was impossible. Estimates of the atmospheric residence time for CO2 ranged from 6 months to 10,000 years. Shortly after C. D. Keeling began his measurement of atmospheric CO2 in 1958, it became clear that atmospheric CO2 was accumulating. This ruled out the short lifetimes: If atmospheric CO2 could dissolve in the ocean in a year or two, it would not be accumulating in the atmosphere. Modern scientists understand that the dissolving of atmospheric CO2 into the oceans is a three-step process: (1) transfer of CO2 across the air-sea interface, (2) chemical interaction of dissolved CO2 with seawater constituents, and (3) transport of CO2 to the deep ocean by vertical mixing. Steps 2 and 3 are the rate-limiting steps—i.e., these are the processes that happen fairly slowly, making the absorption of atmospheric CO2 by the oceans take decades or centuries, rather than years. The chemistry of seawater is complicated. A thorough treatment of CO2 in seawater involves the bicarbonate ion (HCO3–), boric acid (B[OH]3) and the borate ion (B[OH]4–). The inclusion of the last two species is surprising to many scientists without a background in ocean chemistry. The subject is complicated enough to merit a 356-page monograph.22 For a long time, many scientists misunderstood the problem. They looked up the solubility of CO2 in water, and there seemed to be nothing to prevent CO2 from dissolving rapidly in the ocean. However, these scientists misconceived the problem. The solubility tells you whether all the atmospheric CO2 can dissolve eventually in the ocean. And all the CO2 can dissolve, but it takes a long time to reach equilibrium. This is the wrong approach. It’s not an equilibrium problem. Instead, it’s a transient problem. The real question is: How long does the system take to reach equilibrium? This was not understood by scientists until the mid-1950s. It has been estimated that of 100 molecules of CO2 injected into the atmosphere, 6 molecules will dissolve in the ocean in 1 year; 29 molecules will dissolve in 10 years; 59 molecules will dissolve in 60 years; 84 molecules will dissolve in 360 years; and the last 16 molecules will take over 1,000 years.23 This is the result of a number of different processes taking place on different time scales. There is not a single time scale for dissolving CO2 in the ocean, but it takes a long time. Because it was once a very contentious area, there were lots of naïve ideas circulating, that are now known to be wrong. Those ideas don’t ever totally die away. Since 1960, many new people have entered the field of climatology, and people with technical backgrounds but little experience in climatology have investigated this issue. People who are new to the field are prone to repeat the same mistakes that climate scientists were making in the 1950s and earlier. Cockburn found one PhD, a retired aerospace engineer, Dr. Jeffrey Glassman, who calculated a lifetime of 1.5 to 2.0 years.24 Judged by his Web site, Glassman’s thinking is based on solubility. As just mentioned, this is a transient problem, not a solubility problem. And, of course, if the lifetime were that short, then the CO2 would not be accumulating in the atmosphere, which it clearly is. Contrarian Claim 6: Believers in anthropogenic global warming are entirely dependent upon large-scale computer modeling, whose validity is suspect. If the only evidence for global warming were computer models, then skepticism or at least agnosticism would be entirely justified. In fact </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">there is a great deal of evidence besides computer models that supports global warming</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Some of the evidence has been discussed in this essay.25 The greenhouse effect is after all a real effect, and a large one. Increasing CO2 in the atmosphere leads to an enhanced greenhouse effect, which will be a little over 1˚C when the CO2 level reaches twice the pre-industrial levels. There is more controversy over the feedback, but an estimate of the feedback based on the recovery from the last ice age (see the section “The Ice Age” above, including endnote 15) yields a prediction that doubling the amount of CO2 over pre-industrial levels will result in a temperature rise of 3˚C, in good agreement with the IPCC estimates of 1.5 to 4.5˚C. Thus the estimates by the IPCC seem quite reasonable. Their results, although based on computer models, are supported by arguments that are independent of computer models. This, of course, should enhance confidence in the validity of the computer models. Conclusion </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Anthropogenic global warming is based on very solid science</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. The discussion in the scientific climate change community is about how much anthropogenic global warming is occurring, but not about whether or not anthropogenic global warming is happening at all. The contrarian arguments raised by Alexander Cockburn lack scientific validity. This is not to say that Cockburn and other skeptics should not have raised some of the questions they have. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Science demands constant scrutiny and the misuse of science, when it occurs, is everyone’s concern. But it is also important to recognize a truth when it has been established. The verdict is in. Modern global warming stemming to a considerable extent from anthropogenic causes is real and constitutes a serious threat to life on the planet as we know it. It is time to stop debating its reality and to do something about it, while </span><span style="font-size: 8px;">there is still time.</span><br />

But </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the idea that we could adapt to a 4C rise is absurd and dangerous.

Or perhaps the beginning of our </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">extinction. The collapse of the polar ice caps would become inevitable, bringing</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> long-term </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">sea level rises of 70-80 metres.

The world's geography would be transformed much as it was at the end of the last ice age, when sea levels rose by about 120 metres to create the Channel, the North Sea and Cardigan Bay out of dry land. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Weather would become extreme and unpredictable, with more frequent and severe droughts, floods and hurricanes.

This is a remarkable understatement. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The climate system is already experiencing significant feedbacks</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, notably the summer melting of the Arctic sea ice. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The more the ice melts, the more sunshine is absorbed by the sea, and the more the Arctic warms</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. And </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">as the Arctic warms, the release of billions of tonnes of methane</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> – a greenhouse gas 70 times stronger than carbon dioxide over 20 years – </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">captured under melting permafrost is already under way. To see how far this process could go, look 55.5m years to the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, when a global temperature increase of 6C coincided with the release of about 5,000 gigatonnes of carbon</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> into the atmosphere, both as CO2 and as methane from bogs and seabed sediments. Lush </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">subtropical forests grew in polar regions, and sea levels rose to 100m higher than today</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. It appears that an initial warming pulse triggered other warming processes. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Many scientists warn that this historical event may be analogous to the present: the warming caused by human emissions could propel us towards a similar hothouse Earth.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8px;">Advocacy about the health consequences will ensure that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">climate change is a high priority</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. The United Nations Convention on Climate Change was set up in 1992 to ensure that nations worked together to minimize the adverse effects, but McMichael and Neira noted that, in preparation for the Copenhagen conference in December 2009, only four of 47 nations mentioned human health as a consideration [1]. With business as usual, global warming caused by rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will threaten mass populations through increased transmission of some infections, heat stress, food and water insecurity, increased deaths from more frequent and extreme climate events, threats to shelter and security, and through population migration [2]. On the one hand </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">it is necessary in the media to counter climate change sceptics and denialists</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, but on the other it is also important not to allow climate catastrophists, who tell us it is all too late, to deflect us from pragmatic and positive action</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">. Catastrophic scenarios are possible in the longer term</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, and effective action will be formidably difficult, but evidence suggests that we do have the tools, the time and the resources to bring about the changes needed for climate stability. 2. Climate change evidence and denial Given the current body of evidence, it is surprising that global warming and its causal relationship with atmospheric GHG pollution is disputed any more than therelationship between acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or lung cancer and cigarette smoking. The basic principles that determine the Earth’s temperature are, of course, relatively simple. Some of the short-wave solar radiation that strikes the Earth is reflected back into space and some is absorbed by the land and emitted as long-wave radiation (heat). Some of the long-wave radiation is trapped in the atmosphere by ‘greenhouse gases’, which include water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane. Without GHGs the Earth would be on average 33°C colder. Over the last 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been adding more carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. The result is that the Earth’s atmosphere, ocean and land are indeed warming—due to increased atmospheric ‘greenhouse gas’ concentrations [3]. Gleick et al. [4], from the US National Academy of Sciences, wrote a letter to Science stating ‘</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">There is compelling, comprehensive, and consistent objective evidence that humans are changing the climate in ways that threaten our societies and the ecosystems on which we depend’</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. The most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [5], amounting to nearly 3000 pages of detailed review and analysis of published research, also declares that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the scientific uncertainties of global warming are essentially resolved.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> This report states that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">there is clear evidence for a 0.75°C rise in global temperatures</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> and 22 cm rise in sea level during the twentieth century. The IPCC synthesis also predicts that global temperatures could rise further by between 1.1°C and 6.4°C by 2100, and sea level could rise by between 28 and 79 cm, or more if the melting of Greenland and Antarctica accelerates. In addition, weather patterns will become less predictable and the occurrence of extreme climate events, such as storms, floods, heat waves and droughts, will increase. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">There is also strong evidence for ocean acidification driven by more carbon dioxide dissolving in the oceans</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> [6]. Given the current failure of international negotiations to address carbon emission reductions, and that atmospheric warming lags behind rises in CO2 concentration, there is concern that global surface temperature will rise above the supposedly ‘safe limit’ of 2°C within this century. Each doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration alone is expected to produce 1.9–4.5°C of warming at equilibrium [7]. Of course, climate modelling is an extremely complex process, and uncertainty with projections relating to future emissions trajectories means that the time scale and magnitude of future climate change cannot be predicted with certainty [8]. These uncertainties are magnified when future climate predictions are used to estimate potential impacts. For example, the environmental impacts of climate change are also uncertain, but could underestimate such impacts because they detrimentally interact with habitat loss, pollution and loss of biodiversity due to other causes. There is also the additional problem that switching from biome to biome may not be directly reversible. For example, rainforest recycles a huge amount of water so it can survive a significant amount of aridification before it burns and is replaced by savannah. But the region then has to get much wetter before rainforest can return, as there is greatly reduced water cycling in savannah [9]. In the policy arena, further uncertainty surrounds the desire for international agreements on emission cuts, and the possible routes to such agreement and implementation. The feasible speed of technological innovation in carbon capture and provision of renewable/low-carbon energy resources is also uncertain. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Denying the causes or the current weight of evidence for anthropogenic climate change is irrational</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, just as the existence of ‘uncertainties’ should not be used to deny the need for proportionate action, when </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">such uncertainties could underestimate the risks and impact of climate change</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. There is no reason for inaction and there are many ways we can use our current knowledge of climate change to improve health provision for current and future generations. 3. Catastrophism At the other end of the scale are doom-mongers who predict catastrophic population collapse and the end of civilization. In the early nineteenth century, the French palaeontologist Georges Cuvier first addressed catastrophism and explained patterns of extinction observed in the fossil record through catastrophic natural events [10]. We know now of five major extinctions: the Ordovician–Silurian extinction (439 million years ago), the Late Devonian extinction (about 364 million years ago), the Permian–Triassic extinction (about 251 million years ago), the End Triassic extinction (roughly 199 million to 214 million years ago) and the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction (about 65 million years ago). These mass extinctions were caused by a combination of plate tectonics, supervolcanism and asteroid impacts. The understanding of the mass extinctions led Gould &amp; Eldredge [11] to update Darwin’s theory of evolution with their own theory of punctuated equilibrium. Many scientists have suggested that the current human-induced extinction rates could be as fast as those during these mass extinctions [12,13]. For example, one study predicted that 58 per cent of species may be committed to extinction by 2050 due to climate change alone [14], though this paper has been criticized [15,16]. Some people have even suggested that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">human extinction may not be a remote risk</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> [17–19]. Sherwood &amp; Huber [7] point to continued heating effects that could make the world largely uninhabitable by humans and mammals within 300 years. Peak heat stress, quantified by the wet-bulb temperature (used because it reflects both the ambient temperature and relative humidity of the site), is surprisingly similar across diverse climates and never exceeds 31°C. They suggest that if it rose to 35°C, which never happens now but would at a warming of 7°C, hyperthermia in humans and other mammals would occur as dissipation of metabolic heat becomes impossible, therefore making many environments uninhabitable.</span><br />

<strong>9. We’re almost at the irreversible tipping point – it’s do or die for the affirmative – this decade is critical</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8px;">(Reuters) - </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The world is close to reaching tipping points that will make it irreversibly hotter, making this decade critical in efforts to contain global warming</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, scientists warned on Monday. Scientific estimates differ but the world's temperature looks set to rise by six degrees Celsius by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are allowed to rise uncontrollably. As emissions grow, scientists say the world is close to reaching thresholds beyond which the effects on the global climate will be irreversible, such as the melting of polar ice sheets and loss of rainforests. &quot;This is the critical decade. If we don't get the curves turned around this decade we will cross those lines,&quot; said Will Steffen, executive director of the Australian National University's climate change institute, speaking at a conference in London. Despite this sense of urgency, a new global climate treaty forcing the world's biggest polluters, such as the United States and China, to curb emissions will only be agreed on by 2015 - to enter into force in 2020. &quot;We are on the cusp of some big changes,&quot; said Steffen. &quot;We can ... cap temperature rise at two degrees, or cross the threshold beyond which the system shifts to a much hotter state.&quot; TIPPING POINTS For ice sheets - huge refrigerators that slow down the warming of the planet - the tipping point has probably already been passed, Steffen said. The West Antarctic ice sheet has shrunk over the last decade and the Greenland ice sheet has lost around 200 cubic km (48 cubic miles) a year since the 1990s. Most climate estimates agree the Amazon rainforest will get drier as the planet warms. Mass tree deaths caused by drought have raised fears it is on the verge of a tipping point, when it will stop absorbing emissions and add to them instead. Around 1.6 billion tonnes of carbon were lost in 2005 from the rainforest and 2.2 billion tonnes in 2010, which has undone about 10 years of carbon sink activity, Steffen said. One of the most worrying and unknown thresholds is the Siberian permafrost, which stores frozen carbon in the soil away from the atmosphere. &quot;There is about 1,600 billion tonnes of carbon there - about twice the amount in the atmosphere today - and </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the northern high latitudes are experiencing the most severe temperature change of any part of the planet</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">,&quot; he said. In a worst case scenario, 30 to 63 billion tonnes of carbon a year could be released by 2040, rising to 232 to 380 billion tonnes by 2100. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">This compares to around 10 billion tonnes of CO2 released by fossil fuel use each year. Increased CO2 in the atmosphere has also turned oceans more acidic as they absorb it</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. In the past 200 years, ocean acidification has happened at a speed not seen for around 60 million years, said Carol Turley at Plymouth Marine Laboratory. This threatens coral reef development and could lead to the extinction of some species within decades, as well as to an increase in the number of predators. As leading scientists, policy-makers and environment groups gathered at the &quot;Planet Under Pressure&quot; conference in London, opinions differed on what action to take this decade. London School of Economics professor Anthony Giddens favours focusing on the fossil fuel industry, seeing as renewables only make up 1 percent of the global energy mix. &quot;We have enormous inertia within the world economy and should make much more effort to close down coal-fired power stations,&quot; he said. Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell favours working on technologies leading to negative emissions in the long run, like carbon capture on biomass and in land use, said Jeremy Bentham, the firm's vice president of global business environment. The conference runs through Thursday. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8px;">Marine life face some of the worst impacts. We now know that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">global warming is “capable of wrecking the marine ecosystem and depriving future generations of the harvest of the seas</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">” (see 2009 Nature Geoscience study concludes ocean dead zones “devoid of fish and seafood” are poised to expand and “remain for thousands of years”). </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The acidification of the ocean in particular is a grave threat</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> — for links to primary sources and recent studies, see “Imagine a World without Fish: Deadly ocean acidification — hard to deny, harder to geo-engineer, but not hard to stop” (and below). A new Nature Geoscience study, “Past constraints on the vulnerability of marine calcifiers to massive carbon dioxide release” (subs. req’d) provides a truly ominous warning. The release from the researchers at the University of Bristol is “Rate of ocean acidification the fastest in 65 million years.” I am reprinting below a piece by award-winning science journalist Carl Zimmer published this week by Yale environment360, which explains ocean acidification and what this important study says: The JOIDES Resolution looks like a bizarre hybrid of an oil rig and a cargo ship. It is, in fact, a research vessel that ocean scientists use to dig up sediment from the sea floor. In 2003, on a voyage to the southeastern Atlantic, scientists aboard the JOIDES Resolution brought up a particularly striking haul. They had drilled down into sediment that had formed on the sea floor over the course of millions of years. The oldest sediment in the drill was white. It had been formed by the calcium carbonate shells of single-celled organisms — the same kind of material that makes up the White Cliffs of Dover. But </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">when the scientists examined the sediment that had formed 55 million years ago, the color changed in a geological blink of an eye</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. “</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">In the middle of this white sediment, there’s this big plug of red clay</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">,” says Andy Ridgwell, an earth scientist at the University of Bristol. In other words, the vast clouds of shelled creatures in the deep oceans had virtually disappeared. Many scientists now agree that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">this change was caused by a drastic drop of the ocean’s pH level. The seawater became so corrosive that it ate away at the shells</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, along with other species with calcium carbonate in their bodies. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">It took hundreds of thousands of years for the oceans to recover from this crisis</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, and for the sea floor to turn from red back to white. The clay that the crew of the JOIDES Resolution dredged up may be an ominous warning of what the future has in store. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">By spewing carbon dioxide into the air, we are now once again making the oceans more acidic</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Today, Ridgwell and Daniela Schmidt, also of the University of Bristol, are publishing a study in the journal Nature Geoscience, comparing what happened in the oceans 55 million years ago to what the oceans are experiencing today. Their research supports what other researchers have long suspected: The acidification of the ocean today is bigger and faster than anything geologists can find in the fossil record over the past 65 million years. Indeed, its speed and strength — Ridgwell estimate that current ocean </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">acidification is taking place at ten times the rate that preceded the mass extinction 55 million years ago</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> — may spell doom for many marine species, particularly ones that live in the deep ocean. “This is an almost unprecedented geological event,” says Ridgwell. When we humans burn fossil fuels, we pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, where the gas traps heat. But much of that carbon dioxide does not stay in the air. Instead, it gets sucked into the oceans. If not for the oceans, climate scientists believe that the planet would be much warmer than it is today. Even with the oceans’ massive uptake of CO2, the past decade was still the warmest since modern record-keeping began. But storing carbon dioxide in the oceans may come at a steep cost: It changes the chemistry of seawater. At the ocean’s surface, seawater typically has a pH of about 8 to 8.3 pH units. For comparison, the pH of pure water is 7, and stomach acid is around 2. The pH level of a liquid is determined by how many positively charged hydrogen atoms are floating around in it. The more hydrogen ions, the lower the pH. When carbon dioxide enters the ocean, it lowers the pH by reacting with water. The carbon dioxide we have put into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution has lowered the ocean pH level by .1. That may seem tiny, but it’s not. The pH scale is logarithmic, meaning that there are 10 times more hydrogen ions in a pH 5 liquid than one at pH 6, and 100 times more than pH 7. As a result, a drop of just .1 pH units means that the concentration of hydrogen ions in the ocean has gone up by about 30 percent in the past two centuries. To see how ocean acidification is going to affect life in the ocean, scientists have run laboratory experiments in which they rear organisms at different pH levels. The results have been worrying — particularly for species that build skeletons out of calcium carbonate, such as corals and amoeba-like organisms called foraminifera. The extra hydrogen in low-pH seawater reacts with calcium carbonate, turning it into other compounds that animals can’t use to build their shells. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">These results are worrisome</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, not just for the particular species the scientists study, but </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">for the ecosystems</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> in which they live. Some of these </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">vulnerable species are crucial for entire ecosystems</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> in the ocean. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Small shell-building organisms are food for invertebrates</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, such as mollusks and small fish, which in turn are food for larger predators. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Coral reefs create an underwater rain forest, cradling a quarter of the ocean’s biodiversity</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. But on their own, lab experiments lasting for a few days or weeks may not tell scientists how ocean acidification will affect the entire planet. “It’s not obvious what these mean in the real world,” says Ridgwell. One way to get more information is to look at the history of the oceans themselves, which is what Ridgwell and Schmidt have done in their new study. At first glance, that history might suggest we have nothing to worry about. A hundred million years ago, there was over five times more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the ocean was .8 pH units lower. Yet there was plenty of calcium carbonate for foraminifera and other species. It was during this period, in fact, that shell-building marine organisms produced the limestone formations that would eventually become the White Cliffs of Dover. But there’s a crucial difference between the Earth 100 million years ago and today. Back then, carbon dioxide concentrations changed very slowly over millions of years. Those slow changes triggered other slow changes in the Earth’s chemistry. For example, as the planet warmed from more carbon dioxide, the increased rainfall carried more minerals from the mountains into the ocean, where they could alter the chemistry of the sea water. Even at low pH, the ocean contains enough dissolved calcium carbonate for corals and other species to survive. Today, however, we are flooding the atmosphere with carbon dioxide at a rate rarely seen in the history of our planet. The planet’s weathering feedbacks won’t be able to compensate for the sudden drop in pH for hundreds of thousands of years. Scientists have been scouring the fossil record for periods of history that might offer clues to how the planet will respond to the current carbon jolt. They’ve found that 55 million years ago, the Earth went through a similar change. Lee Kump of Penn State and his colleagues have estimated that roughly 6.8 trillion tons of carbon entered the Earth’s atmosphere over about 10,000 years. Nobody can say for sure what unleashed all that carbon, but it appeared to have had a drastic effect on the climate. Temperatures rose between 5 and 9 degrees Celsius (9 to 16 Fahrenheit). Many deep-water species became extinct, possibly as the pH of the deep ocean became too low for them to survive. But this ancient catastrophe (known as the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum, or PETM) was not a perfect prequel to what’s happening on Earth today. The temperature was warmer before the carbon bomb went off, and the pH of the oceans was lower. The arrangement of the continents was also different. The winds blew in different patterns as a result, driving the oceans in different directions. All these factors make a big difference on the effect of ocean acidification. For example, the effect that low pH has on skeleton-building organisms depends on the pressure and temperature of the ocean. Below a certain depth in the ocean, the water becomes so cold and the pressure so high that there’s no calcium carbonate left for shell-building organisms. That threshold is known as the saturation horizon. To make a meaningful comparison between the PETM and today, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Ridgwell and Schmidt built large-scale simulations of the ocean</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> at both points of time. They created a virtual version of the Earth 55 million years ago and let the simulation run until it reached a stable state. The pH level of their simulated ocean fell within the range of estimates of the pH of the actual ocean 55 millions years ago. They then built a version of the modern Earth, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">with today’s arrangements of continents, average temperature, and other variables. They let the modern world reach a stable state and then checked the pH of the ocean</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Once again, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">it matched the real pH found in the oceans today.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> Ridgwell and Schmidt then jolted both of these simulated oceans with massive injections of carbon dioxide. They added 6.8 trillion tons of carbon over 10,000 years to their PETM world. Using conservative projections of future carbon emissions, they added 2.1 trillion tons of carbon over just a few centuries to their modern world. Ridgwell and Schmidt then used the model to estimate how easily carbonate would dissolve at different depths of the ocean. The results were strikingly different. Ridgwell and Schmidt found that ocean acidification is happening about ten times faster today than it did 55 million years ago. And while the saturation horizon rose to 1,500 meters 55 million years ago, it will lurch up to 550 meters on average by 2150, according to the model. The PETM was powerful enough to trigger widespread extinctions in the deep oceans. Today’s faster, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">bigger changes to the ocean may well bring a new wave of extinctions.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> Paleontologists haven’t found signs of major extinctions of corals or other carbonate-based species in surface waters around PETM. But since today’s ocean acidification is so much stronger, it may affect life in shallow water as well. “We can’t say things for sure about impacts on ecosystems, but there is a lot of cause for concern,” says Ridgwell. Ellen Thomas, a paleoceanographer at Yale University, says that the new paper “is highly significant to our ideas on ocean acidification.” But she points out that life in the ocean was buffeted by more than just a falling pH. “I’m not convinced it’s the whole answer,” she says. The ocean’s temperature rose and oxygen levels dropped. Together, all these changes had complex effects on the ocean’s biology 55 million years ago. Scientists now have to determine what sort of combined effect they will have on the ocean in the future. Our carbon-fueled civilization is affecting life everywhere on Earth, according to the work of scientists like Ridgwell — even life that dwells thousands of feet underwater. “The reach of our actions can really be quite global,” says Ridgwell. It’s entirely possible that the ocean sediments that form in the next few centuries will change from the white of calcium carbonate back to red clay, as ocean acidification wipes out deep-sea ecosystems. “It will give people hundreds of millions of years from now something to identify our civilization by,” says Ridgwell. And for completeness’ sake, here’s more background on ocean acidification (which regular CP readers can skip). You can watch NOAA administrator Lubchenco give a demonstration of the science of ocean acidification. Ocean acidification must be a core climate message, since it is hard to deny and impervious to the delusion that geoengineering is the silver bullet. Indeed, a major 2009 study GRL study, “Sensitivity of ocean acidification to geoengineered climate stabilization” (subs. req’d), concluded: The results of this paper support the view that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">climate engineering will not resolve the problem of ocean acidification</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, and that therefore deep and rapid cuts in CO2 emissions are likely to be the most effective strategy to avoid environmental damage from future ocean acidification. If you want to understand ocean acidification better, see this BBC story, which explains: Man-made pollution is raising ocean acidity at least 10 times faster than previously thought, a study says. Or see this Science magazine study, “Evidence for Upwelling of Corrosive “Acidified” Water onto the Continental Shelf” (subs. req’), which found Our results show for the first time that a large section of the North American continental shelf is impacted by ocean acidification. Other continental shelf regions may also be impacted where anthropogenic CO2-enriched water is being upwelled onto the shelf. Or listen to the Australia’s ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, which warns: The world’s oceans are becoming more acid, with potentially devastating consequences for corals and the marine organisms that build reefs and provide much of the Earth’s breathable oxygen. The acidity is caused by the gradual buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, dissolving into the oceans. Scientists fear it could be lethal for animals with chalky skeletons which make up more than a third of the planet’s marine life…. Corals and plankton with chalky skeletons are at the base of the marine food web. They rely on sea water saturated with calcium carbonate to form their skeletons. However, as acidity intensifies, the saturation declines, making it harder for the animals to form their skeletal structures (calcify). “Analysis of coral cores shows a steady drop in calcification over the last 20 years,” says Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg of CoECRS and the University of Queensland. “There’s not much debate about how it happens: put more CO2 into the air above and it dissolves into the oceans. “When CO2 levels in the atmosphere reach about 500 parts per million, you put calcification out of business in the oceans.” (Atmospheric CO2 levels are presently 385 ppm, up from 305 in 1960.) I’d like to see an analysis of what happens when you get to 850 to 1000+ ppm because that is where we’re headed (see U.S. media largely ignores latest warning from climate scientists: “Recent observations confirm … the worst-case IPCC scenario trajectories (or even worse) are being realised” — 1000 ppm). In June, dozens of Academies of Science, including ours and China’s, issued a joint statement on ocean acidification, warned “Marine food supplies are likely to be reduced with significant implications for food production and security in regions dependent on fish protein, and human health and wellbeing” and “Ocean acidification is irreversible on timescales of at least tens of thousands of years.” They conclude: Ocean acidification is a direct consequence of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. To avoid substantial damage to ocean ecosystems, deep and rapid reductions of global CO2 emissions by at least 50% by 2050, and much more thereafter are needed. We, the academies of science working through the InterAcademy Panel on International Issues (IAP), call on world leaders to: • Acknowledge that ocean acidification is a direct and real consequence of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, is already having an effect at current concentrations, and is likely to cause grave harm to important marine ecosystems as CO2 concentrations reach 450 ppm and above; • Recognise that reducing the build up of CO2 in the atmosphere is the only practicable solution to mitigating ocean acidification; • Within the context of the UNFCCC negotiations in the run up to Copenhagen 2009, recognise the direct threats posed by increasing atmospheric CO2 emissions to the oceans and therefore society, and take action to mitigate this threat; • Implement action to reduce global CO2 emissions by at least 50% of 1990 levels by 2050 and continue to reduce them thereafter. If we want to save life in the oceans — and save ourselves, since we depend on that life — the time to start slashing carbon dioxide emissions is now.</span><br />

<strong>11. Transportation is one of the few sectors where CO2 emissions are still growing. Mode shift from fossil-fuel based transportation options key to avert global warming</strong><br />
<br />
<u><strong>Chapman 07</strong></u> (Professor - School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Science, University of Birmingham, UK Lee Chapman, Transport and climate change: a review, Journal of Transport Geography, Volume 15, Issue 5, September 2007, Pages 354–367)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8px;">1.1. Climate change Natural forces ensure that the Earth has experienced a changing climate since the beginning of time. However, during the last century, anthropogenic (human) activity has threatened significant climate change over a relatively short time period (Karl and Trenberth, 2003). The term ‘global warming’ is well documented and refers to the measured increase in the Earth’s average temperature. This is caused by the build-up of key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere accumulated from continual combustion of fossil fuels and landuse changes over the 20th century (Weubles and Jain, 2001). The anthropogenic signal has now become increasingly evident in the climate record where the rate and magnitude of warming due to greenhouse gases is directly comparable to actual observed increases of temperature (Watson, 2001). Any change to the composition of the atmosphere requires a new equilibrium to be maintained; a balance ultimately achieved by changes to the global climate. Radiative forcing, the change in the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation caused by changes in the composition of the atmosphere, is investigated by using global climate models (GCMs) that represent the interactions of the atmosphere, land-masses, oceans and ice-sheets. By predicting how the global climate will respond to various perturbations, projections can be made to determine how global climate will change under different conditions. Under the six illustrative emission scenarios used by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), CO2 levels are predicted to increase over the next century from 369 parts per million, to between 540 and 970 parts per million (Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000). This translates to an increase in globally averaged temperatures of between 1.4 and 5.8 °C (Watson, 2001), in turn leading to an increase in extreme weather events and a rise in sea levels. However, predictions made with GCMs need to be viewed with caution (Lindzens, 1990), as they are an oversimplification of what is a complicated and dynamic system. Indeed, the large number of emission scenarios considered underlines the uncertainty in making predictions so far into the future as it is unclear as to what extent technological and behavioural change will help the situation. Nevertheless, the growth in CO2 emissions is unsustainable and will soon exceed the level required for stabilisation (currently estimated to be in the region of 400–450 parts per million; Bristow et al., 2004). Furthermore, the radiative forcing experienced from CO2 today is a result of emissions during the last 100 years (Penner et al., 1999). It is this inertia that means that some impacts of anthropogenic climate change may yet remain undetected and will ensure that global warming will continue for decades after stabilisation. 1.2. The role of transport Oil is the dominant fuel source for transportation (Fig. 1a) with road transport accounting for 81% of total energy use by the transport sector (Fig. 1b). This </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">dependence on fossil fuels makes transport a major contributor of greenhouse gases and is </span><span style="font-size: 8px;">one of the few industrial sectors where emissions are still growing (WBCSD, 2001). The impact of transport on the global climate is not limited to vehicle emissions as the production and distribution of fuel from oil, a ‘wells to wheels’ approach, produces significant amounts of greenhouse gas in itself ( [Weiss et al., 2000], [Mizsey and Newson, 2001] and [Johannsson, 2003]). For example, consideration of total CO2 emissions from an average car showed that 76% were from fuel usage where as 9% was from manufacturing of the vehicle and a further 15% was from emissions and losses in the fuel supply system (Potter, 2003). Transport was one of the key sectors highlighted to be tackled by the 1997 Kyoto protocol. The aim was to reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% of 1990 levels by 2012. Therefore, since 1997, transport has featured heavily in the political agendas of the 38 developed countries who signed the agreement. Fig. 2a shows that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the transport sector accounts for 26% of global CO2 emissions</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (IEA, 2000), of which roughly two-thirds originates in the wealthier 10% of countries (Lenzen et al., 2003). Road transport is the biggest producer of greenhouse gases in the transport sector, although the motor car is not solely responsible for all these emissions (Fig. 2b). Buses, taxis and inter-city coaches all play a significant role, but the major contributor is road freight which typically accounts for just under half of the road transport total. Away from road transport, the biggest contributor to climate change is aviation. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Aviation is much more environmentally damaging than is indicated solely by CO2 emission figures</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. This is </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">due to other greenhouse gases being released directly into the upper atmosphere</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, where the localised effects can be more damaging then the effects of CO2 alone (Cairns and Newson, 2006). Although, the actual energy consumption and CO2 emissions from aviation appear relatively low when compared to the motor car (Fig. 2b, Table 1), it is the projected expansion in aviation which is the biggest concern. Air transport shows the highest growth amongst all transport modes (Lenzen et al., 2003) and is predicted to be as high as 5% per annum for the next decade (Somerville, 2003). All transport sectors are experiencing expansion (Table 1 and Table 2) and unfortunately there is a general trend that the modes which are experiencing the most growth, are also the most polluting. Fig. 3a shows a breakdown of CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre. Aviation and motor cars are increasingly the favoured modes for passenger transport, but are also significantly the most damaging. A similar picture is shown for freight in Fig. 3b where again, aviation and road freight are both the sectors with the biggest growth and highest CO2 emissions. Hence, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">there is a need to break the relationship between the current preferred movements of passengers and freight with the most polluting modes</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Either the favoured modes need to be made less polluting through technological change or </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">alternative modes need to be made more attractive via behavioural change driven by policy</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (DfT, 2005a). Clearly, the biggest challenges are car usage, the rpid expansion of aviation and the increase in road freight ( [Lenzen et al., 2003] and [DfT, 2004a]). Hence, this review focuses on the impact of growth in car use, aviation and freight with respect t o climate change inducing greenhouse gas emissions and discusses ways in which society can adapt to reduce the impacts.</span><br />

<strong>12. Warming empirically leads to extinction – oceanic sulfur bacteria poison us all</strong><br />
<br />
<u><strong>Dyer 2012</strong></u> (Gwynne, London-based independent journalist, Tick, tock to mass extinction date, June 19, 2012)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">There have been five mass extinctions in the past 500 million years</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, when 50 per cent or more of the species then existing on the Earth vanished, but until recently the only people taking any interest in this were paleontologists, not climate scientists. They did wonder what had caused the extinctions, but the best answer they could come up was &quot;climate change&quot;. It wasn't a very good answer. Why would a warmer or colder planet kill off all those species? The warming was caused by massive volcanic eruptions dumping huge quantities of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for tens of thousands of years. But it was very gradual and the animals and plants had plenty of time to migrate to climatic zones that still suited them. (That's exactly what happened more recently in the Ice Age, as the glaciers repeatedly covered whole continents and then retreated again.) There had to be a more convincing kill mechanism than that. The paleontologists found one when they discovered that a giant asteroid struck the planet 65 million years ago, just at the time when the dinosaurs died out in the most recent of the great extinctions. So they went looking for evidence of huge asteroid strikes at the time of the other extinction events. They found none. What they discovered was that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">there was</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> indeed </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">major warming at the time of all the other extinctions</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> - and that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the warming had radically changed the oceans. The currents that carry oxygen- rich cold water down to the depths shifted so that they were bringing down oxygen- poor warm water instead, and</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> gradually </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the depths of the oceans became anoxic</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">: the deep waters no longer had any oxygen. When that happens, the </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">sulfur bacteria that normally live in the silt</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (because oxygen is poison to them) </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">come out of hiding</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> and begin to multiply. Eventually </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">they rise all the way to the surface over the whole ocean, killing all the oxygen-breathing life. The ocean also starts emitting enormous amounts of lethal hydrogen sulfide gas that destroy the ozone layer</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> and directly poison land- dwelling species. This has happened many times in the Earth's history.</span><br />

<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8px;">The issue of the carbon footprint is a collateral benefit. Emissions from trains, be they conventional or high-speed, are about two thirds that of airplanes, and one third less that automobiles. And the higher the passenger load, the greater the greenhouse benefit. Overall, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">environmental analysts estimate that</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> between 12 billion and </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">6 billion pounds of CO2 can be eliminated</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> by diverting passengers from air and auto travel in passenger rail corridors ranging from 100 to 600 miles in length. Regarding the “green nature” of high-speed rail, the U.S. Department of Transportation believes they have sufficient data to demonstrate that the administration’s passenger rail improvement initiative promotes economic expansion (including new manufacturing jobs), creates new choices for travelers in addition to flying or driving, reduces national dependence on oil, and fosters urban and rural community development. Further, the Department contends that today’s intercity passenger rail service consumes one-third less energy per passenger-mile than cars, and estimates that if high-speed rail lines are ultimately built on all federally-designated corridors, it could result in an annual reduction of 6 billion pounds of CO2 . For its part, Amtrak forecasts, based on EPA and Department of Energy evaluation factors, that travel-related emissions and energy consumption savings in the Northeast Corridor alone would be approximately $400 million over the initial 30 years of its Northeast Corridor passenger rail improvement program. The California High-speed Rail Authority in 2008 issued a draft environmental impact review/ environmental impact study (EIR/EIS) that among other impacts addressed air pollution issues including greenhouse gasses. The draft EIR/EIS noted that it only calculated CO2 for alignment alternatives that reflected emissions from electrical power stations, planes, and onroad vehicles miles traveled (VMT). The highway component was based on potential daily VMT reductions of 32.691 million miles. The air travel component was based on potential reductions of 52,876 daily trips. Additionally, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the Climate Change Scoping Plan produced by the California Air Resources Board</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (CARB) (pursuant to AB 32) in 2008 </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">includes the HST system as one of the state’s fundamental strategies in meeting the 2020 emissions reduction goals. By 2020, the HST system is expected to have just started operations between San Francisco and Anaheim and is estimated to be only at 26% of the full ridership levels</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">— resulting in a reduction of one million metric tons of CO2 equivalent.</span></em><br />

<strong>14. HSR is energy efficient and sets up commitment to alternative energy, solving nationwide</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">A high-speed rail system could be the centerpiece to a sustainable United States. Trains are a sustainable form of transportation, and electric high-speed rails are the most energy efficient among them all. Not only could high-speed rails reduce road and airway congestion, they would decrease our carbon emissions and dependence on oil and automobiles</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">.¶ While electricity is still largely produced using coal, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">electric high-speed rails align the country with a move toward clean, renewable energy such as wind, solar, and geothermal. Creating an integrated, national high-speed rail system would help establish a commitment to using renewable energy as the future of fossil fuel use becomes increasingly bleak</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">.¶ The debate over installing high-speed rail systems to link major metropolitan areas across our country is picking up steam. Now in heated discussion throughout the country, many Democrats see the high-speed rail as the key to a sustainable future for the United States, while Republicans view these projects as poor investments. It’s causing mixed feelings in states like Ohio and Wisconsin, where the proposed high-speed rail project has come to a halt. At the request of Wisconsin’s outgoing governor, work has been suspended, given election results and concern over consequences that might result from cancellation of the project once work has begun. Wisconsin’s governor-elect has reaffirmed his commitment to stopping the Milwaukee-Madison rail, stating that he believes this project will not help enough people and will cost too much. The governor-elect has returned the $810 million in federal grant money that was awarded to the project in early October from the Federal Railroad Administration for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act). In Ohio, the same story has played out as the governor there sent federal funds back. Similar projects like the Virginia rail, part of the Southeast corridor high-speed rail project, are causing controversy of their own as those opposed are voicing concern over how “high-speed” these rails will actually be, doubting their efficiency. The question lingers – what would it take to make the high-speed rail work for both parties throughout the country?¶ A Profitable Option¶ Those opposed to high-speed rails often see more good in existing infrastructure investment, such as roadwork. They believe this investment will serve more people than a high-speed rail might. However, high-speed rails may become a popular idea with this audience if they can serve not only individuals but national productivity. The executive director for the American High-Speed Rail Alliance, Mary Ellen Curto, sees high-speed rails as a means of productivity and global competitiveness. She claims that as roadways and air travel become more congested, a high-speed rail could relieve some tension on distribution channels. High-speed rails may not be effective in every part of the U.S., but in densely populated areas, a national high-speed rail system could develop into part of a positive business model, becoming not only a sustainable option but a profitable one.¶ A Sustainable Option¶ According to a 2006 study by the Center for Clean Air Policy and the Center for Neighborhood Technology in 2006, “building a high-speed rail system across the US could result in 29 million fewer car trips and 500,000 fewer plane flights each year, saving 6 billion pounds of carbon dioxide emissions – the equivalent of removing a million cars from the road annually.” The suggestion that high-speed rails would not only thin out traffic but also significantly reduce the environmental impact of travel makes a strong case for their implementation.¶ Moving toward a sustainable national infrastructure is a great undertaking for our country, but it will create energy independence, promoting a healthy environment and economy - a sustainable future. This movement has to start somewhere, and that’s why city-to-city projects like the Madison-Milwaukee proposal raise important debates. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation is currently holding open house public meetings around the state so that residents can learn more and voice their opinions on the high-speed rail. There are 54 similar projects occurring in 23 states, so visit the U.S. Department of Transportation website to learn more about high-speed rail projects in your area and get involved in the discussion. It could mean the difference between serving our present and preserving our future.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8px;">In addition to supporting domestic job creation, clean energy is an important and fastest growing international sector, and one where overseas policy can be used to support poor developing regions – such as Africa (Jacobsen and Kammen, 2007) and Central America – as well as regaining market share in solar, fuel cell and wind technologies, where European nations and Japan have invested heavily and are reaping the benefits of month to year backlogs in clean energy orders. Some of those orders are for U. S. installations, but many more could be if we choose to make clean and green energy a national priority for both domestic installation and overseas export. Technology exports have impacts well beyond domestic job creation. In fact, if properly managed, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the development of a thriving ‘cleantech’ sector can address</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> a vital global issues, namely </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the emissions trajectories of major developing nations</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. China and India are often singled out for attention as major, emerging global emitters. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">China</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, in fact, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">will become the world’s largest greenhouse emitter in the near future</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, if it has not already. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">This fact, is often used</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> – mistakenly in my view – </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">to argue against unilateral climate protection efforts by</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> nations such as </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the United States. </span><span style="font-size: 8px;">This view is shortsighted in two vital respects. First, China is demonstrably already suffering from the impacts of fossil fuel use. Crop yields in many parts of China are significantly lower than they would be without the significant sulfur and particulate burden that results from domestic coal combustion. (In fact, coal combustions emissions from China have significant air quality impacts on Japan, and can be measured in the U. S. as well.) Crop losses of over 20% have been reported in part of China, with the decrease unambiguously linked to air pollution. China also experiences significant human health impacts from this pollution burden as well. Second, China has committed, on paper, to a ‘circular economy’ where waste is reduced and overall productivity is enhanced. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">If the United States were to become a major exporter, or even a partner, in</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> the production of </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">low-emissions technologies</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> – from truly carbon-capture coal-fired power plants, to increased numbers of solar, wind, and biofuel technologies – </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">China would be an eager trading partner</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, so that they could install increasing numbers of low-emissions technologies. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">This would directly help the Chinese economy and their environmental</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> and public health </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">situation</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. On both of these grounds, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">U. S. domestic expansion of the clean energy sector will</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> likely </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">positively impact the ability and the actions of</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> a number of </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">emerging economies to ‘go green’.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8px;">Any human activity causes damage to the natural environment. Mobility is a particular contributor to this through local pollution, extensive use of resources, landscape intrusion, habitat fragmentation, wildlife mortality, pressure over biodiversity, noise generation etc. Given this, dealing with increasing travel demands and increasing needs for mobility, as well as accommodating protection of the physical environment, appears to be a tricky issue. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">HSR</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, nevertheless, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">has characteristics that make it an efficient, and effective, solution to mitigate the impact of transportation on the environment, and climate, and make it an essential part of sustainable mobility systems</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. In addition, transport energy-related CO2 emissions are predicted to increase by 1.7% a year from 2004 to 2030. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The significant proportion of global emissions from transport indicates that the sector and HRS in particular can play a key role within the challenge of tackling climate change and sustainable development</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. 4.1 </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">HSR has a lower impact on climate and environment than all other compatible transport modes To compare the overall environmental performance of HSR with other competitive transport modes, all environmental impacts must be considered</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. These are, mainly: energy consumption and the combustion of fossil fuels; air pollutant emissions and noise; and environmental damage like land use and resource depletion. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">These impacts occur during the </span><span style="font-size: 8px;">construction, operation and maintenance</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;"> of HSR.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> The following chapter focuses on the most significant, and on-going, phase, the operation of HSR, and shows how HSR brings solutions to global challenges.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Another objection to HSR is that the track construction is linked with a high emission of CO2 due to the earthworks needed, the construction of viaducts and bridges, the track and rolling stock</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. In a background report for this study, the carbon footprint of 4 different routes in Europe and Asia has been analysed, including the construction of track and rolling stock. The emissions from the construction of the high speed rail lines lies in the range of 58 t – 176 t of CO2 per km of line and year. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Lines with a moderate space and relief constraints (for example in France) emits around 60t of CO2, By comparison, the carbon footprint of the construction of a 2x3 lane motorway is 73 t CO2</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> (with similar transport capacity under the same geographical conditions). Projects with important space (China) or topographical constraints (Taiwan) are linked with a higher value of around 139 t – 176 t of CO2 per km of HS-line and year due to the higher number of viaducts and tunnels. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">The carbon footprint of the track construction per Passenger and km is between 3.7 g CO2 and 8.9 g CO2, mainly depending on the share of viaducts and tunnels and the frequency of HSR trains. The construction, maintenance and disposal of the rolling stock lead to emissions of 0.8 CO2 to 1.0 g CO2 per pkm. Compared with the construction of a car (20.9 g CO2 / pkm), the construction of a HSR-Train is 20 times lower.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> The construction of an airplane (0.5g CO2 /pkm) is in the same order of magnitude as HSR. Thus, estimating the impacts during the full life cycle doesn’t change the low environmental impact of the HSR compared to other infrastructure/transport modes.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;"> It also shows that for HSR CO2 emissions of rolling stock are significantly less</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, compared to the upstream emissions from energy provision. In addition, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the construction of new HSR infrastructures allows it to replace other less sustainable modes such as aviation or the private car, </span><span style="font-size: 8px;">which have GHG emissions factors 5 or 6 times larger</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">. With the construction of new HSR lines, countries may effectively reduce their carbon emissions significantly.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> Hence, an integrated evaluation of the economical investments and the environmental impacts, of new HSR lines is needed to avoid some criticisms of new construction.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8px;">Between May 8th and May 16th 2012, TechnoMetrica conducted a CATI (Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview) survey among randomly selected households within the continental United States. In order to minimize non-response bias, TechnoMetrica interviewers conducted the interviews during weeknights and weekends. • The survey includes 1007 interviews using an RDD (Random Digit Dial) sample of both landline and cell phone numbers. • The number of interviews completed in each region of the country is proportional to its representation in the total US population. To further assure representation to the American population, we weighted the data by gender, age, and race reflective of Census proportions. • At the 95% confidence level, the margin of error for respondents’ overall sample (1007) is +/- 3.2 percentage points; for subgroups, the margins of error are higher and depend upon the size of the sample. Executive Summary Nearly two-thirds </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">(62%) of Americans are likely to use high-speed trains - 35% are “Very Likely” to use and another 27% are “Somewhat Likely” to use.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> Cost, time and convenience will be important considerations for many Americans in their decision to travel by a high-speed train.</span><br />

<strong>5. Nuclear war will not cause extinction – nuclear winter is overstated.</strong><br />
<br />
<u><strong>Dunning 2011</strong></u> (Brian, February 8, “Nuclear War and Nuclear Winter”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1204:http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4244 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4244" rel="nofollow">http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4244</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1204 -->)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8px;">Put on your jackets; today we're going to prepare for the </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">nuclear winter</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, the theorized period of catastrophic global cooling following a nuclear war. Some say that, if war happens, a nuclear winter is a certainty that will devastate agriculture and kill billions; some say that it's greatly overstated or even outright made-up by anti-nuke activists. Does the prospect of a nuclear winter truly constitute one more reason why nuclear arsenals should be dismantled? Our purpose today is not to explore the myriad other implications of nuclear war, or to otherwise prove that it's a bad thing. That's pretty clear. The obvious effects of a nuclear blast, the initial explosion itself and the radioactive fallout, are well established and not in dispute. As destructive as those are, their long-term environmental effects are negligible. So what, then, causes the nuclear winter? The concept of a nuclear winter entered the mainstream in 1983, when the &quot;TTAPS&quot; team, named for its authors Richard Turco, Owen Toon, Thomas Ackerman, James Pollack, and Carl Sagan, reviewed existing work and ran computational climate simulations to see what would happen when huge amounts of smoke were added to the atmosphere. The source of this smoke is not the nuclear explosion itself, but the all the building fires and wildfires that would follow each one. Take 150 nukes striking major population centers worldwide, and that's a lot of fires, with a smoke output greatly exceeding anything in human history. Members of the TTAPS team have also published many followup papers, revising and improving their estimates, but generally with similar results. Almost all of the simulations run by scientists replicating these results agree, at least in broad strokes, when the input variables are the same. It should be stressed that there are a lot of these variables. The principal weakness that these studies all share hinges on one of these variables, and it's a very important one: </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Exactly how much smoke will the fire following a nuclear bomb produce?</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> In 1986, Joyce Penner from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory published an article in the journal Nature in which she pointed out that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">this specific variable is responsible for determining whether the effects will be minor or massive</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. She also found that </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the published estimates of this varied widely</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Penner's paper was not the only one critical of the TTAPS predictions. However, this fact is often misinterpreted. The differences that have been found among the various simulations are of degree. Laypeople who hear of the criticism often think that the idea of a nuclear winter has been &quot;debunked&quot; or that it's some kind of discredited myth. This is not the case. Perhaps the most often cited and most critical paper was &quot;Nuclear Winter Reappraised&quot; by Starley Thompson and Stephen Schneider, published in 1986 in the journal Foreign Affairs. They did not dismiss the idea at all; rather they recharacterized it as a nuclear autumn. So here we get into the meat of the question. We know with pretty good certainty how a given amount of smoke in the atmosphere, distributed a certain way, will affect the climate and for how long; but what we can only guess at is how much smoke is produced when a city burns after a nuke. Our guesses are educated, but they're all over the map. Cities also vary wildly in just about every relevant aspect. Let's look at what we know from history. An obvious question to ask is whether these effects have been seen with any of the nuclear tests that many nations have conducted. Some 2,000 nuclear bombs have been detonated, somewhat less than half of which were in the atmosphere and are comparable to what would be used in a war. In none of them were any harmful smoke-induced environmental effects produced. However the reason for this is quite simple. Nuclear tests are not performed in cities filled with tens of thousands of combustible buildings; they happen way out in the desert or over the ocean, and no subsequent fires are created. But </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">what about the two cases when atomic weapons were used on real-life cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki?</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> Discussion of the subsequent fires in both cities are hard to come by, as they were not really what people were focusing on. Hiroshima developed a firestorm — where it builds into a single large fire with a central heat core that draws in oxygen with a powerful wind from all around — that peaked two to three hours after the explosion. Six hours after the explosion, nearly everything combustible within a one-and-a-half kilometer radius had been consumed, and the fire was almost completely out, leaving over 8 square kilometers destroyed. Descriptions of residual and secondary fires outside the radius of the firestorm are rare and hard to find, but it seems likely that several hundred or thousand small fires continued for the better part of 24 hours. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Photographs taken</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> of Hiroshima over the next few days </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">do not show any significant evidence of vast amounts of smoke</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Nagasaki was hit with a larger bomb, but its geography spared it a firestorm. Whereas Hiroshima is centered in a large flat plain, Nagasaki is irregularly shaped among hills and valleys, and cleft by a large harbor. Secondary fires were widespread, and Nagasaki firefighters had to cope with a damaged water system. It took several days to get the many small structure fires controlled or burned out. But Nagasaki's geography meant that there were far fewer fires than in Hiroshima. Again, the post-nuke photographs don't show vast atmospheric plumes of smoke. When the Iraqi army set 700 of Kuwait's oil wells on fire when they retreated in 1991, the wells burned for eight months, lofting about a million tons of smoke into the atmosphere. The TTAPS team predicted global climate change effects, that fortunately failed to materialize. Carl Sagan discussed this error in his book The Demon-Haunted World, and later research discovered the reason. The smaller individual smoke plumes, spread over a wide area, did not generate sufficient uplift to get the smoke into the upper atmosphere, even though theoretically enough smoke was produced. Temperatures did drop over the Persian Gulf, but the effect remained localized. Other cataclysmic events have proven that the nuclear winter scenario is not at all far-fetched. The eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines, also in 1991, threw some 17 million tons of particulates into the upper atmosphere that caused global temperatures to drop by about a degree for several months. Sunlight dropped by 10%. This temperature drop did not, however, have any long-term effect on agriculture. Pinatubo was only a blip compared the </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the K-T extinction event of some 65 million years ago, when a theorized asteroid hit us</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> with one hundred million megatons of destructive force, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">lighting</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> virtually </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the entire world on fire</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. The evidence of this is called the K-T boundary, a layer of clay found all around the world. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">Sunlight was reduced by 10-20% for ten years, which caused a massive cascading extinction of species from plants to herbivores to carnivores. But we shouldn't expect anything like this to happen from a nuclear war</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Times continue to change, including the nature of warfare. Nations no longer stockpile the megaton class weapons popular in the 1950s and 1960s; typical yields now are a fraction of a megaton. The United States' conventional capability is now so good that it can effectively destroy an entire nation's ability to wage large-scale war overnight, using only conventional weapons. But that doesn't mean the nuclear forces are no longer needed. Should a superpower strike first against the United States with nuclear weapons, the response would more than likely be nuclear, bringing Mutually Assured Destruction into play. But what about a small nation striking first? What about nukes in the trunks of cars parked in major cities? In the modern era, it's much less clear that any superpower would necessarily have anyone to shoot back at. Increasingly, non-superpower nations are building nuclear stockpiles. India and Pakistan might get into it with one another. Israel's foes might surprise it with nuclear weapons. Who knows what North Korea and Iran might do. Smaller regional nuclear wars remain a very real possibility. According to the worst-case estimates in the TTAPS papers, about one million tons of smoke would be expected from the fires resulting from each nuclear strike. And these smaller regional nuclear combats are expected to use about 50 nuclear weapons (compare this to 150 nuclear weapons for a broader global nuclear war). Thus, today's most likely nuclear scenario would be expected to produce climate effects similar to three Pinatubo events, according to the worst estimates, and still many orders of magnitude less than the K-T extinction. And so, while the nuclear winter scenario is a good prediction of the effects of a worst-case scenario, when all the variables are at their least favorable, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">the strongest probabilities favor a much less catastrophic nuclear autumn; and even those effects depend strongly on variables like whether the war happens during the growing season</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. A bomb in Los Angeles might result in history's worst firestorm, while a bomb in the mountains of Pakistan might create no fires at all. The simple fact is that there are too many unpredictable variables to know what kind of climate effects the smoke following nuclear fires will produce, until it actually happens. Obviously we're all very mindful of the many terrible implications of nuclear combat, and if it ever happens, the prospect of a nuclear autumn will likely be among the least of our concerns. The physicist Freeman Dyson perhaps described it best when he said &quot;</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8px;">(TTAPS is) an absolutely atrocious piece of science</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, but I quite despair of setting the public record straight... Who wants to be accused of being in favor of nuclear war?&quot; </span>
