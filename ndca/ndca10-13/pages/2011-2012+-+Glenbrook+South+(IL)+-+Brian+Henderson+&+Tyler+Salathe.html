<br />
There is, however, at least one state that could receive significant outside support: Saudi Arabia. And if it did, proliferation could accelerate throughout the region. Iran and Saudi Arabia have long been geopolitical and ideological rivals. Riyadh would face tremendous pressure to respond in some form to a nuclear-armed Iran, not only to deter Iranian coercion and subversion but also to preserve its sense that Saudi Arabia is the leading nation in the Muslim world.The Saudi government is already pursuing a nuclear power capability, which could be the first step along a slow road to nuclear weapons development. And concerns persist that it might be able to accelerate its progress by exploiting its close ties to Pakistan<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. During the 1980s, in response to the use of missiles during the Iran-Iraq War and their growing proliferation throughout the region, Saudi Arabia acquired several dozen CSS-2 intermediate-range ballistic missiles from China. The Pakistani government reportedly brokered the deal, and it may have also offered to sell Saudi Arabia nuclear warheads for the CSS-2s, which are not accurate enough to deliver conventional warheads effectively. There are still rumors that Riyadh and Islamabad have had discussions involving nuclear weapons, nuclear technology, or security guarantees. </span>This &quot;Islamabad option&quot; could develop in one of several different ways. Pakistan could sell operational nuclear weapons and delivery systems to Saudi Arabia, or it could provide the Saudis with the infrastructure, material, and technical support they need to produce nuclear weapons themselves within a matter of years, as opposed to a decade or longer. Not only has Pakistan provided such support in the past, but it is currently building two more heavy-water reactors for plutonium production and a second chemical reprocessing facility to extract plutonium from spent nuclear fuel. In other words, it might accumulate more fissile material than it needs to maintain even a substantially expanded arsenal of its own.<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> Alternatively, Pakistan might offer an extended deterrent guarantee to Saudi Arabia and deploy nuclear weapons, delivery systems, and troops on Saudi territory, a practice that the United States has employed for decades with its allies. This arrangement could be particularly appealing to both Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. It would allow the Saudis to argue that they are not violating the NPT since they would not be acquiring their own nuclear weapons. And an extended deterrent from Pakistan might be preferable to one from the United States because stationing foreign Muslim forces on Saudi territory would not trigger the kind of popular opposition that would accompany the deployment of U.S. troops. Pakistan, for its part, would gain financial benefits and international clout by deploying nuclear weapons in Saudi Arabia, as well as strategic depth against its chief rival, India. The Islamabad option raises a host of difficult issues, perhaps the most worrisome being how India would respond. Would it target Pakistan's weapons in Saudi Arabia with its own conventional or nuclear weapons? How would this expanded nuclear competition influence stability during a crisis in either the Middle East or South Asia? </span>Regardless of India's reaction, any decision by the Saudi government to seek out nuclear weapons, by whatever means, would be highly destabilizing. It would increase the incentives of other nations in the Middle East to pursue nuclear weapons of their own. And it could increase their ability to do so by eroding the remaining barriers to nuclear proliferation: each additional state that acquires nuclear weapons weakens the nonproliferation regime, even if its particular method of acquisition only circumvents, rather than violates, the NPT.<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> N-PLAYER COMPETITION </span>Were Saudi Arabia to acquire nuclear weapons, the Middle East would count three nuclear-armed states, and perhaps more before long. It is unclear how such an n-player competition would unfold because most analyses of nuclear deterrence are based on the U.S.-Soviet rivalry during the Cold War. It seems likely, however, that the interaction among three or more nuclear-armed powers would be more prone to miscalculation and escalation than a bipolar competition. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union only needed to concern themselves with an attack from the other. Multipolar systems are generally considered to be less stable than bipolar systems because coalitions can shift quickly, upsetting the balance of power and creating incentives for an attack. More important, emerging nuclear powers in the Middle East might not take the costly steps necessary to preserve regional stability and avoid a nuclear exchange. For nuclear-armed states, the bedrock of deterrence is the knowledge that each side has a secure second-strike capability, so that no state can launch an attack with the expectation that it can wipe out its opponents' forces and avoid a devastating retaliation. However, emerging nuclear powers might not invest in expensive but survivable capabilities such as hardened missile silos or submarine-based nuclear forces. Given this likely vulnerability, the close proximity of states in the Middle East, and the very short flight times of ballistic missiles in the region, any new nuclear powers might be compelled to &quot;launch on warning&quot; of an attack or even, during a crisis, to use their nuclear forces preemptively. Their governments might also delegate launch authority to lower-level commanders, heightening the possibility of miscalculation and escalation. Moreover, if early warning systems were not integrated into robust command-and-control systems, the risk of an unauthorized or accidental launch would increase further still. And without sophisticated early warning systems, a nuclear attack might be unattributable or attributed incorrectly.<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> That is, assuming that the leadership of a targeted state survived a first strike, it might not be able to accurately determine which nation was responsible. </span>And this uncertainty, when combined with the pressure to respond quickly, would create a significant risk that it would retaliate against the wrong party, potentially triggering a regional nuclear war<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. Most existing nuclear powers have taken steps to protect their nuclear weapons from unauthorized use: from closely screening key personnel to developing technical safety measures, such as permissive action links, which require special codes before the weapons can be armed. Yet there is no guarantee that emerging nuclear powers would be willing or able to implement these measures, creating a significant risk that their governments might lose control over the weapons or nuclear material and that nonstate actors could gain access to these items. Some states might seek to mitigate threats to their nuclear arsenals; for instance, they might hide their weapons. In that case, however, a single intelligence compromise could leave their weapons vulnerable to attack or theft. </span>Meanwhile, states outside the Middle East could also be a source of instability. Throughout the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union were engaged in a nuclear arms race that other nations were essentially powerless to influence. In a multipolar nuclear Middle East, other nuclear powers and states with advanced military technology could influence -- for good or ill -- the military competition within the region by selling or transferring technologies that most local actors lack today: solid-fuel rocket motors, enhanced missile-guidance systems, warhead miniaturization technology, early warning systems, air and missile defenses. <span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">Such transfers could stabilize a fragile nuclear balance if the emerging nuclear powers acquired more survivable arsenals as a result. </span>But they could also be highly destabilizing.<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> If, for example, an outside power sought to curry favor with a potential client state or gain influence with a prospective ally, it might share with that state the technology it needed to enhance the accuracy of its missiles and thereby increase its ability to launch a disarming first strike against any adversary. </span>The ability of existing nuclear powers and other technically advanced military states to shape the emerging nuclear competition in the Middle East could lead to a new Great Game, with unpredictable consequences.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal probably consists of approximately 90-110 nuclear warheads, although it could be larger. </span>Islamabad is producing fissile material, adding to related production facilities, and deploying additional delivery vehicles.These steps could enable Pakistan to undertake both quantitative and qualitative improvements to its nuclear arsenal<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Whether and to what extent Pakistan’s current expansion of its nuclear weapons-related facilities is a response to the 2008 U.S.-India nuclear cooperation agreement is unclear. </span>Islamabad does not have a public, detailed nuclear doctrine, but its “minimum credible deterrent” is widely regarded as designed to dissuade India from taking military action against Pakistan. <span style="font-size: 4pt;">Pakistan has in recent years taken a number of steps to increase international confidence in the security of its nuclear arsenal. In addition to overhauling nuclear command and control structures since September 11, 2001, Islamabad has implemented new personnel security programs. Moreover, Pakistani and some U.S. officials argue that, since the 2004 revelations about a procurement network run by former Pakistani nuclear official A.Q. Khan, Islamabad has taken a number of steps to improve its nuclear security and to prevent further proliferation of nuclearrelated technologies and materials. A number of important initiatives, such as strengthened export control laws, improved personnel security, and international nuclear security cooperation programs have improved Pakistan’s security situation in recent years.However</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>instability in Pakistan has called the extent and durability of <span style="font-size: 8pt;">these</span> reforms into question. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Some </span>observers fear radical takeover of a government that possesses a nuclear bomb, or proliferation by radical sympathizers within Pakistan’s nuclear complex in case of a breakdown of controls. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">While U.S. and Pakistani officials continue to express confidence in controls over Pakistan’s nuclear weapons, </span>continued instability in the country could impact these safeguards.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For a broader discussion, see CRS Report RL33498, </span>Pakistan-U.S. Relations, by K. Alan Kronstadt. This report will be updated. Chronic political instability in Pakistan and Islamabad’s military efforts against the Taliban and al-Qaeda have raised concerns about the security of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Some observers fear that </span>Pakistan’s strategic nuclear assets could be obtained by terrorists or used by elements in the Pakistani government.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen described U.S. concern about the matter during a September 22, 2008, speech: To the best of my ability to understand it—and that is with some ability—the weapons there are secure. And that even in the change of government, the controls of those weapons haven't changed. </span>That said, they are their weapons. They're not my weapons. And there are limits to what I know.Certainly at a worst-case scenario with respect to Pakistan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, I worry a great deal about </span>those weapons falling into the hands of terrorists and<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> either being </span>proliferated or <span style="font-size: 8pt;">potentially </span>used<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And so</span>, control of those, stability, stable control of those weapons is a key concern.<span style="font-size: 4pt;">And I think certainly the Pakistani leadership that I've spoken with on both the military and civilian side understand that. U.S. officials have generally expressed confidence in the security of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. President Obama addressed this issue in an April 29, 2009, press conference, stating, “I’m confident that we can make sure that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal is secure, primarily, initially, because the Pakistani army, I think, recognizes the hazards of those weapons falling into the wrong hands. We've got strong military-to-military consultation and cooperation.” He also recognized the sensitivity of the issue for Pakistan, saying, “[w]e want to respect their sovereignty, but we also recognize that we have huge strategic interests, huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable and that you don't end up having a nuclear-armed militant state.”1 Declining to engage in “hypotheticals” when asked if the United States is ready to secure the nuclear arsenal if the Pakistani government could not do so, President Obama said he felt “confident that that nuclear arsenal will remain out of militant hands.” More recently, thenDirector of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence February 3, 2010, that “from what we see of … measures that they take,” Pakistan is keeping its nuclear weapons secure. Furthermore, then-Department of State spokesperson Philip Crowley told </span>Fox News December 1, 2010, that the United States believes that Pakistan’s “nuclear weapons are secure.”2 And State Department spokesperson Mark Toner told reporters May 26, 2011, that “the safeguard and security of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons are of concern, but ... it’s an issue that we discussed with the Pakistani government, and we're sure that they're under safeguard.”<strong>The collapse or near-collapse of the Pakistani government is</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> probably </span><strong>the most likely scenario in which</strong> militants or <strong>terrorists</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> could </span><strong>acquire Pakistani nuclear weapons</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. General David H. Petraeus, the former Commander of U.S. Central Command, testified March 31, 2009, that “</span>Pakistani state failure would provide transnational terrorist groups and other extremist organizations an opportunity to acquire nuclear weapons and a safe haven from which to plan and launch attacks.” <span style="font-size: 8pt;">More recently, Gary Samore, National Security Council Coordinator for Arms Control and NonProliferation, stated in a May 2011 interview that The Pakistani government takes the nuclear security threat very seriously, and they’ve put a lot of resources into trying to make sure that their nuclear facilities and materials and weapons are well secured. There’s no lack of recognition that this is a very important issue, and there’s no lack of incentive on the part of the Pakistani government to maintain control. What I worry about is that, </span>in the context of broader tensions and problems within Pakistani society and polity—and that’s obviously taking place as we look at the sectarian violence and tensions between the government and the military and so forth<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—I worry that, </span>in that broader context, <strong>even the best nuclear security measures might break down</strong>.You’re dealing with a country that is under tremendous stress internally and externally, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and that’s what makes me worry. </span>They have good programs in place; the question is whether those good programs work in the context where these broader tensions and conflicts are present<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 4pt;">3 Additionally, former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf told CNN May 26, 2011, that “[i]f Pakistan disintegrates, then it can be dangerous. Otherwise, if Pakistan’s integrity is there, and which I'm sure it will be there as long as the armed forces of Pakistan are there, there is no danger of the nuclear assets or strategic assets falling in any terrorist hands.”4 Pakistani efforts to improve the security of its nuclear weapons have been ongoing and include some cooperation with the United States; Musharraf told a journalist that Islamabad has “given State Department nonproliferation experts insight into the command and control of the Pakistani arsenal and its on-site safety and security procedures.”5 Since the 1998 Pakistani and Indian nuclear tests, the international community has increased attention to reducing the risk of nuclear war in South Asia. The two countries most recently came to the brink of full-scale war in 1999 and 2002, and, realizing the dangers, have developed some risk reduction measures to prevent accidental nuclear war. Islamabad has also developed its command and control systems and improved the security of its military and civilian nuclear facilities. Since the 2004 revelations of an extensive international nuclear proliferation network run by Pakistani nuclear official Abdul Qadeer Khan, as well as possible connections between Pakistani nuclear scientists and Al Qaeda, Islamabad has made additional efforts to improve export controls and monitor nuclear personnel.</span>The main security challenges for Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal are keeping the integrity of the command structure, ensuring physical security, and preventing illicit proliferation from insiders<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Pakistan continues to produce fissile material for weapons and appears to be augmenting its weapons production facilities, as well as deploying additional delivery vehicles—steps that will enable both quantitative and qualitative improvements in Islamabad’s nuclear arsenal<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Pakistan’s nuclear energy program dates back to the 1950s, but it was the loss of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in a war with India that probably triggered a January 1972 political decision (just one month later) to begin a secret nuclear weapons program.7 </span>Deterring India’s nuclear weapons and augmenting Pakistan’s inferior conventional forces are widely believed to be the primary missions for Islamabad’s nuclear arsenal.Observers point to India’s 1974 “peaceful” nuclear explosion as the pivotal moment that gave additional urgency to the program<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 4pt;">Pakistan produced fissile material for its nuclear weapons using gas-centrifuge-based uranium enrichment technology, which it mastered by the mid-1980s. Highly-enriched uranium (HEU) is one of two types of fissile material used in nuclear weapons; the other is plutonium. The country’s main enrichment facility is a centrifuge plant located at Kahuta; Pakistan may have other enrichment sites.8 Islamabad gained enrichment-related technology from many sources. This extensive assistance is reported to have included uranium enrichment technology from Europe, blueprints for a small nuclear weapon from China, and missile technology from China. The United States had information during the 1970s that Pakistan was constructing a uranium enrichment facility.9 A.Q. Khan has stated that Pakistan began enriching uranium in 1978 and produced HEU in 1983.10 Although Pakistan subsequently told the United States that it would produce only low-enriched uranium (which is not used as fissile material in nuclear weapons),11 U.S. and Pakistani officials who were in government in 1990 indicated during a 1994 meeting that Islamabad decided sometime after October 1989 to resume producing HEU.12 However, another Pakistani official suggested during the same meeting that the decision may have happened sooner.13 The United States had information during the 1970s and early 1980s that Pakistan was pursuing nuclear weapons designs, but exactly when Pakistan produced a workable nuclear explosive device is unclear. 14 A 1985 National Intelligence Council report stated that Pakistan “probably has a workable design for a nuclear explosive device” and was “probably ... a year or two away from a capacity to produce enough” highly enriched uranium for such a device.15 A 1987 National Security Council (NSC) memorandum described Pakistan’s “continued pursuit ... of its nuclear weapons option.”16 A 1993 NSC report to Congress stated that Islamabad’s nuclear weapons efforts “culminated with the capability to rapidly assemble a nuclear device if necessary by the end of the 1980s.”17 A.Q. Khan stated in an interview published in May 1998 that Islamabad “attained” the capability to detonate such a device “at the end of 1984.”18 Similarly, Khan reportedly stated in a January 2010 speech that Pakistan “had become a nuclear power” in 1984 or 1985.19 In any case, President Bush’s failure to certify in 1990 that Pakistan did not “possess a nuclear explosive device” led to a cut-off in military and financial aid under the Pressler Amendment.20</span>After India conducted nuclear weapon tests on May 11 and May 13, 1998, Pakistan’s government responded on May 28 and May 30 with six tests in western Pakistan. Test yields were about 10 kilotons and 5 kilotons, according to seismic analysis<span style="font-size: 4pt;">.21 The United States imposed additional sanctions after the tests, but these were lifted after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. According to public estimates, Pakistan has about 90-110 nuclear weapons, though it could have more.22 Pakistan’s nuclear warheads use an implosion design with a solid core of approximately 15-20 kilograms of HEU.23 Islamabad reportedly continues to produce HEU for weapons at a rate of at least 100 kilograms per year.24 Pakistan has also pursued plutonium-based warheads and continues to produce plutonium for weapons. Islamabad has received Chinese and European assistance for at least some of its plutonium program. The 40-50 megawatt heavy-water Khushab plutonium production reactor has been operating since 1998.25 It appears that Islamabad is constructing two additional heavy-water reactors, which will expand considerably Pakistan’s plutonium production capacity, at the same site.26 Additionally, Pakistan has a reprocessing facility27 at the Pakistan Institute of Science and Technology (PINSTECH) and is apparently constructing other such facilities. </span>Nuclear Fuel reported in 2000 that, according to “senior U.S. government officials,” Islamabad had begun operating a “pilot-scale” reprocessing facility at the New Laboratories facility at PINSTECH.28 Pakistan also appears to be constructing a second reprocessing facility at the site29 and may be completing a reprocessing facility located at Chasma.30 Islamabad’s construction of additional nuclear reactors and expansion of its reprocessing capabilities could indicate plans to increase and improve Pakistan’s nuclear weapons arsenal in the near future. Indeed, then-Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Director Michael Maples told the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 10, 2009, that “Pakistan continues to develop its nuclear infrastructure, expand nuclear weapon stockpiles and seek more advanced warheads and delivery systems.”31 Similarly, Admiral Mullen confirmed during the May 14, 2009, hearing that the United States has “evidence” that Pakistan is expanding its nuclear arsenal. Pakistani officials have indicated that they have already determined the arsenal size needed for a minimum nuclear deterrent and that they will not engage in an arms race with India. Pakistan’s Foreign Secretary stated in October 2007 that Pakistan “will not be the first to test in our region.”32 Moreover, the government’s National Command Authority (NCA) “expressed satisfaction” regarding “the pace of development and effectiveness of Pakistan’s strategic deterrence,” according to a December 14, 2010, statement.33 Nevertheless,Pakistan appears to be increasing its fissile production capability and improving its delivery vehicles in order to hedge against possible increases in India’s nuclear arsenal. Islamabad may also accelerate its current nuclear weapons efforts. India has stated that it needs only a “credible minimum deterrent,” but New Delhi has never defined what it means by such a deterrent and has refused to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Furthermore, both the agreement and associated 2008 decision by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to exempt India from some of its export guidelines will renew New Delhi’s access to the international uranium market. This access will result in more indigenous Indian uranium available for weapons because it will not be consumed by India’s newly safeguarded reactors.34 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Pakistani officials have offered estimates for the number of additional nuclear weapons that New Delhi could build. For example, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, Pakistan’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, argued in an October 2010 letter to a British newspaper that eight Indian nuclear reactors that will not be subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards have the potential to produce 280 nuclear weapons annually.35 India currently has approximately 60-100 nuclear weapons, according to public estimates.36 </span>Pakistani officials have stated that the government may need to increase significantly its nuclear arsenal in response to possible Indian plans to do the same<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. According to an April 2006 television broadcast, </span>Pakistani officials from the government’s NCA expressed “concern” that the 2008 U.S.-India nuclear cooperation agreement could tilt the strategic balance between India and Pakistan in favor of the former<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The officials suggested that Islamabad may need to increase or improve its nuclear arsenal in order to “to meet all requirements of minimum credible defence deterrence.”<span style="font-size: 8pt;">37 (See the “Nuclear Doctrine” section for more on Pakistan’s deterrence concept). Similarly, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the IAEA wrote in July 2008 </span>that<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the agreement </span>could cause a nuclear arms race between Pakistan and India.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">38 Moreover, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson indicated during a May 21, 2009, press briefing that, </span>despite the government’s continued opposition to a “nuclear or conventional arms race in South Asia,” Pakistan may need to increase its nuclear arsenal in response to Indian conventional and nuclear arms expansion. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Illustrating this point, a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesperson reacted to India’s July 26, 2009, launch of its first indigenously built nuclear-powered submarine by asserting that “</span>continued induction of new lethal weapon systems by India is detrimental to regional peace and stability<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” adding that </span>“[w]ithout entering into an arms race with India, Pakistan will take all appropriate steps to safeguard its security and maintain strategic balance in South Asia.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">” The submarine, which is not yet deployed, will reportedly be capable of carrying nuclear-armed ballistic missiles.39 Similarly, according to the January 2010 statement, the NCA identified </span>“developments detrimental to the objectives of strategic stability in the region,” including India’s acquisition of “advanced weapons systems” and missile defense systems.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The NCA also noted that the 2008 NSG decision described above, as well as subsequent nuclear fuel supply agreements that New Delhi has concluded with several governments, “would enable India to produce substantial quantities of fissile material for nuclear weapons by freeing up its domestic resources.” The statement suggests </span>that Pakistan could increase or improve its nuclear weapons in response to these developments<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, but does not explicitly say so. Whether and to what extent Pakistan’s current expansion of its nuclear weapons-related facilities is a response to the U.S.-India agreement is unclear, partly because descriptions of the government’s decisions regarding those facilities are not publicly available. </span>In addition to making qualitative and quantitative improvements to its nuclear arsenal, <strong>Pakistan could increase the number of circumstances under which it would be willing to use nuclear weapons</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, Peter Lavoy has argued that </span>India’s efforts to improve its conventional military capabilities could enable New Delhi to achieve “technical superiority” in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as precision targeting, providing India with “the capability to effectively locate and efficiently destroy strategically important targets in Pakistan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”40 </span>Islamabad could respond by lowering the threshold for using nuclear weapons,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> according to Lavoy. Indeed, a Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesperson warned in May 2009 that </span>Islamabad could take this step<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. (See the “Nuclear Doctrine” section.) </span>The Pakistani government may also consider fielding lower-yield nuclear weapons in order to increase the credibility of its nuclear deterrent versus Indian conventional military operations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">41 Nevertheless, Islamabad’s nuclear weapons program may face some budget constraints. Former DIA Director Maples testified in 2009 that “the economic decline will likely slow” the government’s progress in improving its nuclear and conventional military forces. Furthermore, Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program reportedly faced “severe financial cuts” in 2009.42 Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty Pakistani officials cite their concern about India’s recently acquired ability to expand its nuclear arsenal as a reason for refusing to support negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament (CD), which operates by consensus, on a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT).43 The CD adopted a program of work44 in May 2009 that established a working group charged with negotiating an FMCT on the basis of the 1995 “Shannon Mandate.”45 Although Pakistan supported the work plan in 2009, it did not support the adoption of a draft program of work for 2010.46 Ambassador Zamir Akram, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the CD, stated February 18, 2010, that Islamabad had supported the 2009 program of work47 because the government had believed that the Obama administration might reverse U.S. policy on nuclear cooperation with India. Pakistan, which is widely regarded as the main opponent to the start of negotiations,48 argues that a treaty on fissile material should not only prohibit the production of new material, but should also require states with such material to reduce their stocks.49 A treaty without such a requirement, according to Pakistan, will put the country at a disadvantage with respect to India because of what Islamabad characterizes as New Delhi’s larger fissile material stocks and production capability.50 Although the Shannon Mandate states that it “does not preclude any delegation” from proposing the inclusion of existing stocks in the negotiations, Islamabad argues that the CD ought to determine the treaty’s scope prior to beginning negotiations.51 Akram stated June 1, 2011, that Pakistan has not changed its position on this question. Delivery Vehicles Pakistan has two types of delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons: aircraft controlled by the Pakistan Air Force and surface-to-surface missiles controlled by the Pakistan Army. Pakistan could deliver its nuclear weapons using F-16 fighter aircraft purchased from the United States, provided that modifications are made. It is widely believed that Islamabad has made the relevant modifications to the F-16s previously sold to them by Washington.52 Although concerns have been raised about the impact of these sales on the strategic balance in South Asia,53 the U.S. government maintains that the sale of additional F-16s to Pakistan will not alter the regional balance of power.54 The contract for provision of an additional 18 aircraft was signed in 2006, as was the contract for the weapons for those aircraft and a contract to perform the mid-life upgrade on Pakistan’s F-16A/B model aircraft.55 Pakistan’s F-16 fleet will, therefore, be expanded, but it is unclear what portion of the fleet will be capable of a nuclear mission. Mirage V aircraft may also be used as delivery vehicles.56 Pakistan has three types of ballistic missiles57 thought to be nuclear-capable: the solid-fuel </span>HatfIII (Ghaznavi), with a range of approximately 300-400 kilometers58; the solid-fuel Hatf-IV (Shaheen), with a range of over 450 kilometers59; and the liquid-fuel Hatf-V (Ghauri), with an approximate range of almost 1,300 kilometers.60 The solid-fuel Hatf-VI (Shaheen-2) missile, when deployed, will be “capable of reaching targets out to 2,000 kilometers,” former DIA Director Maples stated March 10, 2009,61 adding that Islamabad has made “significant progress” on the missile. A 2009 National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) report appears to support this conclusion, stating that the missile “probably will soon be deployed.” Islamabad continues to carry out ballistic missile tests, but notifies India in advance in accordance with an October 2005 bilateral missile pre-notification pact.62 Maples also indicated that Pakistan is developing nuclear-capable cruise missiles; the Babur (ground-launched) and the Ra’ad (airlaunched), both of which will have estimated ranges of 320 kilometers, according to the NASIC report.63 In an April 29, 2011, announcement of a successful flight test of the Ra’ad, the Pakistani government gave the missile’s range as 350 kilometers.64 Nuclear Doctrine Pakistan’s strategic doctrine is undeclared, and will probably remain so, but prominent officials and analysts have offered insights concerning its basic tenets.65 Describing the guiding principle as minimum credible nuclear deterrence,66 high-level officials’ statements point to four policy objectives for Islamabad’s nuclear weapons: deter all forms of external aggression; deter through a combination of conventional and strategic forces; deter counterforce strategies by securing strategic assets and threatening nuclear retaliation; and stabilize strategic deterrence in South Asia.67 Pakistani officials have also indicated that this nuclear posture is designed to preserve territorial integrity against Indian attack, prevent military escalation, and counter its main rival’s conventional superiority.68<strong>Pakistan has</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> pledged no-first-use against non-nuclear-weapon states, but has </span><strong>not ruled out first use against</strong> a nuclear-armed aggressor, such as <strong>India</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.69 Some analysts say this ambiguity serves to maintain deterrence against India’s conventional superiority; the </span>Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated <span style="font-size: 8pt;">May 21, 2009, </span>that “there are acquisitions of sophisticated weaponry by our neighbour which will disturb the conventional balance between our two countries and hence, lower the nuclear threshold.”<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Other analysts argue that </span>keeping the first-use option against New Delhi allows Islamabad to conduct sub-conventional operations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, such as support for low intensity conflict or proxy war in Kashmir, while effectively deterring India at the strategic level.70 </span>Pakistan has reportedly addressed issues of survivability through pursuing a second strike capability, possibly building hard and deeply buried storage and launch facilities, deploying roadmobile missiles, deploying air defenses around strategic sites, and utilizing concealment measures.<span style="font-size: 5pt;">71 </span><strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Command and Control </span></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Pakistan’s command and control over its nuclear weapons is compartmentalized and includes strict operational security. The government’s command and control system is based on “C4I2SR” (command, control, communication, computers, intelligence, information, surveillance and reconnaissance). Islamabad’s Strategic Command Organization has a three-tiered structure, consisting of the National Command Authority (NCA), the Strategic Plans Division (SPD), and the Strategic Forces Commands. The NCA, established in 2000, supervises the functions and administration of all of Pakistan’s organizations involved in nuclear weapons research, development, and employment, as well as the military services that operate the strategic forces.72 The prime minister, as head of government, is chairperson of the NCA.73 The NCA also includes the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, the ministers of defense, interior, and finance, the director general of the SPD, and the commanders of the Army, Air Force, and Navy. The final authority to launch a nuclear strike requires consensus within the NCA; the chairperson must cast the final vote. The NCA is comprised of two committees, the Employment Control Committee (ECC) and the Development Control Committee (DCC), each of which includes a mix of civilian and military officials. The ECC’s functions include establishing a command and control system over the use of nuclear weapons. The DCC “exercises technical, financial and administrative control over all strategic organisations, including national laboratories and research and development organisations associated with the development and modernisation of nuclear weapons.”74 The SPD is headed by a director general from the Army and acts as the secretariat for the NCA. The SPD’s functions include formulating Islamabad’s nuclear policy, strategy, and doctrine; developing the nuclear chain of command; and formulating operational plans at the service level for the movement, deployment, and use of nuclear weapons. The Army, Air Force, and Navy each have their own strategic force command, but operational planning and control remains with the NCA. The SPD coordinates operational plans with the strategic forces commands. According to current and former Pakistani officials, Islamabad employs a system which requires that at least two, and perhaps three, people authenticate launch codes for nuclear weapons.75 On December 13, 2007, then-President Musharraf formalized these authorities and structure in the “National Command Authority Ordinance, 2007.”76 The NCA was established by administrative order, but now has a legal basis. Analysts point out that the timing of this ordinance was meant to help the command and control system weather political transitions and potentially preserve the military’s strong control over the system. The ordinance also addresses the problems of the proliferation of nuclear expertise and personnel reliability. It outlines punishable offenses related to breach of confidentiality or leakage of “secured information,” gives the SPD authority to investigate suspicious conduct, states that punishment for these offenses can be up to 25 years imprisonment, and applies to both serving and retired personnel, including military personnel, notwithstanding any other laws. As a result, Pakistani authorities say that the ordinance should strengthen their control over strategic organizations and their personnel. </span><strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Security Concerns </span></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">According to a 2001 Department of Defense report, Islamabad’s nuclear weapons “are probably stored in component form,”77 which suggests that the nuclear warheads are stored separately from delivery vehicles. According to some reports, the fissile cores of the weapons are separated from the non-nuclear explosives.78 But whether this is actually the case is unclear; one report states that the warheads and delivery vehicles are probably stored separately in facilities close to one another, but says nothing about the fissile cores.79 And, according to an account of a 2008 experts’ group visit to Pakistan, Lt. Gen. Khalid Kidwai, the head of the SPD, suggested that the nuclear warheads (containing the fissile cores) may be mated with their delivery vehicles.80 According to Kidwai, the report says, the SPD’s official position is that the weapons “will be ready when required, at the shortest notice; [but] the Pakistani doctrine is not endorsing a US-USSR model with weapons on hair trigger alert.” The 2001 Defense Department report says that Pakistan can probably assemble its weapons fairly quickly.81 It warrants mention that, </span>although separate storage may provide a layer of protection against accidental launch or prevent theft of an assembled weapon, it may be easier for unauthorized people to remove a weapon’s fissile material core if it is not assembled. Dispersal of the assets may also create more potential access points for acquisition and may increase the risk of diversion.<span style="font-size: 4pt;">82 As the United States prepared to launch an attack on the Afghan Taliban after September 11, 2001, President Musharraf reportedly ordered that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal be redeployed to “at least six secret new locations.”83 This action came at a time of uncertainly about the future of the region, including the direction of U.S.-Pakistan relations. Islamabad’s leadership was uncertain whether the United States would decide to conduct military strikes against Pakistan’s nuclear assets if the government did not assist the United States against the Taliban. Indeed, President Musharraf cited protection of Pakistan’s nuclear and missile assets as one of the reasons for Islamabad’s dramatic policy shift.84 These events, in combination with the 1999 Kargil crisis, the 2002 conflict with India at the Line of Control, and revelations about the A.Q. Khan proliferation network, inspired a variety of reforms to secure the nuclear complex. Risk of nuclear war in South Asia ran high in the 1999 Kargil crisis, when the Pakistani military is believed to have begun preparing nuclear-tipped missiles.85 It should be noted that, even at the high alert levels of 2001 and 2002, there were no reports of Pakistan mating the warheads with delivery systems.86 In the fall of 2007 and early 2008, some</span>observers expressed concern about the security of the country’s arsenal if political instability were to persist<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 4pt;">87 Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto As noted, this confidence has continued into 2011. James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, told the House Intelligence Committee February 10 that “our assessment is that the nuclear weapons in Pakistan are secure.” General Petraeus told the Senate Armed Services Committee March 15 that “[t]here is quite considerable security for the Pakistani nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” </span>U.S. knowledge of Pakistan’s arsenal, however, remains limited, according to U.S. officials.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For example, Mullen stated that </span>“we’re limited in what we actually know” about Islamabad’s nuclear arsenal.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, similarly acknowledged in a May 18, 2010, speech that </span>the United States does not possess the intelligence to locate all of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons-related sites. <span style="font-size: 4pt;">Other governments have also voiced opinions regarding the security of Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal. For example, Indian National Security Adviser M. K. Narayanan said that the arsenal is safe and has adequate checks and balances.97 Similarly, then-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs David Miliband told the </span>Charlie Rose Show December 15, 2008, that Islamabad’s nuclear weapons “are under pretty close lock and key.” Furthermore, according to Director of the French General Directorate of External Security Erard Corbin de Mangoux, Pakistan’s military and civilian leaders have a “sense of responsibility” to maintain control over the country’s nuclear weapons; these leaders “know that the international status to which they aspire depends directly on their ability to exercise complete control over such an instrument of power,” he argued in an interview published in spring 2010.98 Other officials, however, have sounded somewhat less optimistic. For example, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov said in a March 24, 2009, television interview thatMoscow is “very much concerned” about the security of Pakistan’s arsenal.99 Indian officials expressed concerns about the security of Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal following a May 2011 insurgent attack on a military installation in Karachi.100 <span style="font-size: 4pt;">Pakistani officials have consistently expressed confidence in the security of the country’s nuclear arsenal.101 Then-President Musharraf stated in November 2007 that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons are under “total custodial controls.”102 More recently, President Asif Ali Zardari told </span>CNN December 2, 2008, that the country’s nuclear command and control system “is working well.” Additionally, a Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated May 21, 2009, that “there is simply no question of our strategic assets falling into the wrong hands. We have full confidence in our procedures, mechanisms and command and control systems.” Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani stated May 8, 2010, that Islamabad has “laid to rest” concerns about its nuclear arsenal’s security.103 The May 2011 U.S. strike that killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden generated a public discussion in Pakistan as to whether a country such as India or the United States could successfully attack and destroy Pakistan’s nuclear weapons.104 Responding to these concerns, Prime Minster Gilani stated My 25, 2011, that the country’s “strategic assets are well protected and our capability to defend our sovereignty, territorial integrity and liberties of our people, is very much in place.”105 In addition to the above scenarios,the security of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons could also be jeopardized by another conflict between India and Pakistan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Michael Krepon argued, explaining that </span>an “<strong>escalating war with nuclear forces in the field would increase the probability of accidents, miscalculations, and the use of nuclear weapons</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” This is because</span> <strong>[w]hen tensions rise precipitously with India, the readiness level of Pakistan’s nuclear deterrent also rises</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Because the geographical coordinates of Pakistan’s main nuclear weapon storage sites<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,</span> <strong>missile, and air bases can be readily identified from satellites—and therefore targeted by opposing forces</strong>—the dictates of deterrence mandate some movement of launchers and weapons from fixed locations during crises<strong>. Nuclear weapons on the move are inherently less secure than nuclear weapons at heavily-guarded storage sites. Weapons and launchers in motion are also more susceptible to “insider” threats and accidents.106 Such a war,</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Krepon added</span><strong>, would</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">also</span> <strong>place stress on the army’s unity of command.</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Krepon has also pointed out that</span> <strong>Islamabad faces a dilemma, because less-dispersed nuclear weapons may be more vulnerable to a disarming military strike from India.</strong><span style="font-size: 4pt;">107 U.S. Assistance and Pakistani Nuclear Security U.S. plans to secure Pakistani nuclear weapons in case of a loss of control by the Pakistani government were famously addressed during former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s confirmation hearing in January 2005. In response to a question from Senator John Kerry asking what would happen to Pakistan’s nuclear weapons in the event of a radical Islamic coup in Islamabad, Secretary Rice answered, “[w]e have noted this problem, and we are prepared to try to deal with it.”108 On November 12, 2007, responding to press reports about this contingency, a Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson said, “Pakistan possesses adequate retaliatory capacity to defend its strategic assets and sovereignty,” emphasizing that Islamabad’s nuclear weapons have been under “strong multi-layered, institutionalized decision-making, organizational, administrative and command and control structures since 1998.”109 The issue of U.S. contingency plans to take over Pakistani strategic assets was raised again in the press following Benazir Bhutto’s assassination, and was met with similar assurances by Pakistan’s government.110 More recently, a Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson, responding to a report detailing alleged U.S.-Pakistani discussions regarding contingency plans for U.S. forces to help secure Islamabad’s nuclear weapons, stated November 8, 2009, that Pakistan “does not require any foreign assistance in this regard.”</span>Pakistan will never “allow any country to have direct or indirect access to its nuclear and strategic facilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” the spokesperson said, adding that “</span>no talks have ever taken place on the issue of the security of Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal with US officials<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”111 U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Anne Patterson stated the same day that the United States “has no intention to seize Pakistani nuclear weapons or material.” Gates stated during the January 2010 television interview that </span>the United States has “no intention or desire to take over any of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”</span><span style="font-size: 4pt;">112 The United States reportedly offered nuclear security assistance to Pakistan soon after September 11, 2001.113 U.S. assistance to Islamabad, which must comply with nonproliferation guidelines, has reportedly included the sharing of best practices and technical measures to prevent unauthorized or accidental use of nuclear weapons, as well as contribute to physical security of storage facilities and personnel reliability.114 Some press reports say that the United States provided Pakistan with Permissive Action Links (PALs) in 2003, although former Pakistani military officials have said Pakistan has developed PALs for its warheads without assistance.115 PALs require a code to be entered before a weapon can be detonated. As noted above, Islamabad employs a system requiring that at least two, and perhaps three, people authenticate launch codes for nuclear weapons.116 Security at nuclear sites in Islamabad is the responsibility of a 10,000member security force, commanded by a two-star general. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage confirmed in a November 2007 interview that there has been U.S. assistance in this area, explaining that the United States was unlikely to intervene militarily in a crisis in Pakistan because “we have spent considerable time with the Pakistani military, talking with them and working with them on the security of their nuclear weapons. I think most observers would say that they are fairly secure. They have pretty sophisticated mechanisms to guard the security of those.”117 Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, former Director of the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence at the U.S. Department of Energy, pointed out in May 2009 that “there’s not a lot of transparency into” how Islamabad spends the U.S. funds, but he nevertheless characterized them as “money well spent.”118 A Pakistani official said in November 2009 that Pakistan reserves the right to “pick and choose” the nuclear security measures it will undertake, adding that Islamabad will only accept such measures that are “nonintrusive.” 119 The extent to which Pakistan has shared information about its nuclear arsenal with the United States is unclear. Although, as noted, former President Musharraf has acknowledged Islamabad’s sharing of some information, </span>General Tariq Majid, chair of Pakistan’s Joint Chiefs of Staff<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Committee, </span>stated<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> November 9, 2009</span>, that “there is absolutely no question of sharing or allowing any foreign individual, entity or a state, any access to sensitive information about our nuclear assets.”<span style="font-size: 8pt;">120 Air Commodore Khalid Banuri, Director of Arms Control and Disarmament Affairs in the SPD, indicated in a 2008 interview that Islamabad accepts U.S. “education and awareness, but in a completely non-intrusive way,” adding that Pakistan has “some rudimentary equipment and some training” from the United States. Banuri described giving U.S. officials access to Pakistan’s nuclear weapons facilities as a “red line” that Islamabad will not cross.121 The U.S. government has also reportedly offered assistance to secure or destroy radioactive materials that could be used to make a radioactive dispersal device, and to ship highly enriched uranium used in the Pakistani civilian nuclear sector out of the country.122 Pakistan’s response to these proposals is unclear, and downturns in the bilateral relationship overall may have complicated efforts to make progress in this area. It is worth noting that, </span>according to some observers, spent fuel from Pakistan’s Karachi and Chasma nuclear power plants could be vulnerable to theft or attack<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.123 However, Pakistani officials have expressed confidence in the security of its facilities124 and have said that Islamabad has no plans to transport spent fuel from either reactor. Moreover, the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA) has a Nuclear Security Action Plan, which includes a description of regulations for handling spent nuclear fuel. The PNRA states that Pakistan follows IAEA physical protection standards.125 </span><strong>Proliferation</strong> A fundamental aspect of nuclear security is ensuring that personnel with sensitive knowledge do not proliferate that expertise, but this aspect of nuclear security in Pakistan was recognized only in the past 10 years and resulted in significant reforms of its personnel security system<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Many observers continue to be concerned that </span><strong>other states or terrorist organizations could obtain material or expertise related to nuclear weapons from elements in Pakistan.126 This view is only encouraged by recent instability and governance problems.</strong><br />

<em>By deploying modern computers and modern cli­mate models, the two of us and our colleagues have shown that not only were the ideas of the 1980s correct but the effects would last for at least 10 years, much longer than previously thought. And by doing calculations that assess decades of time, only now possible with fast, current computers, and by including in our cal­culations the oceans and the entire atmosphere— also only now possible—we have found that the smoke from even a regional war would be heat­ed and lofted by the sun and remain suspended in the upper atmosphere for years, continuing to block sunlight and to cool the earth. India and Pakistan, which together have more than 100 nuclear weapons,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> may be the most worrisome adversaries capable of a regional nu­clear conflict today. But other countries besides the U.S. and Russia (which have thousands) are well endowed: China, France and the U.K. have hundreds of nuclear warheads; Israel has more than 80, North Korea has about 10 and Iran may well be trying to make its own. In 2004 this situation prompted one of us (Toon) and later Rich Turco of the University of California, Los Angeles, both veterans of the 1980s investiga­tions, to begin evaluating what the global envi­ronmental effects of a regional nuclear war would be and to take as our test case an engage­ment between India and Pakistan. The latest estimates by David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security and by Robert S. Norris of the Natural Resourc­es Defense Council are that India has 50 to 60 assembled weapons (with enough plutonium for 100) and that Pakistan has 60 weapons. </span>Both countries continue to increase their arsenals<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In­dian and Pakistani nuclear weapons tests indi­cate that the yield of the warheads would be sim­ilar to the 15-kiloton explosive yield (equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT) of the bomb the U.S. used on Hiroshima. Toon and Turco, along with Charles Bardeen, now at the National Center for Atmospheric Re­search, modeled what would happen if 50 Hiro­shima-size bombs were dropped across the high­est population-density targets in Pakistan and if 50 similar bombs were also dropped across In­dia. Some people maintain that nuclear weapons would be used in only a measured way. But in the wake of chaos, fear and broken communications that would occur once a nuclear war began, </span>we doubt leaders would limit attacks in any rational manner. This likelihood is particularly true for Pakistan, which is small and could be quickly overrun in a conventional conflict. Peter R. La­ voy of the Naval Postgraduate School, for exam­ple, has analyzed the ways in which a conflict be­tween India and Pakistan might occur and ar­gues that Pakistan could face a decision to use all its nuclear arsenal quickly before India swamps its military bases with traditional forces. Obviously, we hope the number of nuclear targets in any future war will be zero, but policy makers and voters should know what is possible. Toon and Turco found that more than 20 million people in the two countries could die from the blasts, fires and radioactivity—a horrible slaugh­ter. But the investigators were shocked to discov­er that a tremendous amount of smoke would be generated<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 4pt;">given the megacities in the two coun­tries, assuming each fire would burn the same area that actually did burn in Hiroshima and as­suming an amount of burnable material per per­son based on various studies. They calculated that the 50 bombs exploded in Pakistan would produce three teragrams of smoke, and the 50 bombs hitting India would generate four (one teragram equals a million metric tons). Satellite observations of actual forest fires have shown that smoke can be lofted up through the troposphere (the bottom layer of the atmosphere) and sometimes then into the lower stratosphere (the layer just above, extending to about 30 miles). Toon and Turco also did some “back of the en­velope” calculations of the possible climate im­pact of the smoke should it enter the stratosphere. The large magnitude of such effects made them realize they needed help from a climate modeler. It turned out that one of us (Robock) was already working with Luke Oman, now at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, who was finishing his Ph.D. at Rutgers University on the climatic effects of volcanic eruptions, and with Georgiy L. Stenchikov, also at Rutgers and an author of the first Russian work on nuclear winter. They developed a climate model that could be used fairly easily for the nuclear blast calculations. Robock and his colleagues, being conserva­tive, put five teragrams of smoke into their mod­eled upper troposphere over India and Pakistan on an imaginary May 15. The model calculated how winds would blow the smoke around the world and how the smoke particles would settle out from the atmosphere. The smoke covered all the continents within two weeks. The black, sooty smoke absorbed sunlight, warmed and rose into the stratosphere. Rain never falls there, so the air is never cleansed by precipitation; par­ticles very slowly settle out by falling, with air resisting them. Soot particles are small, with an average diameter of only 0.1 micron (μm), and so drift down very slowly. They also rise during the daytime as they are heated by the sun, re­peatedly delaying their elimination. The calcu­lations showed that the smoke would reach far higher into the upper stratosphere than the sul­fate particles that are produced by episodic vol­canic eruptions. Sulfate particles are transparent and absorb much less sunlight than soot and are also bigger, typically 0.5 μm. The volcanic par­ticles remain airborne for about two years, but smoke from nuclear fires would last a decade. Killing Frosts in Summer</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">T</span>he climatic response to the smoke was surpris­ing. Sunlight was immediately reduced, cooling the planet to temperatures lower than any expe­rienced for the past 1,000 years.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The global aver­age cooling, of about 1.25 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit), lasted for several years, and even after 10 years the temperature was still 0.5 degree C colder than normal. The models also showed a 10 percent reduction in precipitation worldwide. Precipitation, river flow and soil moisture all decreased because blocking sun­light reduces evaporation and weakens the hydrologic cycle. Drought was largely concen­trated in the lower latitudes, however, because global cooling would retard the Hadley air cir­culation pattern in the tropics, which produces a large fraction of global precipitation. In criti­cal areas such as the Asian monsoon regions, rainfall dropped by as much as 40 percent. </span>The cooling might not seem like much, but even a small dip can cause severe consequences. Cooling and diminished sunlight would, for ex­ample, shorten growing seasons in the midlati­tudes. More insight into the effects of cooling came from analyses of the aftermaths of massive volcanic eruptions. Every once in a while such eruptions produce temporary cooling for a year or two. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The largest of the past 500 years, the 1815 Tambora eruption in Indonesia, blotted the sun and produced global cooling of about 0.5 de­gree C for a year; 1816 became known as “The Year without a Summer” or “Eighteen Hundred and Froze to Death.” In New England, although the average summer temperature was lowered only a few degrees, crop-killing frosts occurred in every month. After the first frost, farmers re­planted crops, only to see them killed by the next frost. The price of grain skyrocketed, the price of livestock plummeted as farmers sold the animals they could not feed, and a mass migration began from New England to the Midwest, as people fol­lowed reports of fertile land there. In Europe the weather was so cold and gloomy that the stock market collapsed, </span>widespread famines occurred and 18-year-old Mary Shelley was inspired to write</em> Frankenstein. <em>Certain strains of crops, such as winter wheat, can withstand lower temperatures, but a lack of sunlight inhibits their ability to grow. In our scenario, daylight would filter through the high smoky haze, but on the ground every day would seem to be fully overcast. Agronomists and farmers could not develop the necessary seeds or adjust agricultural practices for the rad­ically different conditions unless they knew ahead of time what to expect. In addition to the cooling, drying and dark­ness, extensive ozone depletion would result as the smoke heated the stratosphere<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; reactions that create and destroy ozone are temperature-depen­dent. Michael J. Mills of the University of Colo­rado at Boulder ran a completely separate climate model from Robock’s but found similar results for smoke lofting and stratospheric temperature changes. He concluded that although surface temperatures would cool by a small amount, the stratosphere would be heated by more than 50 degrees C, because the black smoke particles ab­sorb sunlight. This heating, in turn, would mod­ify winds in the stratosphere, which would carry ozone-destroying nitrogen oxides into its upper reaches. Together the high temperatures and ni­trogen oxides would reduce ozone to the same dangerous levels we now experience below the ozone hole above Antarctica every spring. </span>Ultra­violet radiation on the ground would increase significantly because of the diminished ozone. Less sunlight and precipitation, cold spells, shorter growing seasons and more ultraviolet ra­diation would all reduce or eliminate agricultur­al production<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Notably, cooling and ozone loss would be most profound in middle and high lat­itudes in both hemispheres, whereas precipita­tion declines would be greatest in the tropics. The specific damage inflicted by each of these environmental changes would depend on partic­ular crops, soils, agricultural practices and re­gional weather patterns, and no researchers have completed detailed analyses of such agricultural responses. Even in normal times, however, </span>feed­ing the growing human population depends on transferring food across the globe to make up for regional farming deficiencies caused by drought and seasonal weather changes. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The total amount of grain stored on the planet today would feed the earth’s population for only about two months [see “Could Food Shortages Bring Down Civiliza­tion?” by Lester R. Brown; Scientific Ameri­can, May]. Most cities and countries have stock­piled food supplies for just a very short period, and food shortages (as well as rising prices) have increased in recent years</span>. A nuclear war could trigger declines in yield nearly everywhere at once, and a worldwide panic could bring the glob­al agricultural trading system to a halt, with se­vere shortages in many places. Around one billion people worldwide who now live on marginal food supplies would be directly threatened with star­vation by a nuclear war between India and Paki­stan or between other regional nuclear powers. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Independent Evidence Needed Typically scientists test models and theories by doing experiments, but we obviously cannot experiment in this case. Thus, we look for ana­logues that can verify our models. Burned cities. Unfortunately, firestorms cre­ated by intense releases of energy have pumped vast quantities of smoke into the upper atmo­sphere. San Francisco burned as a result of the 1906 earthquake, and whole cities were incin­erated during World War II, including Dresden, Hamburg, Tokyo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These events confirm that smoke from intense urban fires rises into the upper atmosphere. The seasonal cycle. In actual winter the cli­mate is cooler because the days are shorter and sunlight is less intense; the simple change of sea­sons helps us quantify the effects of less solar ra­diation. Our climate models re-create the sea­sonal cycle well, confirming that they properly reflect changes in sunlight. Eruptions. Explosive volcanic eruptions, such as those of Tambora in 1815, Krakatau in 1883 and Pinatubo in 1991 provide several lessons. The resulting sulfate aerosol clouds that formed in the stratosphere were transported around the world by winds. The surface temperature plum­meted after each eruption in proportion to the thickness of the particulate cloud. After the Pi­natubo eruption, the global average surface tem­perature dropped by about 0.25 degree C. Glob­al precipitation, river flow and soil moisture all decreased. Our models reproduce these effects. Forest fires. Smoke from large forest fires sometimes is injected into the troposphere and lower stratosphere and is transported great dis­tances, producing cooling. Our models perform well against these effects, too. Extinction of the dinosaurs</span><strong>.</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">An asteroid smashed into Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula 65 million years ago. </span>The resulting dust cloud, mixed with smoke from fires, blocked the Sun, killing the dinosaurs. Massive volcanism in India at the same time may have exacerbated the ef­fects. The events teach us that large amounts of aerosols in the earth’s atmosphere can change cli­mate drastically enough to kill robust species.</em><br />

Syria - which backs the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah – is believed to be developing chemical weapons using the lethal nerve agents sarin and VX, which shut down the nervous system in under a minute if inhaled or absorbed through the skin. In December 2008, a company connected to the Syrian WMD programme attempted to buy a shipment of glass-lined reactors, heat exchangers and pumps used in weapons manufacturing from two Indian firms, prompting an intervention by the US. Condoleezza Rice, then US Secretary of State, sent a strongly-worded cable classified “secret” to the US embassy in New Delhi instructing diplomats to order the Indian government to block the sale. Threatening sanctions against the firms if they did not comply, Miss Rice urged embassy officials to remind the Indian government of its obligation “to never, under any circumstances, assist anyone in the development of chemical weapons”. The US has made similar interventions to block the sale of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons materials to North Korea. In March 2008,</span> <span style="color: black;">US diplomats in Beijing urged the government to investigate a Chinese company which had agreed to sell a deadly chemical to North Korea. The US has also been advised to make flattering overtures to North Korea to prevent the regime from feeling the need to flex its muscles by advancing its nuclear capabilities</span></em><br />

<em>The Threat Twenty-first century threats to the United States, its de­ployed forces, and its friends and allies differ fundamental­ly from those of the Cold War. An unprecedented number of international actors have now acquired – or are seeking to acquire – missiles. These include not only states, but also non-state groups interested in obtaining missiles with nucle­ar or other payloads. The spectrum encompasses the missile arsenals already in the hands of Russia and China, as well as the emerging arsenals of a number of hostile states<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The character of this threat has also changed. Unlike the Soviet Union, these newer missile possessors do not attempt to match U.S. systems, either in quality or in quantity. In­stead, their missiles are designed to inflict major devasta­tion without necessarily possessing the accuracy associated with the U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals of the Cold War.1 The warning time that the United States might have be­fore the deployment of such capabilities by a hostile state, or even a terrorist actor, is eroding as a result of several fac­tors, including the continued proliferation and widespread availability of technologies to build missiles and the result­ing possibility that an entire system might be purchased out­right.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Would-be possessors do not have to engage in the pro­tracted process of designing and building a missile. They could purchase and assemble components, reverse-engineer a missile after having purchased a prototype, or immediately acquire a number of assembled missiles. Even missiles that are primitive by U.S. standards might suffice for a rogue state or terrorist organization seeking to inflict extensive damage upon the United States. As the Rumsfeld Commission point­ed out in its 1998 report: Rogue States</span></em>North Korea <em>In the years since the surprise launch of its three-stage</em> Tae­po Dong <em>1 missile over Japan in August 1998, North Korea has made substantial advances in its ballistic missile capabilities and now possesses the largest ballistic missile force in the developing world, according to Jane’s Information Group.3 Pyongyang has engaged in extensive efforts to conceal the size and scope of its ballistic missile programs, though es­timates suggest that it may have deployed as many as 1000 ballistic missiles, including some 600-800</em> Scud<em>-type short-range rockets, between 150 and 200 medium-range</em> No Dong <em>missiles, and 50 other longer-range missiles.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">4 In 2003, North Korea lifted its self-imposed 1999 mora­torium on long-range missile testing.5 In July 2006, the Kim Jong-il regime fired a </span></em>Taepo Dong <em>2 long-range missile as part of a series of missile tests.6 While the 2006 test failed 40 seconds after launch, it signified a considerable advance in the development of North Korea’s extended-range missile capability. The Congressional Research Service has indicat­ed that the</em> Taepo Dong <em>2’s design would allow it to deliver a 1,500-kilogram warhead to targets as far as 8,000 kilometers away.7 According to 2005 testimony by Vice Admiral Low­ell Jacoby, USN (Ret.), former director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Pyongyang’s</em> Taepo Dong <em>2 mis­sile “could deliver a nuclear warhead to parts of the United States in a two-stage variant and target all of North Ameri­ca with a three-stage variant.”8He also stated that North Ko­rea had achieved the ability to arm a missile with a nuclear device.North Korea has had a declared nuclear capability since 2005.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">10 In 2008, North Korean officials admitted that 37 ki­lograms of plutonium had been produced at the Yongbyon reactor, enough for as many as nine nuclear weapons.11 American assessments suggest that the actual amount of plutonium produced is likely much higher and that as much as 60 kilograms could have been extracted.12 </span>Based upon this judgment, North Korea may have as many as 15 nucle­ar weapons, though most estimates in the U.S. intelligence community place the number at around ten<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.13 The extent of North Korea’s uranium enrichment program is not well known, but Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer (A.Q.) Khan stated that he had provided uranium enrichment equipment to Pyongyang.14 In 2002, DPRK First Vice For­eign Minister Kang Sok-ju admitted that North Korea was pursuing a uranium-enrichment program, the clear impli­cation being that the program was meant for weapons pro­duction.15 An operational North Korean uranium program could have the capability to add as many as six additional nuclear weapons a year to Pyongyang’s arsenal.16 A resolu­tion to the North Korean nuclear weapons dilemma has yet to be achieved, despite the various efforts to use the six-par­ty talks and other efforts for this purpose.17 </span></em>Iran <em>With the benefit of assistance from abroad, including North Korea and Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran has moved forward with its ballistic missile program. Iran has had a demonstrated tactical ballistic missile capability since the 1980s, but in June 2003 it marked a major milestone when it deployed its 1,300-kilometer-range Shahab-3, capable of targeting Israel and Turkey, as well as U.S. forces in the Per­sian Gulf.18 Since then, Iran has begun “mass production” of This work has yielded impor­tant dividends: in September 2007, Iran publicly unveiled a “new” medium-range ballistic missile, the</em> Ghadr-<em>1, at a mil­itary parade in Tehran.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This missile, which Iran claims has a range of 1,800 kilometers, appears to be an extended-range variant of the </span></em>Shahab-<em>3.21 Subsequently, in November 2007, Iran carried out a test of its</em> Ashoura <em>missile, a 2,000-kilo­meter-range solid fuel variant of the</em> Shahab<em>.22 These steps are part of what U.S. officials believe is a growing emphasis in Tehran on the development of an inter­continental ballistic missile capability.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As John Rood, then-acting assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation, told Congress in May 2007, “The In­lah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. </span>The transfer of the</em> Shahab <em>3 into the</em> Pasdaran<em>, in lieu of the</em> Artesh<em>, suggests that Ira­nian missile technologies could find their way into terrorist hands as part of Tehran’s ongoing sponsorship of terrorist activities. Intelligence Community assesses that Iran would be able to develop an ICBM capable of reaching the United States and all regions of Europe before 2015 if it chose to do so.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And, I would point out that Iran has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea in the past and note the possibility that it could do so again in the future, potentially acquiring mis­siles with even longer ranges.”23 </span>As a result of these advanc­es, it is likely that Iran could field an intercontinental ballis­tic missile by the middle of the next decade.24 Iran may have conducted tests to determine whether its ballistic missiles, notably the</em> Shahab-<em>3 or the</em> Scud<em>, could be detonated by re­mote control while still in flight.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The significance of such a capability lies in its potential to launch an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack, discussed later in this section. </span>This effort is closely linked to Iran’s growing interest in space. In October 2005, Iran became the first space nation in the Muslim world when it launched a surveillance satellite on a Russian rocket from Russia’s missile base at Plesetsk.25 Since then, Iran has made great strides toward development of an indigenous space launch capability.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In February 2007, it successfully carried out an initial test of a “space rocket” built in Iran.26 A year later unveiled its first space center, with Tehran claiming that it had now “joined the world’s top 11 countries possessing space technology to build satel­lites and launch rockets into space.”27 </span>These advances ampli­fy and expand Iran’s ballistic missile program, since a space-launch vehicle (SLV) is similar in technology and function to the booster on an intercontinental ballistic missile. The threat posed by Iran’s ballistic missile program is closely linked to Tehran’s nuclear effort. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Since it was pub­licly exposed by an Iranian opposition group in August 2002, Since December 2007 Iran has built a stockpile of low-enriched uranium hexafloride. According to the IAEA, Iran’s stockpile had reached more than 1000 pounds by August 31, 2008, with monthly production rates of more than 100 pounds. In 2009 this could give Iran at least 1,500 pounds that could be recirculated through its centrifuges to pro­duce the 35 pounds of weapon-grade uranium sufficient for one bomb.31 In April 2008, Iranian president Mahmoud Ah­madinejad disclosed that his government had begun to in­stall another 6,000 centrifuges at the Natanz facility.32 Ira­nian leaders have taken this to be a critical milestone. “The nuclear issue (of Iran) is the most important political devel­opment in contemporary history,” Ahmadinejad announced to supporters at that time. “Iran’s victory in this biggest po­litical battle will lead to new international developments.”33 </span>Thus all indicators point toward the development of an Ira­nian nuclear capability with varying estimates not about</em> whether <em>Iran is doing so, but instead</em> when <em>it will have such weapons. There have also been reports that Iran as well as North Korea, and even terrorist groups, could have benefited from information from the notorious A.Q. Khan proliferation network. In 2006 drawings were discovered on computers owned by Swiss businessmen that included how to build a warhead that could be fitted on an Iranian ballistic missile. Whether these drawings were earlier passed on to Iran is not certain. The nuclear-related documents allegedly included hundreds of pages of specifications for a compact nuclear device that could have been designed for Iran.34<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Other states already possess or are developing weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. They include: </span><strong>Pakistan•</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which has had a nuclear capability at least since 1998 and </span>has extensive ballistic and cruise missile pro­grams<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Pakistan<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> possessed as many as 100 nuclear war­heads and </span>continues to upgrade its missile forces<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The country has made major advances in missile technology, especially considering that it presently lacks the domestic science and technology base for developing such weap­ons, which suggests that </span>it has been very successful in acquiring technologies from abroad.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> At the moment, </span>Pak­istan’s <span style="font-size: 8pt;">longest-range ballistic missile is the </span></em>Hatf-<em>6, which has a range of 2,000 kilometers. At that range, the</em> Hatf<em>-6 is nearing the 2,500 kilometer thresholdwhich<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the Rums­feld Commission </span>indicated would mark the existence of the technical base necessary for the development of long-range missile systems.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> While Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal and ballistic missiles are • ostensibly intended to deter Indian aggression, Pakistan’s domestic political situation is so turbulent that </span>there is no guarantee that these weapons will be used strictly for that purpose<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, under a radicalized regime </span>such missiles could be used against U.S. forces<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and mili­tary installations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Despite Paki­stan’s cooperation in the War on Terror, serious questions exist as to whether elements in the Pakistani security services, in particular the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), are actively working against U.S. inter­ests by supporting Afghan and Pakistani Taliban fighters in the Pakistani tribal areas. The fact that such powerful elements could be operating outside official Pakistani policy channels is frightening, even though ISI does not directly supervise the nuclear arsenal. Pakistan’s nuclear forces are overseen by the National Command Author­ 34 ity (NCA), and underwent a thorough security upgrade in 2003. Nevertheless, concerns remain about the com­mand and control of Pakistan’s nuclear forces. Particu­larly troubling is the level of sympathy for al-Qaeda and the Taliban within the junior and mid-level cadres of the Pakistani military as a result of fighting side-by-side with Islamists against Indian forces in Jammu and Kashmir. It is precisely these officers who are most likely to be pro­moted to sensitive positions in the years ahead. </span><strong>Syria•</strong> , which maintains biological and chemical weapons capabilities and possesses a large inventory of surface-to-surface ballistic missile systems, could deliver con­ventional and unconventional warheads to neighboring countries in the Middle East.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">35 </span>Syria has also shown more than a passing interest in acquiring a nuclear weapons capability, as evidenced by the construction the Al-Kibar reactor site, which was subsequently destroyed by an Is­raeli Air Force strike in September 2007.The Central In­telligence Agency (CIA) has estimated that Damascus possesses hundreds of free-rocket-over-ground (FROG) missiles,</em> Scud <em>missiles, and SS-21 short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs).36 Syria also maintains the indigenous capability to manufacture liquid-fuel</em> Scud<em>s.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">37 In Septem­ber 2003 testimony before the House of Representatives Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, then-Under Secretary of State John Bolton outlined </span>that Syria “is fully committed to expanding and improving its CW [chemical weapons] program” and “is continuing to de­velop an offensive biological weapons capability.”38 Syr­ia’s mobile missile force is capable of targeting much of Israel, as well as parts of Iraq, Jordan, and Turkey, and it has “developed a longer-range missile – the</em> Scud<em>-D – with assistance from North Korea” while simultane­ously pursuing “both solid- and liquid-propellant mis­sile programs.”<span style="font-size: 8pt;">39 </span><strong>Egypt</strong><strong>•</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>which is engaged in a clandestine effort to acquire WMD and ballistic missile technologies. Egypt has been a primary destination for North Korea’s ballistic missile exports and has received shipments of</em> Scud <em>B and C mis­ 35<span style="color: black;">siles, as well as </span></em>No Dong <em>missiles<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">.40 </span><span style="color: black;">Inspections by the IAEA have uncovered plutonium traces at Egyptian nu­clear facilities, increasing international concern about clandestine nuclear development efforts on the part of the Mubarak regime.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">41 </span><span style="color: black;">The IAEA has also criticized Cairo for failing to declare certain nuclear materials and sites, one of which was a facility for separating plutonium that could be used in an atomic weapon</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">.42 </span><strong><span style="color: black;">Saudi Arabia• </span></strong><span style="color: black;">, which will undoubtedly find a nuclear weapons program a more attractive option if Iran achieves nuclear status and may already be pursuing a nuclear hedging strategy. Under an agreement signed during the October 2003 visit to Islamabad by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, Riyadh reportedly gained access to Pakistani nuclear technologies in exchange for stepped-up energy cooperation and improved strategic relations with Pak­istan.43 While Saudi Arabia has denied that it is devel­oping a nuclear weapons capability, it has been granted “small quantities protocol” status from the IAEA, which removes strict oversight of its nuclear reactor and could potentially facilitate the clandestine pursuit of nuclear weapons.44 Riyadh, meanwhile, was reported to be seek­ing modern replacements from China for its aging arse­nal of CSS-2 missiles originally purchased from China more than a generation ago.4</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">5 </span><strong><span style="color: black;">Strategic Competitors</span></strong></em><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">People’s Republic of China</span><em><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> According to the Defense Department, </span><span style="color: black;">“China has the most active ballistic missile program in the world. It is develop­ing and testing offensive missiles, forming additional missile units, qualitatively upgrading certain missile systems, and developing methods to counter ballistic missile defenses.”</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">46 PRC missile modernization efforts build upon current capa­bilities that encompass ballistic missiles able to target the United States as well as Japan and other regional U.S. allies. For example, China has over 46 </span></em>Dong-feng <em>4,</em> Dong-feng <em>5, and</em> Dong-feng <em>31 intercontinental ballistic missiles, approx­imately 35 intermediate-range (</em>Dong-feng <em>3, and</em> Dong-feng <em>21) missiles, and hundreds of short-range rockets currently deployed.47 Between 990 and 1,070 SRBMs are deployed op­posite Taiwan, and the People’s Liberation Army is increasing this force by more than 100 missiles each year.48 At the same time, China is in the midst of a massive, multi-year strategic-military modernization program, encompassing air power, naval, and land force capabilities, air defense, and electron­ic-, information- and space-warfare technologies.49 As part of this effort, <span style="color: black;">China is upgrading its existing bal­listic missile arsenal.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> This includes the deployment of its </span></em>Dong-feng <em>31 and</em> Dong-feng <em>31A ICBMs with multiple inde­pendently targetable re-entry vehicle (MIRV) warhead tech­nology designed to defeat primitive anti-missile systems, priority solid-fuel propellant research intended to provide Beijing with immediate “launch on command” capabili­ties, and the transformation of its strategic offensive forc­es from large, stationary missiles to more versatile road- and rail-mobile variants. Notably, a successful flight test of China’s new submarine-launched version of the</em> Dong-feng <em>31, the</em> Julang <em>2, was conducted in June 2005.50 The</em> Julang <em>2 has a range of up to 9,600 kilometers and, according to the U.S. Air Force’s National Air Intelligence Center, “will, for the first time, allow Chinese [missile submarines] to target portions of the United States from operating areas located near the Chinese coast.”51 <span style="color: black;">These capabilities are even more troubling in light of remarks made by Chinese Major Gener­al Zhu Chenghu, who declared that nuclear weapons would have to be used if the United States intervened militarily in a conflict over Taiwan.52 In addition, China has also begun to undermine Ameri­can space dominance and is developing asymmetrical op­tions to exploit perceived U.S. vulnerabilities in space</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="color: black;">These include a variety of space-denial capabilities, as well as space assets and launch systems that will significantly augment Beijing’s space operations. For example, in the wake of its successful October 2003 launch of the </span></em>Shenzhou <em>V space­craft, China is developing advanced military capabilities as part of an exo-atmospheric “deterrent” force even while Bei­jing warns against any U.S. weaponization of space. In Jan­uary 2007, China successfully destroyed a Chinese weather satellite using a direct-ascent, anti-satellite weapon, indi­cating its ability to attack satellites operating in low-earth orbit. <span style="color: black; font-size: 3pt;">Beyond the hit-to-kill technology demonstrated in this operation, the PRC is also developing technologies to “jam, blind, or otherwise disable satellites.”</span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">53 </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 3pt;">China has also developed a range of “nano-satellite” technologies for spacewarfare, apparently for the purpose of crippling American space assets.54 Other Chinese advances in space include the </span></em>Ziyuan <em>1 and</em> Ziyuan <em>2 remote-sensing satellites and the develop­ment, through a joint venture between China’s Tsinghua University and the United Kingdom’s University of Surrey, of a constellation of seven mini-satellites (weighing between 101 and 500 kilograms) with 50-meter-resolution remote-sensing payloads.55 Furthermore, there is growing evidence that China is increasingly interested in developing an EMP capability, both as a theater weapon for use in a potential Taiwan conflict and as a strategic asset to counter the Unit­ed States.56 Beijing’s space achievements also include the</em> Shenzhou <em>VII, the third Chinese manned spaceflight, together with China’s first spacewalk in September 2008.57 In addition, China is working on in-orbit rendezvous and docking pro­cedures (which also have direct applications for ASAT and space-denial missions), and exploring the prospects for a manned space station. The</em> Shenzhou <em>VII mission and space­walk will provide China with docking techniques required for the construction of a space station that will reportedly be accomplished by joining two</em> Shenzhou <em>vehicles togeth­er. Moreover, the PRC has an elaborate lunar exploration program that includes an unmanned moon lander, a sam­ple return mission, and an eventual human mission to the moon. For these missions, Beijing is developing a new</em> Long March <em>V booster. The timetables for the Chinese unmanned moon landing, a sample return mission, and a manned lunar mission are believed to be 2012, 2015, and 2017, respectively. China’s manned moon mission is approximately three years ahead of the U.S. target date for returning to the moon. Another extremely troubling development is the PRC’s increasing efforts in the realm of cyber warfare, particular­ly as a means to attack U.S. infrastructure, computers, and associated networks. Such asymmetrical efforts underscore Beijing’s understanding of the increasing role played in U.S. military operations by command, control, communication, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems. The objective of the PRC is to establish elec­tronic dominance early in any conflict scenario in order to disrupt and downgrade the utility of such assets, while si­multaneously taking steps to ensure that an adversary can­not deny China access to its own information systems.58 The inescapable conclusion is that Chinese strategic force mod­ernization, space denial and anti-access capabilities, and cyber warfare activities provide clear evidence of a strategy aimed at degrading the ability of the United States to proj­ect power and support its allies in the region and thus un­dermining the credibility of the U.S. extended deterrent. To address these challenges, the United States must ensure that it remains the preeminent space power.</em> Russian Federation <em>With the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Repub­lics (USSR), the Russian Federation inherited the sprawling Soviet ballistic missile apparatus, which includes medium- and long-range solid- and liquid-fueled missiles. Presently, Moscow retains a formidable offensive strategic arsenal – the cornerstone of which is the SS-18</em> Satan <em>ICBM, slated to remain in combat service for the next ten or fifteen years.59 However, Russia’s principal ballistic missile of the future is the</em> Topol <em>ICBM, which has recently been deployed.60 The Russian military has created a highly maneuverable variant of this missile, the</em> Topol <em>M, which has MIRV warhead tech­nology. Beyond the</em> Topol <em>M, Russia appears to be continu­ing with the development of the RS-24, which is capable of being equipped with as many as 10 warheads.61 The RS-24 has been successfully tested on several occasions.62 The Rus­sian navy has also continued flight tests of its</em> Bulava <em>sea-launched strategic missile system, which has a range of at least 8,000 kilometers and can carry ten or more MIRV war­heads, with varying degrees of success.63 Over the past several years, Russia has substantially al­tered its strategic posture. In late 2003, Russia unveiled a new military doctrine lowering the bar on the use of nu­clear force to protect Russian interests in its “near abroad” of Central Asia and the Caucasus.64 Then-President Vladi­mir Putin announced the end of Russian force reductions and launched massive exercises of the country’s strategic forces.65 Russia has also announced that it will discontin­ue missile-launch notifications to other signatories of the Hague Code of Conduct on missile proliferation. Moscow and Beijing have held joint military exercises on one anoth­er’s territory and continue to strengthen military ties with other countries in the region, by way of the Shanghai Coop­eration Organization.66 These steps are seen by Moscow as a hedge against Western encroachment into countries on its periphery and a means to blunt the emerging American missile defense system. These trends are likely to continue under the Medvedev administration, as power in Russia ap­pears to have shifted to the prime minister’s office, now oc­cupied by Putin.</em> The Dangers <em>This itemized list of advances in ballistic missile capabil­ities in recent years, if viewed individually, might still un­derstate the dangers to the United States and its allies. The proliferation of ballistic missile capabilities by potential enemies, both states and non-state actors, must be viewed more broadly. It carries with it the implication that America and its allies may face coalitions of missile powers as addi­tional states acquire such capabilities. For example, Russia or China could decide to back North Korea in a confronta­tion with South Korea, Japan, and the United States. Like­wise, U.S. allies may drop out in the face of such a combined threat stemming from enemy coalitions whose members are armed with ballistic missiles, thus possibly confronting the United States with the larger missile threat presented by such a combination of missile possessors. Furthermore, in an emerging multi-polar world where ballistic missile and nuclear proliferation create an increasingly complex coali­tion dynamic, the unpredictability factor increases dramat­ically and must be addressed. The analogy of two scorpions in a bottle that characterized the U.S.-Soviet confrontation in the Cold War is giving way to multiple scorpions in a bot­tle, with all the complexity, unpredictability, and danger that this possibility implies. <strong><span style="color: black;">Asymmetric Threats</span></strong><span style="color: black;">Asymmetric threats by rogue states and strategic compet­itors pose growing and compounding dangers to the Unit­ed States and its allies. </span></em>WMD Terrorism <em>An increasing number of terrorist groups are making con­certed efforts to acquire WMD.67<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">As long ago as 1994, ists affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Jihad Organization made a serious bid to buy an atomic bomb or fissile material from one of Russia’s crumbling “nuclear cities.”68 More recently, the 9/11 Commission explicitly warned that </span><span style="color: black;">“Al-Qaeda remains extremely interested in conducting chemical, biological, ra­diological, or nuclear attacks.”</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 4pt;">69 After the March 2003 arrest of 9/11 mastermind Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, investiga­tions revealed that terrorists had obtained materials for pro­ducing botulinum and salmonella toxins and cyanide.70 Lebanon’s Hezbollah has also acquired menacing capa­bilities that were put on display during the 34-day war be­tween the Shiite militia and the Israeli Defense Forces in 2006 days of the war, when Hezbollah should have been weakened by Israel’s sustained military operations, mi­litiamen launched more rockets into Israel than at any oth­er. During the course of the conflict, Hezbollah man­aged to launch over 4,000 of its estimated 13,000 rockets into northern Israel.71 Particularly troubling is the fact that in the final time during the conflict, striking as deep into Israeli ter­ritory as Haifa. Since the 2006 war, Hezbollah has rearmed both quan­titatively and qualitatively, and Hezbollah Secretary Gen­eral Hassan Nasrallah has claimed that the group’s arsenal now includes rockets that can target anywhere in Israel. A 2007 United Nations report concludes that Hezbollah may now have as many as 10,000 long-range rockets and 20,000 short-range rockets.72 United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has suggested that Hezbollah is now capable of striking Israel’s main metropolis, Tel Aviv, and that the mi­litia has tripled its stockpile of C-802 land-to-sea missiles. The addition of longer-range missiles significantly challeng­es efforts to counter Hezbollah’s capabilities. As part of the ceasefire agreement that ended the hostilities in 2006, the Lebanese army and the United Nations Interim Force in Leb­ anon (UNIFIL) have assumed much greater responsibilities in disrupting Hezbollah activities south of the Litani River. In response, Hezbollah has simply moved many of its long-range missile launchers north of the Litani into areas of the Bekaa Valley where neither the Lebanese army nor UNIFIL patrol. Even in southern Lebanon, where the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL are ostensibly providing security, Hezbollah has been successful in rearming with anti-tank missiles and </span></em>Katyusha <em>rockets hidden in villages and camouflaged bun­kers, according to the Israel Defense Force (IDF).<span style="color: black;">73 </span></em><span style="color: black;">The Ship-borne Scud Threat </span><em><span style="color: black;">Among the threats outlined in the 1998 Rumsfeld Commis­sion Report is the one posed by ballistic missiles launched from vessels such as freighters, tankers, or container ships close to the American coastline. Such a danger has only in­creased in the past decade. In August 2004, then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized that “One of the nations in the Middle East had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> They had taken a short-range, probably </span></em>Scud <em>missile, put it on a transporter-erector launcher, lowered it in, tak­en the vessel out into the water, peeled back the top, erect­ed it, fired it, lowered it, covered it up. And the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50, 60, 100 other ships operating in the im­mediate area.”74 U.S. officials have suggested that Rumsfeld was referring to Iran, which tested a ship-launched missile in the late 1990s.75 This ship-borne ballistic capability could be used to launch EMP attacks from locations off the U.S. coastline with devastating effects (more below).</em> Asymmetric Proliferation <em>In 2002, writing in the</em> Financial Times<em>, Defense Science Board chairman William Schneider described the mechan­ics by which North Korea has managed to acquire nuclear capabilities as the quintessential “twenty-first century tem­plate for proliferation.” <span style="color: black;">The rapid, clandestine acquisition of critical mass in Pyongyang’s nuclear program, according to Schneider, reflects the existence of a vibrant, and self-sus­taining, proliferation architecture in today’s internation­al system.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">76 </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 4pt;">Schneider was referring to what has now been deemed “second-tier proliferation,” whereby “states in the developing world with varying technical capabilities trade among themselves to bolster one another’s nuclear and stra­tegic weapons efforts.”77 North Korea is a prime example of this trend. The devel­opment of the Al-Kibar reactor in Syria, destroyed by an Is­raeli airstrike in September 2007, is believed to have been greatly aided by North Korea. In fact, North Korea went so far as to send personnel to help construct the reactor. Be­yond its nuclear proliferation efforts, the Kim Jong-Il regime has become a principal supplier of ballistic missile compo­nents and associated technologies to the Middle East. The Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) estimates that North Korea has exported more than 1,000 </span></em>Scud <em>missiles along with mis­sile-related parts to the Middle East region. Missile exports, which net North Korea around $1.5 billion a year, constitute one of its largest sources of revenue. North Korea has since expanded this trade, and is now believed to be offering tech­nologies associated with its advanced</em> Taepo Dong <em>2 ICBM to a number of regional client states, including Syria and Iran.78 Moreover, North Korea has sold missiles to Pakistan in exchange for nuclear technologies,a trade facilitated in large part by A.Q. Khan’s proliferation network (see below for more on A.Q. Khan).79 China has also used the transfer of nuclear and ballistic missile technologies as a tool of global influence and a mon­ey-making enterprise. Extensive Chinese assistance has been instrumental to North Korea’s development of the</em> Taepo Dong <em>2, and it has played a central role in Pakistan’s development of nuclear capabilities. This cooperation has led to a trilater­al “proliferation axis” that has given Pakistan access to North Korean ballistic missiles and allowed Pakistani nuclear know-how to flow to North Korea.80 Chinese defense companies have also been complicit in aiding Iran’s progress on ballistic missile technology. The United States responded by impos­ing penalties on these companies for exporting to Iran highperformance metals and other components that can be used to extend the range of Tehran’s missile arsenal.81 Furthermore, such activities are not confined to state ac­tors. In late 2003, the discovery of the clandestine nucle­ar cartel headed by Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan exposed an alarming web of WMD and ballistic missile prolifera­tion. Khan confessed that he had provided Libya, Iran, and North Korea with technical assistance and components for manufacturing high-speed centrifuges.82 The government of Pakistan also revealed that he “gave some centrifuges to Iran,” and U.S. intelligence officials believe that North Ko­rea purchased high-speed centrifuges from the Khan net­work.83 Perhaps most troubling was the discovery of a nu­clear weapon design in 2008 on the computer hard drives of several members of Khan’s network.84 The bomb design is a miniaturized implosion device cable of fitting on North Korea’s</em> No Dong <em>missiles, as well as Iran’s</em> Shahab <em>and Pak­istan’s</em> Hatf<em>-5 (</em>Ghauri<em>) missiles. Depending on how much the design allows for warhead size reduction, these coun­tries may be able to make significant advances in their MIRV warhead programs.</em> The EMP Threat <em>According to the 2004 report of the EMP Commission,85 the United States faces a threat from EMP that could have cata­strophic consequences based on even a single nuclear war­head. EMP is generated by any nuclear weapon burst at any altitude above a few dozen kilometers, with the height of<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 4pt;">burst being significant in determining the area exposed to EMP. The EMP threat arises from the ability, whether by ter­rorists or states, to launch relatively unsophisticated mis­siles with nuclear warheads to detonate at altitudes from 40 to 400 kilometers above the earth’s surface. The rationale for such action would be the high political-military payoff in the form of devastating consequences. An EMP attack would constitute a highly successful asymmetric strategy against a society as heavily dependent as the United States is on electronics, energy, telecommunications networks, transportation systems, the movement of inventories in its manufacturing sector, and food processing and distribution capabilities. As noted in the EMP Commission report, EMP was an unintended result of a nuclear detonation at an al­titude of about 400 kilometers during the Starfish nuclear weapons tests above Johnstone Island in the Central Pacif­ic in 1962. The effects, felt some 1400 kilometers away in Ha­waii, included “the failure of street lighting systems, tripping of circuit breakers, triggering of burglar alarms, and damage to a telecommunications relay facility.” Nuclear tests con­ducted by the Soviet Union, also in 1962, produced damage to overhead and underground buried cables at distances as far away as 600 kilometers, together with surge arrest­er burnout, spark-gap breakdown, blown fuses, and power-supply breakdown.</span><span style="font-size: 4pt;">86 </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 4pt;">The destruction and mayhem caused by an EMP explosion would be far more substantial today given the ubiquity of electronics and society’s increased re­liance on them to run critical infrastructures. </span><span style="font-size: 4pt;">Several potential enemies either already have, or could soon acquire, the capability to attack the United States with a high-altitude nuclear explosion EMP that would cover a wide geographic region. Such a weapon need not be deto­nated directly over the United States itself to produce ma­jor damage to America’s critical infrastructures such as telecommunications, banking and finance, fuel/energy, transportation, food and water supply, emergency servic­es, government activities, and space systems. U.S. satellites, both civilian and military, are vulnerable to a range of at­tacks that include EMP, especially in low-earth orbits. Again, as the EMP Commission concluded, “The national security and homeland security communities use commercial satel­lites for critical activities, including direct and backup com­munications, emergency response services, and continuity of operations during emergencies.”87 Such satellites could </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 4pt;">be disabled by collateral radiation effects from an EMP at­tack on ground targets. </span><span style="font-size: 4pt;">Thus it is obvious that an interdependence exists between the objects of a potential EMP attack. Disabling one of the infrastructures, such as telecommunications or electricity, would have severe consequences for others, with cascading effects from which an advanced, technologically dependent society such as the United States might not easily recover. An EMP attack mounted against the United States would have far broader international consequences, given the in­terdependence of America and other economies in an era of globalization. An EMP attack against other economies, such as Japan or a European nation, would have major effects in the United States, and on other countries if the attack was on the United States. The services that would be essential to cope with the consequences of a terrorist attack, such as hospitals and emergency services, themselves might be dis­abled and therefore would not be available when and where they were most needed. As Senator John Kyl has pointed out, “A terrorist organization might have trouble putting a nu­clear warhead ‘on target’ with a </span></em>Scud<em>, but it would be much easier to simply launch and detonate in the atmosphere. No need for the risk and difficulty trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon over the border or hit a particular city. Just launch a cheap missile from a freighter in international waters – al-Qaeda is believed to own about eighty such vessels – and make sure to get it a few miles in the air.”88 Notably, Russia has considered attack options that in­clude EMP. During the May 1999 NATO air campaign against Serbia, members of the Russian Duma, meeting with U.S. congressional counterparts, reportedly speculated about the paralyzing effects of an EMP attack on the United States.89 To amplify on the Rumsfeld statement cited under “Ship-borne</em> Scud <em>Threat,” above, Iran is reported to have tested whether its ballistic missiles, such as the</em> Shahab<em>-3 or the</em> Scud<em>, could be detonated by remote control while still in high-altitude flight. The most plausible explanation for such tests is that Iran is developing the capability to explode a high-altitude nuclear weapon that could destroy critical electronic and technological infrastructures.90 Without an<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 4pt;"> effective missile defense the United States will remain vul­nerable to the EMP threat given its extensive dependence on high-tech, electronic infrastructure that cannot easily be hardened to withstand such an attack. The ability to launch an incapacitating EMP strike against the United States pro­vides enemies with an asymmetric threat that would not only inhibit U.S. military action but would also strike a se­vere economic and psychological blow.</span><strong>The Response</strong>Given this multiplicity of ballistic missile threats, the Unit­ed States must deploy a missile defense that deters hostile states from developing or acquiring missile capabilities that could threaten the United States, its allies and coalition part­ners, and its forces deployed abroad. Furthermore, America’s missile defense R&amp;D programs, together with planned de­ployments, must be sufficiently robust to dissuade would-be missile possessors from attempting to challenge the United States. Washington must deter future enemies from acquir­ing ballistic missiles, just as in the past it dissuaded them from developing strategic bombers because of America’s abil­ity to overwhelm such systems. Finally, U.S. missile defense must be capable of defeating those ballistic missiles, what­ever their range and type, that could be launched against the United States. U.S. and allied ballistic missile defense capabilities are an essential element of a broader damage limitation strat­egy.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The purpose of this strategy is to protect and defend the people, territory, infrastructure, and institutions of the United States and its allies to the greatest extent possible. </span>This strategy is a marked departure from the retaliation-based deterrence strategy of the Cold War. It is a strategy specifically tailored to meeting the security demands result­ing from the emerging multi-polar world, which has been brought about, at least in part, by the proliferation of bal­listic missiles and nuclear weapons. A mix of offensive and defensive strategic forces, which are modernized to meet the new and challenging requirements of this strategy, will be necessary.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Thus, a global and layered ballistic missile de­fense system must be intricately linked to other strategic forces, where the broader strategic posture of the U.S. and its allies results in security benefits that are greater than the sum of its parts. </span>As the United States dissuades future potential possess­ors, it must recognize that threats are increasing at a pace that no longer allows the luxury of long lead times within which a missile defense could be developed and deployed. Therefore, the United States must develop and rapidly field a missile defense with global reach, capable of coping with threats against the United States and its forces and allies</em> from any direction<em>. At the same time, America must attempt to dissuade hostile actors from acquiring missiles by render­ing such investments a poor use of limited resources. Ad­ditionally, given the uncertainty in predicting where, when, and by whom missiles might be launched – and what their targets may be – constant defenses are called for that are capable of intercepting missiles irrespective of their geo­graphic origin.Other things being equal, it is preferable to intercept threatening ballistic missiles as far away from their intend­ed targets and as early in their flight trajectory as possible. Best of all would be to have the capability to destroy an at­tacking missile shortly after it is launched, while its rockets still burn and any perturbation will lead to its destruction – with, in many cases, the debris falling back onto the area from which the attack was launched in the first place. The ca­pability to interdict a missile and its warheads in any phases of their flight (boost, midcourse, and terminal) requires an ability to detect and intercept the attack within a very few minutes and to track and destroy the attacking missile and its warheads during their longer midcourse traverse through space before they reenter the atmosphere.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Finally, the last-ditch defense would be to destroy the attacking missiles as they reenter and pass through the atmosphere – and as ac­companying debris and decoys burn up on reentry – in the terminal phase en route to their targets. </span>The best defense ca­ pability would be layered so that it could provide opportuni­ties for destruction in all three phases of flight<strong>. Only space-based defenses inherently have this global capability and permanence</strong><strong>.</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> While sea-based defenses can move freely through the two-thirds of the earth’s surface that are oceans, their capability is limited by geography and by the specific operations of the fleet – including where the sea-based missile defense happens to be deployed at any given time, and how quickly it could be redeployed to meet a crisis situation. </span>Air-based and ground-based defenses, meanwhile, can have global capabilities, but frequently take considerable time to deploy when and where needed and are also depen­dent on the cooperation of U.S. friends and allies in permit­ting the necessary supporting activities on their territories. Thus, only a space-based missile defense will possess both constancy and global availability, irrespective of allied sup­port and agreement. As such, space-based missile defense constitutes the only truly global system, with all the rest be­ing either regional or local.<span class="A11"><span style="font-size: 6pt;">91</span></span> In the case of sea-based systems, namely the</em> Aegis <em>pro­gram discussed in section 2, we have a regional system ca­pable of boost-phase, midcourse, and terminal intercept de­pending on where and how it is positioned, or vectored. It has a near-global application for</em> regional <em>operations, be­cause it is sea-based and theoretically it can be deployed over any portion of the earth’s surface covered by oceans.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> A land-based system can theoretically be deployed anywhere over about one-third of the world’s surface and, depending on how it is vectored, under some limited conditions would also be capable of boost-phase, midcourse, and terminal in­terception. </span><strong>Yet space-based missile defense alone is truly global in reach because of the medium in which it oper­ates, unconstrained by overflight or territorial restrictions.</strong> It also offers inherent interdiction advantages, described in greater detail below.</em><br />

<em>There is ample reason for concern. The threat environment confronting the U<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span>in the twenty-first century differs fundamentally from<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that of </span>the Cold War era. An unprecedented number of international actors have now acquired – or are seeking to acquire – ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. Rogue states, chief among them North Korea and Iran, place a premium on the acquisition of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the means to deliver them, </span>and these states are moving rapidly toward that goal. Russia and China<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, traditional competitors of the United States, </span>continue to expand the range and sophistication of their strategic arsenals at a time when the United States debates deep reductions in its strategic nuclear forces<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> beyond those already made since the end of the Cold War and has no current modernization program. With a new administration, furthermore, </span>the future development of even our limited missile defense system is in question. Furthermore, a number of asymmetric threats – including the possibility of <span style="font-size: 8pt;">weapons of mass destruction</span> (WMD) acquisition by terrorist groups or the devastation of American critical infrastructure as a result of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> electromagnetic pulse (</span>EMP) – now pose a direct challenge to the safety and security of the United States. Moreover, the number and sophistication of these threats are evolving at a pace that no longer allows the luxury of long lead times for the development and deployment of defenses. <span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In order </span>to address these increasingly complex and multifaceted dangers, the U<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span>must move well beyond the initial missile defense deployments of recent years to deploy a system capable of comprehensively protecting the American homeland as well as U.S. overseas forces and allies<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from the threat of ballistic missile attack. </span>U.S. defenses also must be able to dissuade would-be missile possessors from costly investments in missile technologies, and to deter future adversaries from confronting the United States with WMD<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or ballistic missiles. </span>America’s strategic objective should be to make it impossible for any adversary to influence U.S. decision making in times of conflict through the use of ballistic missiles<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or WMD blackmail based on the threat to use such capabilities. </span></em><br />
<em>These priorities necessitate the deployment of a system capable of constant defense against a wide range of threats in all phases<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of flight: boost, midcourse, and terminal. A layered system – encompassing ground-based (area and theater anti-missile assets) and sea-based capabilities – can provide multiple opportunities to destroy incoming missiles in various phases of flight. </span>A truly global capability<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span>cannot be achieved without a missile defense architecture incorporating interdiction capabilities in space as one of its key operational elements. In the twenty-first century, space has replaced the seas as the ultimate frontier for<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> commerce, technology, and </span>national security. Space-based missile defense affords maximum opportunities for interception in boost phase before rocket boosters have released warheads and decoys<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or penetration aids.</span></em><br />
<em>The benefits of space-based defense are manifold. The deployment of a robust global missile defense that includes space-based interdiction capabilities will make more expensive, and therefore less attractive, the foreign development of offensive ballistic missile technologies<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> needed to overcome it. Indeed, the enduring lesson of the ABM Treaty era is that the absence of defenses, rather than their presence, empowers the development of offensive technologies that can threaten American security and the lives of American citizens. And access to space, as well as space control, is key to future U.S. efforts to provide disincentives to an array of actors seeking such power. </span></em><br />

<em>A space-based KEI is designed to hit a ballistic missile in its boost or ascent phase, when the warhead(s) has not yet separated from the missile and is most vulnerable. It is also capable of midcourse and high-terminal phase intercepts. Ki­netic kill vehicles would be placed in low-earth orbit, where they would remain until a hostile missile launch was detect­ed. For intercepts in the boost or terminal phases, a kinetic kill vehicle would accelerate out of orbit toward the missile which would be destroyed by direct impact. Midcourse in­tercepts would occur in space. By the early 1990s, the United States had developed tech­nology for lightweight propulsion units, sensors, computers, and other components of an advanced kill vehicle. This con­cept,</em> Brilliant Pebbles<em>, consisted of a constellation of about 1,000 interceptors that combined their own early-warning and tracking capability with high maneuverability to engage attacking ballistic missiles in all phases of their flight trajec­tory. Each interceptor, or “pebble,” was designed to identi­fy the nature of the attack, which might include up to 200 ballistic missile warheads, based on a defense that included 1,000 “brilliant pebbles;” and since it knew its own location and that of all other pebbles, each could calculate an opti­mum attack strategy from its own perspective and execute an intercept maneuver, while simultaneously informing the other pebbles of its action<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>This operational concept enabled a robustly viable, testable, operational capability that sur­vived numerous scientific and engineering peer reviews in the 1989-90 time period, including by some groups that were hostile to the idea of missile defense in general, and space-based defenses in particular.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Still, because of persistent pol­icy preferences, the opposition eventually gained the upper hand politically, and the program, which had been formal­ly approved by the Pentagon’s acquisition authorities, was curtailed by Congress in 1991 and 1992 and then cancelled by the Clinton administration.</span><span class="A11"><span style="font-size: 6pt;">14 </span></span>But the technology was clearly established, supporting the Pentagon’s approved acquisition plan that each of the pebbles would operate autonomously because each carried the equivalent of a Cray-1 computer and could perform its own calculations for trajectory and targeting analysis. Each also had its own navigation sensors, allowing it to determine its location and the location of its neighbors – as well as to detect and track the target ballistic missiles and calculate a good approximation of what its neighbors saw.<span class="A11"><span style="font-size: 6pt;">15 </span></span>These peb­bles would act as sensor platforms until all or part of the constellation was authorized to intercept hostile missiles. In fact, their infrared sensors provided the warning and track­ing capability needed to alert the</em> Brilliant Pebbles <em>constel­lation, enabling it to intercept ballistic missiles in the boost and subsequent phases of flight. The constellation would provide a redundant and, for some applications, superior capability to the geosynchronous Defense Support Program satellites used since the early 1970s as a key element of the U.S. Early Warning and Tactical Assessment system.Their small size, meanwhile, made them difficult to target, while their relatively low cost made them easy to replace. The autonomy of</em> Brilliant Pebbles <em>interceptors in detect­ing launch and undertaking interception complicated the use of countermeasures against their command and con­trol. And because of the number of interceptors deployed in space, these defenses would have multiple opportunities for interception, thus increasing their chances of a success­ful intercept<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in either the boost or midcourse phase, or even high in the Earth’s atmosphere during reentry in the termi­nal phase. These characteristics stand in contrast to the cur­rent GMD interceptors, which may not provide more than one independent intercept opportunity</span>. Although the</em> Brilliant Pebbles <em>program was terminated in the early 1990s, advances in the commercial, civil, and other defense sectors since that time would now permit even lighter mass, lower cost, and higher performance than would have been achieved by the 1990-era technology base. Thus, lighter weight and smarter components could now empower a</em> Brilliant Pebbles <em>interceptor with greater accel­eration/velocity, making possible boost-phase intercept of even short- and medium-range ballistic missiles as well as high-acceleration ICBMs, thus surpassing the capabilities of the 1990</em> Brilliant Pebbles<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.16 As noted above, the same sensor and kill-vehicle tech­nology can be used for ground- and sea-based interceptors – notably on the VLS-compatible, high-velocity Navy SM-3 interceptor. </span>Reviving and building on the</em> Brilliant Pebbles <em>concept and related technologies is essential for the deploy­ment of effective SBIs, as well as improved interceptors for use in other basing modes, especially at sea.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> One feasible option for testing and initial deployment of a revived space-based interceptor system based on </span></em>Brilliant Pebbles <em>would be to deploy approximately 40 to 120 inter­ceptors for a space-system test bed analogous to the ground- and sea-based test beds. After demonstrating feasibility by testing against missiles of all ranges in all possible phases of their flight, this test bed would have a limited capabili­ty and could be expanded to become part of a fully capable defensive constellation. In 1991 initial operations were expected to be feasible in approximately five years; however at that time there was an in-place acquisition program with two competing contrac­tor teams. An appropriate</em> Brilliant Pebbles <em>team could be re­constituted and meet an approximate five-year target date for initial operations.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Motorola used commercially available technology to build and begin operating its 66-satellite constellation </span></em>Iridium <em>communications system in roughly five years for approximately $5 billion.</em> Iridium<em>, now used by the Pentagon for com­munications to remote locations, exploited many of the technologies, operational concepts, and ac­quisition management approaches that had been planned for</em> Brilliant Pebbles <em>before it was cancelled in 1993. Consequently, the operational issues dem­onstrated by the</em> Iridium <em>experience would be valu­able in reconstituting a viable</em> Brilliant Pebbles <em>ac­quisition program, provided personnel with that experience were included on the team</em>.<br />

<em><span style="color: black;">Anyone who wants to understand the way our enemies really think, as well as how and why we fail to grasp their reality should read Kevin Woods recent book </span></em>The Mother of All Battles: Saddam Hussein’s Strategic Plan for the Persian Gulf War<em>published by the Naval Institute Press. It tell the story of the 1991 Gulf War from the Iraqi point of view based largely on captured documents and published Arabic sources. The most important point in this study is that, from Saddam’s point of view, as well as that of the Ba’athist leadership, they won. After all, in spite of being ignominiously kicked out of Kuwait and having their armies thoroughly defeated on the battlefield, they remained in power. Political power was the only thing that counted and they had been able to keep it. One of the keys to their belief that they won was that they were able to launch dozens of long-range missiles at their enemies, especially at Israel. They believed that the boost that this gave them, at home and in the Arab world, somehow compensated for everything that happened on the battlefield in Kuwait and southern Iraq. In his autobiography</em> It Doesn’t Take A Hero<em>Norman Schwarzkopf wrote that “…in essence what they had was a weapon that could fly 300 miles and miss the target by a couple of miles with a warhead of only 160 pounds. Militarily, that was the equivalent of a single airplane flying over and dropping one small bomb and flying away—terrible for anyone it happened to land on but in the grand scheme of warfare, a mosquito. However the Scud was effective as a terror weapons against civilian populations.” Ever since 1991 this has been the accepted US and Western view of the missile campaign. Kevin Wood now has given us a much different view these attacks, one that has profound implications for missile defense policy and for the way that political leaders have to rethink the instructions they give to the military. Looking back on the German V-2 campaign against London and Antwerp that went on from September 1944 until April 1945, the greatest military effect was not the physical and psychological damage done to England and Belgium, but the impact on Germany’s national morale. One should never forget that these were called Vengeance weapons. For a population suffering under nearly non-stop Allied bombardment and facing defeat on every front, the fact that they were in some small way able to keep hitting back with a wonder weapon that their enemies could not match was a factor keeping them fighting. Nazi propaganda did not fail to manipulate these feelings. Ba’athist Iraq’s war-weary population was likewise subject to massive and—let’s face it—masterful propaganda. Hitting the hated Israelis, even with ineffective weapons, and the fact that due to US political pressure the Israelis did not strike back, was seen by Iraqis and by other Arabs as a great victory. A claim made explicit in a memoir written by Saddam’s missile force commander Hazim Abd al-Razzaq al-Ayyubi</em> Forty-Three Missiles on the Zionist Enemy <em>published in Amman, Jordan in 1998. Al-Ayyubi described how, in the years and months leading up to the war, his two missile brigades practiced their “shoot and scoot” operational techniques. He also wrote about the very serious efforts the Iraqismade building multiple secure communications links using both radio and phone lines. According to a report to Saddam, they started the war with 230 missiles and 75 “special” warheads. Interestingly, he also bragged about the success of his deception units, not only in fooling US and Coalition targeting efforts, but also in deceiving the UN inspectors who tried to account for the missiles. Wood makes it clear “that despite the cost to the Iraqi people, Iraq’s successful violation of UNSC [United Nations Security Council] resolution 687 was a source of great pride to its leaders.” Most, but not all, of what the Iraqis believed they had accomplished with their attacks was nonsense. The claims that they hit Ben Gurion Airport and the Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv, or the Haifa Technology Institute, are just not serious. As was their claim to have been “the first Arab country to conduct effective offensive operations against the enemy (Israel).” What is true is that these attacks “fulfilled the Iraqi President’s vow that he would retaliate against Israel as revenge for their attacks against the Iraqi reactor.” <strong>It is exactly this need for revenge that should get the attention of those in the US government who are trying to design a realistic missile defense policy for the next fifty years.</strong> Tyrannical regimes and terrorist movements share the need to excite people with dramatic and violent events. The more spectacular the attack, the better<strong>. Firing long-range missiles at an enemy, even if you only hit an empty parking lot, can provide followers with a level of emotional satisfaction. This in turn can motivate them to continue to fight even in a seemingly hopeless battle.</strong> In future wars, those who are fighting against the West—today Iran or North Korea, tomorrow, who knows?—will use ballistic missiles not only to terrorize enemy civilian populations but to build morale among their own forces and people. <strong>Missile defense is the key to winning this critical psychological battle.</strong> <strong>As long as their missiles are being shot out of the sky, claims that they are hurting the enemy and thus filling people’s need for revenge can be shown to be utterly empty. This, however, cannot be done with terminal phase defense weapons</strong>. To hit a missile or a warhead that is descending towards its target may be a feat of technological skill, but it does nothing to decrease the emotional satisfaction that comes from striking a hated enemy. Midcourse interceptors such as the US GBI or the Israeli Arrow are better, but <strong>the best way to publicly humiliate those who are launching Scud-type missiles is to shoot them down as soon after they leave the launch pad as possible</strong>. The only weapon now in development that will—in theory—be able to do this is the Airborne Laser (ABL), which the Missile Defense Agency plans to test next year. This is indeed a promising system, but it has its limits. Its range is, according to unclassified reports, about 300 kilometers, and the US only plans to build, at most, seven aircraft. <strong>If the goal is to prevent the enemy from using its missile attacks to build its own side’s morale and thus lengthen the war, another solution must be found</strong>. Space-based interceptors, such as a new version of the <strong>Brilliant Pebbles</strong> program that was canceled in 1993, <strong>could</strong>, in combination with space- and ground-based sensors, <strong>knock down missiles of this type in the boost phase</strong>. Significantly, they would do so over the launching country’s own territory and at least some of the citizens would witness the destruction of their leader’s vengeance weapons. <strong>This news would spread through word of mouth. This might be one of the keys to undermining their will to make war and help shorten the conflict.</strong></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">SBMD progressed through various programs, such as GPALS, Brilliant Pebbles, Clementine, and SBL, despite dwindling support from presidential administrations following President Reagan’s. Pres. George W. Bush paved the way for the next administration to put SBMD on the international agenda. According to </span></em>The National Security Strategy of the United States of America<em>(2006), the United States may need new approaches to deter state and nonstate actors and deny them the objectives of their attacks<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.50 </span>Additionally<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the </span></em>National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction <em>(2002) states that “today’s threats are far more diverse and less predictable than those of the past. States hostile to the United States and to our friends and allies have demonstrated their willingness to take high risks to achieve their goals, and are aggressively pursuing WMD and their means of delivery as critical tools in this effort. As a consequence, we require new methods of deterrence.”<strong>51</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Cooperation on </span>missile defense initiatives could increase global stability. By banding together in coalitions, countries can deter war by repelling an attack against any member.52 States and rogue elements will not be able to strike surreptitiously if they know that the international community could quickly discern the origin of any launch and compute potential impact points. Attempts by a rogue element to destabilize the region through the attribution of attacks to a state may initially promote the rogue elements own agenda. However, data provided by missile defense and other sensors can refute such claims. The shared international ability to identify launch and impact points might deter states and rogue elements from launching in the first place<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The more nations cooperate with each other, the more stable the world becomes. </span>Policymakers need to invest in the development of many different capabilities, including SBMD, to negate missiles in their boost phase and use the information gleaned from these developments to inform decisions<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. One approach involves bringing a system to the prototype stage for testing and accurately gauging its performance. </span>This approach could let the United States invest in only a limited number of prototypes, thus deferring large-scale production to allow further research, development, and testing. These efforts could decrease the risk of failure during production and deployment.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">53 When the need arises, the United States should capitalize on preexisting prototypes as long as the industrial base could support rapid production</span>. By funding R&amp;D for SBMD, the United States would ensure the viability of these technologies. The DOD cannot expect developments in commercial industry to be available for national security purposes. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Competitive pressures force industry to fund near-term R&amp;D programs and choose near-term survival over long-term possibilities.54 </span>Applied research into SBMD technologies would allow the United States to gain more knowledge about boost-phase defenses. America will get as much R&amp;D in SBMD technologies as it is willing to fund.</em><br />

<em><span style="color: black;">Weapons in Space and Hegemonic War and America would respond</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> … finally. </span><span style="color: black;">But would another state</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">? I have already pointed out that </span>i<span style="color: black;">f America were to weaponize space today, it is unlikely that any other state or group of states would find it rational to counter it in kind. The fact is that should the US develop and deploy weapons in outer space it </span></em>would <em>represent the addition of a potent new military capacity that would assist in extending the period of American hegemony well into the future.<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> This would clearly be threatening, and America must expect severe condemnation and increased competition in peripheral areas. But such an outcome is still </span></em>less <em>threatening than</em> any other state <em>doing so, for two essential reasons. First, <span style="color: black;">no other state can currently compete with the US in military space. The entry cost to provide the infrastructure necessary is too high; hundreds of billions of dollars,</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> at minimum. </span><span style="color: black;">The years of investment it would take to achieve a </span></em>minimal <em>counter-force capability—essentially from scratch—would provide more than ample time for the US to entrench itself in space, and readily counter preliminary efforts to displace it. The tremendous effort in time and resources would be worse than wasted<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Most states, if not all, would therefore opt </span></em>not <em>to counter US deployments in kind. They</em>might <em>oppose US interests with asymmetric balancing, depending on how aggressively America uses its new power, but the likelihood of a hemorrhaging arms race in space should the US deploy weapons there –at least for the next few years—is extremely remote. Second, <span style="color: black;">placement of weapons in space by the United States would be perceived as an attempt at continuing its current military dominance on land, at sea, and in the air</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. It </span></em>would <em>enhance military power across the board, and would</em> extend <em>the current period of American hegemony beyond what it would be without space weaponization. Although there is clear opposition to the current international balance of power, the</em> status quo<em>, there is also a sense that it is at least tolerable to the majority of states. A <span style="color: black;">continuation of it is thus minimally acceptable, even to states working towards its demise. So long as the US does not employ its power arbitrarily </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">(and I have argued that space weapons are structurally far less likely to be used in such a manner, and is at least less threatening, than an increase in current capabilities), </span><span style="color: black;">the situation would be bearable initially and grudgingly accepted over time</span><strong><span style="color: black;">.</span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> On the other hand, </span><span style="color: black;">an attempt by</span></em> <span style="color: black;">any other state</span> <em><span style="color: black;">to dominate space would rightly be perceived as an effort to break the land-sea-air dominance of the United States in preparation for a new international order. The action would be a challenge to the</span></em> <span style="color: black;">status quo</span><em><span style="color: black;">, not a perpetuation of it.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> Such an event would be disconcerting to the nations that accept the current international order (including the venerable institutions of trade, finance, and law that operate within it) and</span></em>intolerable// to the US. As leader of the current system, the US would enact an immediate counter-space effort. As current hegemon, the US could do no less, save graciously decide to step aside. Because all states are not equal in power or interest, no state other than the US would, or could, publicly proclaim its intent to dominate space without setting off an immediate scramble … at least for the time being.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The demand for missile defenses by other countries may create opportunities for SBMD as another way to address their security concerns. SBMD introduces a new dimension to missile defense. </span>Some argue that effective missile defenses will merely lead adversaries to search for other vulnerabilities and find other means to threaten their foes. To which Dr Everett Dolman would reply “Good. The threat of missile attack is now over. If the state is protected from missile attack, which was once a serious threat, this is a laudable result.”11 The international community may appreciate the benefits of SBMD even if they do not necessarily agree with the method. The United States could steer the international community towards a multilateral approach towards SBMD.Using an argument made by William Riker, getting the international community to accept SBMD requires the United States to lead the agenda, frame the issue and tie it to other areas, split the opposition, and avoid old arguments. The United States would want to work from a position of advantage. This position is usually out in front of the issue.The United States must try and manipulate the international agenda in favor of SBMD, if it intends to pursue a multilateral approach. The United States already plays a dominant role in many international organizations, <span style="color: black;">such as the United Nations and NATO, so presiding over committees that hear issues about SBMD could be relatively easy. The United States could work to structure decision-making situations to its advantage.13 Successful manipulation of the agenda could make a favorable outcome more likely.14 Leading the agenda allows the United States to set terms favorable to its interests. The United States could gain support from those who find fault with SBMD methods by framing the issue in another dimension, for instance the need to deter threats in new ways.15</span> <span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">“Today, the United States has only an extremely limited capability to defend its people, territory, foreign deployed forces, allies, and friends against ballistic missile attack.”16 Current US missile defenses cannot shoot down missiles in their boost phase. Many areas around the world may not be defended from ballistic missiles. </span><span style="color: black;">The proliferation of ballistic missiles increases the chances of an attack against vulnerable nations with no defenses. These are all reasons the United States could use while making a case for placing missile defenses on the international agenda.The United States could also appeal to a larger audience to gain widespread acceptance of SBMD on the international stage. SBMD allows the United States to give deterrence a broader appeal because it could benefit many more countries than any other form of missile defense. Confidence in the US’ ability to defend itself from an attack may allow the US to extend this same protection to allies and coalition partners. These international partners may perceive the United States as being more apt to stand by them during conflict versus retreating into an isolationist position due to concerns about the homeland. Effective integrated defenses, which include SBMD, could reassure friends and allies of the US’ commitment to deter, and respond should deterrence fail. SBMD therefore may keep other countries out of conflicts because they are confident the United States could protect them from missile attack. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">The United States may want to restructure the current regime as it pursues a more multilateral approach to SBMD. “International regimes are defined as principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which actor expectations converge in a given issue.”17 Old rules and procedures may no longer support new principles for missile defense. The United States seeks to foster relationships built on common principles concerning the use of space. Many states already value having ballistic missile defense capabilities. The United States could try changing international perceptions about the uses of space. Space has been treated as a sanctuary, preserved for peaceful purposes, since the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957, followed quickly by the American launch of Explorer 1. This peaceful use of space was codified by the United Nations in 1962 by the “Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space.”18 The Outer Space Treaty followed in 1967 expanding the 1962 Declaration to include, “States shall not place nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on celestial bodies or station them in outer space in any other manner to prevent nuclear weapons in space.”19 </span><span style="color: black;">Now perceptions of space as a sanctuary may be changing with recent actions such as the Chinese anti-satellite demonstration in 2007, and even the US’ destruction of an ailing NRO satellite in 2008. Space may no longer be a pristine sanctuary</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. However, the perception shared by international and domestic audiences of space remaining a sanctuary may inhibit the nation's ability to field SBMD. </span><span style="color: black;">The United States may need to shift the international community’s focus from space as a sanctuary, a preserve free of weapons, towards space for the benefit of all mankind, protecting the helpless from ballistic missiles.20</span> <span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">The United States is committed to the overarching space principles of 'freedom of overflight' and 'space for the benefit of all mankind' and not the preservation of space as a sanctuary. Perceptions of fairness may be complicating international buy-in to the current BMD architecture. Land-basing could be perceived as unfair because the system protects some countries more than others.21 One unlikely solution for this concern could entail building more land-based missile defense sites. However, foreign populations may not like the United States building sites on their sovereign territory because it could be an overt sign that they rely on the United States for security. </span><span style="color: black;">An expanded BMD architecture that included SBMD could be perceived as distributing the benefits of protection more fairly. In contrast to intrusive land-based interceptors, SBMD would be out of sight, out of mind for these concerned populations. Those opposing, or ambivalent towards, SBMD do not share the same concerns and therefore may not be uniformly opposed to these defenses. Introducing additional issues or choices into decision-making processes may effectively split the opposition into opposing camps on that issue or choice.22 Once this happens, the United States could exploit the political fissures. “This manipulation works even though those who are manipulated know they are being manipulated because, once a salient dimension is revealed, its salience exists regardless of one’s attitude toward it.”23</span> <span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">The United States has used a multilateral approach to missile defenses with the Soviet Union/Russians in the past. “During his first visit to the United States in 1992, President Boris Yeltsin proposed that the United States and Russia jointly pursue a Global Protection System against ballistic missiles.”24 President George H. W. Bush agreed and started the Ross-Mamedov talks before leaving office. President Clinton, however, did not continue the talks, leaving the Russians skeptical about US intentions for cooperation.25 Perhaps the new administration could restart such talks. The United States could try and reach new audiences about the value of SBMD. SBMD critics express concerns about debris fields and other consequences of employing space-based defenses. The Space Liability Convention already covers the legal consequences and responsibilities of those employing such systems. Missile defenses operating in any medium face similar concerns, yet these issues do not inhibit their employment. </span><span style="color: black;">The military has to worry about the debris and liability generated from any missile intercepts regardless of whether they occur in the atmosphere or space. Reiterating old arguments to the same audiences does not gain new support from those countries who may be interested in a multilateral approach to SBMD.2</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">6 Responding to the same audiences with the same message wastes time and energy that could be spent elsewhere, such as changing perceptions or splitting the opposition. </span><span style="color: black;">By leading the agenda, the United States could avoid being stuck repeating old arguments and move on to more salient issues.</span></strong><br />

While research continued on lasers and particle beam interceptors, the nation proceeded with available hit-to-kill kinetic capabilities. GPALS started in 1991, with the objective of protecting US forces overseas, our friends and allies, and the United States itself from “accidental, unauthorized, and/or limited ballistic missile strikes.” 9 GPALS had three components, of which only one, Brilliant Pebbles, relied on space to provide a global defense against ballistic missiles. Space capabilities played a supporting role in the other two components, theater missile defense and limited national missile defense. Brilliant Pebbles was a “constellation of small autonomous, kinetic-energy interceptors designed to detect and destroy ballistic missiles while they were still in the boost, post-boost, and early midcourse phases of flight.”10 Brilliant Pebbles was expected to be effective against any missile with a range greater than 600-800 kilometers.11 Citing a March 1992 Report to Congress on space-based ballistic missile defense interceptors, Ambassador Henry F. Cooper highlighted, “Simulations using actual DSP data from Scud missile launches during the Gulf War showed that Brilliant Pebbles could have intercepted every Iraqi Scud launched against Israel and Saudi Arabia.” 12 While the technology showed promise, it lacked political support and, as a consequence, the Clinton Administration cancelled Brilliant Pebbles in 1993.<br />

<strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11.5pt;">A fourth countermeasure available to the adversary is the fielding of more missiles to saturate the missile defense architecture.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">34 </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 11.5pt;">The saturation point depends upon the numbers of both space- and terrestrial-based interceptors deployed.

<span style="color: black; font-size: 11.5pt;">The last countermeasure might involve the opponent shifting from ballistic missiles to cruise missiles. Cruise missiles remain beneath the atmosphere where SBMD may not be effective due to the difficulty of penetrating the Earth’s atmosphere. The adversary would pay a penalty in terms of speed, reach, and destructive potential for using cruise missiles instead of ballistic missiles. These penalties, in combination with existing cruise missile defenses, would make their attack less likely to succeed. While SBMD interceptors may not work well against cruise missile attacks, space sensors could still trigger theater missile defenses to intercept these missiles. Getting an adversary to switch from ballistic to cruise missiles would also be a victory for those seeking to deter the proliferation of ballistic missiles and a testament to the effectiveness of SBMD.</span><br />

<strong>Space weaponization’s inevitable</strong><br />

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> The simplest inevitability argument is that </span><span style="color: black;">warfare and armaments are intrinsically uncontrollable because people are warlike and states ultimately will do whatever they believe to be in their self-interest.</span><span style="color: #0658b5;">[12]</span><span style="color: black;"> In short, weapons and warfare abhor a vacuum, and will spread wherever humanity goes.</span><span style="color: #0658b5;">[13]</span><span style="color: black;"> In some cases, adherence to this belief is based upon skepticism about, or even deep visceral revulsion for, negotiated arms control.</span><span style="color: #0658b5;">[14]</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> The premise that </span><span style="color: black;">states are selfish rational actors in an anarchic world</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> actually predicts little about what their specific policies will be in the absence of additional information or assumptions. In fact, warfare and states’ preparations for war are often limited by a wide variety of rational considerations, most of which have little to do with formal arms control negotiations. Deploying space weapons would involve a variety of potential political costs and benefits, both domestic and international, and is far from unreasonable to think that states might shy away from such a course even if it promised to increase their absolute military capabilities, depending on the complete set of incentives and disincentives facing them. As the space weapons debate itself proves, the norm of space as an unweaponized sanctuary that has evolved during the past forty-five years is far from politically insignificant. Of course, </span><span style="color: black;">the more important a military innovation appears to be to a state’s security, the more likely it is to be adopted, even if the price for doing so is fairly high, while it is relatively easy to give up military opportunities of limited value.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> For example, </span><span style="color: black;">the longstanding success of the multilateral 1957 treaty prohibiting military bases in Antarctica, often cited as an example of an effective sanctuary regime, would be more impressive if the signatory powers had strong incentives to establish bases on that continent</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Yet even so it flies in the face of the idea that weaponization will follow wherever people go; the argument that </span><span style="color: black;">space weapons in particular will have military utility too great to resist</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> is a different proposition from the contention that weapons always spread everywhere, and will be later in this essay.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>b) Military utility</strong><br />
<strong>Mueller 2</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – senior political scientist at the RAND specializes in research related to military and national security strategy (Karl, “Is the Weaponization of Space Inevitable?”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://isanet.ccit.arizona.edu/noarchive/mueller.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">__http://isanet.ccit.arizona.edu/noarchive/mueller.html__</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Far and away </span><span style="color: black;">the best argument that space weaponization is inevitable</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, and the only such argument that can plausibly stand on its own, is that </span><span style="color: black;">the military utility of space weapons for the United States and/or its enemies will soon be so great that the imperative of protecting national security will make space weaponization impossible for rational statesmen to resist. Exactly what these weapons would do, and how, varies from one weaponization vision to another, but the standard expectation is that space weapons would eventually defend friendly satellites against enemy attack, attack enemy space weapons and other satellites that perform important military functions, shoot down long-range ballistic missiles, and conduct attacks against enemy air and surface forces and other terrestrial targets</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="color: #0658b5;">[33]</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> Some weaponization advocates anticipate that </span><span style="color: black;">space weapons will ultimately supplant many, or even most, types of terrestrial military forces; others have more modest expectations, but all predict that space weapons will be the best, and in some cases the only, systems available to fulfill at least some key military roles.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> The core of this inevitability argument is that</span><span style="color: black;">even</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> (or especially) </span><span style="color: black;">if the United States chooses not to build space weapons, other countries will certainly do so, in large part because of the great and still growing degree to which U.S. military operations depend upon what has traditionally been known as “space force enhancement”: the use of satellites to provide a vast array of services including communications, reconnaissance, navigation, and missile launch warning, without which American military power would be crippled. This parallels the argument that the importance of satellites to the U.S. economy will make them an irresistible target</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, except that military satellites are far more indispensable, and </span><span style="color: black;">successful attacks against a relatively small number of them could have a considerable military impact, for example by concealing preparations for an invasion or by disrupting U.S. operations at a critical juncture.</span><span style="color: #0658b5;">[34]</span> <span style="color: black;">Rivals of the United States might also find space-to-earth weapons to be a very attractive way to counter U.S. advantages in military power projection.</span><br />

So long as America is the state most likely to acquire a breakthrough technology in this area, my concern is limited to the problem of letting technology take us where it will. But what if an enemy of democratic liberalism should suddenly acquire the means to place quickly and cheaply multiple weapons into orbit? The advantages gained from controlling the high ground of space would accrue to it as surely as to any liberal state, and the concomitant loss of military power from the denial of space to our already-dependent military force could cause the immediate demise of the extant international system. The longer the US dithers on its responsibilities, the more likely a potential opponent could seize low-earth orbit before America could respond. And America would respond … finally. But would another state? If America were to weaponize space today, it is unlikely that any other state or group of states would find it rational to counter in kind. The entry cost to provide the infrastructure necessary is too high; hundreds of billions of dollars, at minimum. The years of investment it would take to achieve a minimal counter-force capability—essentially from scratch—would provide more than ample time for the US to entrench itself in space, and readily counter preliminary efforts to displace it. The tremendous effort in time and resources would be worse than wasted. Most states, if not all, would opt not to counter US deployments in kind. They might oppose US interests with asymmetric balancing, depending on how aggressively America uses its new power, but the likelihood of a hemorrhaging arms race in space should the US deploy weapons there—at least for the next few years—is extremely remote.– This rationality does not dispute the fact that US deployment of weapons in outer space would represent the addition of a potent new military capacity, one that would assist in extending the current period of American hegemony well into the future. This would clearly be threatening, and America must expect severe condemnation and increased competition in peripheral areas. But such an outcome is less threatening than any other state doing so. Placement of weapons in space by the United States would be perceived correctly as an attempt at continuing American hegemony. Although there is obvious opposition to the current international balance of power, the status quo, there is also a sense that it is at least tolerable to the majority of states. A continuation of it is thus minimally acceptable, even to states working towards its demise. So long as the US does not employ its power arbitrarily, the situation would be bearable initially and grudgingly accepted over time. On the other hand, an attempt by any other state to dominate space would be part of an effort to break the land-sea-air dominance of the United States in preparation for a new international order, with the weaponizing state at the top. The action would be a challenge to the status quo, not a perpetuation of it. Such an event would be disconcerting to nations that accept the current international order (including the venerable institutions of trade, finance, and law that operate within it) and intolerable to the US. As leader of the current system, the US could do no less than engage in a perhaps ruinous space arms race, save graciously decide to step aside.<br />

<strong>That’s war</strong><br />

The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. <span style="text-decoration: none;">American predominance prevents</span> these <span style="text-decoration: none;">rivalries from intensifying</span> — its regional as well as its global predominance. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Were the United States to diminish its influence</span> in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the <span style="text-decoration: none;">other nations would settle disputes</span> as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often <span style="text-decoration: none;">through confrontation and wars of varying</span> scope, <span style="text-decoration: none;">intensity, and destructiveness</span>. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that <span style="text-decoration: none;">most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars</span> between them less likely, or it could simply make them <span style="text-decoration: none;">more catastrophic. It is</span> easy but also <span style="text-decoration: none;">dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing</span> a measure of <span style="text-decoration: none;">stability in the world</span> even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that <span style="text-decoration: none;">other nations </span>cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They <span style="text-decoration: none;">either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil.</span> Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. <span style="text-decoration: none;">In a more genuinely multipolar world</span>, however, <span style="text-decoration: none;">it would not</span>. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i <span style="text-decoration: none;">and othermajor conflicts, would disrupt trade flows</span> in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to <span style="text-decoration: none;">American power</span>, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe ’s stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States <span style="text-decoration: none;">could step in to check any dangerous development</span> on the continent. <span style="text-decoration: none;">In a</span> genuinely <span style="text-decoration: none;">multipolar world, that would not be possible without</span> renewing the danger of world <span style="text-decoration: none;">war.</span> People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that ’s not the way it works. <span style="text-decoration: none;">International order</span> does not rest on ideas and institutions. It <span style="text-decoration: none;">is shaped by configurations of power</span>. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power<span style="text-decoration: none;">, a multipolar world</span> in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, <span style="text-decoration: none;">would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it.</span> Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world ’s great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. <span style="text-decoration: none;">War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan</span>. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These</span>, too, <span style="text-decoration: none;">could draw in other great powers,</span> including the United States. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Such conflicts may be unavoidable</span> no matter what policies the United States pursues. <span style="text-decoration: none;">But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of</span> regional <span style="text-decoration: none;">dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region</span>. That is certainly the view of most of China ’s neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. <span style="text-decoration: none;">In Europe</span>, too, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the departure of the United States</span> from the scene — even if it remained the world’s most powerful nation — <span style="text-decoration: none;">could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery</span>. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe — if it adopted what some call a strategy of “offshore balancing” —<span style="text-decoration: none;">this could</span> in time <span style="text-decoration: none;">increase</span> the likelihood of <span style="text-decoration: none;">conflict</span> involving Russia and its near neighbors, <span style="text-decoration: none;">which could in turn draw the United States back in</span> under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, “offshore” role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more “even-handed” policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel ’s aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn ’t change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. <span style="text-decoration: none;">A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia</span>, if only to secure their interests. 18 <span style="text-decoration: none;">And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region</span>, particularly Iran, <span style="text-decoration: none;">to expand and fill the vacuum.</span> It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn ’t changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to “normal” or to a new kind of stability in the region. <span style="text-decoration: none;">It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again</span>.<br />

(Reuters) <strong>- North Korea shows no sign of giving up its pursuit of nuclear weapons and remains a threat to the South,</strong> the top U.S. military official said Thursday, urging <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reuters.com/places/china" rel="nofollow">China</a> to lean on its ally to exercise restraint. &quot;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reuters.com/places/north-korea" rel="nofollow">North Korea</a> shows no signs of relenting in pursuit of its nuclear capabilities, and I'm not convinced that they won't provoke again,&quot; Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters during a visit to the South. &quot;I've said for a long time that the only thing predictable about North Korea is their unpredictability.&quot; Mullen attended the change of command of about 30,000 U.S. troops stationed in the South to General James Thurman from outgoing commander General Walter Sharp. &quot;(The) expectation at least from my perspective, that unless the leadership in the North is deterred, they will continue to do that,&quot; Mullen said, referring to the sinking of a South Korean navy ship and the bombing of an island last year. Mullen, who was in Beijing earlier, said that Chinese military leaders agreed it was important to maintain stability in North Korea. Most experts and officials believe the North Korean regime is not at risk of collapse. But they say there are signs of discontent as the North tries to continue dynastic rule by working on succession of power from current leader Kim Jong-il to his youngest known son, Jong-un. Mullen said the North's aggressive behavior toward <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reuters.com/places/south-korea" rel="nofollow">South Korea</a> may be linked to the succession process underway in Pyongyang. &quot;<strong>We have a sense of urgency to</strong> essentially work on planning to <strong>deter the North from further provocations.</strong> Whether they will be deterred or not, that's to be seen.&quot;<br />

<strong>The international community is increasingly aware that cooperative diplomacy is the most productive way to tackle the multiple, interconnected global challenges facing humanity, not least of which is the increasing proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. Korea and Northeast Asia are instances where risks of nuclear proliferation and actual nuclear use arguably have increased in recent years. This negative trend is a product of continued US nuclear threat projection against the DPRK as part of a general program of coercive diplomacy in this region, North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, the breakdown in the Chinese-hosted Six Party Talks towards the end of the Bush Administration, regional concerns over China’s increasing military power, and concerns within some quarters in regional states (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) about whether US extended deterrence (“nuclear umbrella”) afforded under bilateral security treaties can be relied upon for protection. The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious, not only for the Northeast Asian region but for the whole international community. At worst, there is the possibility of nuclear attack1, whether by</strong> intention, miscalculation, or merely accident**, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities. On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust of unprecedented proportions. But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: That is not global winter, but the nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years. The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow…The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger…To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.4 These, of course, are not the only consequences. Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. The direct impacts, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, could make the present global financial crisis pale by comparison. How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. There could be many unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with subsequent nuclear breakout and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, and aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant states. The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community.<br />

<strong>Syria•</strong> , which maintains biological and chemical weapons capabilities and possesses a large inventory of surface-to-surface ballistic missile systems, could deliver con­ventional and unconventional warheads to neighboring countries in the Middle East.35 Syria has also shown more than a passing interest in acquiring a nuclear weapons capability, as evidenced by the construction the Al-Kibar reactor site, which was subsequently destroyed by an Is­raeli Air Force strike in September 2007. The Central In­telligence Agency (CIA) has estimated that Damascus possesses hundreds of free-rocket-over-ground (FROG) missiles, <em>Scud</em> missiles, and SS-21 short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs).36 Syria also maintains the indigenous capability to manufacture liquid-fuel <em>Scud</em>s.37 In Septem­ber 2003 testimony before the House of Representatives Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, then-Under Secretary of State John Bolton outlined that Syria “is fully committed to expanding and improving its CW [chemical weapons] program” and “is continuing to de­velop an offensive biological weapons capability.”38 Syr­ia’s mobile missile force is capable of targeting much of Israel, as well as parts of Iraq, Jordan, and Turkey, and it has “developed a longer-range missile – the <em>Scud</em>-D – with assistance from North Korea” while simultane­ously pursuing “both solid- and liquid-propellant mis­sile programs.”39<br />

<br />
Israel's blunt-talking foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, warned Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, on Thursday that the Assad family would lose power in any war with Israel, ratcheting up bellicose exchanges between the countries in recent days. In a speech at Bar-Ilan University, near Tel Aviv, Mr. Lieberman said: ''I think that our message must be clear to Assad. In the next war, not only will you lose, you and your family will lose the regime. Neither you will remain in power, nor the Assad family.'' That had to be the message, Mr. Lieberman added, because ''the only value truly important to them is power.'' In an effort to calm the atmosphere, an aide to Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said that Mr. Netanyahu was ''ready to go anywhere in the world, at any time, to open peace talks with Syria without preconditions.'' The aide, Nir Hefetz, added that Israel did not rule out assistance from any ''fair third party'' that could advance a peace process with Syria. Mr. Lieberman was responding to strident comments from Syria on Wednesday. Mr. Assad told the visiting Spanish foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, that Israel was ''not serious about achieving peace'' and that the facts indicated that ''Israel is pushing the region toward war, not peace,'' according to the Syrian news agency SANA. Furthermore, the Syrian foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, said Wednesday that ''Israel should not test Syria's determination,'' adding, ''Israel knows that war will move to the Israeli cities.'' <span style="color: black;">He implied that a conflict beginning in South Lebanon could also lead to an all-out war. Mr. Moallem made his comments in response to a strong statement made by Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, to senior Israeli Army officers on Monday, warning that ''in the absence of an arrangement with Syria, we are liable to enter a belligerent clash with it that could reach the point of an all-out, regional war.'' Israelis understood Mr. Barak's remark as a plea for the Israeli government to start new peace negotiations with Syria, but the Syrians apparently interpreted it as warmongering. Israel's northern borders with Lebanon and Syria are quiet, but tense. The last Israel-Syria war was in 1973; Israel last fought Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia that receives support from Syria, in Lebanon in 2006. Israeli military officials have warned repeatedly that Hezbollah has been rearming, and they assert that Syria has been preparing its military to move from the conventional battlefield into missiles that can be aimed at Israeli cities. Mr. Lieberman said the Syrians had issued a ''direct threat'' to Israel that ''crossed a line.'' ''We cannot continue with business as usual,'' he said. Shaul Mofaz, a former Israeli Army chief and defense minister, and now a senior member of the opposition centrist Kadima Party, described Mr. Lieberman's statements as ''irresponsible.'' ''They are liable to lead to verbal escalation or other types of escalation,'' Mr. Mofaz told Israel Radio. Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly said that he is ready to talk to the Syrians without preconditions on either side. But Syria expects a guarantee from Israel up front that it is willing to withdraw from the Golan Heights, the strategic plateau that Syria lost in the 1967 war. There are sharp differences within Mr. Netanyahu's governing coalition, not least over whether a deal with Syria would succeed in removing Syria from the Iranian sphere. ''Those who think that territorial concessions will cause a severance of the ties between Syria and the axis of evil are deluding themselves and avoiding reality,'' Mr. Lieberman said Thursday, referring to Iran with a term used by former President George W. Bush.</span><br />

Arab WMD Development A common argument is that the Israeli nuclear capability has led to the pursuit of WMD and ballistic missiles by some of the Arab states and Iran. This is only partially correct. The fact is that the Arab states have pursued such capabilities to counter each other also. The region’s extraordinary complexity, the numerous actors, and the sources of conflict also have to be considered. 15 The resulting divisions in the Arab world have ensured that the chances of a combined Arab attack are low. The Syrian chemical arsenal should be considered, to a certain extent, as being a direct response to Israeli nuclear power, though it has other WMD arsenals to fear, such as Iraq’s. In Syrian strategic thinking, chemical weapons are designed to offset Israel’s conventional superiority in the event of war. A major Israeli concern is—a massive Syrian surprise attack with conventional forces on the Golan Heights. Syria possesses missiles such as the Scud-C (range 500 km) and the Scud-B (range 280 km) and also chemical arsenals for them like the powerful nerve agent VX. 16 These missiles armed with chemical warheads could strike airfields and mobilisation points, incapacitating these areas. With Israel denied air superiority, Syria could retake the Golan Heights. A simultaneous Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and the Gaza strip along with other Arab states attacking would make the situation particularly grave. Such a scenario would be ripe for a nuclear Armageddon. Further, both Iraq and Iran are known to possess vast quantities of WMD. In case of Iraq, UNSCOM has already shown how elaborate the Iraqi chemical and biological weapons programme was, till the Gulf war. The deadliness of the arsenal had already been established, when Iraq used chemical weapons against its Kurdish population in the late 80s. The activities of UNSCOM in the past eight years notwithstanding, the technical knowhow is still present, and Iraq is capable of recreating its lethal arsenal. The important thing to understand here is that, till the time Israel maintains its nuclear arsenal, and the opacity surrounding it, the Arab states and Iran would claim justification for their own WMD stock. Further, Israel’s nuclear arsenal might deter an Arab chemical attack but the danger of creating a linkage between the two categories of weapons is that the nuclear threshold is lowered to scenarios that may not be ‘last resort’ situations. Danger of Irrational Use A fear expressed regarding the proliferation of nuclear weapons is that they could fall into the hands of irrational decision-makers in the Middle East, especially in a scenario where an Arab state might acquire nuclear weapons. There is belief that in case an Arab state achieves such a status, then in a confrontational situation, theories of deterrence, MAD may not work. One side assuming the inevitability of war may decide to launch a pre-emptive strike at the other’s nuclear forces. On the other hand, an equally convincing argument would be that the high price as a consequence of mistakes in a nuclear weapons scenario, can also force parties to reconsider their course of action, and can also lead to pull backs, in spite of a loss of face. The US had withdrawn from the Bay of Pigs, likewise the Soviet Union withdrew their missiles from Cuba. 17 Risk of Actual Use The introduction of nuclear weapons in an already hostile region could increase the possibility of actual use of nuclear weapons in a tense situation. The continuous hostility of varying levels over the past five decades, might lead to the inclusion of nuclear and other WMD in existing “war-fighting” doctrines. 18 If the states in the region see WMD simply as weapons to be used in a conflict, the probability of these weapons being used increases drastically. The Arabs have tried to counter Israel’s nuclear superiority, by developing a sizeable chemical and biological weapons arsenal. The greater the number of powers in a region possessing WMD, the greater the risk of escalation. Wars in history have more often than not been limited; but the main reason for this has been constraints due to resources and technological know-how. Instances are very rare of a war being limited due to considerations of the consequences of existing capabilities. 19 The indiscriminate effect of Weapons of Mass Destruction makes it very difficult to keep a war involving such weapons, limited. Future leaders may have less respect for the nuclear taboo, and may refuse to see the nuclear bomb as only a last resort, thereby increasing the risk. On the other hand, it could also be argued that development of battlefield weapons would not have the cataclysmic effects of bombing population centers. Nuclear Deterrence Against Terrorists Many of the threats that Israel has faced have not been influenced by the fact that it is a nuclear power. Atomic weapons cannot deter guerrilla attacks and they also cannot help in civil wars like the one Israel was involved in Lebanon. It could thus be argued that in the last 25 years, though there have been no conventional wars, Israel has still been forced into various other conflicts, which have threatened its security, and its atomic arsenal has been ineffectual. The Israeli nuclear doctrine is still based on the last resort option, though there have been moves towards battlefield nuclear capability also. But in situations that are less than last resort, deterrence has not really worked, even after taking into account any battlefield strategies that Israel might have developed. Further weakening of the deterrent has taken place as Israel is in control of Arab lands. This weakening has occurred as Israel’s occupation is not just military but also national, ideological and territorial. The goal of conflict resolution is not helped by Israel’s nuclear arsenal. The Pre-Emptive Strike Option In 1981, Israel successfully bombed Iraq’s Osirak reactor. But in its goal of denying nuclear capability to anyone else in the Middle East, it can no longer attempt such pre-emptive air strikes. The most likely candidates to threaten Israel are Iran (which recently tested its Shahab-3 long range missile), Syria, and to a lesser degree, Iraq. At least the first two have undertaken measures like concealment, dispersion, hardening and installation of air defence equipment to prevent any Israeli air strikes. Since pre-emption is ruled out, therefore Israel may be forced to adopt a ‘launch on warning’ posture as it does not have the luxury of waiting to assess the damage from a first strike before responding. In turn Iran, Iraq or Syria, lacking securesecond strike forces of their own would be under great pressure to launch their missiles first—another first strike posture. There could thus be a hair trigger alert scenario. The possibility of nuclear war breaking out by accident or design would be great and would place intolerable strain on Israel’s freedom of military movement and civilian morale.<br />

There is ample reason for concern. The threat environment confronting the United States in the twenty-first century differs fundamentally from that of the Cold War era. An unprecedented number of international actors have now acquired – or are seeking to acquire – ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. Rogue states, chief among them North Korea and Iran, place a premium on the acquisition of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and the means to deliver them, and these states are moving rapidly toward that goal. Russia and China, traditional competitors of the United States, continue to expand the range and sophistication of their strategic arsenals at a time when the United States debates deep reductions in its strategic nuclear forces beyond those already made since the end of the Cold War and has no current modernization program. With a new administration, furthermore, the future development of even our limited missile defense system is in question. Furthermore, a number of asymmetric threats – including the possibility of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) acquisition by terrorist groups or the devastation of American critical infrastructure as a result of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) – now pose a direct challenge to the safety and security of the United States. Moreover, the number and sophistication of these threats are evolving at a pace that no longer allows the luxury of long lead times for the development and deployment of defenses. In order to address these increasingly complex and multifaceted dangers, the United States must move well beyond the initial missile defense deployments of recent years to deploy a system capable of comprehensively protecting the American homeland as well as U.S. overseas forces and allies from the threat of ballistic missile attack. U.S. defenses also must be able to dissuade would-be missile possessors from costly investments in missile technologies, and to deter future adversaries from confronting the United States with WMD or ballistic missiles. America’s strategic objective should be to make it impossible for any adversary to influence U.S. decision making in times of conflict through the use of ballistic missiles or WMD blackmail based on the threat to use such capabilities.<br />
These priorities necessitate the deployment of a system capable of constant defense against a wide range of threats in all phases of flight: boost, midcourse, and terminal. A layered system – encompassing ground-based (area and theater anti-missile assets) and sea-based capabilities – can provide multiple opportunities to destroy incoming missiles in various phases of flight. A truly global capability, however, cannot be achieved without a missile defense architecture incorporating interdiction capabilities in space as one of its key operational elements. In the twenty-first century, space has replaced the seas as the ultimate frontier for commerce, technology, and national security. Space-based missile defense affords maximum opportunities for interception in boost phase before rocket boosters have released warheads and decoys or penetration aids.<br />
The benefits of space-based defense are manifold. The deployment of a robust global missile defense that includes space-based interdiction capabilities will make more expensive, and therefore less attractive, the foreign development of offensive ballistic missile technologies needed to overcome it. Indeed, the enduring lesson of the ABM Treaty era is that the absence of defenses, rather than their presence, empowers the development of offensive technologies that can threaten American security and the lives of American citizens. And access to space, as well as space control, is key to future U.S. efforts to provide disincentives to an array of actors seeking such power.<br />

Possible Causes- for an EMP. A direct attack from a nation and/or terrorist group using one or more nuclear weapons exploded at very high altitude over the United States - a blast from a meteor exploding at high altitude in the atmosphere - check out this report on the<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20127001.300-space-storm-alert-90-seconds-from-catastrophe.html?full=true" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">solar EMP possibility.</a> U.S. vulnerability- The U.S. is more vulnerable than any other nation on earth to an EMP because she has become totally dependent on electricity and electronics for just about everything used in everyday living. This vulnerability has come about in the last few decades. All of the major enemies of the U.S. are aware of this vulnerability and that <strong>this is the easiest way to cripple the United States.</strong> Russia has this capability and tested it during the cold war. Some officials from Russia suggested they could use this capability against the United States in 1999 during the Balkans conflict. China now has this capability, and U.S. intelligence sources say that North Korea and Iran are actively developing the technology and capability. Terrorist groups could get the capability from any one of these countries or from a few other countries either directly or by theft. The weapon could be delivered by a Scud missile hidden under a tarp from a medium sized ship in the shipping lanes off the coast of the United States. Scud missiles are available in the weapons market for about $100,000. If the United States were attacked with this weapon the country may find it very difficult if not impossible to retaliate. Finding out who was responsible might not be easy especially if it was done by state sponsored terrorists or if terrorists carried it out on their own. If the U.S. responded in kind over a country like North Korea, it would not significantly change their way of life and if the U.S. nuked their cities without serious proof I can foresee a collective world reaction against the United States that would only make substantial recovery in the U.S. more difficult if not impossible. Even <strong>conventional warfare may not be possible because our military would have to be recalled to the United States to restore domestic order.</strong> EMP Effects - total blackout - Y2K + X to the nth power– A large EMP would actualize the perceived Y2K threat of the year 2000 except the effects of an EMP would be many magnitudes worse than anyone's worst nightmare about Y2K. <strong>A large EMP would cause the immediate collapse of the North American power grid and the destruction of much unshielded electronic equipment in the area of the pulse</strong>. The extent of the pulse depends on many factors; it could hit the whole nation, a good part of the nation, or be more local. Those who would attempt such an attack would seek to maximize the extent of the damage so more than likely, the pulse would hit much if not most of the United States. The EMP pulse itself has three components with each subsequent component causing further damage. An EMP is generated when Gamma Rays from a high altitude nuclear explosion interact with the atmosphere to produce a radio frequency wave pulse that would hit everything in line of sight of the explosion. A small crude nuclear weapon exploded high above the United States could create a devastating pulse. If an EMP hit a large part of the United States it would not cause just a temporary power outage.<strong>It could take</strong> months or even <strong>years to get power back to most of the United States</strong>.Electronic equipment and power generating equipment in power plants themselves would be damaged and there will be no way of easily replacing this equipment. Even if the equipment were not damaged the grid could not easily be brought back up. It takes a source of power to bring up modern power plants to put them back on line. <strong>Just bringing up the whole U.S. grid from scratch would take</strong> weeks or <strong>months</strong>. <strong>Even if the blackout were only for weeks, the disruption to the United States would be immense.</strong> In a matter of hours there would be large-scale looting in the major cities and in days there would be riots in all large cities over food and water. Marshal Law would be declared and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would nationalize all police forces and take control over managing the people of the United States. All available military would be following the directives of DHS as well. A major EMP over a large part of the United States would cause all major transportation systems to break down. Most means of communication would not be possible. There would be no TV, little radio, no useable cell phone systems, no Internet system and no food or water distribution other than through the direction of Homeland Security. All essentials would be rationed. Those carrying out the DHS directives would confiscate all known critical supplies. The civil disorder and disruptions that have taken place in New Orleans and southern Mississippi in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina are a small example of what would take place nationwide after an EMP. In that case massive aid from the rest of the nation eased the crisis but after an EMP the whole nation will be coping with the crisis and little aid will be possible. All able bodied manpower in the United States would have to report for assignments directed by Homeland Security. All financial assets would be frozen. There would be no access to any money, the stock market would be closed and the U.S dollar would become near worthless on the world market. For weeks, months, and perhaps years there could be little gross national product in the United States. <strong>The U.S is the largest debtor nation in the world so she would be forced to default on her debt bringing about a massive world depression.</strong> Even after the power was brought back up, it would be likely that much of the electronically controlled infrastructure systems would have to be totally replaced. This could take many years. Meanwhile, financial assets in every category either would become worthless or lose tremendous value. <strong>All financial bubbles will burst.</strong> Likelihood of this threat occurring before A.D 2025? <strong>If significant military action is not taken against Iran and North Korea</strong> (if they do not immediately abandon their nuclear weapons program),<strong>it is</strong> almost <strong>certain that one or more EMP attacks will be attempted</strong><strong>with the likelihood of success being high.</strong> The possibility of a successful EMP attack before 2025 AD would in my opinion be at least a 7 on a scale of 1-10. If Iran and North Korea no longer have nuclear capabilities the likelihood of an attack is then much less at least for a number of years. Pakistan still will be a problem because she has nuclear weapons and a large segment of the population supports terrorism against the United States. It is unlikely that China would want an EMP to happen over the United States as long as she is getting rich exporting to the United States. (The China threat could be the reason the U.S. allows the seemingly insane trade imbalances.) If China no longer needs the U.S. because world demand for their products is more than they are capable of producing and/or if Taiwan becomes a flash point, the likelihood of an EMP attack is again extremely high unless by that time the U.S. has taken major steps to harden the infrastructure against such an attack. If a cold war reemerges with Russia, they also might see a world without the United States as being in their best interest and they also would pose a grave threat to the United States either directly or by supporting Islamic terrorists groups who would use this technology to bring the U.S. to destruction. <strong>Non-state sponsored terrorism will continue to be a threat if they can get hold of a nuclear bomb.</strong> Some reports have indicated that nuclear bombs are available on the black market. I do not know if this is actually the case but experts who have access to intelligence say the possibility of terrorists obtaining a nuke in the next 10 years is better than 50-50.<br />

<strong>Extinction</strong><br />

Then there are the dolorous consequences of a potential collapse of the world's financial architecture. For decades now, Americans have enjoyed the advantages of being at the center of that system. The worldwide use of the dollar, and the stability of our economy, among other things, made it easier for us to run huge budget deficits, as we counted on foreigners to pick up the tab by buying dollar-denominated assets as a safe haven. Will this be possible in the future? Meanwhile, traditional foreign-policy challenges are multiplying. The threat from al Qaeda and Islamic terrorist affiliates has not been extinguished. Iran and North Korea are continuing on their bellicose paths, while Pakistan and Afghanistan are progressing smartly down the road to chaos. Russia's new militancy and China's seemingly relentless rise also give cause for concern. If America now tries to pull back from the world stage, it will leave a dangerous power vacuum. The stabilizing effects of our presence in Asia, our continuing commitment to Europe, and our position as defender of last resort for Middle East energy sources and supply lines could all be placed at risk. In such a scenario there are shades of the 1930s, when global trade and finance ground nearly to a halt, the peaceful democracies failed to cooperate, and aggressive powers led by the remorseless fanatics who rose up on the crest of economic disaster exploited their divisions. Today we run the risk that rogue states may choose to become ever more reckless with their nuclear toys, just at our moment of maximum vulnerability. The aftershocks of the financial crisis will almost certainly rock our principal strategic competitors even harder than they will rock us. The dramatic free fall of the Russian stock market has demonstrated the fragility of a state whose economic performance hinges on high oil prices, now driven down by the global slowdown. China is perhaps even more fragile, its economic growth depending heavily on foreign investment and access to foreign markets. Both will now be constricted, inflicting economic pain and perhaps even sparking unrest in a country where political legitimacy rests on progress in the long march to prosperity. None of this is good news if the authoritarian leaders of these countries seek to divert attention from internal travails with external adventures.<br />

<em>Iran</em> With the benefit of assistance from abroad, including North Korea and Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran has moved forward with its ballistic missile program. Iran has had a demonstrated tactical ballistic missile capability since the 1980s, but in June 2003 it marked a major milestone when it deployed its 1,300-kilometer-range Shahab-3, capable of targeting Israel and Turkey, as well as U.S. forces in the Per­sian Gulf.18 Since then, Iran has begun “mass production” of This work has yielded impor­tant dividends: in September 2007, Iran publicly unveiled a “new” medium-range ballistic missile, the <em>Ghadr-</em>1, at a mil­itary parade in Tehran. This missile, which Iran claims has a range of 1,800 kilometers, appears to be an extended-range variant of the <em>Shahab-</em>3.21 Subsequently, in November 2007, Iran carried out a test of its <em>Ashoura</em> missile, a 2,000-kilo­meter-range solid fuel variant of the <em>Shahab</em>.22 These steps are part of what U.S. officials believe is a growing emphasis in Tehran on the development of an inter­continental ballistic missile capability. As John Rood, then-acting assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation, told Congress in May 2007, “The In­lah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The transfer of the <em>Shahab</em> 3 into the <em>Pasdaran</em>, in lieu of the <em>Artesh</em>, suggests that Ira­nian missile technologies could find their way into terrorist hands as part of Tehran’s ongoing sponsorship of terrorist activities. Intelligence Community assesses that Iran would be able to develop an ICBM capable of reaching the United States and all regions of Europe before 2015 if it chose to do so. And, I would point out that Iran has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea in the past and note the possibility that it could do so again in the future, potentially acquiring mis­siles with even longer ranges.”23 As a result of these advanc­es, it is likely that Iran could field an intercontinental ballis­tic missile by the middle of the next decade.24 Iran may have conducted tests to determine whether its ballistic missiles, notably the <em>Shahab-</em>3 or the <em>Scud</em>, could be detonated by re­mote control while still in flight. The significance of such a capability lies in its potential to launch an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack, discussed later in this section. This effort is closely linked to Iran’s growing interest in space. In October 2005, Iran became the first space nation in the Muslim world when it launched a surveillance satellite on a Russian rocket from Russia’s missile base at Plesetsk.25 Since then, Iran has made great strides toward development of an indigenous space launch capability. In February 2007, it successfully carried out an initial test of a “space rocket” built in Iran.26 A year later unveiled its first space center, with Tehran claiming that it had now “joined the world’s top 11 countries possessing space technology to build satel­lites and launch rockets into space.”27 These advances ampli­fy and expand Iran’s ballistic missile program, since a space-launch vehicle (SLV) is similar in technology and function to the booster on an intercontinental ballistic missile. The threat posed by Iran’s ballistic missile program is closely linked to Tehran’s nuclear effort. Since it was pub­licly exposed by an Iranian opposition group in August 2002, Since December 2007 Iran has built a stockpile of low-enriched uranium hexafloride. According to the IAEA, Iran’s stockpile had reached more than 1000 pounds by August 31, 2008, with monthly production rates of more than 100 pounds. In 2009 this could give Iran at least 1,500 pounds that could be recirculated through its centrifuges to pro­duce the 35 pounds of weapon-grade uranium sufficient for one bomb.31 In April 2008, Iranian president Mahmoud Ah­madinejad disclosed that his government had begun to in­stall another 6,000 centrifuges at the Natanz facility.32 Ira­nian leaders have taken this to be a critical milestone. “The nuclear issue (of Iran) is the most important political devel­opment in contemporary history,” Ahmadinejad announced to supporters at that time. “Iran’s victory in this biggest po­litical battle will lead to new international developments.”33 Thus all indicators point toward the development of an Ira­nian nuclear capability with varying estimates not about <em>whether</em> Iran is doing so, but instead <em>when</em> it will have such weapons. There have also been reports that Iran as well as North Korea, and even terrorist groups, could have benefited from information from the notorious A.Q. Khan proliferation network. In 2006 drawings were discovered on computers owned by Swiss businessmen that included how to build a warhead that could be fitted on an Iranian ballistic missile. Whether these drawings were earlier passed on to Iran is not certain. The nuclear-related documents allegedly included hundreds of pages of specifications for a compact nuclear device that could have been designed for Iran.34<br />

<strong>Iran Israel war causes extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Hirsch 5</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - Professor @ UC San Diego (Jorge, “Can a nuclear strike on Iran be averted,” November 21st,)</span><br />
<br />
The Bush administration has put together all the elements it needs to justify the impending military action against Iran. Unlike in the case of Iraq, it will happen without warning, and most of the justifications will be issued after the fact. We will wake up one day to learn that facilities in Iran have been bombed in a joint U.S.-Israeli attack. It may even take another couple of days for the revelation that some of the U.S. bombs were nuclear. Why a Nuclear Attack on Iran Is a Bad Idea Now that we have outlined what is very close to happening, let us discuss briefly why everything possible should be done to prevent it. In a worst-case scenario, the attack will cause a violent reaction from Iran. Millions of &quot;human wave&quot; Iranian militias will storm into Iraq, and just as Saddam stopped them with chemical weapons, the U.S. will stop them with nuclear weapons, resulting potentially in hundreds of thousands of casualties. The Middle East will explode, and popular uprisings in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and other countries with pro-Western governments could be overtaken by radical regimes. Pakistan already has nuclear weapons, and a nuclear conflict could even lead to Russia's and Israel's involvement using nuclear weapons. In a best-case scenario, the U.S. will destroy all nuclear, chemical, and missile facilities in Iran with conventional and low-yield nuclear weapons in a lightning surprise attack, and Iran will be paralyzed and decide not to retaliate for fear of a vastly more devastating nuclear attack. In the short term, the U.S. will succeed, leaving no Iranian nuclear program, civilian or otherwise. Iran will no longer threaten Israel, a regime change will ensue, and a pro-Western government will emerge. However, even in the best-case scenario, the long-term consequences are dire. The nuclear threshold will have been crossed by a nuclear superpower against a non-nuclear country. Many more countries will rush to get their own nuclear weapons as a deterrent. With no taboo against the use of nuclear weapons, they will certainly be used again. Nuclear conflicts will occur within the next 10 to 20 years, and will escalate until much of the world is destroyed. Let us remember that the destructive power of existing nuclear arsenals is approximately one million times that of the Hiroshima bomb, enough to erase Earth's population many times over.<br />

<span class="text"><u>Those contributing to the growing chorus of antihegemony</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and multipolarity may </span><span class="text"><u>know they are playing a dangerous game,</u> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">one </span><span class="text"><u>that needs to be conducted with the utmost care</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as French leaders did during the Cold War, </span><span class="text"><u>lest the entire international system come crashing down around them.</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> What they may not have adequately calculated, however, is the possibility that Americans will not respond as wisely as they generally did during the Cold War. Americans and their</span><span class="text"><u>leaders should not take all this sophisticated whining about U.S. hegemony too seriously.</u> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">They certainly should not take it more seriously than the whiners themselves do. But, of course, Americans are taking it seriously. In the United States these days, the lugubrious guilt trip of post-Vietnam liberalism is echoed even by conservatives, with William Buckley, Samuel Huntington, and James Schlesinger all decrying American &quot;hubris,&quot; &quot;arrogance,&quot; and &quot;imperialism.&quot; Clinton administration officials, in between speeches exalting America as the &quot;indispensable&quot; nation, increasingly behave as if what is truly indispensable is the prior approval of China, France, and Russia for every military action. Moreover, at another level, there is a stirring of neo-isolationism in America today, a mood that nicely complements the view among many Europeans that America is meddling too much in everyone else's business and taking too little time to mind its own. The existence of the Soviet Union disciplined Americans and made them see that their enlightened self-interest lay in a relatively generous foreign policy. Today, that discipline is no longer present. In other words, foreign grumbling about American hegemony would be merely amusing, were it not for the very real possibility that</span><span class="text"><u>too many Americans will forget</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> — even if most of the rest of the world does not — </span><span class="text"><u>just how important continued American dominance is</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">to the preservation of a reasonable level of international security and prosperity. World leaders may want to keep this in mind when they pop the champagne corks in celebration of the next American humbling.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">Finally, I am angry at those who undermine our efforts to conduct this war. I am angry at </span>people<span class="Underline">, who </span>through their words<span class="Underline">, and efforts </span>contribute to the<span class="Underline"> injury and </span>death of our soldiers<span class="Underline">,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> who provide encouragement to the enemy, who weaken our efforts and prolong the war, who, </span>for political gain<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> put our soldiers, our people, and our nation at greater risk. There is a LOT of anger going on. Many times it is inappropriately acted upon. Islamists are angry, so they blow up people. Conservatives are angry so they advocate indiscriminate retaliation. </span>Liberals are angry<span class="Underline"> so they advocate undermining the war. All </span>this anger is misdirected<span class="Underline">. We can see how the killing of innocents is wrong, but sometimes </span>we cannot see how allowing innocents to be killed is wrong<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. One should seriously consider the impacts of certain types of dissention in this country before embarking on said dissentious course. I have many issues with the war in Iraq, but I will focus on just a couple. When President Bush pronounced to the world that he would defeat terrorism, he made a promise. He promised that he would not only pursue the terrorists wherever they may be, but he promised to go after the countries that enable those terrorists. When the UN made resolution after resolution against Iraq those too were promises. The difference comes in whether one follows up a promise or not. You see, no one embarks on a major undertaking with the expectation of losing. The choices any person or group are almost always predicated on the fact that the reward exceeds the price or risk. </span>Hitler would not have invaded<span class="Underline"> Czechoslovakia </span>unless he thought he could get away with it.<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">He would not have invaded Poland unless he though he could get away with it. The success of those events and reaction of Europe convinced him that he could press on and take all of Europe</span><span class="Underline">. </span>Saddam would not have invaded<span class="Underline"> Kuwait </span>unless he thought he could get away with it<span class="Underline">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">He would not have defied the UN unless he though he could get away with it. In those cases,</span>the acting party decided that they could attain their goals using the methods employed. The same<span class="Underline"> thing </span>goes for the terrorists<span class="Underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> They methods they employ are based on the expectation of ultimate success. The methods they employ are also based on their own capabilities, capabilities that stem from the support of governments both passive and active, the support of moneyed benefactors, and the support of powerful influencers such as media and high profile personalities. This brings me back to promises made. Part of the reason these </span>terrorists became<span class="Underline"> so </span>bold<span class="Underline"> is that </span>there were few significant reprisals for their actions<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. In the same way Hitler moved on Poland and Hussein defied the UN, Al Qaeda flew planes into our buildings. Ultimately it was because they could and that the reprisals had insufficient deterrent effect. Now, when President Bush announced that he would pursue the nations that supported terrorism, he basically set the stage for action. The choice was, rattle the saber and hope it is enough, or draw the saber and demonstrate our commitment to living up to our promises. It is fair to debate whether Iraq was the best choice for an operation, but the stage had also been set there as well. With promises being made at the UN, the choice was to continue to prove that promises meant nothing or to prove that they did. I believe that the lack of consequences in the past was a key factor in the terrorist activity leading up to and including 9/11.</span>Without <span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">the</span>resolve<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">to back up our promises</span><span class="Underline">,</span> our enemies will be emboldened<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">to act. It does not get any simpler than that. Iraq was a promise kept. Now, some people want us to renege on that promise and others. That is a dangerous position to be advocating. The thing is</span><span class="Underline">, </span>the debate about Iraq belongs BEFORE we took action<span class="Underline">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">And</span>that debate DID occur<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. It occurred BEFORE the war. And the result was overwhelmingly in FAVOR of action. The congress granted President Bush the authority to act. The fact that they did not like his decision is moot. If they did not trust his ability to act, they were wrong to have given him the authority to do so. </span>NOW they are wrong for challenging his decision<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> after the fact. That brings us back to the concept of one's expectation of the results of one's actions. In many cases throughout history, the winner of a conflict was not always the one with the bigger army, the better equipment, and the best trained, or any of those factors. The winner quite often was the one with the greater will to win. Wars are won by will in far greater weight then in anything else. I would say that will is THE determining factor in success in any conflict. Obviously will is not enough. A greater force can sap the will of another army, but not always. The revolutionary war was won by will, not by military might. Vietnam was lost by will not by military might. And, Iraq will be won or lost by will alone</span><span class="Underline">. </span>The consequences of this outcome will have<br />
long lasting impacts on the security of our nation<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. At this point, it does not matter whether we should have gone into Iraq. The fact is we are there now. We either complete the job and fulfill our promises to rebuild that nation and leave it with a stable and free society or we cut and run and have the world know with certainty that our word is null and void and that we have no resolve. That is the stakes. That is the goal of the terrorists: to prove they have resolve, to prove that we do not. Their victory will ensure increased attacks on all nations because the terrorists will have unimpeachable proof that their tactics will ultimately succeed. Bombings, beheadings, gross atrocities will be the weapons of choice in the future. Tactics that have been proven to bring down the mighty. If will is the factor that determines the outcome, then will is the place where we must consider here and now. As far as our enemy is concerned, we MUST make them believe that they cannot succeed. </span>We MUST make them sure that WE will prevail. We MUST prove to them that their tactics are ineffectua<span class="Underline">l</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. There is a down side to that. Once an enemy realizes their tactics are not succeeding, they will change them. With an enemy of this nature, that could result in greater atrocities than we have yet seen. Yet, even then we must prevail. We must continue to demonstrate OUR resolve and OUR willingness to see this to the end and DEFEAT them. Since they have shown little regard for decency and life, since they have shown that our very existence is provocation to them, </span>no amount of<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> diplomacy or </span>concessions will achieve an end satisfactory to our nation<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. The only solution is the demonstration of our willingness to defeat them despite their tactics. Our goal is to defeat the will of the enemy. His goal is to defeat ours. Any indication that the enemy's will is faltering will bolster our own will. However, the opposite is true as well. </span>Any indication that our will is faltering will embolden the enemy's will<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. Unfortunately, from the very first minute of this conflict, parts of our country have shouted from the very mountain tops just how little will they have to win the war. They demonstrate clearly for our enemies that we don't want to fight. They give clear indication that enemy tactics are successful. In effect, they give aid and comfort to the enemy and spur them on to continued fighting because they tell the enemy in clear messages that if they continue in their tactics, the United States will be defeated. As I said before, the debate about whether we go to war is over. We are now at war, and the ONLY debate we should have is on what tactics are most appropriate for prosecuting that war. It is marginally fair to state that you are unhappy about our decision to go to war, but beyond that, anything else will embolden the enemy. Think very long and about what is at stake here. </span>It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to be pro America while actively dissenting on ongoing conflict.<span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> It is bordering on treason for a public official to undermine the war effort, the Commander in Chief and the military publicly for all the world to see. We have started down this path, and there are but two choices: to win or to lose. There is no &quot;suing for peace&quot; with this enemy. Now, that does not mean you have to become militaristic and be a war monger. You can be a peacenik, but you need to consider that unless you want to see the United States harmed, you should cease criticism of the war itself until after it is won. There is plenty of time to castigate the people who made what you perceive as errors AFTER we have finished the job. However, if you persist in presenting disunity and a weakened resolve to the enemy, you take direct responsibility for the lives of all Americans, Iraqis and foreign terrorists that will die subsequently. The quickest way to end the war is to be united, to demonstrate unshakable resolve, and to have the enemy surrender. Or, YOU can surrender to the enemy. Anything else will just prolong the killing. This goes infinitely more so for our public leaders. What they do for political gain is completely unconscionable.</span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">Vote negative to endorse US hegemony – Retreat from primacy magnifies every international problem and escalates conflict</span></strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">Thayer 2006</span></strong></span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> – </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">PhD, professor of security studies at Missouri State, Fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard (Bradley, The National Interest, “In defense of primacy”)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">THROUGHOUT HISTORY, peace and stability have been great benefits of an era where there was a dominant power</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">--Rome, Britain or the United States today.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">Scholars and statesmen have long recognized the irenic effect of power on the anarchic world of international politics. Everything we think of when we consider the current international order--free trade</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a robust monetary regime, increasing</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">respect for human rights, growing democratization--is directly linked to U.S. power. Retrenchment proponents seem to think that the current system can be maintained without the current amount of U.S. power behind it</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In that</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">they are dead wrong</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and need to be reminded of one of history's most significant lessons:</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Appalling things happen when international orders collapse. The Dark Ages followed Rome's collapse. Hitler succeeded the order established at Versailles</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Without U.S. power, the liberal order created by the United States will end just as assuredly. As country and western great Ral Donner sang: &quot;You don't know what you've got (until you lose it).&quot; Consequently, it is important to note what those good things are. In addition to ensuring the security of the United States and its allies, American primacy within the international system causes many positive outcomes for Washington and the world. The first has been a more peaceful world. During the Cold War, U.S. leadership reduced friction among many states that were historical antagonists, most notably France and West Germany. Today,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">American primacy helps keep a number of complicated relationships aligned--between Greece and Turkey, Israel and Egypt, South Korea and Japan, India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.This is not to say it fulfills Woodrow Wilson's vision of ending all war.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Wars still occur</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">where Washington's interests are not seriously threatened, such as in Darfur,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">but a Pax Americana does reduce war's likelihood, particularly</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">war's worst form: </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">great power wars</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Second, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">American power gives the United States the ability to spread democracy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and other elements of its ideology of liberalism: Doing so is a source of much good for the countries concerned as well as the United States because, as John Owen noted on these pages in the Spring 2006 issue, liberal democracies are more likely to align with the United States and be sympathetic to the American worldview.( n3) So, spreading democracy helps maintain U.S. primacy. In addition,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">once states are governed democratically, the likelihood of any type of conflict is significantly reduced</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.This is not because democracies do not have clashing interests. Indeed they do. Rather, itis</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">because they are more open, more transparent and more likely to want to resolve things amicably in concurrence with U.S. leadership</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And so, in general, democratic states are good for their citizens as well as for advancing the interests of the United States. Critics have faulted the Bush Administration for attempting to spread democracy in the Middle East, labeling such aft effort a modern form of tilting at windmills. It is the obligation of Bush's critics to explain why :democracy is good enough for Western states but not for the rest, and, one gathers from the argument, should not even be attempted. Of course, whether democracy in the Middle East will have a peaceful or stabilizing influence on America's interests in the short run is open to question. Perhaps democratic Arab states would be more opposed to Israel, but nonetheless, their people would be better off. The United States has brought democracy to Afghanistan, where 8.5 million Afghans, 40 percent of </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">them women, voted in a critical October 2004 election, even though remnant Taliban forces threatened them. The first free elections were held in Iraq in January 2005. It was the military power of the United States that put Iraq on the path to democracy. Washington fostered democratic governments in Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Caucasus. Now even the Middle East is increasingly democratic. They may not yet look like Western-style democracies, but democratic progress has been made in Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Iraq, Kuwait, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">By all accounts, the march of democracy has been impressive</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Third, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">along with the growth in the number of democratic states around the world has been the growth of the global economy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. With its allies,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the United States has labored to create an economically liberal worldwide network characterized by free trade and commerce, respect for international property rights, and mobility of capital and labor markets. The economic stability and prosperity that stems from this economic order is a global public good from which all states benefit, particularly the poorest states in the Third World</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The United States created this network not out of altruism but for the benefit and the economic well-being of America. This economic order forces American industries to be competitive, maximizes efficiencies and growth, and benefits defense as well because the size of the economy makes the defense burden manageable.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Economic spin-offs foster the development of military technology, helping to ensure military prowess</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Perhaps the greatest testament to the benefits of the economic network comes from Deepak Lal, a former Indian foreign service diplomat and researcher at the World Bank, who started his career confident in the socialist ideology of post-independence India. Abandoning the positions of his youth, Lal now recognizes that the only way to bring relief to desperately poor countries of the Third World is through the adoption of free market economic policies and globalization, which are facilitated through American primacy.( n4) As a witness to the failed alternative economic systems, Lal is one of the strongest academic proponents of American primacy due to the economic prosperity it provides. Fourth and finally, the United States, in seeking primacy, has been willing to use its power not only to advance its interests but to promote the welfare of people all over the globe.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The United States is the earth's leading source of positive externalities for the world</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The U.S. military has participated in over fifty operations since the end of the Cold War--and most of those missions have been humanitarian in nature. Indeed,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the U.S. military is the earth's &quot;911 force&quot;--it serves, de facto, as the world's police, the global paramedic and the planet's fire department. Whenever there is a natural disaster, earthquake, flood, drought, volcanic eruption, typhoon or tsunami, the United States assists the countries in need</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. On the day after Christmas in 2004, a tremendous earthquake and tsunami occurred in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, killing some 300,000 people. The United States was the first to respond with aid. Washington followed up with a large contribution of aid and deployed the U.S. military to South and Southeast Asia for many months to help with the aftermath of the disaster. About 20,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines responded by providing water, food, medical aid, disease treatment and prevention as well as forensic assistance to help identify the bodies of those killed. Only the U.S. military could have accomplished this Herculean effort.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">No other force possesses the communications capabilities or global logistical reach of the U.S. military</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In fact, UN peacekeeping operations depend on the United States to supply UN forces.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">American generosity has done more to help the United States fight the War on Terror than almost any other measure</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Before the tsunami, 80 percent of Indonesian public opinion was opposed to the United States; after it, 80 percent had a favorable opinion of America. Two years after the disaster, and in poll after poll, Indonesians still have overwhelmingly positive views of the United States. In October 2005, an enormous earthquake struck Kashmir, killing about 74 000 people and leaving three million homeless. The U.S. military responded immediately, diverting helicopters fighting the War on Terror in nearby Afghanistan to bring relief as soon as possible To help those in need, the United States also provided financial aid to Pakistan; and, as one might expect from those witnessing the munificence of the United States, it left a lasting impression about America. For the first time since 9/11, polls of Pakistani opinion have found that more people are favorable toward the United States than unfavorable, while support for Al-Qaeda dropped to its lowest level. Whether in Indonesia or Kashmir, the money was well-spent because it helped people in the wake of disasters, but it also had a real impact on the War on Terror. When people in the Muslim world witness the U.S. military conducting a humanitarian mission, there is a clearly positive impact on Muslim opinion of the United States.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">As the War on Terror is a war of ideas and opinion as much as military action, for the United States humanitarian missions are the equivalent of a blitzkrieg</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Those talks led to an array of cooperative ventures, from weather data exchanges to the docking detente of Apollo-Soyuz in 1975, setting the stage for working together on the International Space Station project. Defuse possible tensions </span><u>&quot;China civil space plans are ambitious and inevitable,&quot; s</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">aid Joseph Fuller, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of the Futron Corporation based in Bethesda, Maryland. &quot;</span><u>It is not a question of if, but when</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For the U.S. exploration vision to succeed on a grand scale, it must include China, India, Russia and other space faring nations,&quot; he said. &quot;Substantial collaboration already exists in business and economics,&quot; Fuller said, &quot;why not civil space?&quot; As China expands its automated and human spaceflight abilities, how best should the United States look upon this blossoming work--from a military/civilian perspective? Denying NASA and U.S. space commercial vendors </span><u>the right to work with China is a political,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not a security </span><u>issue,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> said James Clay Moltz, Deputy Director, Center for Nonproliferation Studies and Professor of International Policy Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California. &quot;Space station technologies are available from other suppliers and are unlikely to lead to any meaningful military advantages,&quot; Moltz explained. &quot;On the other hand, forcing China to develop its own space station with Russian or other partners simply sets up a possible competitor where there doesn't need to be one.&quot; Moltz told SPACE.com that cooperating with China would defuse possible tensions, promote cost-savings for NASA, and level the playing field for U.S. companies. The United States should continue to hold China to account for human rights violations and other problems, but not hold space hostage. &quot;It's simply not in U.S. interests,&quot; he said. Elite club of countries Given success in the human spaceflight arena, Luo of CNSA said that his country intends to orbit its own space lab by 2015. Leading up to this effort, he added, Chinese astronauts are to carry out space walks, with rendezvous and space docking skills also to be demonstrated in coming years. China carried out its first human space voyage into Earth orbit in October 2003. That less-than-a-day flight catapulted China into an elite club of countries that has this independent space ability, following the former Soviet Union in 1961 and the United States in 1962. Last year, China sent a two-person crew into orbit on a five-day mission, substantially shaking out their Shenzhou spaceship. During his U.S. travels--including a stopover at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland--Luo said his country will send a first robotic probe to the Moon next year, make a soft-landing of a robotic rover on the Moon in 2012, and conduct an automated lunar sample return effort in 2017. There was no direct mention by Luo of dispatching a crew to the Moon--or any timetable for such a feat--other than stating that he thought China will also consider the possibility of a manned mission to the Moon. Lunar desires &quot;I happen to believe that their goal is to get to the Moon and that their schedule is probably more ambitious than ours is,&quot; said former Congressman Robert Walker and now chairman of Wexler &amp; Walker Public Policy Associates in Washington, D.C. Walker also chaired the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry and was a member of the Presidential Commission on the Implementation of the United States Space Exploration Policy. </span><u>China's lunar desires will be seen by some people as a very direct challenge</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Walker said, &quot;but for the Chinese it will simply establish respect for their science and technology programs, which will then allow them, perhaps, to command a bigger price for a lot of their products in the world market.&quot; Walker told SPACE.com that China's growing space prowess is &quot;a very strategic kind of concept for them,&quot; adding: &quot;If we are going to be competitive in a world environment we need to respect and do our job of anticipating and responding.&quot; More assurances needed In terms of working with China on space matters, Walker said there is need for &quot;more assurances&quot; than the U.S. presently has about the Chinese willingness to respect technology, copyrights and patents. &quot;We have challenges with the Chinese at the present time because the rule of law sometimes means different things to them than it means to us,&quot; Walker added. &quot;We're trying to work that out through World Trade Organization arrangements and hopefully some day we will.&quot; Walker said that U.S.-China space cooperation should be very carefully measured. </span><u>There is need to assure that the United States, he said, doesn't end up giving China technology that challenges, and possibly exceeds, American space expertise. Leadership in space technology is a very important part of the United States being competitive in the 21st century, Walker said. &quot;We do not want to easily give up the technology that allows us to stay in the lead.&quot; Most Americans think that the United States is so far ahead in the space arena that no one will ever catch us, Walker concluded. &quot;In my view, that's a mistake to believe that...because there are people with ambitions that rival our own.&quot;</u><br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">We face this domestic challenge while </span><u>other major powers are experiencing rapid economic growth. Even though countries such as China, India, and Brazil have profound political, social, demographic, and economic problems, their economies are growing faster than ours, and this could alter the global distribution of power. These trends could</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in the long term </span><u>produce a multi-polar world. If U.S. policymakers fail to act and other powers continue to grow, it is not a question of whether but when a new international order will emerge. The closing of the gap between the United States and its rivals could intensify geopolitical competition among major powers, increase incentives for local powers to play major powers against one another, and undercut our will to preclude or respond to international crises because of the higher risk of escalation.</u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">The stakes are high. In modern history, </span><u>the longest period of peace among the great powers has been the era of U.S. leadership</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. By contrast, </span><u>multi-polar systems have been unstable, with their competitive dynamics resulting in frequent crises and major wars among the great powers. Failures of multi-polar international systems produced both world wars.</u><u>American retrenchment could have devastating consequences</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Without an American security blanket, </span><u>regional powers could rearm in an attempt to balance against emerging threats</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Under this scenario, </span><u>there would be a heightened possibility of arms races,</u><u>miscalculation, or other crises spiraling into all-out conflict</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Alternatively, </span><u>in seeking to accommodate the stronger powers, weaker powers may shift their geopolitical posture away from the United States.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Either way, </span><u>hostile states would be emboldened to make aggressive moves</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in their regions. </span><u>As rival powers rise, Asia in particular is likely to emerge as a zone of great-power competition. Beijing’s economic rise has enabled a dramatic military buildup</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> focused on acquisitions of naval, cruise, and ballistic missiles, long-range stealth aircraft, and anti-satellite capabilities. China’s strategic modernization is aimed, ultimately, at denying the United States access to the seas around China. Even as cooperative economic ties in the region have grown, </span><u>China’s expansive territorial claims</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> — and provocative statements and actions following crises in Korea and incidents at sea — </span><u>have roiled its relations with South Korea, Japan, India, and Southeast Asian states.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Still, </span><u>the United States is the most significant barrier facing Chinese hegemony and aggression</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Given the risks, </span><u>the United States must focus on restoring its economic</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and fiscal </span><u>condition while checking and managing the rise of potential adversarial regional powers such as China. While we face significant challenges, the U.S. economy still accounts for over 20 percent of the world’s GDP. American institutions</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> — particularly those providing enforceable rule of law — set it apart from all the rising powers. Social cohesion underwrites political stability. U.S. demographic trends are healthier than those of any other developed country. </span><u>A culture of innovation, excellent institutions of higher education, and a vital sector of small and medium-sized enterprises propel the U.S. economy in ways difficult to quantify.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Historically, </span><u>Americans have responded pragmatically, and sometimes through trial and error, to work our way through the kind of crisis that we face today.</u><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Two Chinese journalists were supposed to watch the U.S. space shuttle Endeavour take off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in mid-May. The shuttle was using the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer-2 particle detector, a component developed by Chinese scientist Samuel Ting, and their story would have made useful provender for China’s state media apparatus. But they were turned away at the gates. Their employer, Xinhua, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), went into high dudgeon. A scornful editorial made no bones about the man and the law responsible: </span><span class="Underline">“‘</span>Wolf Clause’ betrays China-U.S. cooperation<span class="Underline">,” </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the headline read.</span><span class="Underline"> It was the doing of </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Rep. Frank</span><span class="Underline"> Wolf, a long-term critic of the CCP, after he became chairman of the House Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in January. </span><span class="Underline">The language he inserted into the spending bill</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for those agencies in April </span><span class="Underline">prevents NASA and the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The agencies are not allowed </span><span class="Underline">to “develop, design, plan, promulgate, implement, or execute a bilateral policy, program, order, or contract of any kind to participate, collaborate, or coordinate bilaterally in any way with China</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or any Chinese-owned company.” Additionally, </span><span class="Underline">it prevents NASA from hosting &quot;official Chinese visitors</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; “I think the Chinese are shocked,” said one of Wolf’s staffer’s in a telephone interview, responding to the Xinhua counterattack. “They're so used to the administration caving to them and bending over backward. I think they’re truly taken aback that this policy was put in place.” </span>The clause ispart of a larger debate about how the U<span class="Underline">nited </span>S<span class="Underline">tates </span>should deal with a Chinese<span class="Underline"> communist </span>regime t<span class="Underline">hat, while gathering ever more global clout, engages in state sanctioned human rights abuses, technology theft, and persistent cyber warfare against the U.S. government and American companies. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">While none of that is new to Rep. Frank Wolf, </span>the straw that broke the camel’s back was the suggestion<span class="Underline"> by the Obama administration</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—first made when the president went to Beijing in November 2009, and reiterated when Chairman of the Communist Party Hu Jintao visited Washington in January—</span>that the U<span class="Underline">nited </span>S<span class="Underline">tates </span>cooperate with China in<span class="Underline"> human </span>spac<span class="Underline">e flight.The scope of the cooperation would have extended to “hands-on, bilateral, human space flight technology sharing, training sharing, and critical national secrets or expertise, giving that to the Chinese,” according to Wolf’s staff member</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, who was not authorized to speak publicly. “</span><span class="Underline">We look at this and say: 'How does that administration not get this?'” Wolf made his position clear in his testimony</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to the U.S.-China Commission in May: “</span><span class="Underline">The U.S. has no business cooperating with the PLA to help develop its space program.” Cooperation with China on human space flight, would, according to </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Richard </span><span class="Underline">Fisher</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, an analyst and author on the Chinese military, “In essence .. </span><span class="Underline">constitute </span>a free transfer of technology<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) leads China’s space efforts, and there is no real difference between China’s military and civil space programs, experts say. </span><span class="Underline">Wolf</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> thus </span><span class="Underline">asserts, “There is no reason to believe that the PLA’s space program will be any more benign than the PLA’s recent military posture</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” </span><span class="Underline">His clause to combat this cooperative venture and others like it was passed as part of the budget negotiations,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and is valid until Sept. 30.

Though the area of acute concern was human space flight cooperation, </span>Wolf made the language<span class="Underline"> cover OSTP as well “</span>to send a signal to the White House<span class="Underline"> and NASA” </span>that “this is unacceptable<span class="Underline">,”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> according to Wolf’s staffer. “</span>To engage China<span class="Underline"> increasingly in bilateral areas </span>is not appropriate<span class="Underline"> until we see some changes in China,” the staffer added. </span>The administration and Congresshave locked horns on the<span class="Underline"> issue already, and they may do so again</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

Biden, who arrived in Tokyo on Monday night, is visiting Japan for the first time since he assumed the vice presidency. He is scheduled to leave Japan on Wednesday</span><span class="Underline">. To describe the two countries' strong relationship, Biden cited a joint statement they issued at a meeting of the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee, known as the two-plus-two security talks of foreign and defense ministers</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in June</span><span class="Underline">. The statement called for defense cooperation in missile defense technology transfer and realignment of U.S. forces in Okinawa</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Prefecture. As for a new Japan-U.S. joint declaration that the two countries have agreed to issue on the 50th anniversary of the revised Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, Biden did not elaborate, apparently in consideration of Japan's current political confusion. Biden only said, &quot;I would reiterate that, statement or not, </span><span class="Underline"><strong>our ties are real and they are strong</strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; Meanwhile, Biden said the </span><span class="Underline">United States will continue to extend support to Japan's recovery and reconstruction</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from the March 11 disaster </span><span class="Underline">through measures such as the so-called Tomodachi Fund,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in which the governments and business circles of the two nations will join hands to invest in disaster-hit areas. &quot;Japan is back in business but </span>there is still work to be done<span class="Underline">, and the U.S. will be there to help, including through public-private partnerships,&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Biden said. </span></em><br />

<span class="Underline">Beyond the bilateral difficulties of cooperating with the PRC, it is also important to consider potential ramifications of Sino-US cooperation in space on the Asian political landscape</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Underline">In particular, </span>cooperation between Washington and Beijing on space issues may<span class="Underline"> well </span>arouse concerns in Tokyo and Delhi<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Both of these nations have their own space programs, and while they are arguably not engaged in a “space race” with China (or each other), they are certainly keeping a close eye on developments regarding China. </span><span class="Underline">Of particular importance is Japan. The United States relationship with Japan is arguably its most important in East Asia.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> US interest in Japan should be selfevident. Japan hosts 47,000 US troops and is the linchpin for forward US presence in that hemisphere. Japan is the second largest contributor to all major international organizations that buttress US foreign policy…. </span>Japan is the bulwark for US<span class="Underline"> deterrence and </span>engagement of China<span class="Underline"> and North Korea</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—the reason why those countries cannot assume that the United States will eventually withdraw from the region. 35 For Japan, whose “peace constitution” forbids it from using war as an instrument of state policy, the United States is an essential guarantor of its security. </span><span class="Underline"><strong>Any move by the US that might undermine this view raises not only the prospect of weakening US-Japanese ties, but also potentially affecting Japan’s security policies</strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Underline">In this regard, then, </span>it is essentialnot to engage in activities that would undercut perceptions of American reliability<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Such moves, it should be noted, are not limited to those in the security realm. For example, the Nixon administration undertook several initiatives in the late 1960s and early 1970s that rocked Tokyo-Washington relations, and are still remembered as the “Nixon shocks.” While some of these were in the realm of security (including Nixon’s opening to China and the promulgation of the Nixon Doctrine), the others were in the trade area. These included a ten percent surcharge on all imports entering the US and suspended the convertibility of the dollar (i.e., removed the US from the gold standard). 36 Part of the “shock” was the fundamental nature of these shifts. </span><span class="Underline">Even more damaging, however, was the failure of the Nixon Administration to consult their Japanese counterparts, catching them wholly off-guard</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It </span><span class="Underline">took several years for the effects of these shocks to wear off</span>. If theU<span class="Underline">nited </span>S<span class="Underline">tates </span>is intent<span class="Underline"> up</span>on expanding space relations with the PRC<span class="Underline">, then </span>it would behoove it to consult Japan<span class="Underline">, in order </span>to minimize<span class="Underline"> the prospect of </span>a “space shock<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” </span><span class="Underline"><strong>Failing to do so may well incur a Japanese reaction.</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The decision on the part of Japan to build an explicitly intelligence-focused satellite was in response to the North Korean missile test of 1999, suggesting that Tokyo is fully capable of undertaking space-oriented responses when it is concerned. 37 </span><span class="Underline">That, in turn, would potentially arouse the ire of China</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Underline">The tragic history of Sino-Japanese relations continues to cast a baleful influence upon current interactions between the two states. </span>If there is not a “space race” currently underwaybetween Beijing and Tokyo, it would be<span class="Underline"> most </span>unfortunate if American actions<span class="Underline"> were to </span>precipitate one<span class="Underline">.</span><br />

When China conducted provocative missile tests in the waters around Taiwan in 1996, the United States sent two aircraft carrier groups into nearby waters as a sign of its disapproval of China's belligerent act.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">THE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO THE high-intensity scenario postulates </span><u>a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> far and near </span><u>and</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- horror of horrors -- </span><u>raise the possibility of a <strong>nuclear war</strong>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the </span><strong>region</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. </span><u>If China were to retaliate, east Asia willbe set on fire</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And </span><u>the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, </span><u>hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? </span><u>According to General</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Matthew </span><u>Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at the time </span><u>thought of using nuclear weapons against China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -- truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. </span><u>If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The US estimates that </span><u>China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A </span><u>Chinese military officer disclosed</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> recently </span><u>that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, </span><u>there were strong pressures from the military to drop it.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> He said </span><u>military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, </span><u>we would see the destruction of civilization</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><u>There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a<strong>nuclear Armageddon</strong> over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else.</u><br />

<u>Potentially further complicating this situation is India.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> With a burgeoning space program, </span><u>India constitutes yet another participant in a potential Asian space race</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Fueled by a growing economy, India has steadily improved its space capabilities, launching the Chandrayaan-1 lunar probe in 2008, soon after the Japanese Kaguya and Chinese Chang’e-1 probes. Again, this is not to suggest that there is a space race underway, but it would be hard to deny that the major Asian powers are each watching the others carefully (or, more accurately, that </span><u>China is being watched carefully by its neighbors</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">). That </span><u>space is a major potential arena for competition among these states</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is highlighted by the Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation Between Japan and India, initialed by the Japanese and Indian Prime Ministers on October 22, 2008 in Tokyo. The final “mechanism of cooperation” listed in the agreement was for cooperation between the two nations’ space programs. “Cooperation will be conducted between the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in the field of disaster management.”38 </span><u>For the United States, cooperating with China on space issues, when it is not yet doing so with India, could well send mixed messages to Delhi.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In particular, there is a perception in many quarters that the United States is intent upon balancing China through India.39 US space cooperation with China might allay such concerns and signal that the US is not seeking to counter China through India.</span> <u>It might,</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">however,</span> <u>be seen as “double-dealing” by the Indian government, which has its own concerns about China</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">stemming to at least the 1962 Sino-Indian War. </span><br />

<u>Failure to contain proliferation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in Pyongyang </span><u>could spread nuclear fever throughout Asia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span> <u>Japan and South Korea</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">might</span> <u>seek nuclear weapons and missile defenses.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> A pentagonal configuration of </span><u>nuclear powers in the Pacific</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> basis (Russia, China, Japan, and the two Koreas – not including the United States, with its own Pacific interests) </span><u>could put deterrence at risk and create enormous temptation toward nuclear preemption.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Apart from actual use or threat of use, </span><u>North Korea could exploit the mere existence of an assumed nuclear capability in order to support its coercive diplomacy.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As George H. Quester has noted: If the Pyongyang regime plays its cards sensibly and well, therefore, the world will not see its nuclear weapons being used against Japan or South Korea or anyone else, but will rather see this new nuclear arsenal held in reserve (just as the putative Israeli nuclear arsenal has been held in reserve), as a deterrent against the outside world’s applying maximal pressure on Pyongyang and as a bargaining chip to extract the economic and political concessions that the DPRK needs if it wishes to avoid giving up its peculiar approach to social engineering. </span><u>A five-sided nuclear competition in the Pacific would be linked,</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in geopolitical deterrence and proliferation space, </span><u>to the existing nuclear deterrents in India and Pakistan, and to the emerging nuclear weapons status of Iran.</u><u>An arc of nuclear instability from Tehran to Tokyo could place U.S. proliferation strategies into the ash heap of history and call for more drastic military options, not excluding preemptive war</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, defenses, and counter-deterrent special operations. In addition, </span><u>an eight-sided nuclear arms race in Asia would increase the likelihood of accidental or inadvertent nuclear war</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">In this chapter and in the six preceding chapters I have </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">examined a number of structures and factors which have some connection with the war system</span><span class="Underline">. </span>There is much more that could be said about<span style="font-size: 8pt;">any one of these structures, and</span>other factors which could be examined<span class="Underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Here I wish to note one important point: </span>attention should not be focussed on one single factor to the exclusion of others.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is often done for example by some Marxists who look only at capitalism as a root of war and other social problems, and by some feminists who attribute most problems to patriarchy. The danger of </span>monocausal explanations<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> is that they may </span>lead to an inadequate political practice. The ‘revolution’ may be followed by the persistence or even expansion of many problems which were not addressed by the single-factor perspective.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The one connecting feature which I perceive in the structures underlying war is an unequal distribution of power. This unequal distribution is socially organised in many different ways, such as in the large-scale structures for state administration, in capitalist ownership, in male domination within families and elsewhere, in control over knowledge by experts, and in the use of force by the military. Furthermore, these different systems of power are interconnected. They often support each other, and sometimes conflict. This means that the struggle against war can and must be undertaken at many different levels. It ranges from struggles to undermine state power to struggles to undermine racism, sexism and other forms of domination at the level of the individual and the local community. Furthermore, the different struggles need to be linked together. That is the motivation for analysing the roots of war and developing strategies for grassroots movements to uproot them</span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><u>While theoretical debates</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at academic conferences </span><u>are important to academics, the discourse and concerns of</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> foreign-policy </span><u>decisionmakers are</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> quite different, </span><u>so different that they constitute a distinctive</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> problemsolving, theory-averse, </span><u>policy-making subculture</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. There is a danger that </span><u>academics assume that the discourses they engage are more significant</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the practice of foreign policy and the exercise of power than they really are. This is not, however, to minimize the obvious importance of academia as a general institutional structure among many that sustain certain epistemic communities in particular states. In general, I do not disagree with Dalby’s fourth point about politics and discourse except to note that his statement-‘Precisely because reality could be represented in particular ways political decisions could be taken, troops and material moved and war fought’-evades the important question of agency that I noted in my review essay. </span><u>The assumption that</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> it is </span><u>representations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span><u>make action possible is inadequate</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by itself. </span><u>Political, military and economic</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> structures, </span><u>institutions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, discursive networks and leadership </span><u>are</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> all </span><u>crucial</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in explaining social action and should be theorized together with representational practices. Both here and earlier, Dalby’s reasoning inclines towards a form of idealism. In response to Dalby’s fifth point (with its three subpoints), it is worth noting, first, that his book is about the CPD, not the Reagan administration. He analyzes certain CPD discourses, root the geographical reasoning practices of the Reagan administration nor its public-policy reasoning on national security. Dalby’s book is narrowly textual; the general contextuality of the Reagan administration is not dealt with. Second, let me simply note that I find that the distinction between critical theorists and poststructuralists is a little too rigidly and heroically drawn by Dalby and others. Third, Dalby’s interpretation of the reconceptualization of national security in Moscow as heavily influenced by dissident peace researchers in Europe is highly idealist, an interpretation that ignores the structural and ideological crises facing the Soviet elite at that time. Gorbachev’s reforms and his new security discourse were also strongly selfinterested, an ultimately futile attempt to save the Communist Party and a discredited regime of power from disintegration. The issues raised by Simon Dalby in his comment are important ones for all those interested in the practice of critical geopolitics. While I agree with Dalby that questions of discourse are extremely important ones for political geographers to engage, there is a danger of </span><u>fetishizing</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> this </span><u>concern with discourse</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> so that we </span><u>neglect</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><u>institutional</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and the </span><u>sociological</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the materialist and the </span><u>cultural</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the </span><u>political and</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><u>geographical contexts within which</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> particular </span><u>discursive strategies become significant</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Critical geopolitics, in other words, should not be a prisoner of the sweeping ahistorical cant that sometimes accompanies ‘poststructuralism nor convenient reading strategies like the identity politics narrative; it needs to always be open to the patterned mess that is human history. </span></span><br />

A focus on representations destroys social change by ignoring political and material constraints<br />
<strong>Taft-Kaufman, 95</strong> (Jill, professor, Department of Speech Communication And Dramatic Arts, atCentralMichiganUniversity, Southern Communication Journal, Spring, proquest)<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The postmodern passwords of &quot;polyvocality,&quot; &quot;Otherness,&quot; and &quot;difference,&quot; unsupported by substantial analysis of the concrete contexts of subjects, creates a solipsistic quagmire. The political sympathies of the new cultural critics, with their ostensible concern for the lack of power experienced by marginalized people, aligns them with the political left. Yet,</span> <u>despite their adversarial posture and talk of opposition, their discourses on intertextuality and inter-referentiality isolate them from and ignore the conditions that have produced leftist politics</u>--<span style="font-size: 6pt;">conflict, racism, poverty, and injustice. In short, as Clarke (1991) asserts, postmodern emphasis on new subjects conceals the old subjects, those who have limited access to good jobs, food, housing, health care, and transportation, as well as to the media that depict them. Merod (1987) decries this situation as one which leaves no vision, will, or commitment to activism. He notes that academic lip service to the oppositional is underscored by the absence of focused collective or politically active intellectual communities. Provoked by the academic manifestations of this problem Di Leonardo (1990) echoes Merod and laments: Has there ever been a historical era characterized by as little radical analysis or activism and as much radical-chic writing as ours? Maundering on about Otherness: phallocentrism or Eurocentric tropes has become a lazy academic substitute for actual engagement with the detailed histories and contemporary realities of Western racial minorities, white women, or any Third World population. (p. 530) Clarke's assessment of the postmodern elevation of language to the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of critical discussion is an even stronger indictment against the trend. Clarke examines Lyotard's (1984) The Postmodern Condition in which Lyotard maintains that virtually all social relations are linguistic, and, therefore, it is through the coercion that threatens speech that we enter the &quot;realm of terror&quot; and society falls apart. To this assertion, Clarke replies:</span> <u>I can think of few more striking indicators of the political and intellectual impoverishment of a view of society that can only recognize the discursive.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">If the worst terror we can envisage is the threat not to be allowed to speak, we are appallingly ignorant of terror in its elaborate contemporary forms. It may be the intellectual's conception of terror (what else do we do but speak?), but its projection onto the rest of the world would be calamitous....(pp. 2-27) The realm of the discursive is derived from the requisites for human life, which are in the physical world, rather than in a world of ideas or symbols.(4) Nutrition, shelter, and protection a</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">re basic human needs that require collective activity for their fulfillment. Postmodern emphasis on the discursive without an accompanying analysis of how the discursive emerges from material circumstances hides the complex task of envisioning and working towards concrete social goals (Merod, 1987). Although the material conditions that create the situation of marginality escape the purview of the postmodernist, the situation and its consequences are not overlooked by scholars from marginalized groups. Robinson (1990) for example, argues that &quot;the justice that working people deserve is economic, not just textual&quot; (p. 571). Lopez (1992) states that &quot;the starting point for organizing the program content of education or political action must be the present existential, concrete situation&quot; (p. 299). West (1988) asserts that borrowing French post-structuralist discourses about &quot;Otherness&quot; blinds us to realities of American difference going on in front of us (p. 170). Unlike postmodern &quot;textual radicals&quot; who Rabinow (1986) acknowledges are &quot;fuzzy about power and the realities of socioeconomic constraints&quot; (p. 255), most writers from marginalized groups are clear about how discourse interweaves with the concrete circumstances that create lived experience. People whose lives form the material for postmodern counter-hegemonic discourse do not share the optimism over the new recognition of their discursive subjectivities, because such an acknowledgment does not address sufficiently their collective historical and current struggles against racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic injustice</span>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">They do not appreciate being told they are living in a world in which there are no more real subjects. Ideas have consequences.</span> <u>Emphasizing the discursive self when a person is hungry and homeless represents both a cultural and humane failure</u>. <u>The need to look beyond texts to the perception and attainment of</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">concrete social goals keeps writers from marginalized</span> <u>groups</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">ever-mindful of the specifics of how power works through political agendas, institutions, agencies, and the budgets that fuel them.</span><br />

<strong>Value to life inevitable</strong><br />
<strong>Bernstein ‘2</strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> (Richard J., Vera List Prof. Phil. – New School for Social Research, “Radical Evil: A Philosophical Interrogation”, p. 188-192)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">This is precisely what</span><u>Jonas</u><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> does in The Phenomenon of Life, his rethinking of the meaning of organic life. He tealizes that his philosophical project goes against many of the deeply embedded prejudices and dogmas of contemporary philosophy. He </span><u>challenges two well-entrenched dogmas: that there is no metaphysical truth, and that there is no path from the &quot;is&quot; to the &quot;ought&quot;. To escape from ethical nihilism, we must show that there is a metaphysical ground of ethics, an objective basis for value</u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and purpose in being itself. These are strong claims; and, needless to say, they are extremely controversial. In defense of Jonas, it should be said that he approaches this task with both boldness and intellectual modesty. He frequently acknowledges that he cannot &quot;prove&quot; his claims, but he certainly believes that his &quot;premises&quot; do &quot;more justice to the total phenomenon of man and Being in general&quot; than the prevailing dualist or reductionist alternatives. &quot;But in the last analysis my argument can do no more than give a rational grounding to an option it presents as a choice for a thoughtful person — an option that of course has its own inner power of persuasion. Unfortunately I have nothing better to offer. Perhaps a future metaphysics will be able to do more.&quot; 8 To appreciate how Jonas's philosophical project unfolds, we need to examine his philosophical interpretation of life. This is the starting point of his grounding of a new imperative of responsibility. It also provides the context for his speculations concerning evil. In the foreword to The Phenomenon of Life, Jonas gives a succinct statement of his aim. Put at its briefest, this volume offers an &quot;existential&quot; interpretation of biological facts. Contemporary existentialism, obsessed with man alone, is in the habit of claiming as his unique privilege and predicament much of what is rooted in organic existence as such: in so doing, it withholds from the organic world the insights to be learned from the awareness of self. On its part, scientific biology, by its rules confined to the physical, outward facts, must ignore the dimension of inwardness that belongs to life: in so doing, it submerges the distinction of &quot;animate&quot; and &quot;inanimate.&quot; A new reading of the biological record may recover the inner dimension — that which we know best -- for the understanding of things organic and so reclaim for psycho-physical unity of life that place in the theoretical scheme which it had lost through the divorce of the material and the mental since Descartes. p. ix) </span><u>Jonas</u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, in his existential interpretation of bios, </span><u>pursues &quot;this underlying theme of all of life</u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">in its development </span><u>through the ascending order of organic powers</u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">and functions:</span><u>metabolism, moving and desiring, sensing and perceiving, imagination, art, and mind</u> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">— a progressive scale of freedom and peril, culminating in man, who may understand his uniqueness anew when he no longer sees himself in metaphysical isolation&quot; (PL, p. ix). The way in which Jonas phrases this theme recalls the Aristotelian approach to bios, and it is clear that Aristotle is a major influence on Jonas. There is an even closer affinity with the philosophy of nature that Schelling sought to elaborate in the nineteenth century. Schelling (like many post- Kantian German thinkers) was troubled by the same fundamental dichotomy that underlies the problem for Jonas. The dichotomy that Kant introduced between the realm of &quot;disenchanted&quot; nature and the realm of freedom leads to untenable antinomies. Jonas differs from both Aristotle and Schelling in taking into account Darwin and contemporary scientific biology. A proper philosophical understanding of biology must always be compatible with the scientific facts. But at the same time, it must also root out misguided materialistic and reductionist interpretations of those biological facts. In this respect, Jonas's naturalism bears a strong affinity with the evolutionary naturalism of Peirce and Dewey. At the same time, Jonas is deeply skeptical of any theory of evolutionary biology that introduces mysterious &quot;vital forces&quot; or neglects the contingencies and perils of evolutionary development.' Jonas seeks to show &quot;that it is in the dark stirrings of primeval organic substance that a principle of freedom shines forth for the first time within the vast necessity of the physical universe&quot; (PL 3). Freedom, in this broad sense, is not identified exclusively with human freedom; it reaches down to the first glimmerings of organic life, and up to the type of freedom manifested by human beings</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. &quot; </span><u>'Freedom' must denote an objectively discernible mode of being</u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">i.e., a manner of executing existence, distinctive of the organic per se and thus shared by all members but by no nonmembers of the class: an ontologically descriptive term which can apply to mere physical evidence at first&quot; (PL 3). This coming into being of freedom is not just a success story. &quot;The privilege of freedom carries the burden of need and means precarious being&quot; (PL 4). It is with biological metabolism that this principle of freedom first arises</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><u>Jonas goes &quot;so far as to maintain that metabolism</u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, the basic stratum of all organic existence, already displays freedom — indeed that it</span><u>is the first form freedom takes</u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.&quot; </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">1 ° With &quot;metabolism — its power and its need — not-being made its appearance in the world as an alternative embodied in being itself; and thereby being itself first assumes an emphatic sense: intrinsically qualified by the threat of its negative it must affirm itself, and existence affirmed is existence as a concern&quot; (PL 4). This broad, ontological understanding of freedom as a characteristic of all organic life serves Jonas as &quot;an Ariadne's thread through the interpretation of Life&quot; (PL 3). The way in which Jonas enlarges our understanding of freedom is indicative of his primary argumentative strategy. He expands and reinterprets categories that are normally applied exclusively to human beings so that we can see that they identify objectively discernible modes of being characteristic of everything animate. Even inwardness, and incipient forms of self; reach down to the simplest forms of organic life. 11 Now it may seem as if Jonas is guilty of anthropomorphism, of projecting what is distinctively human onto the entire domain of living beings. He is acutely aware of this sort of objection, but he argues that even the idea of anthropomorphism must be rethought. 12 We distort Jonas's philosophy of life if we think that he is projecting human characteristics onto the nonhuman animate world. Earlier I quoted the passage in which Jonas speaks of a &quot;third way&quot; — &quot;one by which the dualistic rift can be avoided and yet enough of the dualistic insight saved to uphold the humanity of man&quot; (GEN 234). We avoid the &quot;dualistic rift&quot; by showing that there is genuine continuity of organic life, and that such categories as freedom, inwardness, and selfhood apply to everything that is animate. These categories designate objective modes of being. But we preserve &quot;enough dualistic insight&quot; when we recognize that</span><u>freedom, inwardness, and selfhood manifest themselves in human beings in a distinctive manner</u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">I do not want to suggest that Jonas is successful in carrying out this ambitious program. He is aware of the tentativeness and fallibility of his claims, but he presents us with an understanding of animate beings such that we can discern both continuity and difference.' 3 It should now be clear that Jonas is not limiting himself to a regional philosophy of the organism or a new &quot;existential&quot; interpretation of biological facts. His goal is nothing less than to provide a new metaphysical understanding of being, a new ontology. And he is quite explicit about this. Our reflections [are] intended to show in what sense the problem of life, and with it that of the body, ought to stand in the center of ontology and, to some extent, also of epistemology. . . The central position of the problem of life means not only that it must be accorded a decisive voice in judging any given ontology but also that any treatment of itself must summon the whole of ontology. (PL 25) The philosophical divide between Levinas and Jonas appears to be enormous. For Levinas, as long as we restrict ourselves to the horizon of Being and to ontology (no matter how broadly these are conceived), there is no place for ethics, and no answer to ethical nihilism. For Jonas, by contrast, unless we can enlarge our understanding of ontology in such a manner as would provide an objective grounding for value and purpose within nature, there is no way to answer the challenge of ethical nihilism. But despite this initial appearance of extreme opposition, there is a way of interpreting Jonas and Levinas that lessens the gap between them. In Levinasian terminology, we can say that Jonas shows that there is a way of understanding ontology and the living body that does justice to the nonreducible alterity of the other (l'autrui). 14 Still, we might ask how Jonas's &quot;existential&quot; interpretation of biological facts and the new ontology he is proposing can provide a metaphysical grounding for a new ethics. Jonas criticizes the philosophical prejudice that there is no place in nature for values, purposes, and ends. Just as he maintains that </span><u>freedom, inwardness, and selfhood are objective modes of being,</u><u>so</u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> he argues that </span><u>values and ends are objective modes of being</u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><strong><u>There is a basic value inherent in organic being, a basic affirmation, &quot;The Yes' of Life</u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">&quot; (IR 81). 15&quot;</span><strong><u>The self-affirmation of being becomes emphatic in the opposition of life to death. Life is the explicit confrontation of being with not-being</u></strong><u>. . . . The 'yes' of all striving is here sharpened by the active `no' to not-being</u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&quot; </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">(IR 81-2). Furthermore — and this is the crucial point for Jonas —</span><strong><u>this affirmation of life that is in all organic being has a binding obligatory force upon human beings</u></strong><u>. This blindly self-enacting &quot;yes&quot; gains obligating force in the seeing freedom of man,</u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">who as the supreme outcome of nature's purposive labor is no longer its automatic executor but, with the power obtained from knowledge, can become its destroyer as well.</span><u>He must adopt the &quot;yes&quot; into his will and impose the &quot;no&quot; to not-being on his power</u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">But precisely this transition from willing to obligation is the critical point of moral theory at which attempts at laying a foundation for it come so easily to grief. Why does now, in man, that become a duty which hitherto &quot;being&quot; itself took care of through all individual willings? (IR 82). We discover here the transition from is to &quot;ought&quot; — from the self-affirmation of life to the binding obligation of human beings to preserve life not only for the present but also for the future. But why do we need a new ethics? The subtitle of The Imperative of Responsibility — In Search of an Ethics for the Technological Age — indicates why we need a new ethics</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><u>Modern technology has transformed the nature and consequences of human action so radically that the underlying premises of traditional ethics are no longer valid</u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> For the first time in history human beings possess the knowledge and the power to destroy life on this planet, including human life.</span><u>Not only is there the new possibility of total nuclear disaster; there are the</u><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> even more invidious and threatening possibilities that result from the unconstrained </span><u>use of technologies that can destroy the environment required for life.</u> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">The major transformation brought about by modern technology is that the consequences of our actions frequently exceed by far anything we can envision. Jonas was one of the first philosophers to warn us about the unprecedented ethical and political problems that arise with the rapid development of biotechnology. He claimed that this was happening at a time when there was an &quot;ethical vacuum,&quot; when there did not seem to be any effective ethical principles to limit ot guide our ethical decisions. In the name of scientific and technological &quot;progress,&quot; there is a relentless pressure to adopt a stance where virtually anything is permissible, includ-ing transforming the genetic structure of human beings, as long as it is &quot;freely chosen.&quot; </span><u>We need</u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, Jonas argued</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, </span><u>a new categorical imperative that might be formulated as follows: &quot;Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life&quot;;</u><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> or expressed negatively: &quot;</span><u>Act so that the effects of your action are not destructive of the future possibility of such a life&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 5pt;">; or simply: &quot;</span><strong><u>Do not compromise the conditions for an indefinite continuation of humanity on earth</u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">&quot;; or again turned positive: &quot;In your present choices, include the future wholeness of Man among the objects of your will.&quot; (IR</span><br />

Greek philosophy is said to have been greatly influenced by the Vedic culture of India.45 But by far the greater influence of course came from the ancient civilizations of the Near East and also Egypt.

Amid the fog of postmodern relativism disseminated by Baudrillard, Zizek, and others, something essential is missing.

At a conference I attended recently, a friend with impeccable left-wing credentials who until communism's recent collapse had been an ardent champion of the proletarian cause, jumped on the pan-Arab bandwagon, reciting the names of obscure Muslim intellectuals who, he claimed, offered a promising political alternative to the debilities of Western liberalism.

U.S. STRATEGIC ADJUSTMENT As Kevin Narizny points out in his study of grand strategy, political turnover in the executive office often leads to dramatic shifts in state behavior. In particular, changes in control of government from one party to another can lead states to redefine their strategic goals and the means of promoting them.40 <u>The</u> <u>profound and ongoing strategic adjustment by the Obama administration has indeed borne out this argument. The much-maligned grand strategy of primacy and unilateralism has given way to a new stance that emphasizes strategic restraint and multilateral diplomacy. Smart power, rather than military preponderance, is now seen by many as the best way to pursue U.S. interests in the world. The current strategic adjustment by the U.S. has significantly lowered China</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">’</span></u><u>s traditional concern about the threat posed by a hegemonic America. China</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">’</span></u><u>s foreign policy analysts have reached a consensus that the U.S. has suffered a significant relative decline and is in the process of strategic retreat.</u> <u>41</u> <u>As a result, the old hegemonic system is believed to have disintegrated. This new perception of the U.S. position in the world has also led the PLA to reassess the likelihood of war between the two countries</u>. Some Chinese military strategists now believe that the relative decline of the U.S. has critically affected the ability and will of the American military to engage in major foreign wars. Lei Sihai, a strategist with a PLA background, claims that <span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">“</span>the military capability of the U.S. has declined significantly and it is no longer capable of launching major wars.<span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">”</span>42 Major General Jin Yinan, a strategist at the PLA National Defense University, has suggested that the rise of China and the relative decline of the U.S. have made a war scenario between them very unlikely.43 <u>Thus, the strategic landscape between China and the U.S.</u><u>, as seen by Chinese experts from both civilian and military backgrounds, has shifted because of changes in American grand strategy and military</u> strategy. This change in perception has relaxed Chinese concerns about national security. It marks a significant turnaround from China<span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">’</span>s view of the American threat from the mid-1990s to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, when the American pursuit of hegemony was seen as the greatest threat in China<span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">’</span>s strategic environment. <u>After U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced major changes in the Pentagon</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">’</span></u><u>s 2010 budget, including cancelling the procurement of F-22 fighters and key missile defense programs, one PLA strategist characterized these adjustments as</u> <u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">“</span></u><u>a comprehensive rethinking about U.S. geopolitical strategies.</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">”</span></u> <u>As the analysis emphasizes,</u> <u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">“</span></u><u>Gates’s and Obama</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">’</span></u><u>s thinking no longer shows aggressiveness. Instead, they seek a new security framework through accommodation. These significant adjustments in U.S. military strategies, especially the decisions to cut missile defense and stop procurement of F-22 fighters, which are directed mainly against China and Russia, should be welcomed. They are conducive for relaxing relations among great powers and reducing their strategic misunderstanding.</u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">”</span>44 <strong><u>Moreover, Chinese experts have taken keen noticeof the new space policy of the Obama administration, which opposes deployment of weapons in space and is willing to explore internationalagreements on the issue.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">THE SECURITY DILEMMA AND CHINA’S MILITARY SPACE AGENDA </span><u>Although many U.S. experts are correct in emphasizing the importance of space war in China’s asymmetric strategy to counter U.S. conventional advantages, this article suggests that China</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">’</span></u><u>s</u> <u>military space agenda is also driven by the security dilemmabetween the two countries. China is pursuing military capabilities in space to counter perceived national security threats posed by the U.S. quest for space dominance and missile defense that could neutralize China</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">’</span></u><u>s nuclear deterrence.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In both cases, Chinese security experts believe that the U.S. seeks </span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">absolute security</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in order to maximize protection for the American population from external threats.9 This means that China at least recognizes the defensive motivations behind the U.S. quest for space dominance and missile defense. However, with the chaotic nature of international relations, one country</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">s efforts to maximize its security could degrade the security of others by changing the balance of power. </span><u>Inevitably, the U.S. quest for</u> <u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">“</span></u><u>absolute security</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">”</span></u> <u>evokes countermeasures from other countries.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">As Kenneth Waltz observes, when a great power seeks superiority, others will respond in kind, since </span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">maintaining status quo is the minimum goal of any great power.</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10 According to Robert Jervis, </span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The heart of the security dilemma argument is that an increase in one state</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">s security can make others less secure, not because of misperceptions or imagined hostility, but because of the anarchic context of international relations.</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In this context, </span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Even if they can be certain that the current intentions of other states are benign, they can neither neglect the possibility that the others will become aggressive in the future nor credibly guarantee that they themselves will remain peaceful.</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11 Inevitably, when one state seeks to expand its military capability, others have to take similar measures. DENYING THE U.S. QUEST FOR SPACE DOMINANCE </span><u>The first factor that caused the</u> <u>security dilemma in the Sino-U.S. military space relationship is the professed American quest for space dominance. This quest is a reflection of the U.S. obsession with primacy that predates the Obama administration. The primacy strategy demands undisputed military dominance in different areas, including space, to ensure the best possible protection of U.S. national security. The U.S. is the only country in the world that has articulated a coherent national strategy for space dominance. As emphasized by Michael W.

Lord, former commander, Air Force Space Command, points out the importance of space dominance: </span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Space superiority is the future of warfare. We cannot win a war without controlling the high ground, and the high ground is space.</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15 In December 2007, the U.S. Air Force released a White Paper called </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Nation’s Guardians: America’s 21st Century Air Force</span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in which General T. Michael Moseley made a similar statement: </span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">No future war will be won without air, space and cyberspace superiority</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; thus, </span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the Air Force must attain cross-domain dominance. Cross-domain dominance is the freedom to attack and the freedom from attack in and through the atmosphere, space and electromagnetic spectrum.</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16 </span><u>This strategy of space dominance, however, generates the classic security dilemma between the U.S. and other countries. Although the U.S. may be motivated by defensive purposes, such as shielding the American population from nuclear weapons and other threats, other countries have to assume the worst in an anarchic world. As observed by Joan Johnson-Freese,</u> <u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">“</span></u><u>I would argue that the rest of the world accepts U.S. space supremacy.

Indeed, Chinese military and civilian strategists argue that the U.S. search for</u> <u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">“</span></u><u>absolute security</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">”</span></u> <u>jeopardizes other countries</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">’</span></u> <u>security.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is widely reported in Chinese military literature that the U.S. has already developed and is in fact implementing a master plan for military dominance in space. The challenge for China is to prevent the U.S. from jumping too far ahead. As observed by a major study organized by the General Staff of the PLA, </span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In recent decades the U.S. has been consistently pursuing dominance in space in order to become its overlord.</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18 </span><u>The study also points out that the U.S. is the first country to develop a full set of doctrines for space militarization and dominance:</u> <u>In April 1998, the U.S. Space Command published its long-term strategic development plan,</u> <em><u>Vision for 2020</u></em><u>, which specifically proposed the concept of space dominance and revealed the goals of allowing the American military to use space weapons to attack the enemy</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">’</span></u><u>s land, sea, air, and space targets.</u><u>World opinion believes this represented the formal debut of U.S. space war theory and indicated an important first step by the U.S. military toward space war.</u><u>19</u> <u>Li Daguang, one of the most influential PLA experts on space war, also alleges that the U.S. has initiated</u> <u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">“</span></u><u>a new space war</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">”</span></u> <u>to maintain its status as</u> <u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">“</span></u><u>the overlord of space.</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">”</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> He claims that the ultimate goal of the U.S. space program is to </span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">build a powerful military empire in outer space that attempts to include any space between earth and moon under American jurisdiction.</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Under this empire, </span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">without U.S. permission, any country, including even its allies, will not be able to use outer space for military or other purposes.</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20 One particular concern for the Chinese military is that the U.S. may no longer be content with merely militarizing space, which involves extensive use of satellites for military operations. </span><u>Instead, weaponization of space is on the agenda. The PLA now believes that the U.S. is on the verge of important breakthroughs in the development of weapons for space war. As one study claims:</u> <u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">“</span></u><u>Currently, the U.S. military already possesses or will soon possess ASAT technologies with real combat capabilities, such as aircraft-launched ASAT missiles, land-based laser ASAT weapons, and space-based energy ASAT weapons.</u><u><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif;">”</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21 </span><u>Moreover, the PLA suggests that the U.S. is trying to acquire space-based weapons to attack targets on earth:</u> <u>The U.S. military is developing orbital bombers, which fly on low altitude orbits, and when given combat orders, will re-enter the atmosphere and attack ground targets. This kind of weapon has high accuracy and stealth capability, and is able to launch sudden strikes. These capabilities make it impossible for</u><u>enemies to defend against</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Orbital bombers thus can strike at any target anywhere on the planet. It is the major means for the U.S. military to perform global combat in the 21st century.22 </span><strong><u>This perception of the American lead in space</u></strong> <strong><u>militarization and attempts for its weaponization is a major motive for the Chinese military to developsimilar projects and thus avoid U.S. domination in future wars.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The PLA believes that control of the commanding heights will decide the outcome of future wars, and China cannot afford to cede that control to the U.S. As a result, space war is a key component of the PLA Air Force</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">s (PLAAF) new doctrines. In 2006 the PLAAF released a comprehensive study called </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Military Doctrines for Air Force</span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which makes the following statement: In future wars, merely possessing air superiority will no longer be sufficient for seizing the initiative of battles. In significant ways, only obtaining space superiority could ensure controlling the initiative of war. The contest in outer space has become the contest for the new commanding heights. Seizing control of space will mean control of the global commanding heights, which will in turn enable dominance in air, land, and sea battles. Thus, it is impossible to achieve national security without obtaining space security.23 Another driver of the PLA</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 8pt;">’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">s efforts to counter U.S. dominance in space is the time factor. There is a genuine sense of urgency about controlling the commanding heights in space. The U.S. is seen as already possessing a decisive lead in the race toward space hegemony. As observed by Lieutenant General Ge Dongsheng, vice president of the PLA Academy of Military Sciences: Establishing space capability is not only important but also urgent. This is due to the fact that the U.S. and Russia have already taken the steps and now enjoy a vast lead over us. Even India, Japan, and European countries have ambitious plans to develop their own space capabilities. Under this situation, if we do not hasten implementing our own plan, there will be the possibility of having to face a generational gap in space capabilities.24</span><br />

<strong>NSP’s strategic adjustment has headed off an arms race</strong><br />

May 2011]<br />
<u>This article, citing firsthand Chinese military sources, identifies the major factors contributing to the security dilemma that is driving China</u><u><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">’</span>s military space program. The first is China</u><u><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">’</span>s attempt to respond to perceived U.S. military strategies to dominate outer space. Chinese strategists are keenly aware of the U.S. military</u><u><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">’</span>s plan to achieve so-called full-spectrum dominance, and the Chinese military feels compelled to deny that dominance.</u> The second factor is China<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">’</span>s concern about U.S. missile defense, which could potentially weaken Chinese strategic nuclear deterrence. Many PLA analysts believe that a multilayered ballistic missile defense system will inevitably compromise China’s offensive nuclear forces. China’s response is to attempt to weaken the U.S. space-based sensor system that serves as the eyes and brains of missile defense. Thus, U.S. missile defense has forced China to contemplate the integration of nuclear war and space warfare capabilities. <u>Because of the security dilemma, many experts in both China and the U.S. have expressed growing pessimism about the future of arms control. <strong>However, this article suggests that precisely because the current U.S.-China military space relationship is governed by the security dilemma, it is amenable to changes in the strategic environment that could extricate both from their mutual mistrust and the ongoing cycle of actions and counteractions. The current strategic adjustment by the U.S., efforts by the Obama administration to curb missile defense, and the fundamentally altered situation in the Taiwan Strait offer a window of opportunity for the two countries to relax the tensions in their space relationship</strong></u>. <u>With the right strategies, China and the U.S. could slow the momentum toward a space arms race. Perhaps reflecting this new context of space security, when meeting with the heads of foreign air force delegations in November 2009, President Hu Jintao promised that China would</u> <u><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">“</span>unswervingly uphold the principle of peaceful use of space and actively participate in international cooperation on space security.</u><u><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">”</span></u><u>7</u> Li Daguang, a leading PLA space war expert known for his pessimistic views on international space cooperation, recently argued that <span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">“</span>ensuring the peaceful use of outer space and preventing its weaponization represent a consensus of the international community.<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">”</span><u>8 These messages show that China has perhaps modified its previous assessment of the feasibility of arms control in outer space. This shift, together with President Obama</u><u><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">’</span>s new space policies, could dilute the security dilemma between China and the U.S. and pave the way for arms control.</u><br />

<strong>Cooperation is perceived now</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">As is well understood, the space policies of the Bush administration were decidedly oriented toward military security concerns and independent action. The 2006 National Space Policy unabashedly proclaimed the U.S. intention to maintain a dominant position in space indefinitely. This policy orientation dismissed multilateral cooperation as impinging on U.S. “freedom of action,” throwing weight instead behind a wide range of technology development initiatives founded on the assumption that deployment of weapons in space was, if not already factual, certainly inevitable.2 U.S. commercial and civil engagement was overshadowed by these security concerns, expressed through the tightening of export control restrictions inhibiting a broad range of technology sharing. Once again, U.S. space policy was subsumed by other national priorities, in this case dominated by military security concerns.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">This background is essential for appreciating how </span><u>the space policies of</u> <u>the Obama administration are beginning to genuinely break new trails</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><u>The</u> <u>U.S. National Space Policy issued in June 2010 has been widely recognized for its cooperative and multilateral tone</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, including as explicit near-term goals the expansion of international cooperation on all activities and pursuing international as well as national measures to enhance space stability. </span><u>Particularly notable are the document’s emphasis on orienting U.S. “leadership” toward fostering international cooperation</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, and its references, in its concluding section, to cooperation with other states and non-state actors in the pursuit of national security space objectives.3</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Less broadly noticed was this policy’s clarity and coherence in articulating a vision for U.S. space activities on its own terms. The document is organized around core principles, subsidiary goals and implementing guidelines that exceed its predecessors in delineating a longer-term direction for U.S. space policy that is integrated with, rather than derivative of, broader U.S. global aims.4 The policy also was generated and issued far earlier in the tenure of the administration than either of its predecessors, indicating an increased prioritization of attention to space policy at higher levels of policy-making.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">To some degree,</span> <u>a turn toward multilateral cooperation in U.S. space policy was to be expected</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision increased awareness of the challenge of space debris and the need for better global information sharing on space situational awareness (SSA).5 Also, </span><u>new budget realities</u> <u>and unpromising technological developments have scaled back ambitions in some quarters for solving U.S. space security concerns with new independent capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Finally, the Obama administration has pursued a more cooperative disposition across a wide range of global policy challenges, from Iranian nuclear ambitions to global climate change. But the improved clarity of vision in the 2010 Space Policy suggests that the emphasis on fostering global cooperation on space-related activities is more grounded in deliberate foresight than sailing the prevailing political winds.</span><br />
<u>The 2011 National Security Space Strategy</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, released February 4, </span><u>is best interpreted against this background of the Obama administration’s turn toward both greater international space cooperation</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and greater attention to space policy in general. This first-of-its-kind strategic statement culminates a congressionally mandated space posture review.6 The initial section portraying the strategic environment to which U.S. security policy must be responsive highlights the growing problems of space debris, orbital congestion and coordination among a growing number of space actors — not state-based security threats per se. The Security Space Strategy features the objective of a “stable space environment in which nations exercise shared responsibility.”7 Specific provisions intended to implement this strategy, relevant to the preceding observations, include:8 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">• The strategy presents a full section on “Partnering with Responsible Nations, International Organizations, and Commercial Firms.” This category is not wholly multilateral in the traditional sense, displaying a symbiosis of alliance-building and collective cooperation not always carefully distinguished; i.e., “The United States will lead in building coalitions of like-minded space-faring nations and, where appropriate, work with international institutions to do so.”</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">• The strategy intends to “encourage responsible behavior in space and lead by the power of example,” a significant observation given the tendency of U.S. policy-makers (as noted above) not to expect quid pro quo responses to cooperative gestures. Also, </span><u>the strategy states the U.S. “will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, and <em>norms of behavior for responsible space operations</em>.”</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> [italics added] In the context of the section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression,” the strategy similarly intends to “support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space” as well as “pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint,” along with other measures. </span><u>This emphasis</u> <u>on norm-building and the role of example suggests a near-term endorsement of the development of “codes of conduct” for space activities</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (such as the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct, discussed below), </span><u>whether or not such concord leads to more formal arms control arrangements</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">in the longer-term.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">• </span><u>The Department of Defense is directed to “foster cooperative SSA relationships</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">,” and to “expand provision of safety of flight services to U.S. Government agencies, other nations, and commercial firms.” Greater SSA information sharing has been a key suggestion for fostering international cooperation; the U.S. possesses globally superior SSA capabilities, but restricts the sharing of this information on the basis of national security concerns.9 Hence, this nominal commitment is significant in its own right.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">• </span><u>The strategy commits to reforming export controls.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> “In particular, as new opportunities arise for international collaboration, a revised export control system will better enable the domestic firms competing for these contracts.” As noted above, the oppressive impact of current U.S. export controls not only impinges on U.S. commercial space actors but also epitomizes the high degree to which U.S. policy has subsumed commercial and civil interests to national security concerns. The strategy appears to acknowledge this connection and commit to remedy it.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">• The most assertive passages of the statement are moderated with community-building intent. For example, the strategy’s section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression” concludes that the U.S. “will retain the right and capabilities to respond in self-defense, should deterrence fail,” but immediately adds that the U.S. “will use force in a manner that is consistent with longstanding principles of international law, treaties to which the United States is a party, and the inherent right of self defense.”</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">• The concluding and most conflict-oriented section of the strategy opens by noting that “some actors may still believe counterspace actions could provide military advantage.” Counterspace capabilities, unarticulated in the document, include ASATs, ground-based directed energy weapons and satellite transmission jamming. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy Gregory Schulte explained at the strategy’s rollout that China is a principal concern in this regard, but so is the proliferation of these technologies: “If Ethiopia can jam a commercial satellite, you have to worry what others can do.”10 This section of the strategy does not, however, call for maintaining options to develop complementary space conflict capabilities.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Rather, the strategy asserts that the U.S. “must be prepared to ‘fight through’ a degraded environment,” and identifies “resilience” and “space protection” as the key criteria.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective, highlighting those elements expressing consistency with the 2010 National Space Policy’s bend toward fostering greater international collaboration. Perhaps </span><u>as striking</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">as the prevalence of such passages, however, </span><u>is the absence of</u> <u>expressed intention — even couched in hedging language — to sustain or expand</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the kind of </span><u>independent space-based military capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that were the centerpiece of the prior administration’s aims (if not its accomplishments). Again, to some extent this turn in tone is overdetermined by extenuating global circumstances. But one must still be struck by the degree to which developments such as the Chinese ASAT test have not ignited the kind of response one might have anticipated only a few short years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 </span><br />
<u>The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its sends concerning U.S. policy toward the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.12 The strategy did not explicitly endorse this EU initiative, but Mr. Schulte, at the February 4 presentation of the strategy, highlighted the initiative “as a potential way” to promote “transparency and confidence-building measures, which tend to be voluntary as opposed to legally binding.” A week earlier, Rose Gottemoeller, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, stated at the Conference on Disarmament that the administration was nearing a decision on whether the U.S. would sign on to the code, and what modifications might be required in order to do so.13 As U.S. interest in the Code of Conduct has increased, debates over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. </span><br />
<u>These policy movements</u> <u>toward multilateral engagement and commitment to behavioral standards (even if non-binding) mark a sharp departure from the stiff resistance to curtailing U.S. “freedom of action” in the previous administration</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, and have accordingly generated resistance from congressional opponents on just those terms. Prior to the release of the National Security Space Strategy, a group of 37 Republican senators led by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl issued a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concern over a potential multilateral commitment that might limit development and/or deployment of space-based missile defense interceptors and ASAT-defeating systems.14 Critics also decried the strategy’s emphasis on “the old fallacious assumption that the power of example will prevent adversaries from doing the United States harm,” and endorsed maintaining the goal of U.S. retention of a “dominant position in military and intelligence space capabilities.”15 In fact, the administration’s warming toward normative commitments in general — and the EU Code of Conduct in particular — are in part intended to forestall pressure for more formal and binding measures that would definitively cut off the “hedge” of unilateral U.S. weapons development options.16 The balance of U.S. debate may have shifted toward greater international cooperation, but the terms of the debate remain the same.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">In sum, </span><u>the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing in U.S. policy toward greater global engagement but also,</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and more importantly, </span><u>a step toward greater long-term coherence in thinking concerning the core goals of U.S. space activities</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Even supporters of the general directions of the strategy noted its more-than-expected breadth of thought.17 But if this reading is sound, the strategy is still but one step on a long road, and ongoing debates over the role of U.S. space policy vis-à-vis broader national security interests will insure that road is bumpy. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that more specific guidelines for military implementation of the strategy remain to be developed.18 Many devils may lurk in these details. </span><br />

<strong>Esa technology 2010</strong> [&quot;Proba-2 shows solar eruption that touched Earth&quot;, April 14, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Technology/SEMM5H9MT7G_0.html" rel="nofollow">__http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Technology/SEMM5H9MT7G_0.html__</a>]<br />
<br />
<u>Polar skies glowed with ghostly auroras</u> last week <u>during the biggest geomagnetic storm of 2010. The event owed its origin to a solar eruption a few days earlier – revealed</u> here <u>in high-speed detail by ESA’s</u> small Sun-watcher <u>Proba-2</u>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Eruptions like this one have several components, most notably solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). Solar flares are caused by sudden impulsive releases of magnetic energy from the surface of the Sun. The flare seen here took place at 11:54 CET on Saturday 3 April. It was officially classed as ‘weak’, though still involved temperatures of tens of millions of degrees and around the same energy the human race consumes on Earth per year. Significantly, this eruption was lined up with Earth, sending a vast number of charged particles hurtling towards us. Travelling at around 500 km per second, the front of this CME reached Earth the following Monday, 5 April. The resulting geomagnetic storm was the most powerful in more than three years. It provoked dazzling auroras but no damage was reported to potentially susceptible systems such as satellites and GPS, communications and electrical power infrastructure. Solar flares are rarely visible in ordinary light, but are often spectacular at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths.</span> <u>The ESA-NASA SOHO mission has been a solar flare ‘watchdog’ producing remarkable images for</u> approaching <u>15 years, but last year a new ‘pup’ made it to Earth orbit: ESA’s small satellite Proba-2. Measuring only a cubic metre, the satellite is crammed with technology demonstrations but also carries science payloads: its SWAP</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">(Sun Watcher using APS detectors and imaging processing) instrument is only the size of a large shoebox, but</span> <u>gathers images much more frequently than SOHO’s equivalent sensor.<span style="color: black;">SWAP acquired an image every 100 seconds during the flare</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 6pt;">while SOHO manages one around every 15 minutes</span><span style="color: black;">,” <u>said</u> </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 6pt;">David </span><u><span style="color: black;">Berghmans of the Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB), overseeing SWAP operations. “This means we have about 40 images compared to five to six for SOHO</span></u><span style="color: black;">, </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 6pt;">allowing us to see clearly the full range of phenomena associated with such an event.”</span><br />

Despite numerous </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">articles,</span><span class="Underline"> commentaries, </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">and international discussions</span><span class="Underline"> about the merits and failings of American space policies </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">released in 2006 and 2010,</span><span class="Underline"> there is very little commentary on the EU’s new priority statement on space. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">This article outlines some views about this policy that national leaders could consider as the United States implements its policy that has been described by the Pentagon Space Policy office as “collective assurance.”</span>The EU produced a<span class="Underline"> highly </span>unilateraldocument focused on the advancement of European<span class="Underline"> domestic space </span>capabilities.<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The EU space policy is based on years of meetings within the European Commission and its space council regarding the direction for Europe in space. The policy articulates goals and objectives within three main areas: strategic interests, security, and economic prosperity. Throughout the document, strategic language interweaves itself throughout with Euro-centric goals and objectives for its industry, economy, and civil and military arenas. This policy indicates that</span><span class="Underline"> the Europeans understand the political and economic importance of space power as a vital interest, </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">its impact on the everyday life of European citizens, and its affect on Europe’s quest for greater security, prestige, and wealth.Interestingly, the order and precedence of their strategic objectives were like a national-focused document with end states reflecting the interests of Europe first, and lacking the global flavor of the 2010 US space policy and follow-on strategy. The strategic goals of this document are not what many might expect: a US-modeled push for “interdependence”, “collective self-defense”, and further integration in the “global economy.” Rather, </span><span class="Underline">the EU produced a highly unilateral document focused on the advancement of European domestic space capabilities. </span>These capabilities aim to enable<span class="Underline"> “economic and political independence” for European citizens and </span>a greater role for European excellence in space<span class="Underline"> and worldwide</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. They view space as an area of strategic importance and acknowledge the need for enhanced military capabilities in space, in order to “strengthen its security missions.” Galileo is one example of many projects, where the Europeans desire is to remain independent and lead in other areas as well, such as space launch</span><span class="Underline">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">One other key area to note is that this “independent access” to space is underscored by the statement that</span>Europe will not relyon<span class="Underline"> any </span>foreign launch<span class="Underline"> or service provider. </span>This is interesting when comparing EU with<span class="Underline"> current </span>US<span style="font-size: 6pt;">plans and</span>policy that project reliance<span class="Underline"> on Russian Soyuz for human access to the International Space Station and American reliance on commercial and foreign partners overall. This US reliance on foreign partners could </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">potentially lead to advantages for foreign commercial entities and possibly</span><span class="Underline"> hurt, not help, US space industrial and high tech jobs. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">This is an area that shows potential strategic contradictions within the US policy and bears further scrutiny. Second</span><span class="Underline">, the Europeans’ vision for space power advancement includes growth for its domestic space industry and economic capabilities as well. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The EU policy states, “a solid technological base [is required] if [Europe] is to have an independent, competitive space industry.”</span>To advance the influence of the EUspace industrial base<span class="Underline"> globally, </span>they recognize they must increase innovation<span class="Underline">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Like the US space policy that advocates increased innovation in research and development, the EU policy also advocates innovation but with a different tone. To promote “industrial competitiveness” in the marketing of European space technology, they see “the setting of ambitious space objectives” as the key to “stimulating innovation,” not endless funding of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education initiatives to keep the youth excited about entering the apparently dwindling US space sector. They understand that beyond mere research and development alone, with no concrete commitment to any funded ambitious space objectives in space exploration and national security programs, their space industrial base will neither innovate nor compete on the world stage.As a result of this understanding</span><span class="Underline">, </span>the Europeansdesire a strong industry that will assist<span class="Underline">/provide the increased prestige and </span>influence<span class="Underline"> necessary for European space efforts </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">to be advanced in multilateral forums</span><span class="Underline">. The EU space policy is a policy regarding Europe and its goals and objectives for the Union to gain in space leadership worldwide. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The third observation concerns EU’s view of international cooperation. Reading through the document, and what little press was given to the release of the policy, demonstrated a structure dissimilar to US policy.</span>Rather than interweaving international<span class="Underline"> and global </span>themes<span class="Underline"> throughout each sector or mission area, </span>the Europeans focus on<span class="Underline"> advancing </span>domestic<span class="Underline"> capability and </span>policy<span class="Underline"> for the benefit of Europeans. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">I will note that the Europeans are not anti-international cooperation; they do view themselves as a partner and want to maintain “space dialogues” with their “strategic partners”, notably Russia and the United States. However, one will note that inter ational cooperation is a very short section of the overall policy and its overall strategic goal is to use space “as an instrument serving the Union’s internal and external policies.” Also, this section is the last in their list of strategic objectives. They do, however, acknowledge that “increasingly” space efforts are not just for individual nations but in many cases can be achieved through pooling resources. The word usage in quotations here is notable.</span><span class="Underline"> By contrast, US space policy states that international cooperation in US space programs is a requirement </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">(and a directive for all departments to pursue international partnerships in all space mission areas)</span><span class="Underline">. The Europeans appear to see it as something to be considered following the development of their domestic capabilities and leadership in critical areas such as positioning, navigation and timing, and space launch, among others.</span><br />

<strong>Power is zero sum-U.S leadership trades off with EU leadership</strong><br />
<strong>Shelton and Holdridge 04</strong>-[“ The US-EU Race for Leadership of Science and Technology: Qualitative and Quantitative Indicators “-International Technology Research Institute R.D. Shelton, Director Geoffrey M. Holdridge, WTEC Division Director and ITRI Series Editor ]<br />
<u>Both the United States and the European Union have set goals for worldwide leadership of science and technology.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">While the U.S. leads in most input quantitative indicators, </span><u>output indicators</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">may be more specific for determining present leadership. They</span> <u>show that the EU has taken the lead in important metrics and is challenging the U.S. in others.</u> <u>Qualitative indicators of fields of research and development, based on expert review studies organized by the authors, confirm that many EU labs are equal or better than those in the U.S.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">I. Introduction A. Purpose Since the 1950s, the top science goal of the U. S. Government has been “maintaining world leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering,” and there is wide acceptance in the U. S. of the premise that it is already ahead. With the new emphasis on planning mandated by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), federal agencies need goals, plans for achieving them, and performance reports on their progress. While the U.S. may currently lead the world in science and technology (S&amp;T) in some aggregated sense, research agencies must assess the status in the sub-disciplines they fund. Systematic assessments of individual fields are sparse, but the best available evidence shows that the U.S. does not lead the world in many important fields. In particular many European research centers now present a challenge to U.S. leadership<u>.</u></span> <u>In 2000 the European Union set itself a goal of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. Strategies are being implemented to achieve this goal, including the tighter integration of research and development activities into a European Research Area. In addition the EU also plans to sharply increase its investment in research and development (R&amp;D) to 3% of GDP by 2010.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">The EU has already made good progress in some output indicators of S&amp;T performance, and these policy measures plus its \expansion from 15 countries to 25 in the coming year are likely to accelerate that progress. This paper will compare the status of indicators of S&amp;T leadership by U.S. versus the EU</span><br />

<strong>EU diplomacy is key to solve Iran nuclearization</strong><br />
<strong>Adib-Moghaddam 10</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [Arshin Adib-Moghaddam, lecturer in the comparative and international politics of western Asia at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, 13 November 2010, “Europe still vital in talks with Iran,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3806:http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/13/europe-iran-eu-diplomacy --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/13/europe-iran-eu-diplomacy" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/13/europe-iran-eu-diplomacy</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3806 -->]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the meantime, </span><u>Iran has proposed a new round of talks</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with the P5+1 (the permanent members of the UN security council, plus Germany) to move the negotiations further. Britain and</span> <u>the EU have a pivotal role to play in these negotiations if they revert to a rather more proactive, positive diplomacy vis-à-vis Iran on the one side and the US on the other.</u><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The </span><u>position of the EU should be mediatory rather than firmly entrenched within any camp</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It was former foreign secretary Jack </span><u>Straw</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, after all, whose shuttle diplomacy </span><u>contributed to Iran's voluntary suspension of nuclear enrichment activities in 2003 and the Paris agreement in 2004</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. With the benefit of hindsight </span><u>the delayed response of the EU to Iran's goodwill gesture must be considered a missed opportunity</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not least because it undermined the negotiating position of then President Khatami who was left with nothing to present to the Iranian right who were starting to gather around Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who later succeeded him as president.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The </span><u>failure to follow up on some of the promises made to Khatami's administration</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> after Iran suspended nuclear enrichment activities </span><u>contributed to Iranian suspicions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For the more hawkish elements in the political establishment, this was enough &quot;evidence&quot; for them to dismiss Khatami's efforts. &quot;We suspended the enrichment of uranium once, and none of the sanctions were lifted,&quot; some of the Iranians argued.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">One can always discuss the merits and verity of the Iranian position, but </span><strong><u>the success of the proactive EU diplomacy, galvanised by the efforts of Straw and the British foreign office, indicates that positive mediation produces tangible results</u></strong><u>.</u><u>If there is to be a dual track approach</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as President Obama himself repeatedly emphasised, then surely Britain and </span><u>the EU should position themselves at the forefront of the diplomatic track</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<u>The more manoeuvring space there is in a negotiation process, research shows, the more likely there will be a solution</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In that sense, the inclusion of Turkey (and potentially Brazil) in the new round of talks should be welcomed as an opportunity to open further communication channels and to enable Iranian negotiators to &quot;sell&quot; any viable compromise to a fiercely nationalistic constituency within the country. The nuclear issue is clearly an emblem of national pride and sovereignty in Iran, and any politician negotiating a deal has to take this into account.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">At present, </span><u>the odds for a proactive mediatory role for the EU are good</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In Iran, the taboo of negotiating with the US directly was broken a long time ago, though </span><u>it may</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> still </span><u>be easier for the negotiators to face European delegates</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The fact that the Obama administration has made it unmistakably clear to Netanyahu that the US will not tolerate any unilateral Israeli military adventure targeting Iranian nuclear facilities has been noted in Tehran.</span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>Lindsay and Takeyh 10</strong></span>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">James, Senior Vice President, Director of Studies, and Maurice R. Greenberg Chair, Ray, Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies [“After Iran Gets the Bomb,” March/April <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/22182/after_iran_gets_the_bomb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/22182/after_iran_gets_the_bomb.html</a>] HURWITZ</span><br />
The nightmare scenario that could be unleashed by Iran's nuclearization is easy to sketch. Israel would go on a hair-trigger alert—ready to launch a nuclear weapon at a moment's notice—putting both countries minutes away from annihilation. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey would scramble to join the nuclear club. The Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) would collapse, unleashing a wave of nuclear proliferation around the globe. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Such a doomsday scenario could pan out. Whether it did would depend greatly on how the United States and others, starting with Israel, responded to Iran's nuclearization</span>. Whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forgoes a preventive strike against Iran's nuclear facilities or opts for launching an attack and it fails, the Israeli government will continue to regard the Iranian regime as an existential threat to Israel that must be counteredby any means possible, including the use of nuclear weapons. Given Israel's unique history and Ahmadinejad's contemptible denials of the Holocaust, no Israeli prime minister can afford to think otherwise.<br />

<u>The 2009 reset was an urgently needed “clearing of the air”</u><u>between Washington and Moscow after nearly a decade of deteriorating ties</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, yet by itself the notion of reset had very little policy content. </span><u>It was only following the embrace of reset by both sides, <strong>through difficult negotiations and the creation of new mechanisms for cooperation,</strong> that U.S.-Russia relations began to yield real accomplishments.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">The central mechanism for this cooperation, </span><u>the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission (BPC), was formed in July 2009 with over a dozen substantive working groups</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> devoted to topics ranging from counter-narcotics to energy efficiency cooperation. </span><u>It was endowed with a flexible management structure and a broad agenda, but given relatively limited funding or authority</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Thanks to the early and strong interest of Presidents Obama and Medvedev, </span><u>the BPC and parallel tracks have advanced cooperation across multiple priority areas</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><u>The record so far is impressive</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">: </span><u>The New START agreement</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> limiting strategic nuclear warheads and delivery vehicles has been signed, ratified, and </span><u>is being implemented</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> at this moment. </span><u>U.S. and Russian firms have already signed agreements to enhance civilian nuclear cooperation</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> under the terms of the 123 Agreement, brought into force last year. U</span><u>.S.-Russian security cooperation</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span><u>on Afghanistan, counter-terrorism, and counter-narcotics, has reached unprecedented heights</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The fact that more than half of supplies for NATO’s counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan now transit Russian territory speaks volumes, while Moscow’s willingness to put “boots on the ground” in joint anti-drug operations in Afghanistan—despite the indelible trauma of 1979-89—itself attests to the importance it places on this type of cooperation. </span><u>While impressive, recent accomplishments can be understood at least in part from the perspective of making up for lost time</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">—</span><u>doing things of obvious importance that simply did not get done in the preceding decade</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><u>As cooperation advances, and the most urgent problems</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">—expiration of the previous START treaty, supporting the war effort in Afghanistan, or managing the recent global financial crisis—</span><u>are addressed, the next steps forward may appear to come at higher cost, and with less obvious immediate benefit to both sides</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. At present, Russia and NATO remain at loggerheads over missile defense. The issue cannot be isolated from broader security relations, since Russia perceives NATO’s aspiration to defend against missile attacks as a fundamental threat to its nuclear deterrent, and thus to the strategically stable balance of nuclear forces that has held since the first arms control negotiations in the 1960s and 1970s. With each new unsuccessful round of bilateral or multilateral talks on missile defense—the most recent disappointment was in Sochi in early July—the likelihood of identifying and implementing a mutually acceptable compromise slips farther from our grasp. Even if the breaking point—when NATO missile defense is actually capable of defeating a large-scale missile attack—is still within the realm of some theoretical future, the looming prospect of such a fundamental strategic shift against Russia’s perceived interests will give limitless fodder to those in Moscow opposed to U.S.-Russia cooperation. </span><u>Events in North Africa and the Middle East are moving quickly, and while Moscow and Washington have done well thus far to maintain a productive dialogu</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">e </span><u>on these developments</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span><u>they have also been lucky not to face the most potentially damaging scenarios.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> In light of the ambiguity surrounding NATO’s ongoing intervention in Libya and Russian attempts to mediate a cease-fire, what will happen if more widespread violence breaks out in Yemen or Bahrain, if Egypt’s transition falters and deteriorates, or if opponents of the Assad regime in Syria manage to mount a successful insurgency and seize control of the country’s volatile border regions with Israel and Lebanon? Stability in the Middle East is a vital national security interest for the United States, and Washington will be under intense pressure to act in any of these scenarios—but to do so against clear Russian opposition, or without a mandate from the UN Security Council, would herald a swift and dramatic end to U.S.-Russian security cooperation. </span><u>Afghanistan</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, though it </span><u>has become a success story for U.S.-Russia cooperation, is by the same token the source of the greatest potential disruption</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. If President Obama follows through on recently announced plans to reduce the U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan by one-third next year, with a nearly complete withdrawal of combat troops by the end of 2014, Afghans loyal to the U.S.-backed Karzai government are not the only ones who will have cause for concern. Whatever combat successes U.S. troops can achieve before they depart, and even if they leave behind better trained and equipped Afghan soldiers and police, we can be certain that the Taliban will not be eradicated from Afghanistan, and that the scourges of terrorism, drugs, and weapons trafficking will continue. Without the large U.S. troop presence supplementing Afghan, Tajik, Uzbek, or Kyrgyz security forces, not only Afghan trafficking but the insurgency itself might easily spread northward into Central Asia, with dire consequences for Russia’s “soft underbelly.” Moscow recognizes this danger, and has long worried that a short-lived U.S. intervention in Afghanistan would leave Russians holding the bag—President Obama’s timeline suggests that this eventuality may not be far off. </span><u>To sustain the recent record of successful U.S.-Russian cooperation <strong>despite</strong> <strong>looming challenges like these</strong></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span><u>it will be necessary to define a fundamentally deeper and broader agenda, based on enduring, institutionalized cooperation between the two governments</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> with robust participation from business and civil society. </span><u>What we need is not just more cooperation, but true “normalization” of U.S.-Russia relations on a foundation of mutual understanding and trust</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><strong><u>The BPC is the key platform</u></strong> <u>for the two governments to work together and it should be given much-needed</u><u>resources</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and authorities on both sides so that it can endure whatever political transitions may occur in 2012. On the U.S. side, </span><u>transparent mechanisms are needed to more fully connect BPC working groups with businesses and non-profit organizations already interested in engagement with Russia, as well as those that have not yet made the leap.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Above all, more ordinary Americans and Russians should be given the opportunity to meet one another and build real relationships of trust and partnership. Allowing three-year multiple entry visas is progress, but that should not end negotiations. There is no compelling reason why Washington and Moscow cannot agree to a long-term goal of visa-free travel and take the next necessary steps in the coming year.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 5pt;">A year and a half after Barack Obama hit the &quot;reset&quot; button with Russia, the reconciliation is still fragile, incomplete, and politically divisive. Sure, Russia is no easy ally for the United States. Authoritarian yet insecure, economically mighty yet technologically backward, the country has proven a challenge for U.S. presidents since the end of the Cold War. Recent news hasn't helped: The arrest in July of a former deputy prime minister and leader of the Solidarity opposition movement, Boris Nemtsov, provoked some of the harshest criticism of Russia yet from the Obama administration. Then last Wednesday, Russia announced that it had moved anti-aircraft missiles into Abkhazia, the region that broke off from Georgia during the August 2008 war. The announcement was hardly welcome news for the United States, which has tried to defuse tensions there for the last 24 months. Yet however</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> challenging this partnership may be, Washington can't afford not to work with Moscow. Ronald Reagan popularized the phrase, &quot;Trust, but verify&quot; -- a good guiding principle for Cold War arms negotiators, and still apt for today. </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Engagement is the only way forward.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Here are </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">10 reasons why</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">: 1. </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Russia's nukes are </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">still an existential threat.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Russia has thousands of nuclear weapons in stockpile and hundreds still on hair-trigger alert aimed at U.S. cities.

To this day, it remains the only mechanism granting U.S. inspectors access to secret Russian nuclear sites. The original START agreement was essential for reining in the runaway Cold War nuclear buildup, and New START promises to cut deployed strategic arsenals by a further 30 percent from a current limit of 2,200 to 1,550 on each side. Even more, President Obama and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, have agreed to a long-term goal of eliminating nuclear weapons entirely. But they can only do that by working together. 2. </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Russia is a swing vote on the international stage</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">. As one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Moscow holds veto power over any resolution</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> that the body might seek to pass -- including recent efforts to levy tougher sanctions on Iran or, in 2009, against North Korea following that country's second nuclear test. </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Russian support for such resolutions can also help persuade China and others not to block them. The post-reset relationship between Moscow and Washington works like a force multiplier for U.S. diplomacy</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">. Russia plays an equally crucial role in the G-8 and G-20 economic groups, helping to formulate a coordinated approach in response to economic threats. In 2008, for example, Russia supported a G-20 resolution promising to refrain from protectionism and avoid new barriers to investment or trade. 3. </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Russia</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> is big. The country's borders span across Europe, Central and East Asia, and the Arctic -- all regions where the United States has important interests and where it cannot afford destructive competition. With an ongoing counterinsurgency campaign </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">in Afghanistan, the United States has a strong interest in Central Asian stability and relies on Russia not only for direct assistance with logistics and information sharing, but [and] to help manage threats like </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the recent </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">political upheaval </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">and </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 5pt;">sectarian violence in Kyrgyzstan. In the former Soviet space, Moscow's historical ties to newly independent states are still fresh and powerful. Moscow is the linchpin to resolving &quot;frozen conflicts&quot; that prevent countries like Moldova, Georgia, and Azerbaijan from prospering economically and moving toward European Union membership. Recently, for example, Moscow signaled renewed interest in resolving frozen conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria. And despite recent troop movements into Abkhazia, a negotiated settlement is still very possible, one that returns some territory to Georgia but preserves its autonomous status, along with that of its fellow breakaway republic, South Ossetia. 4. Russia's environment matters. As the catastrophic fires across Western Russia have dramatically illustrated, Russia is both a victim of global climate change and a steward of natural resources -- including many of the forests now badly burned -- needed to reverse the global warming trend. With more than one-tenth of the world's total landmass, vast freshwater and ocean resources, plus deposits of nearly every element on the periodic table, Russia is an indispensable partner in the responsible stewardship of the global environment. On climate change, there is work to be done, but progress is evident. Russia today is the world's fourth-largest carbon emitter, but as a signatory to the Copenhagen Accord, it has pledged to reduce emissions to 20 to 25 percent be</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">low 1990 levels. Another</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 5pt;"> black spot is Russia's use of &quot;flaring&quot; -- a technique that burns natural gas into the open atmosphere during oil extraction, but Medvedev agreed to capture 95 percent of the gas currently released through flaring. Last year he also signed Russia's first law on energy efficiency, which takes such steps as requiring goods to be marked according to their energy efficiency and banning incandescent light bulbs after 2014. True, most of Russia's other commitments are short on deadlines and concrete deliverables. But like China's cleanup for the Beijing Olympics, Moscow could transform resolve into reality with surprising speed, given the right amount of international engagement. And in the meantime, Russia's natural climate-cleaning properties are vast; the Siberian provinces alone contain more clean oxygen-producing forests and reserves of freshwater than continental Europe. 5. Russia is rich. As the &quot;R&quot; in the famous BRIC grouping of emerging economies, Russia is the 12th-largest market in world, with the third-largest foreign currency reserves. And the country's role in world markets is only growing. Russia is a big player in commodity trading, the country boasts a volatile but increasingly attractive stock exchange, and it is open to foreign investment -- even in state-owned industries. Russian businesses are increasingly looking abroad to form strategic partnerships, acquire assets, and sell their products. And as a country that felt the global financial crisis viscerally -- economic growth fell by almost 8 percent in 2009 -- Russia has a strong interest in making sure there is no repeat. Despite occasional retrenchments, such as the ban on grain exports after the summer fires, Russia is committed to becoming a free-trading World Trade Organization member, and wants more access to U.S. and European technology and management know-how to drive its modernization. Excessive bureaucracy and widespread corruption are the biggest challenges to Russia's further economic growth, but these are already top talking points in Medvedev's modernization drive, and engagement with more transparent Western countries such as the United States can only help. 6. One word: energy. The American way of life depends on stable and predictable commodity prices -- gasoline, natural gas, and coal in particular -- and Russia plays a large role in the global production and pricing of these fossil fuels. Russia alone possesses roughly one-quarter of the world's known gas reserves, and it is currently responsible for over a fifth of global exports. It is the second largest oil-producing state after Saudi Arabia and has the second-largest coal reserves after the United States. The even better news for Washington is that Russia is not a member of OPEC, the cartel of oil-producing countries. This gives the country far more freedom to focus on increasing exports rather than reducing them to keep prices down. When it comes to bringing supply to market, many will no doubt remember the so-called gas wars between Russia and Ukraine and Russia and Belarus that left Eastern Europe in the cold several times in recent</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> years. Much of the trouble is attributable to the legacy of Soviet energy infrastructure in Russia's western neighbors, which put a choke-hold on Russia's gas pipelines. Moscow is currently working with the United States, China, and Western Europe to find a way around this problem, which will entail building new pipelines through the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Siberia. 7. </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Russia is a staunch ally in the war on terror</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> (and other scourges). Even during the dark days after the 2008 Russia-Georgia war, </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Moscow and Washington cooperated effectively on counterterrorism,</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> counternarcotics, infectious disease prevention and response, </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">and other shared security priorities.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Recently, the two have worked together under the auspices of the Bilateral Presidential Commission to coordinate relief strategies for catastrophes such as the Haiti earthquake and the violence in Kyrgyzstan.</span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> Both Washington and Moscow recognize that swift, well-organized responses to such crises are key to preventing weaknesses from being exploited -- for example by extremist groups</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> who are happy to fill the vacuum of government authority. </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Russia is also a critical partner in U.S. law enforcement efforts to defeat organized crime and terrorism financing</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">. The two countries are currently working to map smuggling routes in Central Asia. And Russia has shared information with the United States on the informal financial networks used to fund Taliban and Afghan warlords. 8. </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">The roads to Tehran and Pyongyang go through Moscow. Russia maintains unique relationships with Iran and North Korea -- both top concerns on Washington's nuclear nonproliferation radar.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> In the past</span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">, the Kremlin has used its leverage to keep </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">the path open for negotiations</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">, sending senior diplomats to Tehran and offering carrots such as civilian nuclear assistance and weapons sales (though it has deferred the sale of advanced S-300 ground-to-air missiles that could be used to blunt a U.S. or Israeli air strike). </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Now more than ever, Washington needs allies with that kind of leverage to help punish violators and discourage cascading nuclear proliferation worldwide.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Leading by example on nonproliferation is also a must; as the world's biggest nuclear powers, the United States and Russia are looked to as the standard-setters. If they fail to ratify their latest modest step forward on bilateral nuclear arms control, it will be difficult to push other countries to take similar counter-proliferation measures. 9. </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Russia can be a peacemaker. Moscow has the potential to play a role in the settlement of key regional conflicts</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> -- or if it chooses, to obstruct progress.</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Russia is a member of the Middle East &quot;Quartet,&quot; the six-party talks dealing with North Korean denuclearization, and each of the working groups addressing conflicts in the post-Soviet space, such as the OSCE Minsk group on Nagorno-Karabakh, and the 5+2 group on Transnistria. In such post-Soviet regions in particular, </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Russia has a</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> unique capacity tocontribute to peaceful resolution of territorial disputes by facilitating trade and economic engagement with and between former adversaries, and acting as a peacekeeper once a final settlement is reached. In the Middle East, Russia still controls a network of commercial and intelligence assets and has substantial influence </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">with the Syrians, who should be pushed to play a more productive role in the Arab-Israeli peace process. 10. </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Russians buy U.S. goods. As the U.S. economy stops and starts its way out of recession, most everyone agrees that boosting exports is a key component in the recovery. And Russia is a big market. U.S. companies such as Boeing, International Paper, and John Deere have invested billions in Russian subsidiaries and joint venture</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">s. In all, there are more than 1,000 U.S. companies doing business there today. They are in Russia not only to take advantage of the country's vast natural resources and highly skilled workers but also to meet the demand for American-branded goods. The Russian middle class wants consumer goods and the country's firms increasingly seek advanced U.S. equipment and machinery. Between 2004 and 2008, before the financial crisis hit, U.S.-Russia trade grew by more than 100 percent to over $36 billion annually, and although that figure dropped by a third in 2009, there is potential for an even better, more balanced trade relationship in the coming decade. </span><span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">In short, Russia is indispensible. As long as the United States participates in the global economy and has interests beyond its own borders, it will have no choice but to maintain relations with Russia. And good relations would be even better.</span></strong></span><br />

<strong>Space-related technologies are symptomatic of a will to power that uproots human beings from earth—the consequences of this technological mode of thought is dehumanization and global conflict</strong><br />
<strong>Gauthier 04</strong> (David, Phd Candidate in Poly Sci @ Lousiana State, &quot;MARTIN HEIDEGGER, EMMANUEL LEVINAS, AND THE POLITICS OF DWELLING,&quot; <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3808:http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11052004-163310/unrestricted/Gauthier_dis.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11052004-163310/unrestricted/Gauthier_dis.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11052004-163310/unrestricted/Gauthier_dis.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3808 -->)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">I have merely scratched the surface of Heidegger’s provocative interpretation of Nietzsche’s thought. Needless to say, Heidegger’s reading of Nietzsche has aroused much criticism, and this is not the place to explore the reading or the critique. Still, the preceding summary is useful in the fact that it illuminates Heidegger’s conclusion that Nietzsche’s thought brings the Western metaphysical tradition to an end. Heidegger does not argue that philosophy will cease to make its presence felt, however. Rather</span>, <span class="UnderlineChar">for Heidegger metaphysics lives on in the form of modern technology</span>. In Heidegger’s view, <span class="UnderlineChar">technology is the <strong>logical outgrowth</strong> of Western philosophy and its scientific offshoot. Philosophy engenders modern science, and modern science gives birth to technology</span>: “<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Philosophy turns into the empirical science of man, of all that can become for man the experiential object of his technology, the technology by which he establishes himself in the world by working on it in the manifold modes of making and shaping.” 4 And</span> <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong>lying at the heart of modern technology is</strong></span> Nietzsche’s <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong>will to power</strong></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">doctrine, the final manifestation of Western metaphysics. Viewed from this perspective, Heidegger’s encounter with Nietzsche brought him face-to-face with the metaphysical essence of technology. After his confrontation with Nietzsche, Heidegger would proceed to level a powerful critique of modern technology, a critique that was greatly assisted by the work of another German thinker, Ernst Jünger. For Heidegger, Jünger’s 1932 book The Worker (Der Arbeiter) illuminates how the worker is the paradigmatic figure of the modern technological world. 5 According to Jünger, in the modern world “each individual life becomes, ever more unambiguously, the life of a worker; and that, following the wars of knights, kings, and citizens, we now have wars of workers.” 6 However, whereas Jünger affirmed the arrival of a world “stamped” by the “form” (Gestalt) of the worker, Heidegger took a more negative view. In his writings on technology</span>, Heidegger<span class="UnderlineChar"> identified numerous </span>dangers that are concomitant with the rise of<span class="UnderlineChar"> modern </span>technology. <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong>Such dangers include technological dehumanization and increased conflict, among others</strong></span>. However, for Heidegger <span class="UnderlineChar">one of the most disturbing aspects of modern technology is the way in which it uproots human beings from the earth</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As he put it in the famous Der Spiegel interview: Everything is functioning. This is exactly what is so uncanny, that everything is functioning and that the functioning drives us more and more to even further functioning, and that technology tears men loose from the earth and uproots them. I do not know whether you were frightened, but</span> <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong>I</strong></span> at any rate <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong>was frightened when I saw pictures coming from the moon to the earth</strong></span>. We don’t need any atom bomb. <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong>The uprooting of man has already taken place. The only thing we have left is purely technological relationships</strong></span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is no longer the earth on which man lives. As you know, I recently had a long conversation with Rene Char of the Provence, the poet and resistance fighter. Rocket bases are being built in the Provence and the country is being devastated in an incredible way. This poet, who certainly cannot be suspected of sentimentality and of glorification of the idyllic, tells me that the uprooting of man which is taking place there will be the end, if poetry and thought do not once more succeed to a position of might without force. 7 For Heidegger and Char</span>, <span class="UnderlineChar">this uprooting is</span> not a future prospect, but <span class="UnderlineChar">a given fact</span>. Man no longer dwells on the earth. Moreover, <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong>the human connection to other human beings has been destroyed in a world where “the only thing we have left is purely technological relationships</strong></span>.” 8<br />
<br />
<strong>Such forms of technological thought only create the conditions that are the pre-requisite for nuclear wars—the consequences of such thought are more devastating than extinction</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Caputo 93</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 6pt;">—professor of Humanities at Syracuse, founder of weak theology, MA from Villanova, PhD from Bryn Mawr in Philosophy</span></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (John Caputo, <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Demythologizing Heidegger</span></em>, 1993 p. 136-141, [Miller])</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> In his essay &quot;The Thing&quot; </span><u>Heidegger remarks upon the prospect of a nuclear conflagration which could extinguish all human life</u><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">:</span></strong> <u>Man stares at what the explosion of the atom bomb could bring with it. He does not see that <span class="UnderlineChar1"><strong>what has long since taken place and has already happened expels from itself</strong> <strong>as its last emission the atom bomb and its explosion</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">—not to mention the single nuclear bomb, whose triggering, thought through to its utmost poten­tial, might be enough to snuff out all life on earth. (VA, 165/PLT, 166). In a parallel passage, he remarks: ... [Man finds himself in a perilous situation. Why? Just because a third world war might break out unexpectedly and bring about the complete annihilation of humanity and the destruction of the earth? No. </span><u>In this dawning atomic age a far greater danger threatens</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">—precisely when the danger of a third world war has been removed. A strange assertion! Strange indeed, but only as long as we do not meditate. (G, 27/DT, 56). </span><u>The thinker is menaced by a more radical threat, is endangered by a more radical explosiveness,</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> let us say by a more essential bomb, capable of an emission (hinauswerfen) of such primordiality that the explosion (Explosion) of the atom bomb would be but its last ejection. Indeed, the point is even stronger: </span><u>even a</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> nuclear bomb, or a </span><u>wholesale exchange of nuclear bombs between nuclear megapowers, which would put an end to &quot;all life on earth</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">,&quot; which would annihilate every living being, human and nonhuman, </span><span class="UnderlineChar1"><strong>is a deriva­tive threat compared to this more primordial destructiveness.</strong></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> There is a pros­pect that is more dangerous and uncanny—unheimhcher—than the mere fact that everything could be blown apart (Auseinanderplatzen von allem). There is something that would bring about more homelessness, more not-being­at-home (un-Heimlich) than the destruction of cities and towns and of their inhabitants. </span><u>What is truly</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> unsettling, dis-placing (ent-setzen), the thing that is really </span><u>terrifying</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (das Entsetzende), </span><u>is not the prospect of the destruction of</u><u>human life on the planet,</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of annihilating its places and its settlers. Further­more, this truly terrifying thing has already happened and has actually been around for quite some time. This more essential explosive has already been set off; things have already been destroyed, even though the nuclear holocaust has not yet happened. What then is the truly terrifying? </span><span class="UnderlineChar1"><strong>The terrifying is that which sets everything that is outside</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">(heraussitzl) </span><span class="UnderlineChar1"><strong>of its own essence</strong></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (Wesen)'. What is this dis-placing [Entsetzendel? It shows itself and conceals itself in the way in which everything presences (anwest), namely, in the fact that despite all conquest of distances the nearness of things remains absent. (VA, 165/P1.T, 166) The truly terrifying explosion, the more essential destruction is that which dis-places a thing front its Wesen, its essential nature, its ownmost coming to presence. </span><span class="UnderlineChar1"><strong>The essential destruction occurs in the Being of a thing, not in its entitative actuality</strong></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">; it is a disaster that befalls Being, not beings. The destruc­tiveness of this more essential destruction is aimed not directly at man but at &quot;things&quot; (Dirge), in the distinctively Heideggerian sense. The Wesen of things is their nearness, and it is nearness which has been decimated by technological proximity and speed. </span><u>Things have ceased to have true nearness and farness, have sunk into the indifference of that which, being a great distance away, can be brought close in the flash of a technological instant</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Thereby, </span><u>things have ceased to be things, have sunk into indifferent nothingness</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Something profoundly disruptive has occurred on the level of the Being of things that has already destroyed them, already cast them out of (herauswerfen¬) their Being. Beings have been brought close to Us technologically; enor­mous distances are spanned in seconds. Satellite technology can make events occurring on the other side of the globe present in a flash; supersonic jets cross the great oceans in a few hours. Yet, far from bringing things &quot;near,&quot; this </span><u>massive technological removal of distance has actually abolished nearness, for nearness <span class="UnderlineChar1"><strong>is</strong> <strong>precisely what withdraws in the midst of such technological frenzy</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Nearness is the nearing of earth and heavens, mortals and gods, in the handmade jug, or the old bridge at Heidelberg, and it can be experienced only in the quiet meditativeness which renounces haste. Thus the real destruction of the thing, the one that abolishes its most essen­tial Being and Wesen, occurs when the scientific determination of things pre­vails and compels our assent. The thingliness of the jug is to serve as the place which gathers together the fruit of earth and sun in mortal offering to the gods above. But all that is destroyed when pouring this libation becomes instead the displacement of air by a liquid; at that moment science has suc­ceeded in reducing the jug-thing to a non-entity (Nichtige). Science, or rather </span><u>the dominion of scientific representation</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, the rule of science over what comes to presence, what is called the Wesen, which is at work in science and technol­ogy, that </span><u>is the truly explosive-destructive thing</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, the more essential dis-placing. The gathering of earth and sky, mortals and gods, that holds sway in the thing—for &quot;gathering&quot; is what the Old High German thing means—is scat­tered to the four winds, and that </span><u>more essential annihilation occurs <span class="UnderlineChar1"><strong>even if the bomb never goes off</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">:</span><u>Science's knowledge,</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> which is compelling within its own sphere, the sphere of objects, </span><span class="UnderlineChar1"><strong>already had annihilated things long before the atom bomb exploded</strong></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><u>The bomb's explosion is only the grossest of all gross confirmations of the long-since accomplished annihilation of the thing</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. (VA, 168/PLT, 170J When </span><span class="UnderlineChar1"><strong>things have been annihilated in their thingness, the mushroom clouds of the bomb cannot be far behind</strong></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. So whether or not the bomb goes off is not essential, does not penetrate to the essence of what comes to presence in the present age of technological proximities and reduced distances. </span><u>What is essential is the loss of genuine nearness</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, authentic and true nearness, </span><u>following <span class="UnderlineChar1"><strong>which the actual physical annihilation of planetary life would be a</strong> </span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">&quot;gross&quot; confirmation, an unrefined, external, physical destruction that would be but a follow-up, another </span>afterthought, <u>a less subtle counterpart to</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> a more inward, profound, essential, authentic, </span><span class="UnderlineChar1"><strong>ontological destruction</strong></span><u>.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>Our alternative isn’t a fatalistic rejection of technology—rather rejection is a form of releasement that reorients our relationship towards technological modes of thought</strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Botha 02</span> (Catherine, Dept. of Philosophy @ Univ. of Pretoria, “Heidegger, Technology and Ecology,” South African Journal of Philosophy, Vol 22, Issue 2, p. ebscohost)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Homelessness is the mood of the technological age. Rediscovering our worldly home as threatened, signals the “restoring surmounting” of technology. Memory or recollective thought chiefly summons this sense of a threatened sanctuary. Recollecting our worldly habitat not only fosters resistance to Das Gestell, but also Provides guidance in how human being relates to the products of technology. Heidegger acknowledges that</span> <u>we need not reject the products or skills of technology</u>. He says that <u>we can not repudiate the technological world of to day as the “work of the devil”, nor should we destroy it</u>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">assuming that it does not do this to it self (Heidegger, 1993:330</span>). <u>Heidegger does not advocate a retreat to a pre-technological state of being</u>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">nor does he suggest that we fatalistically re sign our selves to the victory of Das Gestell</span>. <strong><u>Fatalism is no answer</u></strong> <strong><u>because it reflects the same absence of thought that is evidenced in a naive complacency with technological progress</u></strong>. <u>We can say both “yes” and “no” to technology <strong>by having an attitude of releasement</strong> <strong>toward things</strong></u>. In other words, <u>although it is crucial to perceive the danger of our technological constructions lest they dominate us, it is unnecessary to reject them completely</u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The alternative to be coming slaves of our own machines is not simply to become their masters. </span><strong><u>The goal is to integrate technology within a bounded worldly dwelling no longer ordered by possessive mastery</u></strong>. <u>The attitude required to free ourselves from possessive mastery and achieve an appropriate relation to technology is one of <strong>awaiting and receiving</strong></u>, openness and releasement. <span class="UnderlineChar1">Releasement towards things and openness to the mystery <strong>grant us the possibility of dwelling in the world in a different way</strong></span>: <span style="font-size: 8pt;">a way where the mood of homelessness has been displaced</span>. <strong><u>Until this occurs, our attempts to control the products of technology will only sustain our subordination to it</u></strong>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The irony is that the “freedom” that has been nurtured for two and a half millennia in the West has encouraged this technological servitude</span><br />
