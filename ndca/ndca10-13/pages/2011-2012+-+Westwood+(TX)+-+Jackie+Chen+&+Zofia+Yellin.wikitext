The Internet-based group of </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">experts</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> who prepared the report for the NSSO </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">recommended that the U.S. government organize itself to tackle the problem of developing SSP; use its resources to "retire a major portion of the technical risk for business development; establish tax and other policies to encourage private development</span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">of SSP, and "become an early demonstrator/adopter/customer" of SSP to spur its development. That, in turn, could spur development of space launch and other industries. Damphousse said a functioning reusable launch vehicle - preferably single-stage-to-orbit - probably would be required to develop a full-scale SSP infrastructure in geostationary orbit. That, in turn, could enable utilization of the moon and exploration of Mars under NASA's vision for space exploration.</span>//

=Framework= 

Our interpretation of debate is that the 1AC has to answer the question of the resolution with a normative policy affirmation of the topic and the affirmative has to defend the political implementation of a specific plan of action

<span class="cite">__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is fair:</span>__</span>

# <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Grammar</span>

Absent grammar there is no predictable way to establish limits – research is derived from the resolution and it’s the only objective point of contention for debate to begin

# Limits –
There are an infinite number of competing frameworks to evaluate a debate
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mearsheimer 1995</span><span style="color: black;"> (John, Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, International Security, Winter 94/95)</span>
<span style="color: black;">In fact, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">change is always possible with </span>
<span style="color: black;">AND </span>
<span style="color: black;">other and world politics will be more peaceful.</span>

Finite limits are key to decision making and effective debate and a middle ground can be reached
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Lutz</span>**,** Prof PolSci U of Huston, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2k</span> (Donald, Political Theory and Partisan Politics p 46)
The surprising fact is not that politicians tend
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">AND </span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">of political theory or not trying at all.</span>

Limits key to fairness – they allow any individual ideology or theory or cause to become an affirmative which negates our ability to effectively research the aff position. Research is predicated off the resolution and has to be limited – even if you knew every aff if there were 1,000 you still couldn’t be prepared.

We need closure to engage in the substance of the aff
<span style="color: black;">Ruth Lesl </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">Shively</span><span style="color: black;">, Professor of Politics at Texas A&M, </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">2K</span><span style="color: black;"> [//Partisan Politics and Political Theory//, p. 181-2]</span>
In most cases, however, our agreements
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">AND </span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">contestation rests on</span> some <span style="font-size: 10pt;">basic agreement</span> or harmony.


# Ground
1. Aff can claim anything from racism bad to violence bad – unpredictable affirmations means we can’t answer their methodology and are forced to impact turn. Turns the case – researching [impact turn to the aff] undoes whatever ethical improvements they have made so far.
2. They dodge our best arguments – we can’t read a DA to the resolution or utilize any of the research we have already done. Proves their impact turns are not a fair test of framework because we couldn’t predict their offense.


Impact is fairness
Debate is a game – it has established norms which guide debate. Even if those norms are bad the only way to create effective change is to play by those norms otherwise the aff faces uncontrollable backlash

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fair debate is good – their solvency requires debate to survive and no one stays in an activity which is inherently unfair. This is different than their privilege arguments because they change the structural foundations of the activity.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Switch side debate uniquely good – forces the majority to listen to dissent and understand both sides of the issue. Adhering to the norms of switch side debate means debaters have to engage the substance of the 1AC.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Topical version of their aff is </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Turns case - Institutional approaches are the only way to avoid the collapse of all movements and effectively challenge the flawed state policies.</span>

Whether or not parts of the jobs bill actually pass is irrelevant to the second half of the disad. As long as Obama is sending a clear economic message, he can convince the voters that Republicans are just being obstructionist, winning him re-election. That’s our Sullivan & Bull evidence.

The plan derails that message – it’s all about jobs and the aff costs money without creating any, especially for the middle class.

==The Jew K== 
March, 1946, Hitler is dead, the Japanese have surrendered and the race to divide Europe is on. Operation Paperclip, the CIA’s plan to smuggle and incorporate Nazi scientists into the American military-industrial complex, is now in full swing. The last eight years has seen more than a bloody war, a violent genocide, the holocaust, which resulted in the deaths of millions of Jewish peoples and political enemies of the Nazi state, but death was not the worst fate… Millions of prisoners ended up in the labor camps like Peenemunde and Mittlewerk, working to build the Nazi rocket program which caused thousands of deaths daily. We came, we saw, we conquered and WE HAD TO HAVE THOSE ROCKETS. But back in Washington, Security briefs never mentioned the means of their research and instead focused on how to fight the Soviets, and so was born the justification for whitewashing the records and thus the war crimes of Nazi scientists in the name of US success. These scientists didn’t just get out of jail free, they brought their research and rocket technology and established a framework for US space exploration built on the backs of those enslaved during the Nazi occupation. Using the ends of the advantages of the aff as logic to ignore the means reuses and justifies the excuses of Operation Paperclip and chooses to ignore atrocities of the holocaust in the name of a “greater good”… maybe even a “final solution”.

the affirmative is not a benign increase in exploration – its action is founded in a model of space exploration that upholds Nazi scientific research founded on the backs of slave labor and experiments committed in concentration camps and imported to the US by Warnher Von Braun.

Humans are bred only to suffer meaninglessly. History shows that on average being born is worse than never being born. The affirmatives attempt to stop suicide simply reflects the ongoing agony of existence. birth is playing Russian roulette with your child’s future.

Such is the strength … their future offspring.

Being born is always bad: The benefits of life will never outweigh the pain because the absence of pain is good even if that good is not enjoyed by anyone whereas the absence of pleasure is only bad if a subject is deprived of that pleasure.
