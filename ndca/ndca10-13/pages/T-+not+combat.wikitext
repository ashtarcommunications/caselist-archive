<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 12pt;">WHAT IS OVERSEAS MILITARY PRESENCE?  </span></span>
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Our working definition of US overseas military presence is that it consists of all the US military assets in overseas areas that are engaged in relatively routine, regular, non-combat activities or functions. </span></span>
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 12pt;">By this definition, </span>__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">forces that are located overseas may or may not be engaging in presence activities. If they are engaging in combat</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"> (such as Operation Enduring Freedom), </span>__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">or are involved in a one-time non-combat action</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"> (such as an unscheduled carrier battle group deployment from the United States </span>__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">aimed at calming or stabilizing an emerging crisis situation), then they are not engaging in presence activities</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 12pt;">. Thus, an asset that is located (or present) overseas may or may not be “engaged in presence activities,” may or may not be “doing presence.”  </span></span>
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">We have thus far defined presence activities chiefly in “negative” terms—what they are not.</span>__ __<span style="font-family: Georgia;">In more positive terms</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 12pt;">, what exactly are presence activities, i.e., what do presence activities actually entail doing?  </span></span>
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Overseas military presence activities are generally viewed as a subset of the overall class of activities that the US government uses in its efforts to promote important military/security objectives</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"> [Dismukes, 1994]. </span>__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">A variety of recurrent, overseas military activities are normally placed under the “umbrella” concept of military presence. These include</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"> but are not limited to </span>__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">US military efforts overseas to train foreign militaries; to improve inter-operability of US and friendly forces; to peacefully and visibly demonstrate US commitment </span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 12pt;">and/or ability to defend US interests; </span>__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">to gain intelligence</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"> and familiarity with a locale; to conduct </span>__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">peacekeeping</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"> activities; </span>__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">and to position relevant, capable US military assets such that they are likely to be available sooner rather than later in case an evolving security operation or contingency should call for them</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 12pt;">. </span></span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">1. limits – allowing combat missions allows affs to change specific strategies in Afghanistan or Iraq, like ending cluster bombing without actually reducing forces themselves, it explodes the literature base </span></span>
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> </span></span>
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">2. negative ground – presence missions are about deterrence and reassurance – including combat missions avoids core negative disads, like deterrence because they are already engaged in combat. </span></span>
