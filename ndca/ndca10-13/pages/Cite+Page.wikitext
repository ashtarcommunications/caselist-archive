<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 8pt;">In order to capture the full importance of concepts such as physis and primordial nature, it is necessary to introduce, very briefly, the background theory to which such concepts are largely a response.

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">A technological approach to the world forces a conceptualization of things as commodities to be used and manipulated by humans.

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">What, then, is the essence of technology? In searching for an answer to this all-important question, Heidegger (as he so often does) looks back to the ancient Greeks to locate techne as a form of poiesis, i.e. a bringing-forth. It is a way of bringing something forth from concealment to unconcealment. Technology, simply put, is a mode of revealing which brings something into presence.</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: Calibri; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.fordham.edu/philosophy/fps/symposia/2001fall/condella.htm#_ftn3|http://www.fordham.edu/philosophy/fps/symposia/2001fall/condella.htm - _ftn3]]</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> **__As a form of revealing or unconcealment,__** </span>
