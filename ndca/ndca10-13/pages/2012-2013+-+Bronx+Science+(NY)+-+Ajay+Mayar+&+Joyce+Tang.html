<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The willful lack of US disaster preparedness is a crucial aspect of interior colonization—so-called natural disasters are not acts of god, they are planned and calculated within the state itself because they provide an opportunity to map neoliberal economics onto racial geographies. Economies of anti-blackness coalesce in disaster, where the only currency is the fungible living corpses of spatially excluded populations. The state’s only function becomes militarizing these zones of sacrifice so that the struggle for survival is a criminalized justification for the destruction of all political hope. </span><br />

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 13pt;">How we articulate disasters is not just a momentary or exceptional question—it is crucial to the very definition of life and death under neo-colonial sovereignty. Unless we attack the underlying spatial logic of disposability, every coming disaster is another opportunity for neo-colonial powers to militarize certain populations marked for death, and invisibilize the process. Instead of lurching from one crisis to the next, we must recognize economies of blackness: the disaster is here, the disaster is now. </span><br />

<em>¶ 14PROGRESS REPORT OF THE INTERAGENCY CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION TASK FORCE - 2010 PART TWO. THE IMPORTANCE OF ADAPTATION¶ Climate change is affecting many aspects of our society, our livelihoods, and our environment. Communities across the Nation are experiencing climate change impacts, such as changes in average temperatures, more extreme weather events, and rising sea levels.3 Historically, societies¶ and ecosystems have adjusted or adapted to natural variability in climatic conditions. However, the pace and impacts of climate change are occurring outside the range of past experiences, rendering many of our current adaptive mechanisms insufficient. In addition, climate change impacts do not act in isolation; rather, climate-related changes interact with and often magnify the impacts of existing non- climatic stressors. Decision-makers across the Nation will need to take proactive measures to better understand and prepare for current and future changes in climate conditions.¶There is scientific consensus that the Earth’s climate is changing due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere.4,5,6 As a result, increased energy trapped in the atmosphere and the oceans due to these higher concentrations is already leading to impacts, including warmer average water and air temperatures(Figure 1), in the United States and globally.¶ The Obama Administration is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to minimize the future impacts of climate change. However, the climate impacts we are observing today will continue to increase, at least in the short-term, regardless of the degree to which greenhouse gas emissions are managed. This is driven by factors such as the long-lived nature of certain greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the absorption of heat by the Earth’s oceans. Even if we reduce our emissions, global average temperatures are predicted to rise over the next 100 years (Figure 2).7 In the long-term, theability to manage greenhouse gas emissions and moderate or reduce atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will affect the magnitude of the impacts to which we will need to adapt.8 Therefore, mitigation and adaptation are inextricably linked, and both are required in order to reduce the impacts of climate change</em><br />

<em>Impacts on Roadways Higher temperatures<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> can cause pavement to soften and expand.

With these changes, it could become more costly to build and maintain roads and highways. On the other hand, certain areas may experience cost savings and improved mobility from reduced snowfall and less-frequent winter storms since warmer winters may lead to reductions in snow and ice removal, as well as salting requirements. [1] [2<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">]¶ Climate change is projected to concentrate rainfall into more intense storms. </span>Heavy rains<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> may </span>result in flooding<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, which </span>could disrupt<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> traffic, delay construction activities, and </span>weaken <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">or wash out the soil and culverts that support </span>roads, tunnels, and bridges<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.</span> [1] [2<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">]¶ Roadway damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005</span>. Source: NASA (2005)<span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Exposure to </span>flooding and extreme snow<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> events also </span>shortens the life expectancy of highways and roads.The stress of water and snow may cause damage, requiring more frequent maintenance, repairs, and rebuilding. Road infrastructure<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in coastal areas </span>is particularly sensitive to<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> more </span>frequent<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and permanent </span>flooding from sea level rise and storm surges.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Approximately 60,000 miles of coastal roads in the United States are already exposed to flooding from coastal storms and high waves</span>. Furthermore, major highways in coastal areas serve as critical evacuation routes. Evacuation routes must be protected from flooding and damage so they may be used for emergencies. [2] [3] In some locations, warmer temperatures are projected to cause more winter precipitation to fall as rain instead of snow. Winter flooding could occur more frequently, if the frozen ground cannot absorb precipitation. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Landslides and wash-outs could also occur more frequently, as saturated soils are exposed to more rainwater. </span>Drought<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in areas such as the Southwest </span>could increase <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the likelihood of </span>wildfires that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">reduce visibility and </span>threaten roads and infrastructure. [1] [2] Impacts on Ice Roads <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Freezing temperatures are required for ice roads in Alaska. </span>These are frozen routes used to connect northern communities, as well as the oil, gas, and mining industries. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The tundra beneath these frozen roads is fragile, so transportation is limited to periods when the road is frozen. Warming temperatures would reduce the number of days ice roads are open, limiting transportation access to these areas</span>. Impacts on Vehicles <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As temperatures increase, many types of vehicles can overheat, and tires will deteriorate more quickly. But milder winters, reductions in the number of cold days, delays in winter freezing, and earlier spring thaws may reduce cold-weather damage to vehicles. </span>[1]Impacts on Railways <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Extreme heat can cause rails to buckle</span>. Source: Volpe National Transportation Systems Center High temperatures cause rail tracks to expand and buckle.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> More frequent and severe heat waves may require track repairs or speed restrictions to avoid derailments.</span> [1] <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Heavy precipitation could also lead to delays and disruption</span>. For example, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the June 2008 Midwest floods closed major east-west rail lines for several days. </span>Tropical storms and hurricanes can <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">also leave debris on railways, </span>disrupt<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ing </span>rail travel and freight transport. [1] [2] Like roadways, coastal <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">railways and subways are subject to inundation from sea level rise and storm surges.</span> This is particularly true in underground pathways and tunnels, which are often already below sea level. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Increased flooding from heavy precipitation and storm surges could disrupt rail travel as well as freight operations. </span></em>Damages from flooding may require rail lines and subway infrastructure to be rebuilt or raised in future expansion projects.// [1] [2] Impacts on Air Transportation Infrastructure In addition to causing closures or delays, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">flooding may damage facilities, including airstrips</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Some of the busiest airports in the United States are located in low-lying coastal areas, making them particularly vulnerable to inundation.</span> For example, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, many critical transportation infrastructure facilities</span> (including Newark and LaGuardia airports) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">lie within the range of current and projected 50-year coastal storm surges</span>. Many airstrips in Alaska are built on permafrost. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Warmer temperatures would thaw permafrost and cause soils to settle, potentially damaging the foundation and structure of key infrastructure. </span>Runways and airports<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> may </span>require rebuilding, relocation, or increased maintenance. [1] [2] Impacts on Ships and Sea Lanes<span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span>Ships are sensitive to many factors, including the depth of a channel and the extent of sea ice. Increasing temperatures could reduce the amount of sea ice in many important shipping lanes, extending the shipping season. Warmer winters will likely lead to less snow and ice accumulation on vessels, decks, and rigging in marine transportation.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> In the Arctic, warmer temperatures </span>could also <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">open up the possibility of a Northwest Passage, which </span>could reduce shipping times and distances<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.</span> However, these new passages <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">may </span>also<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> provide a pathway for invasive species transport and survival. </span>[1] [2]<span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span>Shipping lanes experiencing sea level rise will be able to accommodate larger ships, reducing shipping costs. However, higher sea levels will mean lower clearance under waterway bridges. In inland waterways where water levels are expected to decline, as in the Great Lakes, ships could face weight restrictions, as channels become too shallow. [1] [2]<span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Changes in precipitation can affect shipping in many ways. </span>Flooding could close shipping channels<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, and increased runoff from extreme precipitation events could cause silt and debris to build up, leading to shallower channels. Changes in precipitation patterns could also affect the rate at which sediments accumulate, which may also make existing channels shallower and less accessible.</span> In areas experiencing increasing drought, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">water levels could periodically decrease, limiting inland shipping on rivers</span>. More severe storms could increase disruptions in marine travel and shipping.<br />

In earlyJanuary 2009, a severe winter storm hit the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Heavy snow, followed by abundant, warm rain led to extreme flooding and destructive landslides throughout the state of Washington, forcing emergency closures of multiple state and local highway routes, including Interstate 5 and Interstate 90, and the interruption of freight and passenger rail service. The economic consequences from storm effects on the transportation system, including freight disruptions and infrastructure damage, were estimated in the tens of millions of dollars. Governor Christine Gregoire eventually requested disaster relief from the federal government (Gregoire, 2009). However, this weather event was not an isolated case. During the previous winter, a similar storm created crippling conditions in the same areas. The costs of freight delays alone were estimated around $75 million for the winter storm and flooding that closed Interstate 5 and Interstate 90 in the winter of 2007-08 (WSDOT, 2008). While we must be careful to distinguish individual extreme weather events, such as those above, from long-term trends in climate, consensus in the scientific community projects an increased frequency and intensity of major storms, temperature increases, and changes in seasonal precipitation as a very likely outcome of global climate change. Patterns that today are considered “extreme” may instead become a new normal. This is a potentially very costly problem as our existing surface transportation system has been designed and constructed based upon historical climate trends. Assumptions that have been used historically to design facilities and respond to weather-related “emergencies” may no longer work. A transportation system built without planning for changing climate will likely experience a variety of costly impacts in terms of damage and traveler delay. Among these impacts are inundation of coastal roads from SLR; erosion of roadways and bridge supports from heavy precipitation and storms; increased road and rail maintenance due to flooding and temperature extremes; and travel delays due to weather events and more widespread wildfires. As a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (28 percent nationally), transportation was one of the early sectors to begin responding to the climate change threat, primarily through efforts to account for and reduce the amount of GHGs released into the atmosphere (Center for Transportation and the Environment, 2008). Strategies involve a wide range of activities, including improvements in vehicle and fuel technologies, and land use planning and transportation operation improvements that reduce vehicle miles travelled and increase the overall efficiency of travel (Table 1). These activities are collectively referred to as climate mitigation (Cambridge Systematics, 2009). Recent studies indicate that climate change planning efforts conducted by governments have thus far overwhelmingly focused on mitigation strategies to reduce GHGs, while relatively few are working towards climate adaptation(Wheeler, 2008).<br />

Transportation is such an integral part of daily life in the United States that few pause to consider its importance. Yet the Nation’s strong intermodal network of highways, public transit, rail, marine, and aviation is central to our ability to work, go to school, enjoy leisure time, maintain our homes, and stay in touch with friends and family. U.S. businesses depend on reliable transportation services to receive materials and transport products to their customers; a robust transportation network is essential to the economy. In short, a sound transportation system is vital to the Nation’s social and economic future. Transportation professionals – including planners, designers, engineers, financial specialists, ecologists, safety experts, and others – work hard to ensure that U.S. communities have access to safe and dependable transportation services. Given the ongoing importance of the Nation’s transportation system, it is appropriate to consider what effect climate change may have on this essential network. Through a regional case study of the central Gulf Coast, this report begins to examine the potential implications of climate change on transportation infrastructure, operations, and services. Investments in transportation are substantial and result in infrastructure that lasts for decades. Transportation plans and designs should, therefore, be carefully considered and well informed by a range of factors, including consideration of climate variability and change. Climate also affects the safety, operations, and maintenance of transportation infrastructure and systems. This research investigates the potential impacts of climate variability and change on transportation, and it assesses how planners and managers may incorporate this information into their decisions to ensure a reliable and robust future transportation network. This report does not contain recommendations about specific facilities or adaptation strategies, but rather seeks to contribute to the information available so that States and local communities can make more informed decisions when planning for the future.¶ The climate models used to estimate temperature changes agree that it will be warmer in the future. According to the IPCC report, global average warming is expected to be about 0.4°C (0.72°F) during the next 20 years. Even if the concentrations of all greenhouse gases and aerosols had been stabilized at 2000 levels, warming of 0.2°C (0.36°F) would be expected during this period (IPCC, 2007). Over the longer term, the IPCC models project average global temperature increases ranging from 1.1°C (1.98°F) to 6.4°C (11.5°F) by the end of the 21st century, although climate responses in specific regions will vary. These projections are the result of reviewing a robust set of global climate models under a variety of future scenarios – using a range of assumptions for future economic activity and energy use – for the Earth as a whole. The average increase in temperature may not be as important to the transportation community as the changes in extreme temperature, which also are expected to increase. Over the last 50 years, the frequency of cold days and nights has declined, while hot days, hot nights, and heat waves have become more frequent. The number of days with temperature above 32°C (90°F) and 38°C (100°F) has been increasing since 1970, as has the intensity and length of periods of drought. The IPCC report finds that it is virtually certain that the next century will witness warmer and more frequent hot days and nights over most land areas (IPCC, 2007). Increasing temperatures have the potential to affect multiple modes of transportation, primarily impacting surface transportation. The transportation impacts mentioned most often in the literature included pavement damage; rail buckling; less lift and fuel efficiency for aircraft; and the implications of lower inland water levels, thawing permafrost, reduced ice cover on seaways, and an increase in vegetation. These are discussed in greater detail below:¶ • Pavement damage – The quality of highway pavement was identified as a potential issue for temperate climates, where more extreme summer temperatures and/or more frequent freeze/thaw cycles may be experienced. Extremely hot days, over an extended period of time, could lead to the rutting of highway pavement and the more rapid breakdown of asphalt seal binders, resulting in cracking, potholing, and bleeding. This, in turn, could damage the structural integrity of the road and/or cause the pavement to become more slippery when wet.Adaptation measures mentioned included more frequent maintenance, milling out ruts, and the laying of more heat resistant asphalt.¶ • Rail buckling – Railroads could encounter rail buckling more frequently in temperate climates that experience extremely hot temperatures. If unnoticed, rail buckling can result in derailment of trains. Peterson (2008) noted, “Lower speeds and shorter trains, to shorten braking distance, and lighter loads to reduce track stress are operational impacts.” Adaptation measures included better monitoring of rail temperatures and ultimately more maintenance of the track, replacing it when needed.¶ • Vegetation growth – The growing season for deciduous trees that shed their leaves may be extended, causing more slipperiness on railroads and roads and visual obstructions. Possible adaptation measures included better management of the leaf foliage and planting more low-maintenance vegetation along transportation corridors to act as buffers (Wooler, 2004).¶ • Reductions in aircraft lift and efficiency – Higher temperatures would reduce air density, decreasing both lift and the engine efficiency of aircraft. As a result, longer runways and/or more powerful airplanes would be required. However, one analyst projected that technical advances would minimize the need for runway redesign as aircraft become more powerful and efficient (Wooler, 2004).¶ • Reduced water levels – Changes in water levels were discussed in relation to marine transport. Inland waterways such as the Great Lakes and Mississippi River could experience lower water levels due to increased temperatures and evaporation; these lower water levels would mean that ships and barges would not be able to carry as much weight. Adaptation measures included reducing cargo loads, designing vessels to require less draft, or dredging the water body to make it deeper.¶ • Reduced ice cover – Reduced ice cover was generally considered a positive impact of increasing temperatures in the literature. For example, a study conducted by John D. Lindeberg and George M. Albercook, which was included in the Report of the Great Lakes Regional Assessment Group for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, stated, “the costs of additional dredging [due to lower water levels] could be partially mitigated by the benefits of additional shipping days on the [Great] Lakes caused by less persistent ice cover” (Sousounis, 2000, p. 41). Additionally, arctic sea passages could open; for example, the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment noted, “projected reductions in sea-ice extent are likely to improve access along the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage” (Instanes et al., 2005, p. 934). However, negative environmental and security impacts also may result from reduced ice cover as well from as the increased level of shipping. These are discussed below in the subsection on indirect impacts (Section 1.3.6.).¶ • Thawing permafrost – The implications of thawing permafrost for Arctic infrastructure receive considerable attention in the literature. Permafrost is the foundation upon which much of the Arctic’s infrastructure is built. The literature consistently noted that as the permafrost thaws the infrastructure will become unstable – an effect being experienced today. Roads, railways, and airstrips are all vulnerable to the thawing of permafrost.Adaptation measures vary depending on the amount of permafrost that underlies any given piece of infrastructure. The literature suggested that some assets will only need rehabilitation, other assets will need to be relocated, and different construction methods will need to be used, including the possibility of installing cooling mechanisms. According to the Arctic Research Commission, “roads, railways, and airstrips placed on ice-rich continuous permafrost will generally require relocation to well-drained natural foundations or replacement with substantially different construction methods” (U.S. Arctic Research Commission Permafrost Task Force, 2003, p. 29).¶ • Other – Other impacts of increasing temperatures included a reduction in ice loads on structures (such as bridges and piers), which could eventually allow them to be designed for less stress, and a lengthening of construction seasons due to fewer colder days in traditionally cold climates.<br />

In addition, climate change risks compound the other challenges which are already faced by these countries, including tackling poverty, improving health care, increasing food security and improving access to sources of energy.

In low-latitude regions, where most developing countries are located, reductions of about 5 to 10 per cent in the yields of major cereal crops are projected even in the case of small temperature increases of around 1° C. Although it is expected that local temperature increases of between 1° C and 3° C would have benefi cial impacts on agricultural outputs in mid- to high-latitude regions, warming beyond this range will most likely result in increasingly negative impacts for these regions also. According to some studies, crop yields in some African countries could fall by up to 50 per cent by 2020, with net revenues from crops falling by as much as 90 per cent by 2100. Depending on the location, agriculture will also be prone to water scarcity due to loss of glacial meltwater and reduced rainfall or droughts. Tourism is another industry that may be particularly vulnerable to climate change, for example, through changes in snow cover, coastal degradation and extreme weather.

<strong>With the global financial system in serious trouble, is America's geostrategic dominance likely to diminish? If so, what would that mean? One immediate implication of the crisis that began on Wall Street and spread across the world is that the primary instruments of U.S. foreign policy will be crimped. The next president will face an entirely new and adverse fiscal position. Estimates of this year's federal budget deficit already show that it has jumped $237 billion from last year, to $407 billion. With families and businesses hurting, there will be calls for various and expensive domestic relief programs. In the face of this onrushing river of red ink, both Barack Obama and John McCain have been reluctant to lay out what portions of their programmatic wish list they might defer or delete. Only Joe Biden has suggested a possible reduction -- foreign aid. This would be one of the few popular cuts, but in budgetary terms it is a mere grain of sand. Still, Sen. Biden's comment hints at where we may be headed: toward a major reduction in America's world role, and perhaps even a new era of financially-induced isolationism. Pressures to cut defense spending, and to dodge the cost of waging two wars, already intense before this crisis, are likely to mount. Despite the success of the surge, the war in Iraq remains deeply unpopular. Precipitous withdrawal -- attractive to a sizable swath of the electorate before the financial implosion -- might well become even more popular with annual war bills running in the hundreds of billions. Protectionist sentiments are sure to grow stronger as jobs disappear in the coming slowdown. Even before our current woes, calls to save jobs by restricting imports had begun to gather support among many Democrats and some Republicans. In a prolonged recession, gale-force winds of protectionism will blow. Then there are the dolorous consequences of a potential collapse of the world's financial architecture. For decades now, Americans have enjoyed the advantages of being at the center of that system. The worldwide use of the dollar, and the stability of our economy, among other things, made it easier for us to run huge budget deficits, as we counted on foreigners to pick up the tab by buying dollar-denominated assets as a safe haven. Will this be possible in the future? Meanwhile, traditional foreign-policy challenges are multiplying. The threat from al Qaeda and Islamic terrorist affiliates has not been extinguished. Iran and North Korea are continuing on their bellicose paths, while Pakistan and Afghanistan are progressing smartly down the road to chaos. Russia's new militancy and China's seemingly relentless rise also give cause for concern. If America now tries to pull back from the world stage, it will leave a dangerous power vacuum. The stabilizing effects of our presence in Asia, our continuing commitment to Europe, and our position as defender of last resort for Middle East energy sources and supply lines could all be placed at risk. In such a scenario there are shades of the 1930s, when global trade and finance ground nearly to a halt, the peaceful democracies failed to cooperate, and aggressive powers led by the remorseless fanatics who rose up on the crest of economic disaster exploited their divisions. Today we run the risk that roguestatesmay choose to becomeever morereckless withtheirnucleartoys, just at our moment of maximum vulnerability. The aftershocks of the financial crisis will almost certainly rock our principal strategic competitors even harder than they will rock us. The dramatic free fall of the Russian stock market has demonstrated the fragility of a state whose economic performance hinges on high oil prices, now driven down by the global slowdown. China is perhaps even more fragile, its economic growth depending heavily on foreign investment and access to foreign markets. Both will now be constricted, inflicting economic pain and perhaps even sparking unrest in a country where political legitimacy rests on progress in the long march to prosperity. None of this is good news if the authoritarian leaders of these countries seek to divert attention from internal travails with external adventures. As for our democratic friends, the present crisis comes when many European nations are struggling to deal with decades of anemic growth, sclerotic governance and an impending demographic crisis. Despite its past dynamism, Japan faces similar challenges. India is still in the early stages of its emergence as a world economic and geopolitical power. What does this all mean? There is no substitute for America on the world stage. The choice we have before us is between the potentially disastrous effects of disengagement and the stiff price tag of continued American leadership.</strong><br />

<strong>The second point is that strengthening the world trading system is essential to America's wider global objectives. Fighting terrorism, reducing poverty, improving health, integrating China and other countries in the global economy — all of these issues are linked, in one way or another, to world trade. This is not to say that trade is the answer to all America's economic concerns; only that meaningful solutions are inconceivable without it. The world trading system is the linchpin of today's global order — underpinning its security as well as its prosperity. A successful WTO is an example of how multilateralism can work. Conversely, if it weakens or fails, much else could fail with it. This is something which the US — at the epicentre of a more interdependent world — cannot afford to ignore. These priorities must continue to guide US policy — as they have done since the Second World War. America has been the main driving force behind eight rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, including the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the creation of the WTO. The US — together with the EU — was instrumental in launching the latest Doha Round two years ago. Likewise, the recent initiative, spearheaded by Ambassador Zoellick, to re-energize the negotiations and move them towards a successful conclusion is yet another example of how essential the US is to the multilateral process — signalling that the US remains committed to further liberalization, that the Round is moving, and that other countries have a tangible reason to get on board. The reality is this: when the US leads the system can move forward; when it withdraws, the system drifts. The fact that US leadership is essential, does not mean it is easy. As WTO rules have expanded, so too has as the complexity of the issues the WTO deals with — everything from agriculture and accounting, to tariffs and telecommunication. The WTO is also exerting huge gravitational pull on countries to join — and participate actively — in the system. The WTO now has 146 Members — up from just 23 in 1947 — and this could easily rise to 170 or more within a decade. Emerging powers like China, Brazil, and India rightly demand a greater say in an institution in which they have a growing stake. So too do a rising number of voices outside the system as well. More and more people recognize that the WTO matters. More non-state actors — businesses, unions, environmentalists, development NGOs — want the multilateral system to reflect their causes and concerns. A decade ago, few people had even heard of the GATT. Today the WTO is front page news. A more visible WTO has inevitably become a more politicized WTO. The sound and fury surrounding the WTO's recent Ministerial Meeting in Cancun — let alone Seattle — underline how challenging managing the WTO can be. But these challenges can be exaggerated. They exist precisely because so many countries have embraced a common vision. Countries the world over have turned to open trade — and a rules-based system — as the key to their growth and development. They agreed to the Doha Round because they believed their interests lay in freer trade, stronger rules, a more effective WTO. Even in Cancun the great debate was whether the multilateral trading system was moving fast and far enough — not whether it should be rolled back. Indeed, it is critically important that we draw the right conclusions from Cancun — which are only now becoming clearer. The disappointment was that ministers were unable to reach agreement. The achievement was that they exposed the risks of failure, highlighted the need for North-South collaboration, and — after a period of introspection — acknowledged the inescapable logic of negotiation. Cancun showed that, if the challenges have increased, it is because the stakes are higher. The bigger challenge to American leadership comes from inside — not outside — the United States. In America's current debate about trade, jobs and globalization we have heard a lot about the costs of liberalization. We need to hear more about the opportunities. We need to be reminded of the advantages of America's openness and its trade with the world — about the economic growth tied to exports; the inflation-fighting role of imports, the innovative stimulus of global competition. We need to explain that freer trade works precisely because it involves positive change — better products, better job opportunities, better ways of doing things, better standards of living. While it is true that change can be threatening for people and societies, it is equally true that the vulnerable are not helped by resisting change — by putting up barriers and shutting out competition. They are helped by training, education, new and better opportunities that — with the right support policies — can flow from a globalized economy. The fact is that for every job in the US threatened by imports there is a growing number of high-paid, high skill jobs created by exports. Exports supported 7 million workers a decade ago; that number is approaching around 12 million today. And these new jobs — in aerospace, finance, information technology — pay 10 per cent more than the average American wage. We especially need to inject some clarity — and facts — into the current debate over the outsourcing of services jobs. Over the next decade, the US is projected to create an average of more than 2 million new services jobs a year — compared to roughly 200,000 services jobs that will be outsourced. I am well aware that this issue is the source of much anxiety in America today. Many Americans worry about the potential job losses that might arise from foreign competition in services sectors. But it’s worth remembering that concerns about the impact of foreign competition are not new. Many of the reservations people are expressing today are echoes of what we heard in the 1970s and 1980s. But people at that time didn’t fully appreciate the power of American ingenuity. Remarkable advances in technology and productivity laid the foundation for unprecedented job creation in the 1990s and there is no reason to doubt that this country, which has shown time and again such remarkable potential for competing in the global economy, will not soon embark again on such a burst of job-creation. America's openness to service-sector trade — combined with the high skills of its workforce — will lead to more growth, stronger industries, and a shift towards higher value-added, higher-paying employment. Conversely, closing the door to service trade is a strategy for killing jobs, not saving them. Americans have never run from a challenge and have never been defeatist in the face of strong competition. Part of this challenge is to create the conditions for global growth and job creation here and around the world. I believe Americans realize what is at stake. The process of opening to global trade can be disruptive, but they recognize that the US economy cannot grow and prosper any other way. They recognize the importance of finding global solutions to shared global problems. Besides, what is the alternative to the WTO? Some argue that the world's only superpower need not be tied down by the constraints of the multilateral system. They claim that US sovereignty is compromised by international rules, and that multilateral institutions limit rather than expand US influence. Americans should be deeply sceptical about these claims. Almost none of the trade issues facing the US today are any easier to solve unilaterally, bilaterally or regionally. The reality is probably just the opposite. What sense does it make — for example — to negotiate e-commerce rules bilaterally? Who would be interested in disciplining agricultural subsidies in a regional agreement but not globally? How can bilateral deals — even dozens of them — come close to matching the economic impact of agreeing to global free trade among 146 countries?Bilateral and regional deals can sometimes be a complement to the multilateral system, but they can never be a substitute. There is a bigger danger. By treating some countries preferentially, bilateral and regional deals exclude others — fragmenting global trade and distorting the world economy. Instead of liberalizing trade — and widening growth — they carve it up. Worse, they have a domino effect: bilateral deals inevitably beget more bilateral deals, as countries left outside are forced to seek their own preferential arrangements, or risk further marginalization. This is precisely what we see happening today. There are already over two hundred bilateral and regional agreements in existence, and each month we hear of a new or expanded deal. There is a basic contradiction in the assumption that bilateral approaches serve to strengthen the multilateral, rules-based system. Even when intended to spur free trade, they can ultimately risk undermining it. This is in no one's interest, least of all the United States. America led in the creation of the multilateral system after 1945 precisely to avoid a return to hostile blocs — blocs that had done so much to fuel interwar instability and conflict. America's vision, in the words of Cordell Hull, was that “enduring peace and the welfare of nations was indissolubly connected with the friendliness, fairness and freedom of world trade”. Trade would bind nations together, making another war unthinkable. Non-discriminatory rules would prevent a return to preferential deals and closed alliances. A network of multilateral initiatives and organizations — the Marshal Plan, the IMF, the World Bank, and the GATT, now the WTO — would provide the institutional bedrock for the international rule of law, not power. Underpinning all this was the idea that freedom — free trade, free democracies, the free exchange of ideas — was essential to peace and prosperity, a more just world. It is a vision that has emerged pre-eminent a half century later. Trade has expanded twenty-fold since 1950. Millions in Asia, Latin America, and Africa are being lifted out of poverty, and millions more have new hope for the future. All the great powers — the US, Europe, Japan, India, China and soon Russia — are part of a rules-based multilateral trading system, greatly increasing the chances for world prosperity and peace. There is a growing realization that — in our interdependent world — sovereignty is constrained, not by multilateral rules, but by the absence of rules.</strong><br />

<strong>Continuing calls for curbs on the flow of finance and trade will inspire the United States and other nations to spew forth protectionist legislation like the notorious Smoot-Hawley bill. Introduced at the start of the Great Depression, it triggered a series of tit-for-tat economic responses, which many commentators believe helped turn a serious economic downturn into a prolonged and devastating global disaster. But if history is any guide, those lessons will have been long forgotten during the next collapse. Eventually, fed by a mood of desperation and growing public anger, restrictions on trade, finance, investment, and immigration will almost certainly intensify. Authorities and ordinary citizens will likely scrutinize the cross-border movement of Americans and outsiders alike, and lawmakers may even call for a general crackdown on nonessential travel. Meanwhile, many nations will make transporting or sending funds to other countries exceedingly difficult. As desperate officials try to limit the fallout from decades of ill-conceived, corrupt, and reckless policies, they will introduce controls on foreign exchange. Foreign individuals and companies seeking to acquire certain American infrastructure assets, or trying to buy property and other assets on the cheap thanks to a rapidly depreciating dollar, will be stymied by limits on investment by noncitizens. Those efforts will cause spasms to ripple across economies and markets, disrupting global payment, settlement, and clearing mechanisms. All of this will, of course, continue to undermine business confidence and consumer spending. In a world of lockouts and lockdowns, any link that transmits systemic financial pressures across markets through arbitrage or portfolio-based risk management, or that allows diseases to be easily spread from one country to the next by tourists and wildlife, or that otherwise facilitates unwelcome exchanges of any kind will be viewed with suspicion and dealt with accordingly. The rise in isolationism and protectionism will bring about ever more heated arguments and dangerous confrontations over shared sources of oil, gas, and other key commodities as well as factors of production that must, out of necessity, be acquired from less-than-friendly nations. Whether involving raw materials used in strategic industries or basic necessities such as food, water, and energy, efforts to secure adequate supplies will take increasing precedence in a world where demand seems constantly out of kilter with supply. Disputes over the misuse, overuse, and pollution of the environment and natural resources will become more commonplace. Around the world, such tensions will give rise to full-scale military encounters, often with minimal provocation. In some instances, economic conditions will serve as a convenient pretext for conflicts that stem from cultural and religious differences. Alternatively, nations may look to divert attention away from domestic problems by channeling frustration and populist sentiment toward other countries and cultures. Enabled by cheap technology and the waning threat of American retribution, terrorist groups will likely boost the frequency and scale of their horrifying attacks, bringing the threat of random violence to a whole new level. Turbulent conditions will encourage aggressive saber rattling and interdictions by rogue nations running amok. Age-old clashes will also take on a new, more heated sense of urgency. China will likely assume an increasingly belligerent posture toward Taiwan, while Iran may embark on overt colonization of its neighbors in the Mideast. Israel, for its part, may look to draw a dwindling list of allies from around the world into a growing number of conflicts. Some observers, like John Mearsheimer, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, have even speculated that an “intense confrontation” between the United States and China is “inevitable” at some point. More than a few disputes will turn out to be almost wholly ideological. Growing cultural and religious differences will be transformed from wars of words to battles soaked in blood. Long-simmering resentments could also degenerate quickly, spurring the basest of human instincts and triggering genocidal acts. Terrorists employing biological or nuclear weapons will vie with conventional forces using jets, cruise missiles, and bunker-busting bombs to cause widespread destruction. Many will interpret stepped-up conflicts between Muslims and Western societies as the beginnings of a new world war.</strong><br />

<strong>Resilient infrastructure is key to avert trade collapse</strong><br />

<strong>We are living in the age of disasters. The more we advance, the greater is the impact of each disaster on our society and the more it becomes necessary for us to build resilience into our communities and infrastructure. We cannot avert most disasters. We can, however, be prepared for them to minimize their impact and return to normalcy within the shortest possible time after a disaster with the help of as little external resources as possible. This is what a resilient society strives for. Transportation be it road, rail, air or water – is the lifeline of our society. Serious disruption to transportation infrastructure can have catastrophic impact on the ability of the community, business and economy to recover from a disaster. Hence it is of utmost importance for researchers to address the issue of building resilient transportation infrastructures. Today, more than three quarters of world trade by volume is carried on ships. Hence ports play a very critical role in the overall transportation infrastructure. If port activity is disrupted due to any reason, it will have a direct adverse impact on not only the other transportation functions but also the nation’s economy as a whole.This was amply demonstrated by the impact of the 1995 earthquake on Kobe port in Japan. Disasters know no boundaries. Disaster research too has no boundaries. The multidisciplinary nature of disaster research complicates holistic studies of disasters and also calls for awareness among researchers in diverse disciplines on current research trends across disciplines. To this end, we undertook a literature review in the critical area of disaster resilience of transportation infrastructure and ports, which is not currently available.</strong><br />

<strong>Investment in adaptation tech solves economic consequences</strong><br />

<strong>The impact of climate change on infrastructure is an important economic, environmental and social issue, recognised by the Government’s National Infrastructure Plan 4. Recent impacts from flooding and severe weather highlight the risks infrastructure could face and the significant economic damage these types of events bring. Effective, reliable infrastructure underpins economic activity, and failure to adapt, increases the possibility of service disruption and adverse economic impacts.That is why Defra’s Business Plan 5 has a priority to support a strong and sustainable green economy resilient to climate change; adapting infrastructure forms a key part to realising this. To reduce the risk infrastructure faces from climate change planned, but flexible, adaptation actions are required. Therefore, it is about putting in place measures that enable the cost effective management of climate impacts to reduce the risk that climate change presents to infrastructure. This includes integrating the impacts of climate change into decision making for new infrastructureand maintenance of existing infrastructure. It is not about eliminating all risks from climate change or extreme weather. Potential Opportunities In a low carbon, climate resilient world, investment in climate resilient infrastructure will help enhance the attractiveness of the UK for inward investment, benefitting the economy, business and Government. Modelling by the OECD6 suggests that each £1 spent on climate change adaptation delivers four times its value in terms of potential damage avoided. Adapting infrastructure to climate change presents opportunities if early action is taken and expertise developed. This includes new skills and technologies as well as additional adaptation capacity to enable infrastructure to be adapted, such as new engineering practices or IT-based technology. All countries will need to increase their investment in their infrastructure to adjust to a more challenging climate. This is a potential opportunity; by developing adaptation expertise now, businesses should be well-placed to capitalise on opportunities in domestic and global markets. Potential economic opportunities • Development of new technologies and skills to be used domestically and exported. • Engineering and planning consultancy benefits, if we do this sooner and better than other countries, our engineering and consultancy organisations can be market leaders in adapting infrastructure. • Development of new ICT-based technologies to aid climate resilient infrastructure. • Investment and insurance sector can promote climate resilience, reducing the risk of damage and securing rates of return.</strong><br />

<strong>Plan’s investment is key to hegemony</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">AGC, 11</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (5/19/2011, The Associated General Contractors of America, “THE CASE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE &amp; REFORM: Why and How the Federal Government Should Continue to Fund Vital Infrastructure in the New Age of Public Austerity,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.agc.org/galleries/news/Case-for-Infrastructure-Reform.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.agc.org/galleries/news/Case-for-Infrastructure-Reform.pdf</a>, JMP)</span></strong><br />
<strong>It also is important to note that the federal programs for investing in highway and transit projects has traditionally been self-funded. Since the 1950s, highway users have, through a mixture of gas taxes and other use-related fees, provided all of the funds that go into the Highway Trust Fund. Until only recently all federal surface transportation investments had come from this self-funded Trust Fund. In other words, structured correctly, the federal surface transportation program does not have to cost anyone that doesn’t use the highway system a single penny. As important, there is a strong argument to be made for the fact that the proper role of the federal government is to create and set conditions favorable to private sector job creation. For example, in an economy where the difference between success and failure is often measured by a company’s ability to deliver goods quickly and efficiently, maintaining transportation infrastructure is as important to the success of the private sector as are stable and low tax rates, minimal red tape and regulations and consistent and stable rule of law. Officials in Washington also need to understand that allowing our transportation infrastructure to deteriorate will serve as an added tax on private citizens and the business community alike. That is because added congestion, shipping delays and transportation uncertainty will raise commuting costs, the price of most retail and grocery goods and the cost of getting supplies and delivering products for most U.S. businesses. Investing in infrastructure is vital to our national economic security. America’s position and power in the world is directly dependent on its economic supremacy. It is, after all, our national wealth that funds the country’s highly skilled Armed Forces, that allows us to direct global trade policy and that allows our currency to dominate global marketplaces. Without continued investments to support and nurture that economic vitality, America will surely be eclipsed by other, fast-growing competitors like China, Brazil and/or India. Given that so much of the U.S. economy has evolved into a just-in-time model where as-needed deliveries are far more efficient than expensive warehousing and storage, maintaining our transportation infrastructure is vitally important to the health of our economy. Traffic congestion and aging roads already cost U.S. businesses $80 billion a year because of deferred infrastructure maintenance and our failure to keep pace with the growth of shipping and other traffic. Allowing our transportation infrastructure to deteriorate will only further undermine our businesses and erode our national economic security. In other cases, the federal government has an obligation to invest in infrastructure to avoid imposing costs on U.S. businesses and imposing unfunded mandates on state and local governments. For example, local governments had long been responsible for paying to maintain and operate water systems. That meant only major cities and wealthy towns had access to modern water systems. Much of that changed when the federal government began mandating quality standards for drinking water and wastewater discharge through legislation like the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. These standards were in the best interest of the nation, ensuring protection of public health and environmental quality. By mandating quality standards, however, the federal government forces local governments to spend billions of dollars to upgrade equipment and comply with regulatory burdens. The federal government must not foist the burden of maintaining national standards onto local ratepayers alone. Given that it is in the federal interest to set water quality standards, then so too must it be in the federal interest to provide – primarily in the form of state revolving loan funds – financing help to operators so they can meet those standards.</strong><br />

<strong>US primacy is key to solve great power wars</strong><br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, </span>many actors<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> have </span>bandwagoned with US hegemony <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a </span>status quo<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> that </span>has tended to mute great power conflicts.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> However, </span>as the hegemony<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> that drew these powers together </span>withers,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where</span> power is more diffuse<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and </span>conflicts or wars <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">may be </span>harder to avoid.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> As history attests</span>, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves.’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law. Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that </span>America’s authority<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, although sullied at times, has </span>benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that </span>a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the 1930s: </span>regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For </span>example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973). A world </span>without American<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> hegemony is one where </span>great power wars re-emerge, the liberal<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> international </span>system is supplanted by an authoritarian one<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, and </span>trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy. </span><br />

A new report released by the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation (ITIF) presents a strong case that manufacturing has declined more during the last decade than it did during the Great Depression of the 1930s. It's gratifying to finally see a well-respected non-partisan &quot;think tank&quot; release a report based on empirical datathat corroborates what those of working in the manufacturing industry have experienced, about which I have been speaking and writing since 2003. One of the main points of the report is that during the Great Depression, we lost 30.9% of manufacturing jobs, but in the decade of 2000-2010, we lost 33.1% of manufacturing jobs. It becomes more serious when you realize that in the Great Depression, manufacturing accounted for 43% of jobs lost and 34% of all jobs at the time, but now manufacturing only represents about 11% of all jobs, but nearly one-third of the job loss. This percentage loss represents 5.7 million manufacturing jobs. The report states: &quot;On average, 1,276 manufacturing jobs were lost every day for the past 12 years. A net of 66,486 manufacturing establishments closed, from 404,758 in 2000 down to 338,273 in 2011. In other words, on each day since the year 2000, America had, on average, 17 fewer manufacturing establishments than it had the previous day.&quot; When you understand the multiplier effect of manufacturing jobs, creating 2-3 supporting jobs, this loss of manufacturing jobs represents 11 to 17 million jobs. The report states, &quot;In fact, in January 2012 there were more unemployed Americans (12.8 million) than there were Americans who worked in manufacturing (just under 12 million).&quot; No wonder we have the high local, state, and federal deficits that we are experiencing -- there are fewer taxpayers and more benefit collectors. The two million manufacturing jobs we lost during the Great Recession was added to the over 3.7 million we had already lost. After the recession ended, the report states: &quot;Just 166,000, or 8.2 percent, returned. That leaves 91.8 percent of jobs to be recovered. At the rate of growth in manufacturing jobs in 2011, it would take until at least 2020 for employment to return to where the economy was in terms of manufacturing jobs at the end of 2007. In reality... U.S. manufacturing has been in a state of structural decline due to loss of U.S. competitiveness, not temporary decline based on the business cycle.&quot; It's obvious that with unemployment at 8.3 percent, &quot;all those jobs have not been recreated in other industries.&quot; If manufacturing declines further, there are no guarantees that other jobs will appear to replace those lost in manufacturing. The authors validate what I've written in my book and previous articles: &quot;manufacturing jobs pay more; manufacturing is a source of good jobs for non-college-educated workers; and manufacturing is the key driver of innovation -- without manufacturing, non-manufacturing innovation jobs (for example, research and design) will not thrive.&quot; For years, most economists, experts, and government officials have said that the decline in manufacturing is a natural outcome of our transformation from an industrial society to a post-industrial society. &quot;This decline is often cited by defenders as 'normal' and in line with what is happening in other countries. In this 'post-industrial' view, advanced nations are transitioning from factories to services; the greater and faster the loss of manufacturing, the more successful nations are in mastering the transition.&quot; The authors concede that there is: &quot;Some truth to the post-industrialists' view. Advanced economies naturally see manufacturing jobs contribute to a smaller share of total employment, since manufacturing productivity is typically higher than non-manufacturing productivity. But normally the loss is modest and gradual, in contrast to the United States where in the last decade it was sudden and steep.&quot; In addition: &quot;Advanced nations do lose some lower-value-added, lower-skill, commodity-based manufacturing to lower-wage nations. But ... they also increase their demand for the higher-value-added products that developed nations should naturally produce ... the process of global integration does not and should not naturally lead to the deindustrialization of developed economies, but rather to the transformation of their industrial bases toward more complex, higher-value-added production.&quot; These same experts have denied that manufacturing has been in decline, arguing that manufacturing became incredibly productive just like agriculture did a century earlier so that fewer workers are needed in the industry. The authors state that: &quot;Virtually everyone makes the argument that massive manufacturing job decline is a sign of success: manufacturers are using technology to automate work and to become more efficient ... Manufacturing is like agriculture has been the dominant story. The United States produces more food than ever, but because farming has become so efficient, it requires a very small share of U.S. workers to grow and harvest the food. So while manufacturing productivity growth may be tough on workers, job loss is seen as a sign of strength, not weakness.&quot; It's true that job loss could be result of increased productivity, but what these experts have ignored is that manufacturing's share of the Gross Domestic Product (GD) declined from 15% in 2000 to 11.0% in 2009. While manufacturing has declined as a share of GDP in the United States and some other nations, such as Canada, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom,&quot; it is stable or even growing in many others (including Austria, China, Finland, Germany, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.)&quot; The ITIF report dispels the myth that increased productivity is the reason for the job loss with a review of the productivity of various manufacturing industry sectors, showing that in 2010, &quot;13 of the 19 manufacturing sectors (employing 55 percent of manufacturing workers) were producing less than they there were in 2000 in terms of inflation-adjusted output.&quot; In addition, the authors assert that &quot;the government's official calculation of manufacturing output growth, and by definition productivity, is significantly overstated. &quot;Correcting for biases in the official data, ITIF finds that from 2000 to 2010, U.S. manufacturing labor productivity growth was overstated by a remarkable 122 percent. Moreover, manufacturing output, instead of increasing at the reported 16 percent rate, in fact fell by 11 percent over the period.&quot; This was during a period when the U. S. GDP increased by 17 percent. Besides, the report states that: &quot;It is not clear how productivity could be the culprit behind the large share of job loss in the 2000s when manufacturing labor productivity (as measured by the official value added data) was not substantially different in the 1990s than it was in the 2000s. During the 1990s, manufacturing jobs fell by one percent, while labor productivity increased by 53 percent. In the 2000s, manufacturing jobs fell by 33 percent while productivity increased by 66 percent ... the 2000s productivity number is actually significantly overstated, even more so than the 1990s figure. Adjusting for bias in the data, the actual productivity growth in the 2000s was just 32 percent.&quot; The authors provide evidence that: &quot;There are serious problems with how the U.S. government measures manufacturing output that cause it to significantly overstate output and, by extension, productivity. In order to see how productivity and output are overstated, it is necessary to understand both concepts.&quot; Their explanation is too complicated to consider in this short article, but is well worth reading in the report. They conclude: &quot;that there are substantial upward biases in the U.S. government's official statistics and that real manufacturing output and productivity growth is significantly overstated. The most serious bias relates to the computers and electronics industry (NAICS 334) -- its output is vastly overstated. Correcting for these statistical biases, we see that the base of U.S. manufacturing has eroded faster over the past decade than at any time since WWII, when the United States began compiling the statistics.&quot; I can substantiate this conclusion from my experience as a manufacturers' representative for American companies who perform fabrication services, such as plastic and rubber molding, metal stamping and casting, machining, and sheet metal fabrication for other American manufacturers. While many of the manufacturers in my sales territory of southern California may still be assembling their products in the U.S., many of the components and subassemblies they are using have been produced offshore. Obviously, it takes fewer American workers to produce the end product because part of the work was actually done by foreign workers.<br />

ASCE commends the Joint Economic Committee for holding a hearing today on how <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">surface transportation investment is a key factor for continued economic recovery and job creation</span>. The Society is pleased to present to the Committee our views on <span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 16pt;">investing in the nation's infrastructure and</span> the critical link to U.S manufacturing.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">An agenda that fosters</span> economic growth and job creationthrough policies that strengthen U.S. manufacturing and infrastructure will allow the nation to remain competitive<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in the Twenty-First Century</span>. Infrastructure Receives a Grade of &quot;D&quot; ASCE's 2009 Report Card for America's Infrastructure graded the nation's infrastructure a &quot;D&quot; based on 15 categories (the same overall grade as ASCE's 2005 Report Card). The report also concluded that the nation needs to invest approximately $2.2 trillion from 2009 - 2014 to bring our nation's infrastructure to a state of good repair. This number, adjusted for a three percent rate of inflation, represents capital spending at all levels of government and includes current expenditures. Even with current and planned investments from federal, state, and local governments from 2009 - 2014, the &quot;gap&quot; between the overall need and actual spending will exceed $1 trillion by the end of the five-year period. In the Report Card, the nation's surface transportation system included roads receiving a grade of &quot;D-,&quot; bridges receiving a grade of &quot;C,&quot; and transit receiving a grade of &quot;D&quot;. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">With nearly one-third of roads in poor or mediocre condition, a quarter of the nation's bridges either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, and transit use increasing to its highest levels in 50 years, </span>the nation's surface transportation system is in a state of critical decline. Additionally, to bring just these three surface transportation categories up to an acceptable condition would require a five-year investment of $1.2 trillion, according to ASCE estimates. If the nation continues to under- invest in infrastructure and ignores this backlog until systems fail, we will incur even greater costs. While Congress is in the process of developing a comprehensive multi-year surface transportation authorization bill, and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as</span> President <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama emphasizes the infrastructure investment needs for the nation, our roads, bridges, and transit systems continue on in a state of decline</span>. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the total of all federal spending for infrastructure has steadily declined over the past 30 years. The results of years of under investment can be seen in traffic and airport congestion, unsafe bridges and dams, deteriorating roads, and aging drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. Infrastructure Investment = Jobs <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Money invested in essential public works can create jobs, provide for economic growth, and ensure public safety through a modern, well-engineered national infrastructure</span>. The nation's transportation infrastructure system has an annual output of $120 billion in construction work and contributes $244 billion in total economic activity to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP). In addition to the overarching economic benefits, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that every $1 billion invested in the nation's highways supports 27,823 jobs<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, including 9,537 on-site construction jobs, 4,324 jobs in supplier industries, and 13,962 jobs throughout the rest of the economy</span>. Standard and Poor's has stated that highway investment has been shown to stimulate the economy more than any other fiscal policy, with each invested dollar in highway construction generating $1.80 toward the gross domestic product in the short term, while Cambridge Systematics estimates that every dollar taxpayers invest in public transportation generates $6 in economic returns. The transportation industry's experience with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 illustrated the strong job creation impact of dedicated transportation investment, with the $48 billion for transportation improvements in the legislation supporting tens of thousands of jobs in engineering, construction, and supporting industries. Infrastructure Investment = A Healthy Economy The job-creation potential of infrastructure investment is only one contributing factor<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> of the interaction between surface transportation and the nation's ability to compete in the global marketplace</span>. Equally important are the benefits to a region's long term growth and productivity. A significant challenge to this economic growth is <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">increased congestion,</span> which <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">contributes to the deterioration of the nation's infrastructure</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Therefore, the importance of freight movement and the impact of congestion on the nation's economy must be emphasized</span>. ASCE is concerned with the increasing <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">deterioration of America's infrastructure</span>, reduced investment for the preservation and enhancement of our quality of life, and the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">threatened decline of U.S. competitiveness in the global marketplace</span>. In response, ASCE has not only issued multiple Report Cards on the condition of infrastructure, but has also sought to advance policy solutions that provide for a clean and safe quality of life, as well as fuel economic growth. While taken for granted by most Americans, our infrastructure is the foundation on which the national economy depends. As the economy grows, we cannot only think in terms of repairing what we have, but of creating a modernized transportation system that addresses long-term needs. The current system was originally built in the 1950's and 1960's at a time when the country had different transportation needs and a smaller population. With an expanding population and a larger economy, the nation needs a transportation system that can keep pace. Unfortunately, due to the rapid growth of the country, highway and freight capacity failed to keep up. In July 2011, ASCE released an economic study that measures the potential impacts to the economy in 2020 and 2040 if the nation maintains current levels of surface transportation investments. The report is the first in a series of four reports that will focus on the correlation between the nation's infrastructure and the economy. Subsequent reports will detail the economic correlation to the nation's drinking and waste water systems, energy grid, and ports and airports. The first study, Failure to Act: the Economic Impact of Current Investment Trends in Surface Transportation Infrastructure, found that if investments in surface transportation are not made in conjunction with significant policy reforms, families will have a lower standard of living, businesses will be paying more and producing less, and our nation will lose ground in a global economy. The nation's deteriorating surface transportation will cost the American economy more than 876,000 jobs, and suppress the growth of the country's GDP by $897 billion in 2020.The study results estimate that more than 100,900 manufacturing jobs will be lost by 2020. Ultimately, Americans will also get paid less. While the economy will lose jobs overall, those who are able to find work will find their paychecks cut because of the ripple effects that will occur through the economy. In contrast, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a study</span> from the Alliance for American Manufacturing <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">shows that</span> roughly 18,000 new manufacturing jobs are created for every $1 billion in new infrastructure spending. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">These manufacturing jobs would be created in fabricated metals, concrete and cement, glass-rubber- plastics, steel, and wood product industries</span>. Furthermore, the Alliance for American Manufacturing study shows that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">using American-made materials for these infrastructure projects yields a total of 77,000 additional jobs</span>, based on a projected investment of $148 billion a year (including $93 billion of public investment). International Competitiveness Failure to Act also shows that failing infrastructure will drive the cost of doing business up<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> by adding $430 billion to transportation costs in the next decade</span>. Firms will spend more to ship goods, and the raw materials they buy will cost more due to increased transportation costs. Productivity costs will also fall, with businesses underperforming by $240 billion over the next decade; this in turn will drive up the costs of goods. As a result, U.S. exports<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> will fall by $28 billion, including 79 of 93 tradable commodities</span>. Ten sectors of the U.S. economy account for more than half of <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">this unprecedented </span>loss in export value<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> - </span>among them key manufacturing sectors <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">like machinery, medical devices, and communications equipment</span>. On the contrary, most of America's major economic competitors in Europe and Asia have already invested in and are reaping the benefits of improved competitiveness from their infrastructure systems. To illustrate further the correlation between transportation and a strong national economy, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the U.S. Chamber of Commerce</span> in late 2010 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">released </span>a<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> transportation </span>performance index<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> that </span>examines the<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> overall contribution to economic growth from a well-performing transportation infrastructure</span>. The index displays adecline in the nation's economic competitiveness due to a continued lack of investment in surface transportation <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">systems on all levels</span><strong>.</strong> However, the results also indicate that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a commitment to raising the performance of transportation infrastructure would provide long-term value for the U.S. economy</span>. At this juncture, even Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is underscoring the importance of investing in our nation's infrastructure and the value of export promotion for the competitiveness of U.S. businesses. On a recent trip to a North Carolina manufacturing plant, Secretary Geithner drew parallels between investment in infrastructure, jobs creation, and growth of the domestic manufacturing sector. While efforts such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 have provided some short term relief to a struggling engineering and construction sector, a sustained economic recovery, will remain difficult without a new multi-year surface transportation bill. Five Key Solutions As part of ASCE's 2009 Report Card for America's Infrastructure, ASCE identified five Key Solutions that illustrate an ambitious plan to maintain and improve the nation's infrastructure: Increase federal leadership in infrastructure;<br />
Independently, that innovation solves great power wars<br />

Technological innovation is of central importance to the study of international relations (IR), affecting almost every aspect of the sub-field. 2 First and foremost, a nation’s technological capability has a significant effect on its economic growth, industrial might, and military prowess; therefore relative national technological capabilities necessarily influence the balance of power between states, and hence have a role in calculations of war and alliance formation. Second, technology and innovative capacity also determine a nation’s trade profile, affecting which products it will import and export, as well as where multinational corporations will base their production facilities. 3 Third, insofar as innovation-driven economic growth both attracts investment and produces surplus capital, a nation’s technological ability will also affect international financial flows and who has power over them. 4 Thus, in broad theoretical terms, technological change is important to the study of IR because of its overall implications for both the relative and absolute power of states. And if theory alone does not convince, then history also tells us that nations on the technological ascent generally experience a corresponding and dramatic change in their global stature and influence, such as Britain during the first industrial revolution, the United States and Germany during the second industrial revolution, and Japan during the twentieth century. 5 Conversely, great powers which fail to maintain their place at the technological frontier generally drift and fade from influence on international scene. 6 This is not to suggest that technological innovation alone determines international politics, but rather that shifts in both relative and absolute technological capability have a major impact on international relations, and therefore need to be better understood by IR scholars. Indeed, the importance of technological innovation to international relations is seldom disputed by IR theorists. Technology is rarely the sole or overriding causal variable in any given IR theory, but a broad overview of the major theoretical debates reveals the ubiquity of technological causality. For example, from Waltz to Posen, almost all Realists have a place for technology in their explanations of international politics. 7 At the very least, they describe it as an essential part of the distribution of material capabilities across nations, or an indirect source of military doctrine. And for some, like Gilpin quoted above, technology is the very cornerstone of great power domination, and its transfer the main vehicle by which war and change occur in world politics. 8 Jervis tells us that the balance of offensive and defensive military technology affects the incentives for war. 9 Walt agrees, arguing that technological change can alter a state’s aggregate power, and thereby affect both alliance formation and the international balance of threats. 10 Liberals are less directly concerned with technological change, but they must admit that by raising or lowering the costs of using force, technological progress affects the rational attractiveness of international cooperation and regimes. 11 Technology also lowers information &amp; transactions costs and thus increases the applicability of international institutions, a cornerstone of Liberal IR theory. 12 And in fostering flows of trade, finance, and information, technological change can lead to Keohane’s interdependence 13 or Thomas Friedman et al’s globalization. 14 Meanwhile, over at the “third debate”, Constructivists cover the causal spectrum on the issue, from Katzenstein’s “cultural norms” which shape security concerns and thereby affect technological innovation; 15 to Wendt’s “stripped down technological determinism” in which technology inevitably drives nations to form a world state. 16 However most Constructivists seem to favor Wendt, arguing that new technology changes people’s identities within society, and sometimes even creates new cross-national constituencies, thereby affecting international politics. 17 Of course, Marxists tend to see technology as determining all social relations and the entire course of history, though they describe mankind’s major fault lines as running between economic classes rather than nation-states. 18 Finally, Buzan &amp; Little remind us that without advances in the technologies of transportation, communication, production, and war, international systems would not exist in the first place<br />

The current wave of defense cuts is also different than past defense budget reductions in their likely industrial impact, as the U.S. defense industrial base is in a much different place than it was in the past. Defense industrial issues are too often viewed through the lens of jobs and pet projects to protect in congressional districts. But the overall health of the firms that supply the technologies our armed forces utilize does have national security resonance. Qualitative superiority in weaponry and other key military technology has become an essential element of American military power in the modern era—not only for winningwarsbutfor deterring them. That requires world-class scientific and manufacturing capabilities—which in turn can also generate civilian and military export opportunities for the United States in a globalized marketplace.<br />
b. Advanced manufacturing technology will make war impossible<br />

The convergence of &quot;exponentially advancing technologies&quot; will form a &quot;super-intelligence&quot; so formidable that it could avert war, according to one of the world's leading futurists. Dr. James Canton, CEO and chairman of the Institute for Global Futures, a San Francisco-based think tank, is author of the book &quot;The Extreme Future&quot; and an adviser to leading companies, the military and other government agencies. He is consistently listed among the world's leading speakers and has presented to diverse audiences around the globe. He will address the Air Force Command and Control Intelligence, Survelliance and Reconnaissance Symposium, which will be held Sept. 28 through 30 at the MGM Grand Hotel at Foxwoods in Ledyard, Conn., joining Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz and a bevy of other government and industry speakers. He offered a sneak preview of his symposium presentation and answered various questions about the future of technology and warfare in early August. &quot;The superiority of convergent technologies willprevent war,&quot; Doctor Canton said, claiming their power would present an overwhelming deterrent to potential adversaries. While saying that the U.S. will build these super systems faster and better than other nations, he acknowledged that a new arms race is already under way. &quot;It will be a new MAD for the 21st century,&quot; he said, referring to the Cold War-era acronym for Mutually Assured Destruction, the idea that a nuclear first strike would trigger an equally deadly response. It's commonly held that this knowledge has essentially prevented any rational state from launching a nuclear attack. Likewise, Doctor Canton said he believes rational nation states, considering this imminent technology explosion, will see the futility of nation-on-nation warfare in the near future. Plus there's the &quot;socio-economic linking of the global market system.&quot; &quot;The fundamental macroeconomics on the planet favor peace, security, capitalism and prosperity,&quot; he said. Doctor Canton projects that nations, including those not currently allied, will work together in using these smart technologies to prevent non-state actors from engaging in disruptive and deadly acts. As a futurist, Doctor Canton and his team study and predict many things, but their main area of expertise -- and the one in which he's personally most interested -- is advanced and emerging technology. &quot;I see that as the key catalyst of strategic change on the planet, and it will be for the next 100 years,&quot; he said. He focuses on six specific technology areas: &quot;nano, bio, IT, neuro, quantum and robotics;&quot;those he expects to converge in so powerful a way. Within the information technology arena, Doctor Canton said systems must create &quot;meaningful data,&quot; which can be validated and acted upon. &quot;Knowledge engineering for the analyst and the warfighter is a critical competency that we need to get our arms around,&quot; he said. &quot;Having an avalanche of data is not going to be helpful.&quot; Having the right data is. &quot;There's no way for the human operator to look at an infinite number of data streams and extract meaning,&quot; he said. &quot;The question then is: How do we augment the human user with advanced artificial intelligence, better software presentation and better visual frameworks, to create a system that is situationally aware and can provide decision options for the human operator, faster than the human being can?&quot; He said he believes the answers can often be found already in what he calls 'edge cultures.' &quot;I would look outside of the military. What are they doing in video games? What are they doing in healthcare? What about the financial industry?&quot; Doctor Canton said he believes that more sophisticated artificial intelligence applications will transform business, warfare and life in general. Many of these are already embedded in systems or products, he says, even if people don't know it.<br />

The Role of the Federal Government in Adapting to Climate Change<span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><strong><u>T</u></strong>he Federal Government has an important and unique role in climate adaptation, but it is only one part of a broader effort that must include multiple levels of government and private and non-governmental partners throughout the country. In particular<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, </span>Federal leadership, guidance, information, and support are vital to planning for and implementing adaptive actions<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Because climate impacts span political boundaries, the Federal Government must respond in partnership with communities, Tribes, and states</span> – many of which are already beginning to implement adaptation measures. Effective adaptation requires that stakeholders in affected regions coordinate their responses to climate impacts on shared infrastructure and resources.<span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span>At the core of the Federal Government’s role should be a commitment to promote and implement best practices for adaptation<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, build greater public awareness and understanding of the importance of adaptation, and maintain dialogue</span> and partnerships<span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">with stakeholders and decision makers</span>. The Government should continue to enhance services that enable informed decisions based on the best available science, and to work with the international community to improve knowledge sharing and coordinate adaptation investments.

Most adaptation strategies aim to make infrastructure more durable or sustainable on a system level. Very few strategies attempt to use innovative construction materials, although that is the subject of continuing research. Adaptation approaches to climate change impacts need to be region-specific. Various areas will experience different climate change effects, over different timeframes, and have different levels of associated risk. Some adaptation approaches include extending timeframes of the planning and design analysis and retrofitting existing structures to increase their resilience. In many regions, land use policies may need to be revisited in order to restrict development in higher-risk areas. Planners must also consider the likely cost of feasible adaptation alternatives. Each alternative has an associated cost that must be considered in comparing response options and prioritizing among competing risks located elsewhere within the system. Finally, the planning process might need to be more flexible to allow different outcomes and design life of infrastructure to be evaluated to ensure alternatives and solutions fit the context of the project. There are three general adaptation alternatives (Parry et al., 2007):¶1. Avoidance – Planning new facilities or rerouting existing facilities outside of hazard areas. An example includes construction of a bypass around a landslideprone area.¶ 2. Protection – Improvements to existing facilities to increase their resilience or adaptive capacity to climate change impacts. Examples include increased height of sea walls, landslide fencing and monitoring, or bridge designs that are modified from current standards. Standards and criteria should be continually evaluated or modified based on the newest climate research.¶ 3. Abandonment – Abandonment or closure of a facility may be the most cost-effective solution if avoidance or protection alternatives are infeasible.¶ Examples include closure of landslide-prone segments. A fourth adaptation response could include operational responses such as ongoing maintenance and incident response (including temporary or seasonal closure and messaging services to the traveling public). This alternative would factor in the ongoing cost of repair and incident response based on the projected frequency of events. For vulnerabilities with minimal impact and/or low likelihood of occurrence, or for assets with short lifespan (e.g., pavement) this approach may be an optimal response (Kinsella, 2005). Examples include a planned detour route in response to periodic flooding of a roadway. The City of Portland has such a plan established (including sandbag locations) for the Johnson Creek area, which is known to flood periodically. In many cases, adaptation planning options are not unique to issues of climate change. For many agencies these are good business practices to emergency response, maintenance and asset management. Agencies need to integrate the issues, language and potential impacts of climate change into existing agency and business structures and practices.<br />

Lack of federal leadership on resiliency will undermine US competitiveness and global primacy<br />

Recently, I returned from a trip to Austria, Spain, England, and Scotland. By coincidence, the first issue of The New York Times I picked up after returning to this country included an op-ed column by Bob Herbert, who argued passionately that the United States is falling behind our peers in virtually all areas of public investment -- roads, bridges, electrical grids, education, and more. After my trip, and after looking carefully into the evidence on the matter, I am convinced that Herbert is correct. In this column, I will first reflect on some of the things I saw on my recent travels that confirm Mr. Herbert's dire assessment of the United States' position, relative to the rest of the relatively advanced economies in the world. I will then consider the broader policy initiatives that continue to be essential for our future prosperity, initiatives that have not been able to gain traction in U.S. policy debates for the last several decades. My basic contention, however, is a simple one: The federal government is the only entity that has the opportunity to change the foundation on which our future prosperity will be built. If we continue to ignore the pressing needs that only the federal government can fill, then our future will be much poorer and more dangerous. And there is no better time than today to address these needs – for infrastructure improvement will address not only the United States' competitiveness, but also its strikingly high levels of unemployment and underemployment. The Stark Contrast Between Traveling in Europe, and in the United States Every traveler must, by definition, come into direct contact with a country's transportation infrastructure. Whether he or she is traveling by train, plane, bus, automobile, or any other mode of transportation, the traveler's experience will directly reflect the practical effects of policy choices made by a country's government in designing its public infrastructure. It is, of course, dangerous to draw general conclusions about policy based on a few weeks of travel. Bad experiences can happen in even the best-designed systems; inferior systems might seem attractive on a good day. Even so, patterns begin to emerge; and experiences in one country can provide useful examples of alternative ways to organize and build a society. Moreover, there is ample independent verification of the overall state of the infrastructure in the United States. The Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program, which Herbert's op-ed cited, includes a Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative, which has assessed the state of the roads, bridges, etc., in the United States. Its findings are quite disturbing, citing conclusions ranging &quot;from genuine concern about the condition and quality of our existing infrastructure, to difficulties and lack of choices in moving people and goods.&quot; Similarly, earlier this year, the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a report that assessed the state of America's bridges, roads, drinking water systems, sewage treatment facilities, and so on. The engineers' overall assessment, based on an academic grading scale, was that infrastructure in the U.S. receives a grade of &quot;D.&quot; How does poor infrastructure show itself in day-to-day living? Take, for example, my trip from the United States to Vienna, Austria, and contrast that with my return to Washington, D.C. Arriving in Vienna, the airport was uncongested, clearing Customs took less than one minute, and I was out of the airport in a matter of minutes after that. At that point, there were clearly-marked signs for a high-speed train from the airport, which offered a mere seventeen-minute ride from the airport (on the outskirts of that nation's capital city) to the city's center. And in fact, the seventeen-minute train ride really took seventeen minutes. From there, an array of choices for subways, trams, and buses was available. There was no need to hire a taxi, but if that had been necessary, it would have cost approximately thirty dollars to travel from the airport to my hotel on the other side of the city. Compare this to my experience when arriving at Dulles International Airport, outside Washington, D.C. The airport was clogged with people, and information was not easy to find. Clearing Customs was a thirty-minute ordeal through a snaking line of angry travelers, even though the actual contact with a customs agent was at most a 20-second encounter. For those who wish to travel into D.C. from the airport, there is no train available. Finding the only bus service from the airport is non-intuitive (to say the least), and that bus ride does not terminate in Washington, but in Arlington, Virginia. A taxi or limo can cost up to one hundred dollars, depending upon where one goes in Washington. Perhaps Vienna, Austria is a unique example. Austria is a small country, and its capital is not as large as ours. In my travels, however, I took flights through airports in Bilbao, Spain; Munich and Stuttgart, Germany; London; and Edinburgh, Scotland. The contrast with airports in the U.S. was stunning. Flights in Europe were on time or early. Transportation into and out of the nearby cities was inexpensive and efficient. The entire traveling experience, while never enjoyable, was at least never miserable. That's quite a contrast to far too many experiences I -- like so many others -- have endured in the United States. The Stakes: Economic Competitiveness and Political Relevance But other than personal inconvenience, readers may ask, why does any of this truly matter? If one wants to travel to D.C., then one puts up with it. The destination is what matters, not the journey, right? Hardly. Tourism matters – as an extremely important economic engine in many areas, including Washington, D.C. And, even more importantly, business matters. And experiences such as those I had will directly affect the decisions that people in business make about where to locate their companies' offices, and with whom to engage in commerce. Decisionmakers, both in the U.S. and abroad, know that our transportation networks are decades out of date and are falling apart. That is not enough to drive all business out of this country, of course, but it certainly means that many marginal decisions will cut against the interests of the United States. If we want to be internationally competitive, then we must improve our &quot;welcome mat.&quot;Moreover, the same decisions that will inevitably push businesses to locate in, or even relocate to, other countries threaten to change the notion that the United States is the center of it all. While some pundits claim that U.S. debt or financial policies are pushing business abroad, infrastructure surely remains a profoundly important factor: Is it physically possible to move around in a particular country with reasonable speed and efficiency? We fall painfully short in that regard. And if we continue to push the world away in this respect, then it is inevitable that the world will, over the years, come to care less and less about the United States.<br />

White supremacy is a global modality of genocidal violence – Slavery may have ended in name, but its operational logic continues to fester. Reformist measures simply provide fuel for Whiteness<br />

Vote negative to engage in an unflinching structural analysis of the ontological position of Blackness—the very possibility of ethics and freedom resides in a rejection of the affirmative’s ratification of democracy, the state and civil society. Resisting the lure of anti-blackness through a genealogy of history’s constitutive void is the starting point for imagining a new world.<br />

Faith in liberal society is the root cause of your impact. The state can’t be reformed, constantly trying to reform prevents resistance<br />

 <strong>Text: The United States federal government should [plan text] as temporary-effect legislation mandating a review in five-years to determine the policy’s effectiveness. Based on the review, the policy can be re-authorized, altered, or terminated.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Counterplan is competitive—questions of policy timing are even more important than questions of content.</strong><br />

Most fights about new legislation focus on the legislation’s substance. Yet legislators regularly decide ¶ AND¶ , sometimes indicate that Congress is uncertain whether a statute will be beneficial.”<br />

Third-party monitoring is critical to ensure that transportation agencies and taxing authorities are AND voters after 10, 20 or 30 years also adds additional accountability assurances.<br />
<br />
<strong>Transportation infrastructure is defined by systematic uncertainty—unless we rethink planning around adaptability and flexible governance, we lock-in a status quo unable to deal with alternative futures and increasingly deadly outcomes</strong><br />

Given the reality of the Los Angelization of South-East Queensland by 2020, AND nightmares''. Thus the image of today can create the future of tomorrow.<br />
<br />
<strong>Sunset legislation solves the fundamental uncertainty of transportation policy. It allows dynamic, adaptable investment not constrained by forecasting failures</strong><br />
Gersen 2006 (Jacob, Professor at University of Chicago Law School, “Temporary Legislation,” University of Chicago Law Review, available at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1722:http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/files/296.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/files/296.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/files/296.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1722 -->)<br />
