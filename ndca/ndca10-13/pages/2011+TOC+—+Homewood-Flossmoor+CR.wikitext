==Heidegger- broken round 2== 
**Contention 1 is Welcome to the Standing Reserve**

**Following 9/11 the United States declared a global “War on Terror”, for which the calculative violence it leaves in it’s wake goes beyond mere death- through the construct of technological strategy we seek to rule the world as technological man, reducing all that stands in our way to a standing reserve to be manipulated and controlled of- humans begin to be seen only in terms of tools, utility, and ultimately disposability, byproducts of “strategy”**
**Burke 7** <span class="cite"><span style="font-weight: normal;">(Anthony, Senior Lecturer in the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of New South Wales, Sydney “Beyond Security, Ethics and Violence”, pg 187-203 //Rufus)//</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Just over a year before the Cuban missile crisis, …..</span><span class="underline">massacres have become vital’ </span>

**Through the lens of the War on Terror, security becomes a prerequisite, homogenizing the population into a standing reserve while eliminating all difference, ever calling for new leaders to satisfy our demands- but this mode of thinking divorces us from our being as we refuse to confront uncertainty and shape our relationship to the rest of the world based on technological domination**
**Mitchell 5** <span class="cite"><span style="font-weight: normal;">(Andrew J, Post-Doctoral Fellow in the Humanities at Stanford University “Heidegger and Terrorism”, Research in Phenomenology, 35, pg 208-214 </span></span>Rufus)
<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">There can be no security</span>. </span>….<span class="underline"> Human resources <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">do not die, they perish.</span></span>

**This technological framing of the world that reduces all to the horrible “sameness”, mere tools in strategic thought is the true crisis- while the negative will no doubt attempt to convince you through scenarios for nuclear annihilation, the real threat is that which is already occurring through the destruction of our being, from which nuclear war becomes an inevitable afterthought**
**Caputo 93** <span style="font-weight: normal;">(John, Professor of Humanities @ Syracuse University, “Demythologizing Heidegger” pg 139-141)</span>
<span class="underline">What if one were to question…..authentic, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">ontological destruction</span></span>

**This technological framing of the world reduces all bodies to bare life to be exterminated**

//<span class="underline">In Heidegger's questioning</span> …..<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> the discarded, killing and purifying</span>, and killing and eating.</span>//

**<span class="tagChar">But these fantasies of control inevitably fracture- in rejecting the vulnerability that Terrorism exposes at the heart of the American identity, we create mass violence that borders upon annihilation</span>**

<span class="underline">The apocalyptic imagination …resulting in a malignant synergy</span>. 

**Thus Rufus and I are resolved that the United States federal government should eliminate its military and police presence in Iraq and Afghanistan as a way to contemplate terrorism**

**Contention 2 is Contemplation**

**We will never “not defend” the consequences of the plan, just discuss the steps that would have to occur before action, and think that fiat should be something conceived of more differently than it currently is- we think resoluteness should be a question of ontological questioning and examination of the topic, a blueprint for change rather than an instant solution**
**Pezze 6** <span class="cite"><span style="font-weight: normal;">(Barbara Dalle, has just been awarded a PhD in Philosophy by the University of Hong Kong.

Let us pause for a moment ….<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> remained always the composure of releasement</span> </span>[Verhaltenheit der Gelassenheit]. (Heidegger 1966a, p. 81) 

**When confronted with the “threat” of terrorism, we demand contemplation, using the ballot to think the terrorist and resist the War on Terror’s siren call to aggressive action- only this contemplation can examine terrorism at its base and reconfigure our being towards the concept of terrorism, exposing and dealing with the essential nihilism at the base of human existence**

Is there an escape from terror?....<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the threat of being nothing and nobody</span>. </span>

**In this epoch of Americanism, we have a choice, a way to rethink the metaphysics that have come to dominate America- the affirmative terrorizes thinking itself in order to reconceptualize being**
**Mitchell 5** <span class="cite"><span style="font-weight: normal;">(Andrew J, Post-Doctoral Fellow in the Humanities at Stanford University “Heidegger and Terrorism”, Research in Phenomenology, 35, pg 214-215 Rufus)</span></span>
<span class="underline">Insofar as it is Americanism ….<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">do no</span>t too obstinately <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">squelch them</span>. </span>

**<span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Violent ontologies are the largest cause of violence- their causal chains to improbable impacts ignore the interplay of enframing that underlies it all</span></span>**

My argument here, ….<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> the global rule of insecurity and violence? Will our thought?</span></span>

**We understand that there are risks associated with the plan, but to associate a specific internal link chain misses the fact that there are risks to every path, and the attempt to eliminate them is a futile and nihilistic attempt that dooms us to perpetual violence**
