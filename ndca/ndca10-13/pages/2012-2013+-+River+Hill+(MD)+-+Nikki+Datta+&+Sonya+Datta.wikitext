Plan: The United States federal judiciary should require the provision of transportation infrastructure investment for individuals totally deprived of transportation by holding that San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez creates a total deprivation to transportation cause of action under the federal equal protection clause irrespective of discriminatory intent.

===Advantage 1 is Discrimination:=== 

The poor are discriminated against in access to transportation – means they can’t get a job
Timothy Baldwin, 2006 (“The Constitutional Right to Travel: Are Some Forms of Transportation More Equal Than Others?” Northwestern Journal of Law and Social Policy, Summer 2006, 1 Nw. J. L. & Soc.

The dilemma facing the …are unable to find jobs.47

Poverty is the equivalent to a thermonuclear war between Russia and the US – this systemic impact is bigger and more probable than any war
James Gilligan, 2000 Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, 2000 edition, Violence: Reflections on Our Deadliest Epidemic, p. 195-196
The 14 to 18 million deaths …decade, throughout the world.

Minorities with low incomes are affected by lack of safe facilities

Pol'y 213, L/N, rwg, http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=njlsp)
The poor in the U.S… transportation is not available.

REJECT RACISM AT EVERY TURN:
BARDNT 1991 (JOESEPH, MINISTER, DISMANTLING RACISM)
To study racism is to …, the walls of racism.

The plan through the total deprivation doctrine would protect the rights of the poor and minorities

Pol'y 213, L/N, rwg, http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=njlsp)
It will probably remain … addiction to the automobile.

===Advantage 2: Discriminatory Intent=== 

The courts in the plan create a precedent ‘cause of action under the doctrine of total deprivation’- means courts are key

When politics fail, municipal underbounding … protections like the Fair Housing Act. 102

====Scenario 1 is the Death Penalty==== 

Challenging the doctrine of discriminatory intent allows successful challenges to the death penalty:
Lucy Adams, 2005 (Bachelor of Laws, University of Melbourne, Summer 2005, “Death By Discretion: Who Decides Who Lives and Dies in the United States of America?” Lexis/Nexis, rwg)
The decision in McCleskey has been … prosecution that it is all too obvious.

The Death Penalty is injustice – it kills the innocent and adversely affects minorities, the poor, and members or religious or ethnic communities
Pham, 2012 (Jessica Pham, “U.S. Must Abolish the Death Penalty Before Criticizing Others on Human Rights Record,” Accessed 1/12/13 at http://policymic.com/articles/8577/u-s-must-abolish-the-death-penalty-before-criticizing-others-on-human-rights-record, rwg)

Andre, Velasquez no date (Claire and Manuel, Santa Clara University, Capital Punishment: Our Duty or Our Doom?, http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/iie/v1n3/capital.html)
The case against capital …. it when other alternatives exist.

The US has to get rid of the death penalty to hold up its human rights credibility and rack up soft power

On March 18, 2009, New Mexico …US public diplomacy efforts.

The death penalty diminishes our human right’s record – it’s time for an international dialogue
