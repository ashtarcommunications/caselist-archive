<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Status quo explorations of the universe are fundamentally anthropological in the sense that they are always concerned with the perfection of the human body—this is the continuation of a metaphysical project that Western society has pursued since the Greeks issued their injunction against nature with "man is the measure of all things."

Where do they come from? Our interrogation of what is humanity precedes other considerations—it is a unique ontological question that bankrupts traditional calculative thought. This precedes all other considerations. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Observation Two: Pretty Little Liars</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Despite thousands of reports, the resources of the state are always directed to cover up possibilities of nonhuman intelligence. Until the State recognizes the ontological category of the alien and deconstructs the anthropology of the human body, we will maintain the violence of the status quo. Revealing the distinctly nonhuman nature of UFOs would disrupt the entire Western metaphysical fantasy. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Specifically, the government would be forced to confront its own sovereignty—only forcing the state to engage in deconstruction can undermine its ontological certainty in the human ideal. Exposing the centrality of fantasy to the sovereign's rule ruptures its epistemic foundations; any alternative lapses into violence. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Observation Three: Solvency</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Our engaged deconstruction of the human body offers a new politics of the flesh that can move beyond conventional definitions of politics and ontology. We force a confrontation with the universe that prompts an ontological meditation while simultaneously changing the real political landscape of our modern society. Using the ballot to adopt our ontological starting point of the body offers a momentary experience with revolutionary ontology that precedes all other considerations. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">1: The Link – </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The affirmative is inescapably bound by technological thinking – rather than letting existence be, they are obsessed with finding instrumental technologies such as international relations in an attempt to lash out against Being. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">This mode of thinking reduces the entirety of existence to nothing more than a set of monotonous cogs in various machines – the entire world becomes a standing reserve of energy to be used and deployed as needed. The universe is stripped of all value and material paradise becomes hell on Earth. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The phenomenological annihilation of Being directly translates into violence on the level of everyday life – once stripped of value, existence becomes pointless and all atrocity becomes justified. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">And, their discourse of urgency is preoccupied with eluding death at all costs – rather than living life for its own sake, our existence is reduced to the expedient. This ruins value to life and reduces existence to nothing more than an out-living rather than a living-out of Being – their threats won't ever happen unless we lash against Being. Failure to recognize this delves into nuclear war.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">And, the affirmative's reduction of the political to a stale series of relations between states is an attempt to reduce Being to a metaphysical certainty.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">As Heidegger-himself an […]modern political thought.</span>

===<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Heidegger Real</span>=== 

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Part 1: The Thesis – </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">WHY ARE THERE BEINGS AT ALL INSTEAD OF NOTHING? This question has loomed over the entirety of Western thought since the beginning of philosophy, but has always retained the fallacies of Plato. Thinkers have confused Being as a simple facet of HUMAN life but ignore the greater essence of the universe. This way of thinking ignores the true nature of Being as a separate entity which allows for being to exist in the first place. Existence is not separate from essence, for the essence of Being dwells in the existence of beings. This fallacy is the ultimate concern of our affirmative.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">(From) Heidegger, 2000 (Martin, Rector of Freiburg University, "Introduction to Metaphysics," trans. Gregory Fried, Prof. Phil. BU & Richard Polt, Prof. Phil. Xavier Uni., 2000, "The Fundamental Question of Metaphysics," Pp. 1-7) CJQ</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">WHY ARE THERE beings at all instead of nothing […]we must recognize it as the most originary (urspriinglich) of questions.</span>



<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">WHY ARE THERE DEBATES AT ALL INSTEAD OF CONSENSUS? What IS debate? Perhaps this question is only answered by asking what IS the debate space? Debaters proceed as if they know what the debate space is but in truth none of us really know—our community has failed to attempt to investigate the places where we live only to produce topicality debates and tired framework shells. We are not the debaters of 30 years ago, and our first task is to investigate the spaces where we work and love. That is the project of our meditation.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">All knowledge is ideologically-driven: the modern quest for objectivity has produced fields of knowing that always contain a motive and desire: frameworks and rules are all self-referential constructs designed to in some way inhibit debate and exploration. All rules are self-referential and have no existence beyond the human psyche; modern debate's fear of the Interpretation and concern with the violation worships them as Allah and Yahweh, always concerned with appeasing an ever-evasive fairness and education. Only meditation on what IS the debate space offers the ability to move beyond modern's paralyzing empiricism. </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Stables 2 (Andrew, Stables, Reader in Education at University of Bath, "On the Making and Breaking of Frames in Pursuit of Sustainability, Trumpeter 18.1)</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> Wordsworth is here describing a mood […]guarantee our sustainability.</span>



<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The technological project of modernity dooms us to total ontological damnation. This is no postmodern jargon: Ontological damnation is the severance of humanity from nature, a complete nausea towards the natural world and towards Being; the end of thought, politics—everything that makes life worthwhile. The project of technology will guarantee a nuclear annihilation of all of existence – not just of humans, or of plants, but of Being itself. It is not essential whether or not the bombs go off, for the mushroom clouds of technology will not be far behind the damnation of the world. Death means NOTHING in a world where life has no value: all other concerns are secondary to this philosophical imperative.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Thiele '95 (Professor of Political Science at University of Florida " Timely Meditations," Pp. 203-4.)</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The age of planetary mastery […]devastation is complete</span>



<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">And, the Western view of the universe as fundamentally SEPARATE from the human mind is simply the most recent expression of Newton's mechanical universe: this idea that humans are separate from the universe and that Being can easily be parceled out into parts like "beyond the mesosphere" and "within the stratosphere" are fallacious attempts to dominate nature. The root cause of violence is this violent relationship to the universe. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Part 2: The Meditation</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">THE ALTERNATIVEIS: Vote negative to reject the technology of the affirmative and meditate-on-Being. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">What is the alternative, you ask? What is the solution? WE PROPOSE to meditate-on-being. Our meditation grounds human though in the EARTH and in the localities closest to us—not in far-our realms like the nation-state, or in some supposed mesosphere, but in the here-and-now, in this room and at this time. Our meditation forsakes artificial dreams of omnipotence and enables a true and meaningful interrogation. Instead of falling slavish to the dogmatic limitations of calculative thinking and what COULD be in the future, limit your analysis to the here and the now; to this debate round, and the ontology in this room. Only this offers freedom and authentic exploration of the universe. There is no other version of the plan that doesn't surrender to the imperialism of modernity.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Heidegger '66 (Martin, Rector Freiburg University, "Discourse on Thinking," Pp. 47-9) CJQ</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">There are, then, two kinds of thinking […]organization and automation?</span>



<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">And, evaluate considerations of ontology before EVERYTHING else – it is the basis for all other decisions. If an impact is not justified by ontological analysis DO NOT WEIGH IT. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">As Heidegger-himself an especially revealing figure of the deep and mutual implication of the philosophical and the political-never tired of pointing out, the relevance […]of decision making.</span>



<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Only a genuine ontological meditation allows for being to reveal itself in beauty; the alternativetriggers a reorientation towards Being and restores a value to life. Traditional interpretations of what it means to Be reduce debate to a simple technological device to control and condition the minds of academics. It forces a willful forgetting-of-Being on debaters that ensures ontological damnation. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">WE DECLARE A SACRED WAR ON THE AFFIRMATIVE.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The tragedy of public sacrifice allows for a genuine relationship with the horrors</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">of the 1AC. We ourselves become the violence and the terror, but we simultaneously identify with the victims. Through wounding, we ourselves are broken. As we flay the affirmative, we also wear their skin. This allows for us to enter a space of radical liminality—no longer do divisions of self and other exist, but they are merged and we recognize our own mortality.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Allison 9 [David, Professor of Philosophy, The Obssessions of George Bataille: Community and</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">"Communication ed. Mitchell/Winfree p. 122-123, 127 CJQ]"</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">To communicate with […]communication with other humans.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">In sacrifice, the veil of the universe is torn—we are exposed to other realities and liminality itself if overcome—we die voluntarily, but in our sacrifice we overcome death. This intimate relationship functions to grant meaning beyond mere existence and duration. War functions as a form of mass sacrifice—killing is required and all experience becomes agonistic. Embracing this allows for an infinitely superior value to be given to life—turning the case.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Therefore, we demand that the judge violently sacrifice the affirmative project by adopting the alternative of a negative ballot. This enables a fusion of ontology and metaphysics which overcomes traditional limitations and preemptions.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Specifically, future-oriented calculations deny sacrifice—with no rational reason for their existence, they are denied value and rejected.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Thus we see that the stakes […]the general order of things.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Attempting to restore order denies the excessive violence intrinsic to the State and cedes responsibility for actions taken in the name of violence. The affirmative relies on the subsumation of a political theater reliant on exterminating the other without recognizing them in sacrifice. Necessarily, such a cooption culminates in a terminally fascist state-sacrifice apparatus, in which there is no ontological opening, and which fails to solve by making the sacrifices involved merely tools of the state.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">This means any permutation will fail—combining our theatrical sacrifice with the actions of the State will produce a biopolitical control over a docile body and coopt the sacrifice and produce an ontological closedness which fails to produce any form of sacredness.</span>

===<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Filibuster Counterplan</span>=== 

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Counterplan text: The United States House of Representatives should pass the plan. The United States Senate should fail to invoke cloture on the bill under rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate and then exercise its authority under Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution and invoke cloture with a simple majority. TheUnited StatesSenate should then pass and the President should sign the plan.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">1. It competes:</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">A. Normal means for Senate passage is that the Senate must successfully invoke cloture on a filibuster for a bill to become law.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Nothing will pass […]of health care reform</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">C. And, the counterplan deliberately has the Senate fail to invoke cloture but then modify its rules to abolish the filibuster. This competes with the plan because the affirmative cannot pass and fail simultaneously at any point of the legislative process, making permutations impossible.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">2. It solves:</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">A. The Senate can use Article I, Section 5 to invoke cloture with a simply majority. The plan still happens and the counterplan captures 100% of case—further, the counterplan prevents the filibuster from ever being used again.</span>
