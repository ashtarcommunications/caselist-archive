NEW PLAN:
Without mandating the cessation of operations at the Jungle Warfare
Training Center at Camp Gonsalvez, the United States Department of

Corps personnel stationed in Japan to approximately 5,000 by
realigning, to a location other than Japan, personnel from III Marine
Expeditionary Force.

Observation One – The Status Quo



<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Futenma is like a time bomb on the entire U.S. Japan alliance.</span>
<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Kusumoto, from Stars & Stripes, 6-18-10 (Hana, “Futenma fight could linger despite Japan's new prime minister,” Stars and Stripes, www.stripes.com/news/pacific/okinawa/futenma-fight-could-linger-despite-japan-s-new-prime-minister-1.107689)</span>
<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Kan is taking a …. said, “is like a time bomb.”</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Now is the key time to resolve Futenma – Only way to prevent collapse of the relationship.</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Our shared interests are … into the next generation.</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">What the U.S. should do is substantially reduce the number of Marines in Japan – It preserves the entirety of our detterence and warfighting capabilities</span>

Mike Mochizuki)</span>
<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">2. Restructure U.S. military forces …move forward on these matters P. 195-6</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Independent from any decision regarding the location of the headquarters of the Third Marine Expeditionary Force, the Department of Defense should agree to gradually redeploy Marines from Japan other than the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit as well as a comparable number of Marines to maintain pre-positioned equipment and maintain access arrangement for the emergency use of Japanese facilities.</span>


Observation Two – Deterrence



<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">The status quo ensures a political disaster that will cripple the alliance and support for all of our bases in Japan which are the absolute key to our power projection in Asia</span>
<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Ennis, former member of the Council on Foreign Relations task forces regarding Japan, former Research Fellow at Dartmouth’s Dickey Center for International Understanding, long-time analyst of U.S.-Japan relations, U.S. Correspondent for Keekly Tokyo Keizai, founder of The Oriental Economist, 6-8-10 (Peter, “Jeff Bader, Mike Green hit critics of Obama Futenma policy,” Dispatch Japan, http://www.dispatchjapan.com/blog/2010/06/jeff-bader-mike-green-hit-critics-of-obama-futenma-policy.html)</span>
<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">The exchanges of the last … tensions between Washington and Tokyo.</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">And, Trying to hold onto our Marine presence causes a political backlash that ensures we lose all of our bases – Sacrificing one base now saves 100 in the crunch – The plan doesn’t hurt our deterrence or credibility</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">The security alliance has served … significant challenge in that pursuit.</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">And, Failure to move the Marines will rock the alliance and ignite opposition to our other bases in Japan – The plan is the best way to shore up our defense capabilities</span>
<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Ennis, former member of the Council on Foreign Relations task forces regarding Japan, former Research Fellow at Dartmouth’s Dickey Center for International Understanding, long-time analyst of U.S.-Japan relations, U.S. Correspondent for Keekly Tokyo Keizai, founder of The Oriental Economist, 8-18-10 (Peter, “Gates and Japan,” Dispatch Japan, http://www.dispatchjapan.com/blog/2010/08/gates-and-japan.html)</span>
<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Okinawa is home to the III …naval base in Kyushu.</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Scenario One – Kadena Air Base</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Not doing the plan undermines our ability to hold onto Kadena – The plan saves the base without impacting deterrence</span>
<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">O’Hanlon, Director of Research & Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy at Brookings, Director of Research for the 21st Centry Defense Initiative, 9-2-4 (Michael, before the Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States, http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/osbc/documents/OSBC%20transcript%209-2-04.pdf)</span>
<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Second point. Okinawa, ….don't reconsider some of that.</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">And, Kadena is categorically more important to deterrence than our Marine presence – The plan is critical to shoring up political support for the base.</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Why have Washington and …. the US Japan Security Treaty.</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Deterrence could fail if China's …. maintain the security of Taiwan.</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">THE high-intensity scenario …. China puts sovereignty above everything else.</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Scenario Two – Yokosuka Naval Base</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Failure to do the plan puts fatal stress on the alliance – We’d lose our ability to station an aircraft carrier in Japan which militarialy isolates Japan and undercuts our credibility in Asia</span>
<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Auslin, Director of Japan Studies at the American Enterprise Institute & former History Professor & Senior Research Fellow at the MacMilan Center for Interantation & Area Studes at Yale, 6-16-10 (Micahel, “The Real Futenma Fallout,” Wall Street Journal Asia, http://www.aei.org/article/102196)</span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Every condition of international ….destruction (WMD) at that.</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Scenario Three – Containment</span>


<span style="display: block; font-family: times;">Current Marine deployments in Okinawa creates the perception in China that we are preparing for a land war with them – It increases their perception of being boxed in militarily.</span>

==Japan 1AC - St. Marks== 

Observation One – The Status Quo
In 2006 the U.S. and Japan agreed to close Marine Corps Air Station Futenma IF Japan built a replacement facility for it in Nago City. Japan’s current Prime Minister committed to follow through with the agreement in May BUT local political and public opposition will prevent the move from ever taking place.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tokyo's agreement with ….more difficult than ever</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>
Even though Kan was just re-elected as the Prime Minister, there is zero chance that he will be able to convince Okinawa to accept the relocation of Futenma to Nago

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Failure to shore up the alliance by reducing the presence of Marines collapses the alliance which causes multiple scenarios for nuclear war</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Asia, in the throes of historic …. throughout the region.</span>


<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Observation Two – Deterrence</span>
First, Local political and public opposition means Futenma won’t be relocated – Kan’s inability to get the deal done ensures renewed bilateral tensions and ignites opposition to our other bases

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The already-slim prospects …. carries on, the more that danger rises</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>


<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">And, Trying to hold onto our Marine presence causes a political backlash that ensures we lose all of our bases – Sacrificing one base now saves 100 in the crunch – The plan doesn’t hurt our deterrence or credibility</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Scenario One – Kadena Air Base</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">THE high-intensity scenario …. China puts sovereignty above everything else. </span>


<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Scenario Two – Yokosuka Naval Base</span>
Failure to do the plan puts fatal stress on the alliance – We’d lose our ability to station an aircraft carrier in Japan which militarialy isolates Japan and undercuts our credibility in Asia

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt 12pt;">In 2006 the U.S. and Japan agreed to close Marine Corps Air Station Futenma IF Japan built a replacement facility for it in Nago City. Japan’s current Prime Minister committed to follow through with the agreement in May BUT local political and public opposition will prevent the move from ever taking place. </span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt 24pt;">Tokyo's agreement with Washington to relocate ...has become more difficult than ever. </span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt 12pt;">And, Even though Kan was just re-elected as the Prime Minister, there is zero chance that he will be able to convince Okinawa to accept the relocation of Futenma to Nago </span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt 12pt;">And, Winning that relations are improving is IRRELEVENT – Those arguments are all predicated on the replacement facility being built – When it doesn’t get built, the entire alliance will unravel -- The plan is the only way to ensure long-term stability </span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt 12pt;">Independent from decisions regarding the locations of the Third Marine Logistics Group Headquarters, Third Marine Expeditionary Force Command Element, the First Marine Air Wing Headquarters and without mandating the cessation of operations at the Jungle Warfare Training Center at Camp Gonsalves, the United States Department of Defense should implement a policy whereby the number of personnel from III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed in Japan is reduced to approximately 5,000 which should include, but should not necessarily be limited to, the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit as well as Marine Corps personnel tasked with maintaining pre-positioned equipment and access arrangements for the emergency use of Japanese facilities in addition to requisite combat support, combat service support, administration, and logistics elements. </span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt 12pt;">Now is the KEY time to resolve the basing dispute – It’s the only way to prevent a complete collapse of the U.S. Japan relationship. </span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt 12pt;">And, Basing disputes in Okinawa are the most significant issue facing the Alliance – Failure to reduce the burden of Marines undermines the best mechanism for regional and global security – Even if they win that the alliance doesn’t collapse completely, the plan is the only way to ensure continued public support needed for the it to be successful. </span>

CRITIQUE
depictions of nuclear scenarios and strategy do not build upon an empirical study of nuclear realities are instead reflections of the discourses that preceded them. The “text” of a nuclear weapon is more important than its physical effect on the nuclear balance.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Their argument ignores the fact that Obama’s campaign was largely based on increases resources for the war in Afghanistan and that there was universal support amongst his military advisors for the surge – Going back on his campaign promise and overriding his advisors independently cripples our leadership.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Their argument is premised on the argument that we have overused our hard power – The plan emboldens all of our adversaries and undermines the confidence of our allies by creating the perception that we won’t act to defend our national interests.</span>

**<span style="color: black;">- redraw the Northern Limit Line slightly to the South, warning North Korea that after the redrawing of the line, provocations will be met with swift, appropriate retaliation;</span>**


**<span style="color: black;">- initiate economic cooperation and a peace treaty if North Korea agrees to begin denuclearization, end provocations, and begin economic reforms;</span>**


**<span style="color: black;">- Propose a nuclear weapon free zone treaty, but waive the nuclear-free requirements until it is secure enough to do so. The senate should ratify the treaty when ready;</span>**


**<span style="color: black;">- expand military to military dialogue with China by expanding the Incidents at Sea Agreement and cooperating over the best practices on environmental security issues;</span>**


**<span style="color: black;">- Inform China that if North Korea develops a nuclear arsenal, it will not attempt to prevent its allies from developing their own and that in the event of a North Korean regime collapse, the United States will not take advantage of instability and will offer China financial assistance.</span>**
