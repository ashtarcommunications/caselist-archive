**Our discussion of animal rights through the lens of the plight of the Snake River Salmon intersects with every impact – until we elevate the suffering of animals to the level of the human we will be unable to effectively address the problems of humanity – this is a takeout to all of their education claims because without addressing the issue of the belittling of animals we can never truly understand the woes of humans**
