__The global economy's foundations are weakening, one by one__. Already hobbled by Europe's debt crisis, __the world now risks being hurt by slowdowns in its economic powerhouses.__ __The U.S. economy__, the __world's largest__, __had a third straight month of feeble job growth in May__. __High-flying economies in China, India and Brazil are slowing, too.__ Fears of a global economic downturn have sent investors rushing toward the safest possible investments: U.S. and German government bonds. As a result, __the interest rate on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has hit a record-low__ 1.46 percent. __The rate on the German 10-year bond is even lower__: 1.17 percent. "Treasurys are at 1.46 because people are freaking out," says Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics. The gravest fear is Europe. The most urgent threat is that in mid-June, __Greek__ voters will reject the __terms of a $170 billion bailout__ -- which called for painful budget cuts -- and abandon the euro. The move __could ignite economic and financial chaos as Greek debts shift from denominations in euros to Greek drachmas of uncertain value. Yet the global economy's troubles go well beyond Greece.__
