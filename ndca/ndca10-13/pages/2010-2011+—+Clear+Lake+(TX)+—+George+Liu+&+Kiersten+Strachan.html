<span style="display: block; margin-right: 0.2in;"><strong><u>FEARS of an all-out conflict between North and South Korea grew last night after a ship was sunk in a suspected torpedo attack</u></strong>. Early reports suggested that only 58 of the South Korean naval vessel's 104-strong crew had been saved. After the ship went down, the South Korean navy fired on an unidentified ship in the Yellow Sea, close to North Korea. The incident took place on a disputed sea boundary that has been the scene of numerous incidents, most recently in January and February. Clashes took place in 2002 but these were not as serious as a border dispute in 1999 that left up to 80 North Korean sailors dead after an exchange of gunfire. There are now fears that the latest incident in worsening relations between the two countries could plunge them into war. An emergency meeting of security officials was called by South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak in the capital Seoul. However South Korea was careful not to confirm reports that the attack was by forces controlled by North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il. Kim Jong-il. A spokesman said: &quot;It is not clear whether North Korea was involved.&quot; <strong><u>The dramatic escalation of the conflict comes after North Korea warned it was bolstering its defences in response to joint military operations held by South Korea and America</u></strong>. <strong><u>North Korea had already threatened nuclear strikes against the US and South Korea over claims they were trying to topple Kim Jong-il's communist regime.</u></strong></span><br />

<span style="display: block; margin-right: 0.2in;">Kim Jong Il, often called North Korea's David, did not flinch from standing up to the military muscle of the world's super-Goliath, the United States. Kim Jong Il had already built up a lethal war machine capable of wreaking unprecedented havoc on the American mainland at a minute's notice. Kim Jong Il is sure of the huge capability of his military. It would take the Korean People's Army as few as several minutes to wipe out off the world map the whole of South Korea and the entire Japanese archipelago. Significantly absent from the Perry report is a mention of the real threat of any new war in Korea instantly expanding into nuclear war, with 12 operating nuclear reactors in the ROK, 51 reactors in Japan and 102 in the United States singled out as prime targets. However, the Perry report noted that a new war would be fought on the world's most densely populated and industrialized areas, unlike the Gulf War and the Yugoslavia war. Resumption of hostilities in Korea would spell an abrupt end to the present unprecedented economic prosperity the Americans are enjoying. It would leave South Korea and Japan smoking in Stone-Age ruins. Forward military bases, AEGIS ships, nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, submarines and cruise missiles would be of little operational value in safeguarding the American mainland from nuclear holocaust. Moreover, dozens, hundreds of Chernobyls will inevitably break out in South Korea, Japan and the United States.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; margin-right: 0.2in;">Such a &quot;dual use&quot; capability would benefit the United States as well. The objective would not be a high-profile attempt at containment, but a low-profile capacity for deterrence, relieving Washington of any need to intervene. Most important, <strong><u>America should not reflexively extend its &quot;nuclear umbrella&quot; in response to the future possibility of a nuclear North Korea. Doing so would inevitably deepen American involvement in regional controversies, potentially turning every local dispute into an international crisis</u></strong>. Moreover, while such a policy might seem to be a convenient and cheap means of protecting friends while discouraging proliferation, <strong><u>it would become problematic once another nation gained the ability to strike the United States.</u></strong> If North Korea eventually marries a nuclear weapon to a long-range missile, Pyongyang still won't strike America. Kim Jong-il is evil, not stupid; he wants his virgins in this life, not the next. However<strong><u>, such a weapon would give him a deterrent capability, modest though it might be, diminishing the credibility of Washington's threat to intervene. The question would become: for what are American policy makers willing to sacrifice Los Angeles</u></strong>? Seoul and Tokyo? Sydney and Taipei? Jakarta and Bangkok? All of them? <strong><u>Even if the risk was small, the cost would be catastrophic. And the U.S. government's principal responsibility is to protect American lives, not to guarantee the security of foreign lands. Adopting a policy inviting a nuclear attack on the American homeland violates that duty</u></strong>. <strong><u>Offering nuclear guarantees also diminishes the threat</u></strong> — to North Korea and China — <strong><u>of America's friends developing independent nuclear deterrents. Far better for Washington to indicate that it is not inclined to leave the DPRK with a nuclear monopoly among smaller powers in East Asia.</u></strong> <strong><u>While the United States would not encourage its allies to exercise the nuclear option, it should suggest that it would not stop them.</u></strong> Pyongyang might not mind the further spread of nuclear weapons, but <strong><u>Beijing certainly would not relish the prospect of</u></strong> Japan, and even worse <strong><u>Taiwan, exercising the nuclear option. Even if the PRC was not certain that Washington was serious, it would have an incentive to bring greater pressure on the North. And that, of course, is the ultimate goal: halt proliferation to the DPRK.</u></strong> Whether America and allied states would want to go down this path if Pyongyang proceeded unimpeded could be addressed then. <strong><u>But a written pledge now by Washington to defend South Korea against a nuclear North would eliminate perhaps the most powerful way of sharing the nuclear nightmare with China, and thus encouraging it to act against North Korea.</u></strong> There's nothing unusual about American officials pledging to protect the South. Last month, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated: &quot;I want to underscore the commitments the United States has and intends always to honor for the defense of South Korea and Japan.&quot; But the justification of such a policy long ago disappeared. <strong><u>Washington</u></strong> <strong><u>should devolve responsibility for the ROK's defense to the ROK. Seoul can protect itself against conventional threats. South Korea could respond to nuclear weapons in the North by raising the possibility of building a countervailing nuclear capability</u></strong>. That's not a good solution. But it might prove to be the best of a bunch of bad options. </span><br />

The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious, not only for the Northeast Asian region but for the whole international community. At worst, there is the possibility of nuclear attack, whether <strong><u>b</u></strong>y intention, miscalculation, or merely accident, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities. On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust of unprecedented proportions. But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited <strong><u>nuclear</u></strong> war in the region would rearrange our global climate <strong>far more quickly than global warming</strong>. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies indicate that <strong><u>the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature</u></strong> by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: That is not global winter, but the nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years. The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow…<strong><u>period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production</u></strong> than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger…To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.4 These, of course, are not the only consequences. left by nuclear next-use. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. <strong><u>The direct</u></strong> impacts, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, could make the present global financial crisis <strong>pale by comparison</strong>. How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. There could be many unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with subsequent nuclear breakout and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over <strong><u>fissile material or</u></strong> warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, and aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant states. <strong><u>The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one</u></strong> that warrants priority consideration from the international community.<br />

<strong>The Resulting nuclear winter will cause the extinction of all life</strong><br />
<strong>Sagan</strong> <strong>85</strong> (Carl Astrophysicist Prof “Nuclear War and Nuclear Winter,” Commonwealth Club)<br />
Now, if you imagine all of these put together: the infrastructure of the society utterly destroyed by the prompt effects, billions of people wiped out immediately, the civic and sanitary services, medical facilities, water, electricity, communication, transportation all wiped out. The sun, in effect, turned off. The temperatures dropping much more than they do in winter, although winter is enough. Water supplies frozen to a depth of meters. A deadly smog of poison gases spreading out over the countryside. Radioactive fallout in dangerous quantities, dangerous enough to compromise the human immune system, falling over most of the Northern Hemisphere. The destruction of agriculture and food supplies. The inability to grow a new harvest. With the effects, as I say, propagating into equatorial and Southern Hemisphere regions, you have a ghastly, grizzly picture of what is in store for us if we are so foolish as to permit a nuclear war, even a small one, to occur. Now, a group of distinguished biologists, some 20 of them, have examined the biological consequences of such a nuclear war, of such a nuclear winter with an eye towards the fragility of the global ecosystem, and conclude that under the circumstances that I've just described, massive species extinctions, not just deaths but extinctions, wiping out every last member of the given species, are likely. And, if you think of the interrelatedness of life on the planet, how dependent we are on plants and animals, to say nothing of industries that most of us never even see, you have some sense of how in the years, decades and centuries following such a nuclear war, the human community might dwindle first to a medieval kind of subsistence level and then back to still earlier levels with the human population falling to prehistoric values and the biologists emphasize that the extinction of the human species cannot be excluded under these circumstances. Now, this is serious stuff. Extinction is forever. Extinction undoes the lives, makes pointless the lives of all of our ancestors, of everyone who came before us, of all of those 40,000 generations of humans whose accomplishments we are the beneficiary of. And it also undoes the lives of all those humans who might come after us if we do not permit nuclear war to occur. I claim that there is a new set of stakes that nuclear winter has introduced. The stakes are simply much higher than was ever realized before. Now, how certain are these results?<br />

)<br />
The U.S. Defense Department’s plan for the “transformation and realignment” of U.S. forces worldwide has created some nervousness in both Japan and South Korea despite the potential domestic political benefits of reducing the burden of U.S. bases on local communities. The main concern of Japan, which is shared by some in the South Korean government, relates to rumors of American force reductions that could signal a shift of focus away from the longstanding U.S. role of deterring conflict and reinforcing security in Northeast Asia. U.S. officials and senior military officers insist that any force reductions will be more than compensated for by increasing the mobility and lethality of remaining forces. Some Japanese officials and commentators, however, are not completely persuaded by these reassurances. Analysts have noted that unlike in Europe, where the Pentagon is drawing down and realigning forces that are no longer relevant in a post-Cold War environment, potential flash points such as the Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan Straits continue to represent active threats to peace. These observers note that given the lack of any collective security framework in Asia, the U.S. bilateral alliance system remains the lynchpin of regional stability and security. In general, the Japanese government has indicated cautious support for proposed changes in the American command structure and deployments in Japan and South Korea. At the same time, however, the Koizumi government also appears to have some unresolved concerns about the larger portents of reconfiguring U.S. forces for new challenges arising out of the threat of global terrorism and proliferation. A struggle has emerged between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japan Defense Agency over whether the new National Defense Program Outline, scheduled for adoption by the end of 2004, should include a parallel “transformation” of Japanese forces to facilitate their deployment outside the traditional boundaries of the “Far East,” as referenced in the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. The same concern about the boundaries of the alliance has caused some in the Japanese government to resist a Pentagon proposal to relocate the headquarters of the 1st Army Corps, currently at Fort Lewis in Washington state, to Camp Zama, about 25 miles southwest of Tokyo. The camp currently houses the several U.S. Army headquarters elements as well as Japanese ground forces units. Reportedly, Japanese officials are concerned about the broader implications of hosting a U.S. military command that is responsible for missions beyond the area covered by the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. Some argue that this arrangement could transgress the limits of the prevailing constitutional interpretation banning participation in “collective defense” arrangements. The Paradox of Managing U.S.-Japan Alliance Cooperation on North Korea and Broader Security Threats The United States faces something of a paradox. On one hand, alliance cooperation has never been closer or more extensive, and Japan continues to remove legal and policy barriers to support for U.S. forces in combat situations. On the other hand, Japan also has never been more materially and psychologically prepared to become a “normal” country, since the concept was first proposed by a prominent nationalist politician, Ichiro Ozawa, in the early 1990s, to develop an independent defense and power projection capability. Japan’s concerns about a rising China have also caused nervousness about any indication that the United States might find a “strategic” partnership with Beijing in the U.S. interest. Already, a number of Japanese analysts have warned that the maintenance of the U.S.-Japan alliance for more than five decades is unprecedented. On the other hand, the October 2004 report of the Prime Minister’s Advisory Commission on Defense Capabilities and indications of the contents of the new National Defense Program Outline covering the period 2005 to 2009, continue to emphasize the absolute necessity of maintaining Japanese defense policy on the basis of the U.S.-Japan alliance. These trends and indicators suggest that alliance relations could go in two very different directions, depending on how well the United States manages its current opportunity to forge a closer and more effective alliance. In the near term, the problem of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and other WMD is likely to be the crucible in which the vitality of the alliance is determined. In the longer term, greater Japanese security activism appears to be taking on a life of its own. That is, the expanded role and operational freedom that has been given to the Japanese military in response to Japan’s concerns about keeping the United States attentive to its interests regarding North Korea has acquired momentum that is not necessarily connected with any specific threat or conflict scenario. The Japanese challenge, at the moment, is to acquire the political will and cross-ministry cooperation to forge a new national strategy that reflects not only the need to maintain a strong alliance with the United States, but that also one that is comprehensive with respect to the totality of Japan economic, diplomatic, and military interests.<br />

Even worse, Washington's policy encourages a dependent mentality on the part of the Japanese and enables Tokyo to evade political and military responsibilities in East Asia even when Japan has important interests at stake. Japanese officials confirm that, in the event of war, Japanese military units would not join U.S. forces in combat operations unless Japan itself were attacked. U.S. leaders foolishly perpetuate Japan's security dependence. Washington's East Asian policy is held hostage to the exaggerated fears of Japan's neighbors, who oppose a more active military role for Tokyo. A lingering undercurrent of distrust toward Japan in U.S. policy circles has also been a major motive for Washington's &quot;smothering&quot; strategy. A new policy is badly needed. It would seek a mature relationship between equals and recognize that Japan, as the principal great power in East Asia, must take a more significant role in the region's security affairs. The United States should withdraw its forces from East Asia over the next five years and keep smaller forces based in Guam and other U.S. territories. The U.S.-Japanese alliance ought to be replaced by a more limited, informal security relation- ship. America should be the balancer of last resort, not the intervenor of first resort, in East Asia's security equation. Introduction Critics have long charged that Washington's military commitments to wealthy allies in Western Europe and East Asia encourage those nations to &quot;free ride&quot; on the U.S. security guarantee. The accuracy of such allegations was demonstrated with unusual clarity in early 1995 when Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Nye unveiled his department's latest East Asia strategy report, which affirmed that the United States would keep approximately 100,000 troops in East Asia indefinitely.(1) Five days later Japan's Kyodo News Service announced that the Japanese government hoped to reduce its troop levels and weapons by approximately 20 percent and cut military spending over the next five years.(2) Those two events indicate that incentives matter just as much in international affairs as they do in domestic affairs. Given the threat environment in East Asia--North Korea's attempt to acquire nuclear weapons, China's increasingly assertive behavior, and the continuing political instability in Russia--it is unlikely that Tokyo would decide to cut its already modest military forces and budgets were it not for Washington's willingness to underwrite Japan's defense. The attitude expressed in an editorial in the influential Asahi Shimbun, that Japan should &quot;aim at being a conscientious-objector nation,&quot; would be difficult to sustain if Japan had to be responsible for its own safety.(3) Hisahiko Okazaki, Japan's former ambassador to Thailand, described a more probable reaction. If the U.S. alliance did not exist and Japan's survival were at stake, &quot;because of a threat from the Russians, the North Koreans, or the Chinese,&quot; Okazaki stated, Japan would build a strong military force for itself.(4) Just as domestic welfare expenditures foster an unhealthy dependent mentality and discourage initiative on the part of recipients, so too do international military welfare subsidies. Nye's announcement reassured Japanese officials that it was safe for their country to continue its free-riding habits.<br />

<span style="display: block; margin-right: 0.2in;"><strong><u>The standard argument against Japan playing a more active military role is that it would upset its neighbors in East Asia.</u></strong> The nations of that region, it is said, still remember the outrages committed by imperial Japan during the 1920s and 1930s and would react badly to any manifestations of &quot;Japanese militarism.&quot; <strong><u>But that argument oversimplifies reality.</u></strong> True, a few countries (most notably South Korea) are still paranoid about Japan. China also opposes any military role for Japan. Indeed, if Beijing had its way, the Japanese SDF would not even exist. But <strong><u>China's strident objections are self-serving;</u></strong> <strong><u>PRC officials realize that an</u></strong> active, <strong><u>assertive Japan would be a major obstacle to Beijing's own ambitions</u></strong> to become the dominant power in the region. <strong><u>Other East Asian countries are beginning to mute their objections to Japan playing a more active security role.</u></strong> Successive Australian governments have said that the time has come to bury the fears about renewed Japanese militarism. Singapore earlier this year offered Tokyo the use of its naval facilities -- a strong signal that it accepts the reality that Japan no longer poses a threat. Similar accommodating statements have been emanating from the Philippines over the past year. <strong><u>Those changes are gratifying. They show a recognition that the era of Japanese imperialism ended more than a half century ago, and that</u></strong> 21st century <strong><u>Japan bears no resemblance to the rapacious, expansionist Japan of that earlier era. Modern Japan is a conservative</u></strong>, status quo <strong><u>power that would be a stabilizing force against aggression, not a source of aggression. Japan needs to seize the opportunity afforded by the changing attitude of its neighbors. It is time for the SDF to play a realistic security role in East Asia</u></strong> and beyond. <strong><u>No rational person would object if Tokyo provided combat forces for the struggle against</u></strong> Osama bin Laden and his <strong><u>terrorists.</u></strong> It is time for Japan to fully rejoin the ranks of the great powers. And <strong><u>the United States needs to help with that transition. U.S. officials have</u></strong> not only <strong><u>allowed Japan to get away with free riding on the U.S. security guarantee</u></strong>, they have openly discouraged Japan from venturing beyond the status of being Washington's logistical helpmate. <strong><u>That attitude must be discarded. U.S. leaders ought to make it clear to Japan -</u></strong>- and to that country's neighbors -- <strong><u>that Washington no longer objects to Japan's playing a full-fledged security role. Indeed, the United States should state explicitly that it expects Japan to do so.</u></strong></span><br />

<span style="display: block; margin-right: 0.2in;"><strong><u>The areas of maximum danger and instability in the world today are in Asia</u></strong>, followed by the Middle East and parts of the former Soviet Union. <strong><u>The strategic situation in Asia is more uncertain</u></strong> and potentially threatening than anywhere in Europe. Unlike in Europe, <strong><u>it is possible to envisage war in Asia involving the major powers: remnants of Cold War ideological confrontation still exist across the Taiwan Straits and on the Korean Peninsula; India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and these two countries are more confrontational than at any time since the early 1970s</u></strong>; in Southeast Asia, Indonesia—which is the world’s fourth-largest country—faces a highly uncertain future that could lead to its breakup. The Asia-Pacific region spends more on defense (about $150 billion a year) than any other part of the world except the United States and Nato Europe. China and Japan are amongst the top four or five global military spenders. <strong><u>Asia also has more nuclear powers than any other region of the world. Asia’s security is at a crossroads</u></strong>: the region could go in the direction of peace and cooperation, or it could slide into confrontation and military conflict. There are positive tendencies, including the resurgence of economic growth and the spread of democracy, which would encourage an optimistic view. But there are a number of negative tendencies that must be of serious concern. <strong><u>There are deep-seated historical, territorial, ideological, and religious differences in Asia. Also, the region has no history of successful multilateral security cooperation or arms control</u></strong>. Such multilateral institutions as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the ASEAN Regional Forum have shown themselves to be ineffective when confronted with major crises.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; margin-right: 0.2in;">But <strong><u>lingering hostility toward</u></strong> and suspicion of North Korea <strong><u>in the near term</u></strong> pale in comparison <strong><u>with Japanese concerns over the</u></strong> medium to <strong><u>long term with respect to</u></strong> a rising <strong><u>China. Beijing is exerting greater influence</u></strong> in the political, economic, and diplomatic realms <strong><u>and</u></strong> simultaneously <strong><u>threatening to use force against Taiwan</u></strong> if the island proceeds on its current path toward greater independence. <strong><u>Japan would look upon Chinese annexation of Taiwan as a national security threat</u></strong>, but it is less clear how it would respond to more subtle Chinese challenges to Japanese economic and security interests in and around Taiwan. <strong><u>The trajectory of China’s rise to regional prominence threatens to collide with both Japanese and American interests. The open question is whether all three countries will be able to establish a new strategic balance or whether competition</u></strong> for influence in East Asia <strong><u>will lead to a clash that could threaten the lives of hundreds of millions of people on both sides of the Pacific.</u></strong> According to Eugene Matthews, a former senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and now president of the international educational firm Nintai, Japan’s growing self-reliance is indicative of resurgent nationalism. Matthews urges that U.S. policy be directed at blocking such sentiments, or at least attempting to channel them in a particular direction.3 But it is hardly unreasonable for Japan to seek some measure of independence from the United States.4 A desire that one’s country be capable of defending itself might be a sign of nationalism, but if it is, it is no different from the nationalism expressed by the United Kingdom and dozens of other countries that have maintained a robust defensive capability in spite of security assurances from the United States. Fortunately, the Bush administration has encouraged a more assertive stance on the part of the Japanese government, even at the risk of arousing regional fears of a resurgent Japan. Although such fears cannot be dismissed entirely, <strong><u>both the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></u></strong>nited <strong><u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext;">S</span></u></strong>tates <strong><u>and Japan should continue their efforts to establish Japan as an independent pole of power in East Asia, a “normal country” that is no longer dependent on a distant patron for its defense.</u></strong></span><br />

<span style="display: block; margin-right: 0.2in;">Indeed, a <strong><u>cross-Strait conflict is potentially one of the most dangerous conflicts involving two major nuclear powers, in which the risk of escalation, in the worst case, cannot exclude strategic nuclear exchange</u></strong>. Thus, it is understandable that many countries make such a statement of “neutrality” or remain bystanders. <strong><u>The location of Taiwan</u></strong>, however, <strong><u>in the midst of</u></strong> the <strong><u>vital</u></strong> sea lines of communications (<strong><u>SLOCs), any level of armed conflict will inevitably envelop an international affair with global consequences, economically, politically and militarily. By nature, a cross-Strait conflict cannot be a limited theatre of war</u></strong>. Therefore, it would greatly improve conflict prevention if NATO could at a minimum maintain its own version of “strategic ambiguity” to make Beijing’s calculation of using force more difficult, less optimistic, and thereby more prudent [9]. The recent large-scale naval exercise conducted by the United States, Japanese, Australian, Indian and Singaporean navies in September 2007 might have aimed at such a signalling effect toward China. It will also be constructive if Europe, together with other Western countries, were to make Beijing understand <strong><u>that any armed attack on Taiwan would lead to worldwide criticism and boycotts of Chinese products.</u></strong></span><br />

<u>Washington</u> <u>needs to withdraw</u> <strong>its</strong> <u>troops and eliminate its security guarantee</u><strong>. Many hawks now say that the</strong> <u>U.S. shouldn't stay if it isn't wanted</u><strong>. Even if America is wanted, however, another nation's desire for U.S. aid is no reason to provide it. The</strong> <u>U.S. should do so only if doing so advances American national interests</u><strong>. What vital U.S. interest supposedly is being served? America's presence undoubtedly still helps deter the DPRK from military adventurism, but it is not necessary to do so. As noted earlier, the</strong> <u>South can stand on its own</u><strong>. A recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported simply: &quot;Without U.S. help,</strong> <u>South Korea is capable today of defending itself against an invasion from the North</u><strong>.&quot; As one of the world's wealthiest nations, the</strong> <u>ROK can well afford to replace the American tripwire</u><strong>. Some argue that maybe American troops should be withdrawn, only just not now. But for some policymakers there will never be a good time to update U.S. policy. Indeed, many desire to preserve America's troop presence after reunification. Advocates of a permanent U.S. occupation talk grandly of promoting regional stability. However, it would be a miraculous coincidence if a commitment forged in the Cold War and created to deter a ground invasion from a contiguous neighbor turned out to be the perfect arrangement to meet completely different contingencies in a completely different security environment. In fact, there are</strong> <u>no secondary &quot;dual use&quot; function for America's soldiers to perform</u><strong>. For instance, while U.S. and Chinese interests might eventually collide,</strong> <u>America's deployments in Korea would provide little value</u><strong>. No administration would initiate a ground invasion against the PRC. And South Korea, like</strong> <u>Japan for that matter, is unlikely to allow itself to become the staging ground for such a conflic</u><strong>t. To do so</strong> <u>would turn itself into China's permanent enemy. Containing a resurgent Tokyo is an even more fanciful role.</u> <u>The greatest threats to regional stability are internal</u><strong>--insurgency and corruption in the Philippines, democratic protests and ethnic conflict in Burma, economic, ethnic, nationalistic, and religious division in Indonesia. But they</strong> <u>impinge no vital American interests and are not susceptible to solution by the U.S. military. In sum, without any connection to the larger Cold War and global hegemonic struggle Korea is relatively unimportant to the U.S</u><strong>. So some American policymakers make an entirely different argument: the U.S. should base soldiers overseas at someone else's cost. But Washington must create the additional units, a cost that America's allies do not cover. Moreover,</strong> <u>friendly states are not likely to long accept a foreign occupation carried out solely to save money for Americans.</u> <strong>Some supporters of the U.S. troops presence point to the North Korean nuclear threat. However, the</strong> <u>American presence performs no useful role in dealing with Pyongyang's putative nuclear capabilities. In fact, the current deployment leaves U.S. forces as nuclear hostages if the North marries an effective atomic bomb to a means of delivery</u><strong>. Moreover, the troop tripwire makes North Korea America's problem. Removing it, argues Adam Garfinkle, editor of the National Interest, &quot;would force China and the other parties to the problem to face reality.&quot; The best strategy for handling the DPRK is not obvious. The North may have decided to cheat all along. Or it may have pe</strong><u>rceived that the Agreed Framework was unraveling, since the U.S. had failed to move forward with diplomatic and economic relations.</u> <strong>A not insubstantial factor in its current behavior may be the North's belief that the Bush administration has targeted Kim's regime for a preventive war. CIA Director George Tenet implicitly acknowledged the problem without noting America's role, when he suggested that if the North goes ahead and nonproliferation weakens, other states might view the acquisition of nukes as the best way to match neighbors and deter more powerful nations. Irrespective of who is to blame, what is to be done? It is not surprising that policymakers in Seoul, within easy reach of North Korean artillery and Scud missiles, have a different perspective on coercion. Beijing, Moscow, and</strong> <u>Tokyo also worry about radioactive fallout, missile attacks, refugee flows, economic turmoil, and regional chaos</u><br />
<br />

<strong>Signal of the plan alone is enough to send the signal to de-militarize and look to diplomacy.</strong><br />
<strong>Bandow 96(Doug, senior fellow at the Cato Institute pg 83)</strong><br />
<u>U.S. troops have been stationed in South Korea for the past half century.</u> <strong>Although their withdrawal would unsettle a government and people grown used to America's presence, it really should sur­prise neither. After all, in 1984, 4 of 10 South Koreans advocated that the United States stay only until Seoul became militarily self-sufficient.1</strong> <u>With the economic gap between South and North expand­ing at an embarrassing rate, that time is now</u><strong>. South Korea's Ministry of National Defense has acknowledged that &quot;considering the changes in our security environment including the emerging South-North arms control question, reduction of troops will become inevitable.&quot;2 Unfortunately, the ministry was referring to South Korean troop levels. But</strong> <u>surely the first cuts should come in the forces of the United States, whose support has always been justified by the exceptional military circumstances on the peninsula. Only after the American troop presence has disappeared</u> <strong>should</strong> <u>the ROK,</u> <strong>which obviously has both the most at stake in and the primary obligation for its own defense</strong><u>, downsize its army</u><strong>. In 1971 Prime Minister Kim Jong Pil responded to the Nixon administration's par­tial withdrawal: &quot;Now is no time to survive by depending on oth­ers—U.S. troops in our country will go home sooner or later, which means that we must defend our country through our own strength.&quot;3 Again,</strong> <u>that time is now</u><strong>. Nevertheless, disengagement would be a dramatic step.</strong> <u>Its most important impact would probably be symbolic.</u> <strong>Opines Claude Buss of the Hoover Institution, &quot;</strong><u>In the minds of many Korean and Ameri­can officials, the military role of the U.S. forces is less important than the psychological, political, and diplomatic effects of their pres­ence</u><strong>. As Defense Secretary [James] Schlesinger stated in 1974, U.S. forces in Korea symbolize America's continued interest in the overall stability of that part of the world.&quot;* It would be important, therefore, for Washington to</strong> <u>emphasize that placing responsibility for Korea's defense on Koreans would not mean indifference to the ROK's safety.</u><br />

<u>As</u> <strong>the denuclearization process,</strong> <u>peace</u> <strong>treaty and normalization</strong> <u>talks move forward</u><strong>,</strong> <u>the United States should gradually withdraw its 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea by 2012, which is the target date for relinquishing the U.S. military's wartime operational control over the ROK troops to the South Korean government.</u> <strong>Our troops have been in Korea for too long, and the goal of defending South Korea is no longer credible. Since it costs about $2-4 billion per year to station the U.S. troops in South Korea, and there is a great need to reduce our military spending at present, it will serve the U.S. interests to</strong> <u>reduce our troop strength in the ROK, which already has a powerful military to defend itself.</u> <strong>South Korea also has twice the population of North Korea, and its annual military spending is about eight times larger than North Korea's, while South Korea's GDP is 40 times greater than North Korea's.</strong><br />

The trade agreement with South Korea is coming up for ratification in Congress. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">T<span class="underline">here will be a fight about it, and it will pass. The fight is much more intense in Korea. A partisan in that battle,</span></span> Kim <span class="underline">Kyung-</span>ran, was in Seattle last week to see her allies at the Washington Fair Trade Coalition. She <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">speaks for the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, which opposes the agreement. She said U.S. companies want the agreement in order to invest in Korea. Why would Korean labor oppose that? She answered that the jobs created by U.S. corporations won't be any good.</span> They will be in services only and will have no guarantee of lifetime employment. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">She had just described the sort of job millions of Americans have, and are used to. But until a decade ago, the Korean worker was in a different system. His pay was much lower than the American's, but he had a lifetime job guarantee. Kim's union confederation wants to go back to that world — at least, to the guarantee. But that world is gone. Clark Sorensen, chairman of the Center for Korea Studies at the University of Washington, says the job guarantee was part of a social contract in which the big Korean corporations were financed by state banks. The state guaranteed the company and the company guaranteed the worker. That system, which was built up during conservative governments, collapsed in the Asian financial crisis of 1998, and was swept away by Korea's liberal reformer, President Kim Dae Jung. His policies worked. The Korean economy was the first to pull out of the Asian crisis, and in the recent recession it has suffered less than the United States. &quot;The Korean economy is really changed,&quot; Sorensen says. But many Koreans still associate the companies with favoritism, he says, &quot;and they don't believe the government.&quot; Maybe they shouldn't believe their televisions. Three years ago,</span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Korean TV ran a documentary on the fatal dangers of U.S. beef, warning darkly of mad-cow disease. People responded with a huge candlelight demonstration against American food — a protest that fed right into the campaign against the trade agreement.</span></span> Kim's group, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, does not speak for all of Korean labor, most of which is not organized and some of which is represented by a confederation more moderate on business issues<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. <span class="underline">In a country of 49 million, Kim's group does speak for about half a million workers</span></span><span class="underline">,</span> and, says Yong-Sung Jonathan Kang, professor at the UW School of Law, it is &quot;a big player on the left in Korea.&quot; It has helped to make the trade agreement a big political issue against <span class="underline">President <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Lee</span></span> Myung-bak, who, says Kang, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">has &quot;expended a lot of his political capital&quot; to support it.</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Such a fight seems odd for a country already made rich through a half-century of investment and trade. Since the Korean War ended in 1953, South Korea has pushed up its output per worker to 60 percent of the U.S. level. Life expectancy for men and women is now greater than in the United States. Korea is one of the most wired countries on the planet; its youth are the online fanatics of the video game &quot;World of Warcraft.&quot; The recent history of trade agreements strongly suggests that the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement will be ratified</span>. <span class="underline">The business and political elites of both countries want it, and they will get it</span>. And on this issue they will be right. <br />

DAECHURI, South Korea -- <span class="underline">Here in the marshy heartland of the Korean Peninsula, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the rabble-rousing rice farmers of this tiny village are engaged in their own little war against the U.S. military</span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span> With American forces in the midst of their largest regional realignment in decades, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the farmlands of Daechuri have been condemned to make room for the expansion of a nearby U.S. base.</span></span> While about half the residents have quietly accepted a lucrative cash-for-land deal being offered by the South Korean government, a core group of about 70 holdouts have rebuffed all efforts to buy them out. <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Their refusals to make way for the base</span> -</span>- or give in to what many of the farmers are calling &quot;American bullying&quot; -- <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have won them instant hero status among some South Korean labor unions and student groups.</span></span>Over the past several weeks, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">protesters have held the largest anti-American demonstrations in South Korea in four years, turning Daechuri into a symbol of their struggle to drive U.S. troops out of the country</span>. </span> &quot;We are sick of being treated like America's servants!&quot; said Cho Sun Yeh, a fiery 90-year-old rice farmer. Her first home in the area was bulldozed to make room for a U.S. base during the 1950-53 Korean War. After the uneasy truce that left the peninsula divided into capitalist South and communist North, Cho and her husband built a new house a few hundred yards from the base's barbed wire fences. It is from this home that Cho and her extended family of 17 are refusing to budge. &quot;I am thankful for what the U.S. did to save us from the communists back then, but that was a long time ago and we have paid them enough thanks,&quot; she said. &quot;I gave my land up once already, and I am not about to do it again. It is time for the U.S. to leave us alone.&quot; The last stand at <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Daechuri underscores the significant hurdles that analysts say could set back by years the Pentagon's broad plan to realign American forces in the Pacific.</span></span> State-of-the-art military technologies and shifting geopolitical concerns have convinced the Pentagon that it can do with fewer troops and bases in East Asia's largest host countries, South Korea and Japan. In some respects, that strategy is giving anti-American groups in both nations a dose of what they want. In South Korea, plans call for a 33 percent reduction in the U.S. force, to 25,000 troops, and a consolidation of 104 widely scattered military installations into 10 regional hubs by 2008. In Japan, home to more than 50,000 American troops, 8,000 of the 18,000 Marines now based on Okinawa island will be relocated to the American territory of Guam by 2014. But even as U.S. troops disappear from some communities, their presence is set to increase in others, where they are hardly being welcomed with open arms<span class="underline">. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Vocal anti-American activists are seizing the moment, calling for protracted demonstrations, insisting the United States pay a larger portion of the realignment costs and supporting politicians who favor even greater troop and base reductions.</span> </span><br />

<u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">I can sum up my message today in three sentences: The United States, more than any single country, created the world trading system. The US has never had more riding on the strength of that system. And </span></u><strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">US leadership — especially in the current Doha trade talks — is indispensable to the system's success.</span></strong> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">It is true that as the WTO's importance to the world economy increases, so too does the challenge of making it work: there are more countries, more issues, trade is in the spot light as never before. But </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the fiction that there is an alternative to the WTO — or to US leadership — is both naïve and dangerous</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Naïve </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">because it fails to recognize that multilateralism has become more — not less — important to advancing US interests.</span></strong> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Dangerous </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">because it risks undermining the very objectives the US seeks — freer trade, stronger rules, a more open and secure world economy</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Doha Round is a crucial test</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The core issues — services, agriculture, and industrial tariffs — are obviously directly relevant to the US. America is highly competitive in services — the fastest growing sector of the world economy, and where the scope for liberalization is greatest. </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In agriculture</span></strong> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">too the US is competitive across many commodities — but</span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> sky-high global barriers and subsidies impede and distort agricultural trade. Industrial tariffs also offer scope for further liberalization</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> — especially in certain markets and sectors. But what is at stake in these talks is more than the economic benefits that would flow from a successful deal. </span></u> <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">The real issue is the relevance of the multilateral trading system. Its expanded rules, broader membership, and binding dispute mechanism means that the new WTO</span></strong> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">— created less than ten years ago — </span></u> <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">is pivotal to international economic relations</span></strong> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. But this means that the costs of failure are also higher — with ramifications that can be felt more widely</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span></u> <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">Advancing the Doha agenda would confirm the WTO as the focal point for global trade negotiations, and as the key forum for international economic cooperation.</span></strong> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> The credibility of the institution would be greatly enhanced. But if the Doha negotiations stumble, doubts may grow, not just about the WTO's effectiveness, but about the future of multilateralism in trade</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This should be a major concern to the US</span></strong> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">for two reasons: First</span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, the US is now integrated with the world economy as never before</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. A quarter of US GDP is tied to international trade, up from 10 per cent in 1970 — the largest such increase of any developed economy over this period. </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">A third of US growth</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> since 1990 </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">has been generated by trade. And America's trade is increasingly global in scope</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> — 37 per cent with Canada and Mexico, 23 per cent with Europe, 27 per cent with Asia. Last year alone, exports to China rose by almost 30 per cent. </span></u> <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">The US has also grown more reliant on the rules of the multilateral system to keep world markets open</span></strong> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. Not only has it initiated more WTO dispute proceedings than any other country</span></strong> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">— some 75 since 1995 — according to USTR </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">it has also won or successfully settled most of the cases it has brought</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The point is this: </span></u> <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">even the US cannot achieve prosperity on its own; it is increasingly dependent on international trade, and the rules-based economic order that underpins it.</span></strong> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">As the biggest economy, largest trader and one of the most open markets in the world, it is axiomatic that the US has the greatest interest in widening and deepening the multilateral system</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Furthermore, </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">expanding international trade through the WTO generates increased global prosperity, in turn creating yet more opportunities for the US economy</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The second point is that strengthening </span></u> <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">the world trading system is essential to America's wider global objectives. Fighting terrorism, reducing poverty, improving health, integrating China and other countries in the global economy</span></strong> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> — all of these issues <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">are linked</span></span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, in one way or another</span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, to world trade</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This is not to say that trade is the answer to all America's economic concerns; only that </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">meaningful solutions are inconceivable without it</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The world trading system is the linchpin of today's global order — underpinning its security as well as its prosperity. A successful WTO is an example of how multilateralism can work. Conversely, if it weakens or fails, much else could fail with it. This is something which the US</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> — at the epicentre of a more interdependent world — </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">cannot afford to ignore</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. These priorities must continue to guide US policy — as they have done since the Second World War. </span></u> <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">America has been the main driving force behind eight rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, including the</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the </span></u><strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">creation of the WTO</span></strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The US — together with the EU — was instrumental in launching the latest Doha Round two years ago. Likewise, the recent initiative, spearheaded by Ambassador Zoellick, to re-energize the negotiations and move them towards a successful conclusion is yet another example of how essential the US is to the multilateral process — signalling that the US remains committed to further liberalization, that the Round is moving, and that other countries have a tangible reason to get on board. The reality is this: </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">when the US leads the system can move forward; when it withdraws, the system drifts</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The fact that US leadership is essential, does not mean it is easy. </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">As WTO rules have expanded, so too has as the complexity of the issues the WTO deals with — everything from agriculture and accounting, to tariffs and telecommunication. The WTO is also exerting huge gravitational pull on countries to join — and participate actively — in the system</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The WTO now has 146 Members — up from just 23 in 1947 — and this could easily rise to 170 or more within a decade</span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. Emerging powers like China, Brazil, and India rightly demand a greater say in an institution in which they have a growing stake. So too do a rising number of voices outside the system as well. More and more people recognize that<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> the WTO matters</span></span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">More non-state actors — businesses, unions, environmentalists, development NGOs — want the multilateral system to reflect their causes and concerns. A decade ago, few people had even heard of the GATT. Today the WTO is front page news. A more visible WTO has inevitably become a more politicized WTO. The sound and fury surrounding the WTO's recent Ministerial Meeting in Cancun — let alone Seattle — underline how challenging managing the WTO can be. </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">But </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">these challenges can be exaggerated. They exist precisely because so many countries have embraced a common vision. Countries the world over have turned to open trade — and a rules-based system — as the key to their growth and development. They agreed to the Doha Round because they believed their interests lay in freer trade, stronger rules, a more effective WTO</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Even in Cancun the great debate was whether the multilateral trading system was moving fast and far enough — not whether it should be rolled back. Indeed, it is critically important that we draw the right conclusions from Cancun — which are only now becoming clearer. The disappointment was that ministers were unable to reach agreement. The achievement was that they exposed the risks of failure, highlighted the need for North-South collaboration, and — after a period of introspection — acknowledged the inescapable logic of negotiation. Cancun showed that, if the challenges have increased, it is because the stakes are higher. </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The bigger challenge to American leadership comes from inside</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> — not outside — </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the U</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates. In America's current debate about trade, jobs and globalization we have heard a lot about the costs of liberalization. We need to hear more about the opportunities. </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We need to be reminded of the advantages of America's openness and its trade with the world — about the economic growth tied to exports; the inflation-fighting role of imports, the innovative stimulus of global competition. We need to explain that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">freer trade works</span> precisely <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">because it involves positive change — better products, better job opportunities, better ways of doing things, better standards of living.</span></span></strong> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">While it is true that change can be threatening for people and societies, it is equally true that </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the vulnerable are not helped by resisting change — by putting up barriers and shutting out competition. They are helped by training, education, new and better opportunities that — with the right support policies — can flow from a globalized economy. The fact is that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">for every job in the US threatened by imports there is a growing number of high-paid, high skill jobs created by exports</span></span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Exports supported 7 million workers a decade ago; that number is approaching around 12 million today. And these new jobs — in aerospace, finance, information technology — pay 10 per cent more than the average American wage. We especially need to inject some clarity — and facts — into the current debate over the outsourcing of services jobs. Over the next decade, the US is projected to create an average of more than 2 million new services jobs a year — compared to roughly 200,000 services jobs that will be outsourced. I am well aware that this issue is the source of much anxiety in America today. Many Americans worry about the potential job losses that might arise from foreign competition in services sectors. But it’s worth remembering that </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">concerns about the impact of foreign competition are not new. Many of the reservations people are expressing today are echoes </span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">of what we heard in the 1970s and 1980s. But people at that time didn’t fully appreciate the power of American ingenuity. </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Remarkable advances in technology and productivity laid the foundation for unprecedented job creation</span></strong> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">in the 1990s </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and there is no reason to doubt that this country, which has shown time and again such remarkable potential for competing in the global economy, will not soon embark again on such a burst of job-creation. America's openness to service-sector trade — combined with the high skills of its workforce — will lead to more growth, stronger industries, and a shift towards higher value-added, higher-paying employment</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Conversely, </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">closing the door to service trade is a strategy for killing jobs, not saving them</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Americans have never run from a challenge and have never been defeatist in the face of strong competition. Part of this challenge is to create the conditions for global growth and job creation here and around the world. I believe Americans realize what is at stake. </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The process of opening to global trade can be disruptive, but they recognize that the US economy cannot grow and prosper any other way. They recognize the importance of finding global solutions to shared global problems. </span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Besides, </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">what is the alternative to the WTO</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">? Some argue that the world's only superpower need not be tied down by the constraints of the multilateral system. They claim that US sovereignty is compromised by international rules, and that multilateral institutions limit rather than expand US influence. Americans should be deeply sceptical about these claims.</span></u><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Almost <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">none of the trade issues facing the US today are any easier to solve unilaterally, bilaterally or regionally</span>. The reality is probably just the opposite</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. What sense does it make — for example — to negotiate e-commerce rules bilaterally? Who would be interested in disciplining agricultural subsidies in a regional agreement but not globally? How can bilateral deals — even dozens of them — come close to matching the economic impact of agreeing to global free trade among 146 countries? </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Bilateral and regional deals can sometimes be a complement to the multilateral system, but they can never be a substitute. </span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">There is a bigger danger. </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">By treating some countries preferentially, bilateral and regional deals exclude others — fragmenting global trade and distorting the world economy. Instead of liberalizing trade — and widening growth — they carve it up. Worse, they have a domino effect: bilateral deals inevitably beget more bilateral deals, as countries left outside are forced to seek their own preferential arrangements, or risk further marginalization</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This is precisely what we see happening today. There are already over two hundred bilateral and regional agreements in existence, and each month we hear of a new or expanded deal. There is a basic contradiction in the assumption that bilateral approaches serve to strengthen the multilateral, rules-based system. </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Even when intended to spur free trade, they can ultimately risk undermining it. </span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">This is in no one's interest, least of all the United States. America led in the creation of the multilateral system after 1945 precisely to avoid a return to hostile blocs — blocs that had done so much to fuel interwar instability and conflict. America's vision, in the words of Cordell Hull, was that “</span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">enduring peace and the welfare of nations was indissolubly connected with the friendliness, fairness and freedom of world trade”. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Trade would bind nations together, making another war unthinkable. Non-discriminatory rules would prevent a return to preferential deals and closed alliances.</span> A network of multilateral initiatives and organizations</span></strong> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">— the Marshal Plan, the IMF, the World Bank, and the GATT, now the WTO — </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">would provide the institutional bedrock for the international rule of law, not power. Underpinning all this was the idea that freedom — free trade, free democracies, the free exchange of ideas — was essential to peace and prosperity, a more just world </span></strong><br />

But </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the proliferation of nuclear weapons to new powers is a major challenge to the stability of the system.

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Our hopes for mitigating the severity of the coming environmental crises also depend on early and concerted global action of a sort that can only happen in a basically co-operative international system. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">When the great powers are locked into a military confrontation, there is simply not enough</span> spare <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">attention</span>, let alone enough <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">trust,</span> to make deals on those issues, so <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the highest priority at the moment is to keep the multilateral approach alive and avoid a drift back into alliance systems and arms races.</span></span></strong> <strong>And there is no point in dreaming that we can leap straight into some never-land of universal brotherhood; we will have to confront these challenges and solve the problem of war within the context of the existing state system.</strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Indeed, regional agreements, with fewer stakeholders, offer more flexibility in terms of prescribing and revising their regulations, which seems to provide an attractive alternative for WTO Members that need stricter export controls regulations to ensure access to supply.</span></strong> <u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Such Members can freely choose their partners in negotiating and concluding regional agreements. In addition, as regional agreements involve less countries, trade-off142 that needs to be made in the process of further liberalisation on a reciprocal basis could be a lot smaller, gives rise to lesser impact on the relevant domestic industries and, thus, results in less domestic opposition in concluding such agreements. However, the most important aspect of such regional approach is that: are the targeted exporting countries willing to negotiate and conclude bilateral or regional agreements with importing countries and, if they are, will such agreement contain provisions more advantageous to importing countries? From this perspective, the cases of the NAFTA and the ECT are exceptions rather than the norms. Amongst the 151 WTO Members, the majority of which are dependent on importing energy, how many of them enjoy the power and hold the resources as influential as the EU and the US to “convince” energy resource-rich countries to negotiate and conclude regional agreements that tailor to the needs of importing parties? Even for the US, negotiation under the Energy Chapter in the NAFTA encountered great difficulties due to the historically unique role of energy industry in Mexico. And for the EU, the negotiation on the Transit Protocol under the ECT had to be suspended due to strong opposition from Russia, itself a powerful player. From the analyses in Section 2,</span></u> <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">energy security presents different policy concerns</span></strong> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> for countries with different characteristics and needs, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">which</span> also <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">brings out different dimensions</span> and policy concerns <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in energy trade.</span> In contrast to most of the regional agreements, the membership in the WTO is fairly large and issues addressed under the WTO cover a wide range of policies</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Each country can of course opt for regional agreement in addressing its special energy security needs. However, </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">as countries transform following different phases of development, their energy security needs and policy concerns in energy trade might also modify to adjust to such transformation. </span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">As a result, </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">each country might need to consider as many energy security concerns as possible in its long-term planning</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. With respect to the various types of policies pertinent to different countries’ energy security concerns, as identified in Section 2.1 and summarised in Table 1, </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the WTO seems to be the only global regime that cover nearly all of such policies. Under such circumstance, the variety of policy concerns regulated under the WTO legal framework seems to be the only international platform which can provide a wide range of interests available to each Member so that trade-off, in particular in each negotiation round, can be more easily calculated to address both its contemporary and future policy needs</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For example, as previously analysed in 2.2.1, countries with abundant energy resources and countries with advanced technologies have different market access needs. </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Their different needs can both be satisfied under the WTO via tariff reduction and/or service negotiation, resulting in meeting different energy security concerns. </span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Furthermore, </span></u> <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 11pt;">over-reliance on the regional approach</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> might, </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in the long run, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">impede a country’s capabilities to address evolving policy concerns</span>.</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> For example, when </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">an energy importing country concluded a regional agreement with its main exporting partner with the intention of securing energy supply, it might steadily increase energy resources import from that particular country. This might <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">reduce the level of diversification of energy supply and over-dependence on single energy supply</span>, endangering its energy security objective.</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> For those policies that have yet to be addressed, such as investment and competition policies, and those provisions that have yet to be clarified or strengthened, such as export regulations, freedom of transit, energy service, state-own enterprises, under the GATT/WTO, regional agreements do play a significant role in filling such policy or legal vacuum. Nonetheless, </span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">regional agreements involve a smaller group of countries, and, most importantly, are not a viable alternative to most WTO Members that do not hold strong bargaining power to engage in such an approach</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

And post-Soviet states such as Georgia, which are adept at playing the United States and Russia oª against each other, could act in ways that escalate tensions. Putin’s stage management of Moscow’s succession in order to maintain a dominant role for himself makes a major foreign policy shift in Russia unlikely.

<strong>C. Nationalist revival causes US-Russian nuclear war.</strong><br />

<strong><span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The first and by far most dangerous possibility is what I call the power scenario. </span><span class="underline">Supporters</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of this option </span><span class="underline">would, in the name of a &quot;united and undivided Russia,&quot; radically change</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> domestic and foreign </span><span class="underline">policies</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Many would seek to revive a dictatorship and take</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> urgent </span><span class="underline">military steps to mobilize </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the people </span><span class="underline">against the</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> outside </span><span class="underline">&quot;enemy.&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Such steps would include Russia's denunciation of the commitment to no-first-use of nuclear weapons; suspension of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) I and refusal to ratify both START II and the Chemical Weapons Convention; denunciation of the Biological Weapons Convention; and reinstatement of a full-scale armed force, including the acquisition of additional intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple warheads, as well as medium- and short-range missiles such as the SS-20. Some of these measures will demand substantial financing, whereas others, such as the denunciation and refusal to ratify arms control treaties, would, according to proponents, save money by alleviating the obligations of those agreements. In this scenario, </span><span class="underline">Russia's military planners would shift Western countries from </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the category of </span><span class="underline">strategic partners to </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the category of </span><span class="underline">countries representing a threat to national security</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This will revive the strategy of nuclear deterrence -- and indeed, realizing its unfavorable odds against the expanded NATO,</span><span class="underline"> Russia will place new emphasis on the first-use of nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a trend that is underway already. The power scenario envisages a hard-line policy toward the CIS countries, and in such circumstances the problem of the Russian diaspora in those countries would be greatly magnified. Moscow would use all the means at its disposal, including economic sanctions and political ultimatums, to ensure the rights of ethnic Russians in CIS countries as well as to have an influence on other issues. Of those means, even the use of direct military force in places like the Baltics cannot be ruled out. Some will object that this scenario is implausible because no potential dictator exists in Russia who could carry out this strategy. I am not so sure. Some Duma members -- such as Victor Antipov, Sergei Baburin, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and Albert Makashov, who are leading politicians in ultranationalistic parties and fractions in the parliament -- are ready to follow this path to save a &quot;united Russia.&quot; Baburin's &quot;Anti-NATO&quot; deputy group boasts a membership of more than 240 Duma members. </span><span class="underline">One cannot help but remember</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span><span class="underline">when Weimar Germany was isolated, exhausted, and humiliated</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as a result of World War I and the Versailles Treaty, Adolf <span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hitler took it upon himself to &quot;save&quot; his country</span></span>. It took the former corporal only a few years to plunge the world into a second world war that cost humanity more than 50 million lives. I do not believe that Russia has the economic strength to implement such a scenario successfully, but then again, Germany's economic situation in the 1920s was hardly that strong either. Thus, I am afraid that economics will not deter the power scenario's would-be authors from attempting it. Baburin, for example, warned that </span><span class="underline">any political leader who would &quot;dare to encroach upon Russia&quot; would be </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">decisively</span><span class="underline"> repulsed by the Russian Federation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> &quot;</span><span class="underline">by all measures</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on heaven and earth </span><span class="underline">up to </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the use of </span><span class="underline">nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; n10 In autumn 1996 Oleg Grynevsky, Russian ambassador to Sweden and former Soviet arms control negotiator, while saying that NATO expansion increases the risk of nuclear war, reminded his Western listeners that Russia has enough missiles to destroy both the United States and Europe. n11 Former Russian minister of defense Igor Rodionov warned several times that Russia's vast nuclear arsenal could become uncontrollable. In this context, one should keep in mind that, despite dramatically reduced nuclear arsenals -- and tensions -- Russia and the United States remain poised to launch their missiles in minutes. I cannot but agree with Anatol Lieven, who wrote, </span><span class="underline">&quot;It may be</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, therefore, that </span><span class="underline">with</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> all </span><span class="underline">the new Russian order's many problems and weaknesses, it will</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for a long time </span><span class="underline">be able to stumble on, until we all fall down together</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot;</span></span></strong><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">SEOUL, Nov. 23 (Yonhap) -- South Korea on Tuesday denied it was considering redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on its territory, watering down a sensitive remark by its defense chief who raised the possibility a day ago. <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">In response to North Korea's revelation of a new uranium enrichment facility,</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Defense Minister Kim Tae-yong had raised the possibility on Monday, telling a lawmaker who asked if South Korea would consider such redeployment that the government &quot;will review what you said.&quot;South Korean Defense Minister Kim Tae-young (L) hurriedly leaves the National Assembly for the Defense Ministry upon hearing a report on North Korea's firing of hundreds of rounds of artillery toward South Korean waters and Yeonpyeong Island around 2:34 p.m. on Nov. 23, injuring several soldiers and civilians.

Uranium is an alternative means to plutonium in making nuclear bombs.

Simply maintaining these commitments requires enormous resources, but in recent years American leaders have pursued far more ambitious goals than merely maintaining the status quo. The Bush administration has not just continued America’s traditional grand strategy, but pursued ambitious objectives in all three major regions at the same time—waging wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, seeking to denuclearize North Korea and expanding America’s military allies in Europe up to the borders of Russia itself. For nearly two decades, those convinced of U.S. dominance in the international system have encouraged American policy makers to act unilaterally and seize almost any opportunity to advance American interests no matter the costs to others, virtually discounting the possibility that Germany, France, Russia, China and other major powers could seriously oppose American military power. From public intellectuals like Charles </span><strong><u>Krauthammer</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and Niall </span><strong><u>Ferguson</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to neoconservatives like Paul Wolfowitz and Robert </span><strong><u>Kagan</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, even to academicians like Dartmouth’s William </span><strong><u>Wohlforth and</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Stephen </span><strong><u>Brooks, all believe the principal feature</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the post-cold-war world </span><strong><u>is the unchallengeable dominance of American power</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

To be sure, the period of U.S. relative decline has been, thus far, fairly short. A healthy appreciation of our situation by American leaders may lead to policies that could mitigate, if not rectify, further decline in the foreseeable future.

I<span class="cardChar"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">n this security context the United States should push for the free-trade agreement with South Korea, known as KORUS-FTA. In a prior column, this author discussed the necessity for a U.S.-Japan free-trade agreement, but that cannot occur while the agreement with our other East Asian ally languishes. The KORUS-FTA is the linchpin for any future Asian free-trade agreements. The agreement was signed by both nations in June 2007 and would eliminate tariffs on 95 percent of most goods and services. South Korea is the 10th-largest economy, our seventh-largest trading partner and our sixth-largest market for agricultural goods. A number of independent and government studies indicate that the KORUS-FTA would add $20 billion in bilateral trade, increase U.S. gross domestic product by up to $11.9 billion, and raise U.S. exports by 49 percent. On average, current American exports face higher tariffs in South Korea than the other way around. Although 70 percent of South Koreans believe it would promote friendly relations with the United States, there is great opposition by forces against free trade and various people in the new Obama administration. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said, as a candidate for president, &quot;While I value the strong relationship the United States enjoys with South Korea, I believe that this agreement is inherently unfair.&quot; There have been outstanding issues over items like U.S. beef exports, pharmaceuticals and products produced at Kaesong industrial complex.However, President </span></span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: fuchsia; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Obama must reassure the world of his free-trade credentials</span></span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: fuchsia; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span> </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: fuchsia; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">There is consternation in many capitals over perceived protectionist sentiment and its dubious partner, isolationism</span>.</span> This issue is another victim of the lack of media attention to international affairs.

The Japanese, for their part, are already mindful of the continuing anxiety of the nations of the Pacific Rim. Perhaps that is one reason why <span class="underline">such a large portion of Japan’s foreign aid budget has been given to the countries occupied by Japanese forces during World War II</span>—Thailand, Korea, the Philippines, and China. Japanese aid in 2003 constituted approximately 50 percent of the total foreign aid received by Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos; about 60 percent of the aid received by the Philippines, Malaysia, and Myanmar; and about 70 percent of aid to China.54 <span class="underline">Japanese businesses have also developed extensive economic ties in those nations<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. These spending and investment patterns suggest that the Japanese government,</span> and Japanese citizens and businesses, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">place great value on friendly, peaceful relations with their Asian neighbors</span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. </span><span class="cardChar"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 10pt;">At</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> the same time, a series of urgent security challenges has prompted a reassessment throughout Japanese society of the utility of military power. While it is conceivable that a few Japanese might wish to remain dependent on America for their security, either out of a desire to avoid paying more for defense or for fear of the risks associated with a change from the status quo, many more are now willing to embrace a new strategic relationship with the United States in which the Japanese take full responsibility for their own security and also accept additional responsibilities in East Asia and the western Pacific. The Bush administration is encouraging such new thinking on the part of the Japanese. The president and his senior advisers appear to appreciate that fears of a new Japanese empire are both irrational and anachronistic. “There is no fear of Japan,” an unnamed administration official told National Review’s Richard Lowry. “The old cork-in-the-bottle theory is dead.”55 The Bush administration should combine this recognition of Japan’s legitimate security interests with a willingness to devolve security responsibilities to Japan, thereby easing the military and economic burden on American taxpayers. In other words, the Bush administration should view Japanese military capabilities not only as additive to, but also as a partial replacement for, U.S. military forces in the region. The agreements announced in late October 2005 suggest that the process of strategic devolution may already be taking place. As discussed above, Japanese military forces are already extremely capable of both defending the territory of Japan and confronting would-be regional threats. Japan possesses advanced anti-submarine warfare capabilities, which are particularly important in the East Asian theater, and it also is capable of conducting mine-clearing activities. 56 Those assets are geared primarily to regional contingencies, but the vessels in Japan’s Maritime SDF constitute the second or third most capable fleet in the world. A shift in Japanese defense posture would not necessarily require a substantial expansion of current military spending.</span></span>57 <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Given Japan’s tight integration into the global economy, and its continued reliance on raw materials and energy resources from outside the Asia-Pacific region, the Japanese want to be in a position to safeguard the flow of such strategic resources, as well as finished goods, to and from their country, and this might require a new approach to the deployment and disposition of their existing military, especially naval, asset</span>s</span>. Ultimately, however, Washington must prompt such a shift by continuing to stress its new vision for U.S.-Japan strategic cooperation. The Japanese government must decide the size and composition of Japan’s military, consistent with the wishes of the Japanese people. <span class="underline">Americans must be willing to allow the Japanese to assert a measure of independence from their former patron; it serves neither U.S. nor Japanese long-term interests to expect Tokyo to merely toe Washington’s line</span>.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">[ ] US-ROK security alliance weakening – 4 reasons </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kelly 9</span></strong> <span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">– Assistant Professor Department of Political Science &amp; Diplomacy Pusan National University. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3692:http://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2009/04/24/start-admitting-that-the-us-commitment-to-sk-is-weakening --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2009/04/24/start-admitting-that-the-us-commitment-to-sk-is-weakening" rel="nofollow">http://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2009/04/24/start-admitting-that-the-us-commitment-to-sk-is-weakening</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3692 -->.</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: .2in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Korean press has been filled for months with the coverage of the US military’s redeployment from north to south of Seoul. Usually these reports include protestations from both sides that the military commitment of the US to the South has not diminished. I just can’t see how that can be the case. </span><strong><u>I want the US commitment to remain strong, but</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I think </span><strong><u>this is wishful thinking. 1. The US has slowly reduced its ground forces in Korea over the last few decades. US force totals are now around 28k and may sink below 25k by 2015. By contrast, the US has about twice that number in Japan and Germany</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">neither of whom are as directly threatened as SK. The common response is that the US can provide the same level of protection with fewer people because of today’s greater lethality per US warfighter, as well as the continuing cover provided by the US air force and navy. Essentially this is a Rumsfeldian transformation argument. The ‘transformation’ of the US military has made each US solider more individually effective, so you need fewer of them for the same job. This is achieved through better training, and use of IT to coordinate firepower better. Smart soldiers and combined arms have multiplier effects we didn’t enjoy during the Cold War. So instead of blowing up a whole valley to kill the enemy, you only need the firepower to blow up a part of it, because IT (‘the networked battlefield’) will tell you exactly which part the enemy is in. I find this moderately compelling, but the verdict is not really in yet on transformation. (See Thomas Ricks at Foreign Policy and Fred Kaplan at Slate, who have long chronicled the ups and downs of this notion.) While it seemed to work well in Afghanistan, it was an abysmal failure in Iraq, where low force totals were the single biggest US problem until the surge.</span> <strong><u>Transformation and smaller forces</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also seem to </span><strong><u>run against a basic military lesson – more is better</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">Ceteris paribus, a larger force should improve options and create a greater cushion to absorb casualties and defeats. I think we all assume that NK’s military is clapped out, but it is over 1 million strong, and US totals seem awfully low. Also, should the US be involved in another war – as we are now – at the time of a conflict with the DPRK, more is again better. It just seems awfully risky.</span> <strong><u>2. US forces are being moved south of Seoul. To me, this is the most obvious sign of decreased willingness. During the Cold War, US troops were purposefully strewn along the DMZ, so that if there was a conflict, US lives would be lost almost immediately. Dead Americans would then rouse US public opinion to commit to the war</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. NATO followed the same logic in central Europe. The more flags on the initial coffins, the more likely collective security would be honored. </span><strong><u>It seems willful blindness to say that the US is not looking to avoid casualties and therefore the public opinion chain-gang effect by this southward move</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This may be good for the US. It lowers the likelihood of an immediate public outcry, and so gives DoD and the White House some time in a crisis. But if I were South Koreans, I would be nervous. Similarly, </span><strong><u>US forces will no longer be located between Seoul, the capital, and the DMZ</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">20m people live in greater Seoul – 40% of the national population. It is extremely exposed. It is only 30 miles from the DMZ; it is extremely dense, and it is filled with skyscrapers and high apartment tower blocks that would fall easily if it hit by NK artillery. (Picture the horrifying WTC collapse happening dozens of times.) I imagine the ROK army will be put in the US place, but still if I were a Korean, I would be pretty spooked that the US is no longer protecting what would obviously be the primary target if the DPRK drove south</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u>3. In 2012, the US will relinquish wartime authority to control SK forces. This abolition of</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Combined Forces Command (</span><strong><u>CFC) is marketed as restoring sovereignty and control to the South, but an obvious extra for the US is that it is no longer obligated to command in the case of a war</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Again, this gives the US more wiggle room. 4. </span><strong><u>Finally</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, I think </span><strong><u>US public opinion is hardly deeply committed the defense of SK anymore</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt;"> The Cold War is over. If SK were to go communist now, it would not matter to US security as much as before. And Americans are exhausted from Iraq, Afghanistan, and the general stress of the GWoT. To the extent Americans even know where SK is, most of their political images will be of a wealthy country (Samsung TVs, etc, etc) that should be able to defend itself. </span><strong><u>The American attitude, and</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> probably </span><strong><u>that of DoD, is burden-sharing</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Allies should carry more of their own defense. NK is SK’s problem, let them fix it; it’s their war, let them fight it. In sum, the bulk of smaller US forces will be 100 miles from the DMZ, south of Seoul, and </span><strong><u>we don’t have the authority to command the SK military in a fight most Americans won’t see as critical for national security</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In other words, we are reserving options for ourselves, including just how much we want to commit. </span></span><br />

<span style="margin-right: .2in;"><strong><u>Hundreds of people demonstrated</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> at Yongsan, the huge U.S. military base in Seoul, with smaller actions taking place in Kwangju and other cities on Nov 23-24. </span><strong><u>Civic groups hope to collect two million signatures on a petition demanding legal changes in the U.S.-Korean alliance that would allow U.S. soldiers to be tried in Korean courts.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> They are also sending a delegation to Washington to ask President George W Bush to overturn the acquittal. </span><strong><u>Many of the demonstrations had a strong anti-American flavour</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">.

Strategically, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">some in South Korea and the United States also see the FTA as a means for boosting the U.S.-South Korean alliance</span>.</span> In announcing the launch of the FTA, for instance, Trade Minister Hyun-chong <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Kim stated that the FTA launch was “the most important event” in the history of the alliance, one that would take the U.S.-South Korean relationship “to the next tier, the next level.”</span></span> Some in Korea and the United States feel a need to boost the relationship because of bilateral strains over major alliance issues, primarily brought about by different views about how to handle North Korea and China. Since the late 1990s, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">even as Americans have come to feel that the danger from North Korea has increased, South Koreans’ perception of a threat from North Korea has declined markedly. This has led some to question the purpose of the U.S.-South Korea alliance, which is predicated upon deterring an attack by North Korea.</span> </span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">[ ] Plan key to sustaining the alliance </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Bae 10 </span></strong>(Jong-Yun, Prof of Political Science, Asian Survey, Vol. 50, No. 2, pg. 335) <br />
<span style="margin-right: .2in;"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">The names of the policies have changed, but </span><strong><u>the basic theme of engagement has been kept by both conservative and progressive regimes in South Korea</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Despite efforts by then President-elect Lee’s transition team to integrate the Ministry of Unification with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in January 2008, the former, in charge of all matters related to Korean unification and inter-Korean relations, is still operating in the Lee administration. Moreover, </span><strong><u>in December 2005, new legislation was passed known as the Inter- Korean Relations Development Act, which obligates Seoul to pursue the development of inter-Korean relations and unification</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. A divided nation conscious of more than 1,200 years of continuous unity remains committed to the dream of reunification. </span><strong><u>The United States traditionally has prioritized democratization over nationalist aspirations for reestablishing a single state after a period of division, particularly when Washington sees a communist regime on one side insistent on imposing its totalitarian ways.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">The U.S. government interfered in the Vietnam War, arguing that the nationalist appeal of reunification was secondary to the pull of freedom in South Vietnam. </span><strong><u>With North Korea, the embodiment of the worst excesses of totalitarianism in American eyes, and South Korea an ally credited with establishing a full-fledged democracy and an “economic miracle” based on a market economy, the U.S. finds little basis for reunification unless the North collapses or its regime changes fundamentally</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Regarding these approaches, most of </span><strong><u>Washington</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">, including George W. Bush, </span><strong><u>had little sympathy</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> with the Sunshine Policy, especially </span><strong><u>for peacefully solving North Korean nuclear issues</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">.13 Even policy makers of the U.S. Congress have negative attitudes. The report “Congressional Attitudes on the Future of the U.S.-South Korea Relationship” states, “On a bipartisan basis, </span><strong><u>those interviewed were very skeptical of South Korean policy toward North Korea, including the Sunshine Policy and subsequent ROK efforts to engage North Korea</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">.”14 </span><strong><u>Some of the U.S. policy makers understand South Korea’s engagement policy as too generous, naïve, and dangerous</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Critical for understanding the differences with the U.S. is the realization that </span><strong><u>despite the sharp political differences between conservatives and progressives in South Korea,15 there is a degree of consensus on handling North Korea</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">To be sure, the past 10 years of progressive regimes had tilted the balance toward sustaining the North Korean regime rather than conditioning rewards on its transformation. This no doubt also created a degree of sympathy for the North and suspicion of the alliance with the U.S. that a conservative regime would have worked much harder to avoid.16 “Self-reliance in National Defense” or “Balancer in Northeast Asia,” which were chosen by Roh Moo-hyun as role concepts in security issues including the North Korean nuclear crisis, were also criticized by conservatives as weakening the alliance between the U.S. and South Korea.17 Yet, the fact is that divisions over North Korean policy between the U.S. and South Korea also existed in the Kim Young Sam period during the first North Korean nuclear crisis. In the Kim Dae-jung period, there was meaningful policy cooperation with the Clinton administration (as when then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited North Korea and signed the U.S.-North Korea Joint Communiqué in October 2000). Still, early in the period Kim’s Sunshine Policy raised doubts in the U.S. that were only overcome with the final report of the Perry Process in 1999 that put Clinton behind testing whether engagement would work. And the Roh Moo-hyun government joined the agreement in the Six-Party Talks on February 13, 2007, after cooperating with the U.S. to make it possible, although many South Korean conservatives were skeptical that the North would meet its promises and wondered if Bush might be backing down because of his troubles elsewhere</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. </span><strong><u>The two camps in South Korea do not agree on policies toward North Korea or the U.S., but they are not far apart on the need to stick to the path of engagement. At the core of this overall consensus is strategic thinking that opens the door to North Korea while visualizing reunification as a gradual process in a regional context</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. </span><strong><u>One key element of this strategic consensus is maintaining the alliance with the U.S.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> Even Roh Moo-hyun, who was elected amid anti- American sentiment in 2002, recognized this reality when he dispatched the Korean army to Iraq at Bush’s request.18 Roh also agreed to the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in April 2007 and acceded after the U.S. Congress insisted on changes at the end of June. </span><strong><u>Whatever the differences on how to deal with Pyongyang, Seoul remains committed to an alliance relationship with Washington. The alliance is virtually unassailable because the foremost objective in strategic thinking is stability</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">.</span> <strong><u>This is seen as essential for the South Korean economy</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">, sandwiched between technologically more-advanced producers in Japan and the U.S. and the rising, low-cost producers of China. </span><strong><u>The alliance with the U.S. may be primarily a means to keep North Korea from invading or otherwise destabilizing the South, but it also is a bulwark of dependability for the South and the region. Thus, its significance is much broader than many have suggested</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. Although both Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun propelled several quietly progressive policies toward North Korea, they never denied the importance of the American alliance, even at times of policy discord on the North Korean nuclear issue. Nonetheless</span><strong><u>, the value of the alliance could be called into question if the U.S. gets trigger-happy toward the North</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">—or if force realignment aimed at a possible war over Taiwan were to lead many in Korea to perceive the American troops as a source of instability. </span></span><br />

<span style="margin-right: .2in;"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">Ahead of the meetings with President Obama, President Lee had called for a ratification of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement that was signed in 2007. There has been resistance from the U.S. auto industry, which is facing its own troubles, on this.

<span class="underline">One </span>of the <span class="underline">striking new developments in Korean politics</span> today <span class="underline">is the rise of </span>a new generation <span class="underline">of young Koreans as an independent political force.</span> <span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">Ironically, the event that sparked their rise had nothing whatsoever to do with politics; it was the 2002 World Cup games which South Korea co-hosted with Japan. The unprecedented success of the Korean national team, which managed to reach the semifinals, drew hundreds of thousands of mostly young Koreans to downtown streets as they celebrated victory after victory. Mobilization for the massive celebrations was aided in no small measure by the Internet, of which almost all young Koreans are everyday users. The celebration went on for the duration of the World Cup, lasting nearly a month and peaking at the end of June. Though the massive celebration was anything but political, it generated much discussion on the new nationalism of Korean youth. Less than six months later,</span> <span class="underline">Korean young people</span> once again <span class="underline">gathered en masse </span>in downtown streets, but in sharp contrast to the World Cup celebrations, the gathering was somber and, more importantly, very much political. This time, the Korean youth were mobilized <span class="underline">for <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“candlelight protests”</span></span> which lasted from late November 2002 to the early months of 2003. <span class="cardChar">These protests</span><span class="underline"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">were sparked by the U.S. Military</span></span> <span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">Tribunal’s acquittal of two American soldiers charged with the negligent homicide of two Korean schoolgirls during an armored mine clearing vehicle exercise.1 The public outcry for “justice” brought tens of thousands of Koreans to the streets of downtown Seoul every day to both mourn the deaths of the young girls and demand a major revision to the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) in Korea.2 Specifically, the protesters demanded that the SOFA include a mandate for the United States Forces in Korea (USFK) 3 to concede its jurisdiction to the Korean authorities over crimes committed by U.S. troops while on duty. As with the World Cup celebrations, the majority of those in the streets were in their 20s and 30s. And as with the World Cup, the Internet played a key role in mobilizing the young masses who, in this case, were spurred by a message one young man posted on an Internet bulletin board. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">At the peak of the protests, anti-American sentiments were so strong that the North Korean admission of a nuclear program, which shocked the rest of the world, did little to constrain their mass rallies.</span></span> Instead, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Korean youth rallied around the presidential candidate</span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">,</span> Roh Moo-hyun, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">who portrayed himself as independent from the U.S. and keen on domestic reform</span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span> <span class="underline">Internet-savvy Korean youth used email and their cell phones to increase voter turnout</span> on December <span class="underline">19 and ensured his victory</span> in a close presidential race. These events in 2002 demonstrate how <span class="underline">Korean youth can become a potent political force in a sudden and effective manner</span>. <span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">If the World Cup street cheers revealed the mobilizing capacity of Korean youth, the “candle-light protests” demonstrated their ability to mobilize resources toward a specific political agenda. In most countries, the younger generation is portrayed as a politically apathetic group. The younger generation in Korea would be no exception in a time of political stability, but late 2002 in Korea was anything but politics as usual. Moreover, South Korea has a history of student activist movements that has its roots in the anti-authoritarian protests that began in the early 1960s. As</span> <span class="underline">democracy in Korea continues to evolve,</span> <span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">this legacy seems to have transformed into a diffused form of youth movement in which university students actively participate as young citizens. Needless to say,</span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the political views of these citizens have great potential to shape the course of South Korean politics and the U.S.-Korea alliance.</span></span><br />

On November 24, Americans were bombarded (pun intended) with the news that North Korea had fired upon the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong. This news follows on the heels of a March incident where a South Korean warship was allegedly sunk by a North Korean sub. <span class="underline">While events of this nature in a far off country should normally be of only humanitarian and economic interest to Americans, </span>our country was put on edge by these unnerving developments because, for some reason<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, <span class="underline">we still have nearly 30,000 US troops stationed in South Korea</span></span> (many more if you include Japan, Okinawa and Guam) <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that would be put at immediate risk in the event of a war between North and South.</span> Then, less than two weeks later, we were greeted with the news that South Korea and the US had reached an agreement on a new trade deal.</span> Am I the only one who is a bit irked by the dichotomy of these two Korea related news items? Some sixty years after America went to war on the Korean peninsula we are still there protecting the deadbeat South Koreans at great risk of life and treasure. And the otherwise nationalistic South Koreans seem disinclined to change this arrangement anytime soon. (Unlike our officials in Washington, the South Koreans apparently know a sweet deal when they see it.) They recently negotiated a delay (read fobbed off) a planned transfer of wartime operational command from Washington to Seoul that had been scheduled for April 2012. I am not necessarily opposed to free trade in theory, but I am sick of Uncle Sam being a chump. South Korea wants freer access to the lucrative American marketplace. I don’t blame them. Who wouldn’t? But at the same time they want the beleaguered American taxpayer and our overextended military to continue underwriting their defense.

<span class="underline">One </span>of the <span class="underline">striking new developments in Korean politics</span> today <span class="underline">is the rise of </span>a new generation <span class="underline">of young Koreans as an independent political force.</span> <span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">Ironically, the event that sparked their rise had nothing whatsoever to do with politics; it was the 2002 World Cup games which South Korea co-hosted with Japan. The unprecedented success of the Korean national team, which managed to reach the semifinals, drew hundreds of thousands of mostly young Koreans to downtown streets as they celebrated victory after victory. Mobilization for the massive celebrations was aided in no small measure by the Internet, of which almost all young Koreans are everyday users. The celebration went on for the duration of the World Cup, lasting nearly a month and peaking at the end of June. Though the massive celebration was anything but political, it generated much discussion on the new nationalism of Korean youth. Less than six months later,</span> <span class="underline">Korean young people</span> once again <span class="underline">gathered en masse </span>in downtown streets, but in sharp contrast to the World Cup celebrations, the gathering was somber and, more importantly, very much political. This time, the Korean youth were mobilized <span class="underline">for <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“candlelight protests”</span></span> which lasted from late November 2002 to the early months of 2003. <span class="cardChar">These protests</span><span class="underline"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">were sparked by the U.S. Military</span></span> <span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">Tribunal’s acquittal of two American soldiers charged with the negligent homicide of two Korean schoolgirls during an armored mine clearing vehicle exercise.1 The public outcry for “justice” brought tens of thousands of Koreans to the streets of downtown Seoul every day to both mourn the deaths of the young girls and demand a major revision to the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) in Korea.2 Specifically, the protesters demanded that the SOFA include a mandate for the United States Forces in Korea (USFK) 3 to concede its jurisdiction to the Korean authorities over crimes committed by U.S. troops while on duty. As with the World Cup celebrations, the majority of those in the streets were in their 20s and 30s. And as with the World Cup, the Internet played a key role in mobilizing the young masses who, in this case, were spurred by a message one young man posted on an Internet bulletin board. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">At the peak of the protests, anti-American sentiments were so strong that the North Korean admission of a nuclear program, which shocked the rest of the world, did little to constrain their mass rallies.</span></span> Instead, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Korean youth rallied around the presidential candidate</span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">,</span> Roh Moo-hyun, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">who portrayed himself as independent from the U.S. and keen on domestic reform</span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span> <span class="underline">Internet-savvy Korean youth used email and their cell phones to increase voter turnout</span> on December <span class="underline">19 and ensured his victory</span> in a close presidential race. These events in 2002 demonstrate how <span class="underline">Korean youth can become a potent political force in a sudden and effective manner</span>. <span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">If the World Cup street cheers revealed the mobilizing capacity of Korean youth, the “candle-light protests” demonstrated their ability to mobilize resources toward a specific political agenda. In most countries, the younger generation is portrayed as a politically apathetic group. The younger generation in Korea would be no exception in a time of political stability, but late 2002 in Korea was anything but politics as usual. Moreover, South Korea has a history of student activist movements that has its roots in the anti-authoritarian protests that began in the early 1960s. As</span> <span class="underline">democracy in Korea continues to evolve,</span> <span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">this legacy seems to have transformed into a diffused form of youth movement in which university students actively participate as young citizens. Needless to say,</span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the political views of these citizens have great potential to shape the course of South Korean politics and the U.S.-Korea alliance.</span></span><br />

Park Kie-duck is a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute, a policy research organization in Seoul. He believes Pyongyang wants to leave open the door for future talks as it does not want relations to remain ruptured. The South’s lead delegate to the talks, Colonel Moon Sang-gyun, says the door is still open for high-level military discussions but Pyongyang must accept Seoul’s condition that it takes responsibility for two lethal incidents last year. South Korea contends a North Korean torpedo sank one of its navy ships in the Yellow Sea last March. The North Koreans deny any involvement in the incident. North Korea, seven months later, shelled a South Korean island in the same waters, but has not apologized, as Seoul demands. Sejong Institute analyst Park says it is likely that Pyongyang will reach out first to suggest another meeting of colonel-level officers. Park says that is because China, North Korea’s mentor and supporter, wants inter-Korean talks to be held. Also, Park says, Seoul has made clear it will not continue with talks unless Pyongyang changes its attitude and shows sincerity. South Korean officials say they also want progress on the military dialogue before allowing Red Cross talks with the North on resuming family reunions across the heavily fortified border. <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: fuchsia; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The United States, South Korea and Japan have also indicated multi-national talks on North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs are not possible until there is some progress</span> </span>in discussions between Pyongyang and Seoul.

The time and choosing of our enemy’s next attack against the vital interests of the U.S. and its allies is no longer predictable. Those who threaten, support, or enable such activities must be dealt with both effectively and immediately. Such is the case with North Korea. The purpose of this paper was to conduct an analysis of current U.S. policy towards North Korea and recommend necessary changes as applicable. As mentioned earlier, the basic policy of containment still provides a sound foundation from which to further develop and refine necessary foreign policy and strategy. That said, it is my belief that the U.S. should adopt a new and more comprehensive three-pronged strategy to deal with the security issue presented on the Korean peninsula. <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Containment through deterrence, a policy of engagement, and co-opting regional actors and alliances to promote U.S. security efforts are the keys to peace on the Korean peninsula</span></span> and protection of U.S. vital interests world-wide. </span><br />

Alliance and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as other long-standing alliances.” 20 Leveraging the power gained by involving all the regional actors is the optimal solution.

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Despite these trends, neither the ROK Ministry of National Defense nor the Pentagon has initiated a serious dialogue. Instead, a buck-passing response to these imperatives has emerged. Seoul responds to complaints from domestic constituencies about the U.S. footprint by demanding that Washington lay out a plan of action. At the same time, the United States wants its ally to volunteer a vision of its own. Each side draws up lists of discussion questions both at security and military consultative meetings, but neither side really wants to take a crack at answering them. Why? The problem is that the tail is wagging the dog. First, rather than a larger, joint strategic vision of the U.S.-ROK alliance driving changes to the U.S. force presence on the ground, bureaucratic issues related to USFK maintenance are driving the larger vision. For example, measures such as the land <strong>[End Page 94]</strong> readjustment program or Yongsan relocation, designed to reduce the military footprint, get bogged down in planning and implementation because a consensual big picture about what the future force structure should look like does not exist. As a result, the larger vision of the USFK becomes incrementally developed, ad hoc, and subject to transient bureaucratic needs. Second, the absence of a long-term vision on the Korean side, as one specialist noted, is due in part to a void of substantive and serious thinking on the issue, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:121:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@REF11&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: REF11&quot;/&gt; --><a name="REF11"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:121 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu.ezproxy.lib.ou.edu/journals/washington_quarterly/v026/26.1cha.html#FOOT11" rel="nofollow">11</a> partially explained by political imperatives created by the sunshine policy. Although an important and unprecedented strategy of engagement undertaken by Kim Dae-jung, the policy has had the unintended consequence of stifling discussion about the future. Those opposed to the policy feel obligated to emphasize the threat posed by the DPRK and therefore do not believe the time is right to contemplate the long term. Those who support the sunshine policy and believe it has reduced tension on the peninsula also do not want to talk about a post-DPRK alliance for fear of upsetting the North and undercutting the sunshine policy. </span><br />

The final site of interest returns us to procedures, rules, and institutions. Can we regulate the public sphere in such a way to promote deliberative rhetoric or at least minimize the incentives to engage in plebiscitary rhetoric? Habermas sometimes implies that it is all about the rules of the game: “Once the established rules constitute the right game – one that promises the generation of considered public opinions – then even the powerful actors will only contribute to the mobilization of relevant issues, facts and arguments” (Habermas 2006: 420). But by rules of the game he means broad structural considerations that are difficult to bring under control. These considerations include a 26self-regulating media that is independent of markets and political power, an inclusive civil society, and citizens empowered (meaning informed and mobilized) to participate in public discourse. I think we would all like these things. Are there more immediate and direct ways to minimize and perhaps expose plebiscitary rhetoric? The media can and in some places is regulated in such a way as to promote informed citizenship. This may include things like the length of political advertisement, debate formats, equal time and access regulations, and public affairs content. Obviously such regulation is easier in some legal contexts than others. The structure of referendum and ballot initiatives can also be rethought in light of promoting deliberative rhetoric. This would primarily involve stretching important decisions over at least two election cycles in order to move debate out of the pre-election strategic rush for votes. The duration and frequency of election campaigns is also a fruitful site for thinking about plebiscitarian incentives. Although polling itself cannot be regulated, there are interesting initiatives to limit the influence of polls. These mostly involve limiting the distribution of polling data on election-day so as not to influence the vote. Jacobs and Shapiro suggest that rather than limiting the use, appeal and dependence on survey data, we should encourage as much publicity as possible for such data (2000). Putting polling data in the public eye will have two salutary effects on public debate. The first is that citizens will become more sophisticated and indeed skeptical of polling data in general. They will come to see that there are many ways to ask questions and survey research never offers simple answers to the question “what is in the public interest?”. More importantly the publication, discussion and thematization of such data will hopefully initiate a debate about what exactly is the public’s opinion on any given 27issue. This in turn can feed back into public opinion itself as well as limit what elites can do in the name of the “pubic interest.” Habermas, too, sees that public opinion formation can benefit from a reflexive discussion about pubic opinion formation. That both elected governments and voters can take an affirmative, a negative, or an indifferent attitude toward public opinion highlights the most important trait of the public sphere, namely its reflexive character. All participants can revisit perceived public opinions and respond to them after reconsideration. These responses, from above as well as from below, provide a double test as to how effective political communication in the public sphere functions as a filtering mechanism (2006: 18). Sophisticated and easily accessible public opinion data is a double edged sword or perhaps Janus-faced to use a favorite Habermasian metaphor. On the one hand, it takes the guesswork out of crafting plebiscitary rhetoric. Whether one is pandering or priming, ‘effective’ communication becomes a science. On the other hand, as a topic in the public sphere, public opinion data can become a weapon against the passive and sometimes manipulative relationship between speaker and audience created by plebiscitary rhetoric. Indeed, by promoting a reflective and discursive rather than an descriptive and uncritical attitude towards public opinion, we might even be promoting deliberative rhetoric. <br />

Habermas defends deliberative democracy as a two-track model of democracy or more recently a centre/periphery model. The relatively formal institutions of representative democracy are at the centre; the informal interactions of public opinion and will formation are at the periphery. The political public sphere stands between and mediates. It is very important to Habermas that public opinion and will formation is anonymous, informal and anarchic (1996). By anonymity he means that unlike some communitarian views, <span class="underline">when citizens deliberate they do not create a supra subject, even in a metaphorical sense. Public opinion is strictly speaking a plurality of often conflicting opinions.</span> By informal he means that <span class="underline">when citizens deliberate as a public, it is nothing like parliamentary deliberations. No meetings are convened, no agenda is set, and certainly no decisions are taken. Although meetings, agendas, and decisions might all feed into the process, the process itself is not bounded</span>. By anarchic he means that <span class="underline">when citizens deliberate there are no procedural rules other than the legal and regulatory infrastructure of a liberal civil society and the process is in principle unpredictable. </span>He sometimes describes it as “wild,” implying with this metaphor of nature that it is beyond human convention. <br />

Survey results regarding the U.S.-R.O.K. alliance suggest that the majority of Americans view the alliance with South Korea as having value and purpose beyond it original intent of deterrence of North Korea aggression. The vast majority (80%) of respondents believe, if unification was to occur, that the United States should maintain its alliance with Korea, and a majority (43%) cite counterbalancing China as their primary reasoning. American support for a long-term U.S. military presence in South Korea is also relatively strong. More Americans (62%) think the U.S. should have long-term military bases in South Korea than any other country included in the survey. Half of respondents also thought that the current number of U.S. troops on the Peninsula seems “about right,” a marked increase from surveys of previous years. Regarding the North Korea nuclear issue, Americans generally support the record and continuation of U.S. diplomacy with the North Koreans. The largest number (50%) of respondents supported working to “negotiate an end to North Korea’s nuclear capacity even if it means accepting the North Korean regime and continuing division of the Peninsula,” with minority groups supporting other options. A strong majority of Americans (62%) say that U.S. government leaders should be ready to meet and talk with leaders in North Korea. <br />

<span style="font-size: medium;"> <span class="cardChar"><span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">The argument goes that Japanese authorities conspired to use their nation's power in order to change Korea's traditional spelling of Corea to Korea so that Japan would come before Korea in any international forum.Indeed, it is an irrefutable fact that Korea was at one time spelled as Corea, largely because of French influence in the 19th century. The usage of Corea is an indisputable part of the historic record, with numerous official items showing the official and unofficial spelling of Corea. Sometime in the late 19th century and early 20th century, however, both official Korean usage and unofficial usage clearly came to favor Korea.That Japan was behind the spelling change in order to come out ahead of Korea is an interesting hypothesis, but it is full of holes in the form of logic and fact. The story is verifiably false for the following reasons:1. No one has ever been able to come up with hard, conclusive evidence that such conscious decisions were ever made.When the Japanese government denied official involvement in the mobilization of Comfort Women during World War II, historians combed through document after document to prove them wrong. Japanese historians xxx and xxx found the evidence to show that the Japanese government's denial of official sanction was a lie.If the Japanese still had records that would implicate the government in something so heinous as the creation and mobilization of the Comfort Women corps, it would stand to reason that the decision to change Corea to Korea would be documented somewhere, too. Yet it has not turned up.The member of the ROK National Assembly who proposed in 2003 that Korea be changed to Corea does say he has seen a document indicating that Japanese officials complained of Koreans using &quot;Corea&quot; to spell the country's name, which was seen as a sign of nationalism. I have not seen this, but it may well have been that the official was complaining of Koreans not using Chosen, the Japanese pronunciation of Choson, not that he was complaining of Korean spelling. This is purely speculative on my part, but well grounded. Nevertheless, you will see that this is not relevant.Link to Barbara Demmick article on K-v-C issue, which includes mention of the apocryphal story (my description, not hers) that Japan changed the spelling in time for the 1908 Olympics in London. Note that the Korean Olympic Committee was formed in 1946, before the Republic of Korea was officially established, and in time for the 1948 Olympics when Korea made its Olympic debut (South Korea also participated in the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, despite the Korean War raging at the time). Simply put, Korea was not one of the 22 countries that participated in the 1908 London Olympiad.Of course, the lack of such records is not at all irrefutable evidence. Arguably, it is not evidence at all, since there could be a whole host of reasons why a document may exist (or once existed) but hasn't turned up. Fortunately, this is the weakest piece of evidence why the Korea-versus-Corea issue is nothing more than a red herring. I only mention it because it is the first sign that the pro-Corea argument simply doesn't hold water.2. As ruler over a Korea that had been absorbed into Japan, there would be no reason for Japan to be concerned with how Korea's name appeared in international forums.Sohn Kee-chung (Son Kijŏng), known as Kitei Son in Japanese.1930s medal commemorating Olympic marathon gold medalist Kitei Son (the Japanese pronunciation of Son Kijŏng), an ethnic Korean who, as a Japanese citizen, participated on behalf of Japan. His English name is officially spelled Sohn Kee-chung.3.</span> </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The name Korea was used in official government materials long before the Japanese took over Korea.</span></span><span class="cardChar"><span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">stamps (although Japanese helped make them)1884 Korean stamp labeled as Corean Post.1900 stamp from Imperial Korean Post.Chosŏn imperial-era 50-poon stamp identifying country as Korea.Postcard issued by Imperial Korean Post.passportsImperial Korean passport issued by The Imperial Korean Foreign Office.This evidence is not new. In fact, pro-Coreans counter this argument by pointing out that Japanese influence in Korea was strong well before 1910 when Japan annexed Korea, and even before 1904 when Japan began plans in earnest to not just control Korea but absorb it into Japan. Going back to Japan's 1895 victory over China in the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese government and Japanese individuals had been exerting considerable influence on Korea's politics and its economy.That is why exhibit #4 is rather important.4. The Japanese authorities continued to use Chōsen or the Corea spelling during their rule of Korea.This is where my argument goes beyond that of most others who have debunked the Corea myth. The ultimate way of demonstrating that the Japanese authorities were not behind the Korea spelling for any kind of malicious alphabetic purpose is that they continued to refer to Korea using two spellings that begin with C.Chōsen, for those of you who are not aware, is the Japanese pronunciation of </span><span style="font-family: 'ヒラギノ角ゴ ProN W6'; font-size: 7pt;">朝鮮</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">, the Chinese characters that represent Chosŏn (Joseon in the atrocious NAKL writing system) the name of the Korean kingdom (1392-1910) begun by Yi Sŏnggye (later King T'aejo) at the end of the 14th century. The Japanese continued to use </span><span style="font-family: 'ヒラギノ角ゴ ProN W6'; font-size: 7pt;">朝鮮</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt;"> to refer to Korea, as do the North Koreans even today (although the North Koreans tend to write it in Korean script, </span><span style="font-family: 헤드라인A; font-size: 7pt;">조선</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">).1937 &quot;green card&quot; (U.S. alien registration card) of Japanese national listing Chosen as country of birth.The same U.S. Immigrant Identification Card of ethnic Korean of Japanese nationality showing country of birth as Chosen.Imperial Japanese passport with U.S. visa stamp issued by American Consul at Seoul, Chosen.1939 postcard with Chosen stationery.Japanese occupation-era postcard with Keijyo, Chosen postmark (Keijyo, a later alternate spelling of Keijō, is the Japanese pronunciation of Kyŏngsŏng, or </span><span style="font-family: 'ヒラギノ角ゴ ProN W6'; font-size: 7pt;">京城</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt;"> , the Japanese name for Seoul).Japanese occupation-era postcard with Corea in postmark.Japanese occupation-era postcard with Custom House stamp issued by Umaji Takahira at Fusan, Corea (Fusan is the Japanese pronunciation of Pusan).Japanese consul stamp from Kensan, Corea.Postcard of Chemulpo, Corea with postmark from Chemulpo, Corea (Chemulp'o is the older name of port area in modern-day Inch'ŏn).1923 postcard postmarked from Kinsen, Corea (Kinsen is the Japanese pronunciation of Inch'ŏn).To sum up:1. There is zero solid, documentary evidence that Japan officialdom ever set out to change Corea's spelling to Korea.2. Having absorbed Korea, Japan would have no need to worry about whether Korea would come above it or below it in an international forum.3. Korea's royal and imperial governments began using the Korea spelling before Japan started wielding sufficiently hefty influence over Korea around 1904.4. The Japanese continued to spell Korea's name with a C (as Chōsen or Corea) when they controlled Korea.The evidence is clear for anyone who wants to look into it.</span></span> <span class="underline">This is all the more reason it is so irresponsible for organizations and companies to jump on the Corea bandwagon: they are unwittingly buying into an argument exists to promote animosity toward another country.</span><span class="cardChar">I<span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">t is also true that some, such as the artist linked here, feel that even if it is not true that the Japanese imposed the Korea spelling</span>, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the Corea spelling &quot;represents the lost memories of a pre-occupation pre-war unified Corea</span></span><span class="cardChar">, <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">without North and South, without a communism versus freedom connotation. At the very least, it gets people to ask why I spell it like that and learn a little about Corean history, even if they disagree or do not care.&quot;That may be fine, but what kind of history are they learning? The Corea spelling as a modern issue is inextricably tied to attempts to whip up animosity against another country.And what exactly does Corea hearken back to?</span></span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> It was the spelling of the country when its people were suffering under the weight of a corrupt and oppressive monarchy that was often unable or unwilling to meet the challenges of a new era, which helped Korea become swallowed up by Japan</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">.<span class="cardChar">Please don't get me wrong,</span> <span class="underline">a great deal of horrific things happened at the hands of imperial Japan</span> </span><span class="cardChar"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">prior to 1945. And it can be argued that modern-day Japan's current leadership is not facing up to that legacy with the genuine contrition that would be needed for Japan to move forward with the countries it once invaded, occupied, and brutalized. But I feel that the actual atrocities of occupation, forced labor, mobilization of the Comfort Women sex slaves, etc., are enough by themselves to make Koreans take pause when regarding Japan without making up new insults and injuries</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">.</span><span class="underline">If anything, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">these fabrications diminish what has actually happened to real people at the hands of the Japanese. It is an insult to the Comfort Women and the forced laborers, for example, because it says to those people, &quot;Sorry, but your actual suffering is not enough for us to whip up anger against Japan, so we have to make stuff up.&quot;</span> </span></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">In addition, he may have been the first to anticipate the way in which the terms left and right would eventually come to mean their precise opposite in the reforming economies of Eastern Europe. He was fascinated but not entirely surprised by the events in old Yugoslavia, where a Stalinist system had been forced to reform into a more market oriented economy. In fact, he noted that the trend had begun in the 1960s, and extended all over Eastern Europe. What was essentially happening, Rothbard wrote, was that <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">socialism had been tried and failed and now these countries were turning to market models</span></span>.

Rothbard did not believe this, based on both theory and evidence. Rothbard saw that all sectors in all countries moving either toward capitalism or toward socialism, which is to say, toward freedom or toward control. In the US, the trends looked very bleak indeed but he found trends to cheer in the antiwar movement, which he saw as a positive development against military central planning. “Both in Vietnam and in domestic government intervention, each escalating step only creates more problems which confront the public with tile choice: either, press on further with more interventions, or repeal them--in Vietnam, withdraw from the country.&quot; His conclusion must have sounded impossibly naive in 1973 but today we can see that he saw further than any other &quot;futurists&quot; of his time: &quot;the </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">advent of industrialism and the Industrial Revolution has irreversibly changed the prognosis for freedom and statism</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">. </span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">In the pre-industrial era, statism and despotism could peg along indefinitely, content to keep the peasantry at subsistence levels and to live off their surplus.

For example, the powers of the United Nations General Assembly are delegated by nation-states, so the only citizens' concerns it considers are those the nation-states --however repressive, unaccountable or unrepresentative they may be -- are prepared to discuss. The nation-state acts as a barrier between us and the body charged with resolving many of the problems affecting us. The UN's problem is that global politics have been captured by nation-states; that globalization, in other words, has been forced to give way to internationalism. The problem is not globalization but the release from globalization which both economic agents and nation-states have been able to negotiate.

The issue of consumption is perhaps one of the most vexed in the environmental and sustainability discourses, especially when contrasting the United States, which tends towards more of a free market, free consumer choice philosophy, with the European Union. Some interesting recent work indicates that it may also be much more complex than we generally realize. Take the recent work by George Lowenstein at Carnegie-Mellon University, Brian Knutson of Stanford, and Drazen Prelec of MIT. In order to better understand the brain chemistry underlying consumption, they presented product choices, then payment choices, to volunteers while scanning their brains with functional magnetic resonance imaging. They found that</span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the nucleus accumbens, which is involved in processing reward stimul</span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">i</span> (food, recreational drugs) <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">was activated by presentation of desirable products</span></span> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">such as chocolates, while the insular cortex, linked to expectations of pain, was activated by price information.</span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">After both product and price were presented, the prefrontal cortex, an area associated with rational calculation, engaged</span></span> <span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">as well. This not only indicated that modern behavior (&quot;rational&quot; consumption choices) are piggybacking on neural circuits evolved for much different circumstances (not a surprise), but leads to some interesting if speculative possibilities. A fairly straightforward interpretation of these data is the suggestion that</span>, <span class="underline">at the neural level, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">consumption is affected</span></span>, perhaps significantly, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">by a weighing of immediate pleasure versus immediate pain, rather than rational calculation</span></span>, <span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">which only comes later. This may not sound revolutionary, especially to marketing gurus, but it nonetheless has some substantial implications. To begin with, it emphasizes the importance of marketing and presentation in consumption: if the benefits of a product can be made explicit and attractive from the beginning, the decision to purchase can be encouraged before the &quot;rational weighing&quot; process is even engaged. This might argue against the traditional environmental project of reducing consumption by generating large amounts of environmental information to be appended to particular products: if the V8 GT or large SUV is initially appealing, information on fuel consumption may be only marginally relevant because it enters the cognitive processes after the purchasing decision is essentially made. Conceptually, in other words</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">,</span> <span class="underline">the environmental approach to reducing consumption through product specific information implicitly accepts &quot;the rational consumer&quot; model of human behavior</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">: </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">provide more information on social and environmental costs, and consumers, rationally balancing their options, will choose the more “rational” outcome -- that is, environmental preferability (remembering that consumers may not share the values prioritization of environmentalists). This appears to be an oversimplistic, if not incorrect, model of consumer cognition. However, while this research might discourage product-by-product information schemes, it might support general anti-consumption campaigns. After all, such campaigns when successful make the act of consumption itself more negative emotionally, and thus enhance the expectations of pain associated with any consumption (the downsides of consistently negative messages from environmentalists are well known, however, and might generate consumer backlash that outweighs such consumption reduction effects over time). Another, perhaps more difficult, implication is the possibility that use of credit, which on balance reduces the immediate “pain” of a purchase because nothing material is apparently given up in exchange, creates a context within which consumers are inherently weighted towards consumption (the researchers have not yet tested this hypothesis). The growth and differentiation of credit mechanisms, and the dematerialization of money, are long-term trends in developed economies, and a major mechanism supporting the continued growth in complexity of financial and economic structures. Thus</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">,</span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it becomes problematic for anti-consumption activists if</span> the inherent dynamics and structure of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">economic systems as they evolve shifts the balance between consumption and pain towards consumption.</span> </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">That consumption has deep emotional dimensions, and that access to credit encourages economic growth, and along with it consumption, are not revolutionary findings. But that consumption decisions engage particular brain pathways in ways that affect the effectiveness of environmental campaigns and projects is both interesting and important, even if at this point it may be difficult to be sure quite how these new discoveries cut. At the least, however, the demonstration that</span> <span class="underline">even apparently straightforward decisions are, in fact, grounded in pre-rational cognitive information processing suggests that environmental and sustainability activists need to become more sophisticated in the way they think about</span>, <span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">and seek to socially engineer</span>, <span class="underline">consumption decisions.</span> <span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">For social engineering is a double-edged sword, and especially in areas like consumption, increasingly understood as involving complex and fundamental behaviors, such efforts can rebound against those who seek to impose such behavior change, regardless of their good intentions. </span></span><br />

<span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kagan ‘10</span></span> (Robert, March 5, Senior associate@Carnegie Endowment, “On Foreign Policy, Obama and the GOP Find Room for Agreement”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=40298" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=40298</a>)<br />
Perfect bipartisanship on foreign and defense policy is a lot to ask in an election year, and Republicans have a right, even an obligation, to be critical of policies they regard as dangerous. But there is more agreement today than usual. Never mind the divisive decades of the Bush and Clinton administrations. Democrats who look back fondly to the days of George H.W. Bush forget that they voted overwhelmingly against the Persian Gulf War and attacked that administration for paying too much attention to foreign policy. Today, by contrast, the administration and opposition largely agree on some of the most pressing issues. By historical standards, foreign policy is one area where the government is working. How to explain the surprising comity? Partly it is because the Democrats have changed in power. Being in opposition for many years tends to breed irresponsibility, as both parties have shown over the past two decades. Obama's team took office assuming that it should do the opposite of whatever Bush did or said, and the policy of &quot;un-Bush&quot; dominated the first months, just as &quot;un-Clinton&quot; shaped the early Bush years. But &quot;un-&quot; policies are no substitute for serious thinking. On most issues the Obama administration is now pursuing approaches closer to those of both Clinton and Bush than those favored by the virulently anti-Bush partisans. This is not surprising, since neither American interests nor the interests of other nations change with the American electoral cycle. There are larger forces at work, too, above all Sept. 11's lingering effects on the American psyche. Obama officials at first celebrated their abandonment of the &quot;war on terror,&quot; seeing it as a Bush-era mistake and, rhetorically at least, placed more emphasis on righting legal wrongs done to captured terrorism suspects than on stopping terrorist attacks. The irony is that Obama has been fighting the war on terror at least as vigorously as his predecessor. He escalated the war in Afghanistan and greatly increased drone attacks on suspected terrorists in Pakistan. The fact is, no president can allow himself to be perceived as trading any degree of American security to better protect the rights of suspected terrorists. Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt countenanced far more egregious violations of individual rights when security interests were perceived to be at stake. It was predictable that whatever Candidate Obama promised, President Obama would be compelled to take a tough line on terrorism. So Guantanamo remains open and may stay open for the remainder of Obama's presidency. Khalid Sheik Mohammed will probably not be tried in New York. After the Christmas Day bomber was taken into custody, more people have been put on watch lists. The USA Patriot Act has been renewed. Obama has probably learned not to provide Republicans new opportunities to exploit his weakness in these areas. For Republicans, meanwhile, the ongoing effect of Sept. 11 has been to check isolationist tendencies that have periodically flared in the party since the 1920s. Most Republicans today don't believe there is safety to be found in a Fortress America and reject even more modest calls for a retrenchment of U.S. involvement overseas.<br />

<u>WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Clinton</span> on Thursday <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">urged the Senate to ratify the new nuclear arms treaty reached with Russia, trying hard to ease the Republican concerns that it might hamper U.S. missile defense buildup.</span></u> Clinton made the testament before the Senate Armed Services Committee, alongside Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Energy Secretary Steven Chu and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen. The Russian government had said that it reserves the right to withdraw from the treaty if it feels threatened by U.S. missile defense system, which has raised concerns among Republicans<u>. But Clinton argued that &quot;a unilateral statement made by Russia concerning missile defense does not limit or constrain our missile- defense efforts.&quot;</u> <u>She said a U.S. statement on the treaty made it clear that &quot;the United States intends to continue improving and deploying its missile-defense systems in order to defend itself against limited attack.&quot;</u> Clinton strongly believed that the new treaty will make U.S. &quot; more secure&quot; and urged the Senate to ratify it &quot;expeditiously.&quot; <u>U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed the new nuclear arms treaty on April 8 which replaces the START treaty that has expired in December. Under the new pact, the two countries agreed to reduce their deployed nuclear warheads to 1,550 each, or 30 percent below the current level of 2,200. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">The Democrats need support from the Republicans as the treaty needs 67 votes from the Senate to be ratified.</span></u><br />

<span style="color: black;">Ok, worst case scenario. </span><u><span style="color: black;">Congress fails to ratify i</span></u><span style="color: black;">t. What happens next? I think that <u>would be an incredibly horrible scenario</u>. I think there is a sort of asymmetry about this Treaty that on the one hand it’s very modest, but on the other hand if it fails to be implemented, I think it will have extreme implications. I think that first </span><u><span style="color: black;">you will just have a complete loss of confidence and intelligence that the both sides had about each other’s nuclear arsenals. And the last thing you want when you have weapons on hair-trigger alert is a loss of confidence about the other side</span></u><span style="color: black;">, and so I think <u>it could lead to growing uncertainty</u>. I thin<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">k </span></span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; color: black;">Russia would see this as a big slap in the face</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; color: black;">.</span></u> <span style="color: black;">And I think relations would cool. I think, in a broader perspective it would really call to question the administration commitment to nuclear disarmament, to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Both the US and Russia used the START Treaty during the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in May to really make the argument that we are committed to arms control. And <u>if you don’t ratify this Treaty then I think there is a danger that countries that don’t have nuclear weapons could look at this and say “Well, the US is upholding its end of the MPT bargain. Why should we continue to be non-nuclear weapon states? <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">It could potentially close the whole non-proliferation regime overboard and lead to a sort of a cascade of nuclear proliferation</span></strong>.</u> I think it is the worst case scenario. But </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; color: black;">I think <strong>it’s not put of the realm of possibility if this Treaty is not ratified by the Senate</strong></span></u><span style="color: black;">. This leads my next question. How does the START Treaty, and </span><u><span style="color: black;">how will the START Treaty, affect international security</span></u><span style="color: black;">? I think, <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">if it’s ratified, what it simply does is kind of basically maintain the current nuclear status quo of nuclear stability between the US and Russi</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a<strong>. The new START provides a platform for further talks, for further action on other things and maintains nuclear stability</strong></span></u>. The analogy I’d like to use. It is sort of continuing traffic laws. People don’t really pay attention to the traffic laws, but if you eliminated them, the consequences would be severe and a lot of people would probably die. So, continuing the sort of institutions and structures that are in place and modernizing them, which this Treaty does in terms of verification and monitoring, is incredibly important, I think, for overall global security. From the US perspective we are really committed to disarmament and to arms control. And that the Bush administration years, where this didn’t get much attention, were sort of “a blip on the radar” from the past history of US President. Someone recently said that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; color: black;">without verification mechanism <strong>we would have nuclear anarchy</strong></span></u><span style="color: black;">. It was Senator Tom Daschle who said it. Yes, I think, that’s exactly right. Without the verification monitoring measures we‘d be sort of back to what we were in the Cold War when there were absolutely no rules or processes governing the US-Russia nuclear relations. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; color: black;">We’d be back at the point where it would be very easy for suspicion and distrust to carry the day</span></u><u><span style="color: black;">.</span></u> <span style="color: black;">And ultimately when you are dealing with military planners on both sides, their job is to be skeptical and they are going to be even more skeptical if they don’t have boots on the ground monitoring each other’s arsenals and don’t really have solid intelligence about what other side is doing. That leads to increased skepticism</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; color: black;">, increased tension and fear and could put us to the point where nuclear war</span></u><span style="color: black;">, which has now become unthinkable, becomes slightly more thinkable. And that in itself is a horrible direction to be moving in. </span><!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:123:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@_Toc264986023&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: _Toc264986023&quot;/&gt; --><a name="_Toc264986023"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:123 -->
