The best Afghan policy would be to reduce the number of foreign troops from the current level of 90,000 to far fewer … limit our objectives to counter-terrorism and humanitarian assistance and work out how to work with fewer troops and less money over a longer period. In Afghanistan in the long-term, less will be more.<br />

Bourne thereby identified a central truth of modern American politics: Stripped to its essence, our democracy has become an elaborate process of conferring enormous power on a single individual. What we choose to call an inauguration is more accurately a coronation. Nominally a chief executive, the president today occupies a position more akin to that of emperor, and Americans both expect much and demand much of their emperor. To be &quot;the most powerful man in the world&quot; is to be simultaneously worshiped and despised. To occupy the Oval Office is to become the modern-day equivalent of a Sun King, commanding deference, while also becoming the subject of endless gossip, envy, jealousy, and intrigue, all to be reported at length and ad nauseam by Bob Woodward. What lends this arrangement a semblance of legitimacy is the expectation that our president-monarch knows how to wield power effectively. Through the exercise of royal prerogatives, the king demonstrates his worthiness for high office. Should a president demonstrate an absence of mastery — if he comes across as a weakling or a ditherer — profound dysfunction results. Recall the Carter era. Jimmy Carter's inability to resolve the Iran hostage crisis reduced him to a figure of contempt and left Americans with a sense that the country itself was adrift. In short order, they stripped Carter of his crown. Yet presidential weakness — even an inkling of weakness — can have international as well as domestic implications. This is notably the case in matters related to national security. If the occupant of the Oval Office appears less than fully in command, friend and foe alike will wonder who exactly is in charge. Confusion about American priorities and intentions can thereby result. Out of confusion can come miscalculation, as allies revise downward their estimate of American reliability and adversaries persuade themselves that they can get away with mischief. In other words, the implications of weakness extend beyond the who’s up, who’s down preoccupations of garden-variety politics. This confusion describes where we find ourselves today. There is no doubting that President Obama is smart, talented, well intentioned, and smooth as they come. Yet whether he possesses the temperament to govern is fast becoming an open question. Put simply, the question is this: Does Obama have sufficient backbone? The release of Bob Woodward's new book <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-style: normal;">Obama’s Wars</span></em> has raised this question to new heights. It depicts a president who not only gets rolled but who <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-style: normal;">knows</span></em> when he is getting rolled and still allows it to happen. With regard to how to proceed on Afghanistan — the most important foreign policy decision to cross Obama’s desk thus far — the president last year demanded that the Pentagon present him with distinctive policy options. The king didn’t want to be handed the solution; he wanted to <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-style: normal;">choose.</span></em> In fact, however, the members of his court offered him three variations of a single course of action, the one that the Pentagon itself preferred — a textbook example of how the theory of “civilian control” differs from actual practice. Particularly disturbing is the fact that our very smart president understood exactly what was happening. Woodward shows Obama complaining loudly. Having registered that complaint, the president more or less meekly rubber-stamped the policy that the Pentagon was foisting on him. In effect, on Afghanistan he thereby forfeited to others the power to decide. Once Obama endorsed choices made by unelected subordinates, the office of commander-in-chief had acquired additional tenants. That was back in December 2009, of course. Here in October 2010, the Pentagon's preferred plan for Afghanistan shows little sign of succeeding anytime soon. Obama's wariness about escalating the war there — now about to enter its tenth year — looks increasingly sound, which makes his complicity in going along with that escalation all the more damning. Yet perhaps all is not lost — at least not entirely so. The president may yet have one last chance to retrieve the situation and to reverse the impression that he is less than fully in control of his administration. The next Afghanistan &quot;milestone&quot; is a strategic assessment promised for this coming December, one full year after Obama announced his (or the Pentagon's) Afghan surge. The military — General David Petraeus in the vanguard — will exert itself to minimize the importance of this mid-course review. So too will members of the Petraeus Lobby, currently challenging AIPAC, the trial lawyers, the pharmaceutical industry and all the rest of the powerful interest groups vying for preeminence in Washington. You can take it to the bank: The military backed by militarists in mufti will press for more time. They will argue for postponing any serious decisions until July 2011, intending in the mean time to chip away at the president's vaguely stated promise to begin withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan next summer. If Obama wishes to salvage his presidency and demonstrate his capacity to lead and to govern, he will reject that effort. He will instead seize the opportunity presented by the mid-course review. December is the time to render a verdict on the Afghanistan war. If the Afghan surge is still not showing clear signs of success by year's end, waiting another seven months won’t make a difference. December also presents Obama with an opportunity — perhaps his last one — to reverse the impression that he is not fully in control of his own administration. Decisive action just might enable the president to reassure Americans and the rest of the world that he is, after all, up to the job. Should he squander this last opportunity, however, the king is likely to find himself soon thereafter seeking new employment.<br />

It <em>is</em> about making cold-blooded political and economic calculations about where U.S. national interests will lie in the next decade. They do not lie in an open-ended COIN mission. The history of the Peloponnesian War is particularly relevant here. Athens began fighting Sparta with the resources of an empire and thousands of talents of silver in the bank—enough to fight expensive, far-flung naval and land campaigns for three years without lasting financial consequences. Athens was <em>rich</em>, and if peace with Sparta had come by the end of the third year, Athens would have continued to prosper and rule over much of the Mediterranean. (Athens had a &quot;hard&quot;—conquered or cowed—empire as opposed to the &quot;soft&quot; empire of alliances and treaties the U.S. currently has.) But the war with Sparta dragged on for decades, despite occasional peace overtures by both sides. By war's end—despite the spoils of battle and increased taxes and tribute extracted from its shrinking dominion—Athens was broke, depopulated by fighting and plague, bereft of its empire, and could no longer project power into the Mediterranean. Where its former interests ranged from Black Sea Turkey to southern Italy, it spent decades as a small-bore power and never regained its former strength or influence. I worry that the U.S. is similarly locked into an open-ended commitment to democratize a nation that is of regional rather than global importance—a parallel to Athens convincing itself that it had to conquer distant, militarily insignificant Sicily. &quot;Winning&quot; in Afghanistan <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The U.S. could &quot;win&quot; in Afghanistan</span></span> where victory is defined as a stable, legitimate central government that can project power within its own borders. I don't doubt that the U.S. and its allies could accomplish this given enough time and resources. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">But</span></span> I think—as many COIN experts also do—that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">it will take at least another decade or more of blood and treasure to produce such a result, if ever</span></span>. Of course I'd like to see the results of a successful COIN campaign: a stable democracy, women's rights, and general prosperity for Afghans, who among all Asia's peoples surely deserve those things. I certainly want to end al-Qa'ida's ability to operate freely in South Asia and elsewhere. The U.S. is the only country that would both conceive of these missions and attempt to carry them out. But goals beyond keeping al-Qa'ida on the run don't serve the long-term interests of the U.S., and I am more interested in regaining and preserving U.S. hard power than I am in the rewards that would come from &quot;winning&quot; a lengthy COIN war. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">I fear the U.S. people and government becoming exhausted from the costs of a lengthy COIN effort, just as they are already exhausted from</span></span> (and have largely forgotten about) the <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Iraq</span></span> war. I worry that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">if this fatigue sits in, the U.S. will abandon foreign-policy leadership</span></span> as it has done periodically throughout history. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">This outcome would be worse than a resurgent Taliban</span></span>, worse than Afghan women and men being further oppressed, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">and worse than al-Qa'ida having plentiful additional caves </span></span>to plot in. Here are some signs of an exhaustion of U.S. power: <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The U.S. is already overextended</span></span>, with commitments in Iraq (shrinking for now), Afghanistan (expanding), Yemen (pending) and Iran (TBD). At home, the U.S. economy remains feeble and in the long term is increasingly hostage to other nations for goods and services it no longer produces (and increasingly, no longer <em>can</em> produce). Even more worrisome is the U.S. credit situation. The wars, and much other U.S. government spending, are now heavily underwritten by other countries' purchases of debt the U.S. issues. It has borrowed trillions from foreign countries and especially China, which continues its steady, highly rational policy of promoting exports while freeriding under the American security umbrella (just as the U.S. once rode for free beneath Britain's). Over time, those countries accrue enough debt to have a say in U.S. policies that may threaten the dollar's value, which is why you now see high U.S. officials flying to Beijing to soothe PRC nerves and explain why America keeps borrowing money. At home, there are few resources to apply following a major disaster, such as a Katrina-style hurricane or a major earthquake. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The U.S. needs to start rebuilding its reserves—of capital, of credit, of political goodwill abroad, of military force—to be ready for these and more serious crises</span></span>, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">for which we currently have few resources to spare. Such challenges may involve humanitarian crises (think Darfur, a Rwanda-style genocide, Indian Ocean tsunamis);</span></span> Latin American instability (Mexico, Venezuela, post-Castro Cuba); <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">rogue-state nuclear development (Iran, North Korea); or complex challenges from a rising power (China, a reinvigorated Russia</span></span>). </span><br />

<br />
Afghanistan is a quagmire of attrition warfare that is destroying US morale and readiness.<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Kuhner, 9 - </span></span><span style="color: black;">the president of the Edmund Burke Institute for American Renewal<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"> (Jeffrey, Washington Times, “Obama’s quagmire; US should look to its own interests,” 9/7, Lexis Academic) </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: black;">America is losing the war in Afghanistan. Rather than change course, President Obama is sending 21,000 additional U.S. troops. This will bring the total to 68,000 American soldiers fighting in Afghanistan, bolstering coalition forces to 110,000. The troop surge</span>, however, <span style="color: black;">will not work. Afghanistan has become</span> Mr.<span style="color: black;"> Obama's Vietnam - a protracted quagmire draining precious American blood and treasure. August was the deadliest month for U.S. forces, with 47 soldiers killed by Taliban insurgents. More than 300 coalition troops have died in 2009. This is the highest toll since the war began in 2001, and there are still four months to go. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The </span></span><span style="color: black;">tide of battle has turned against the West. The Taliban is resurgent. It has reasserted control over its southern stronghold in Kandahar. The Taliban is launching devastating attacks in the western and northern parts of the country - formerly stable areas. U.S. casualties are soaring. The morale of coalition forces is plummeting. Most of our allies - with the exception of the Canadians and the British - are reluctant to engage the Islamist militants. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">American public support for the war is waning.</span></span><span style="color: black;"> The conflict has dragged on for nearly eight years. (U.S. involvement in World War II was four years, World War I less than one.) Yet, America's strategic objectives remain incoherent and elusive. The war's initial aim was to topple the Taliban and eradicate al Qaeda bases from Afghan territory. Those goals have been achieved. Washington should have declared victory and focused on the more important issue: preventing Islamic fundamentalists from seizing power in Pakistan, along with its nuclear arsenal. Instead, America is engaged in futile nation-building. Mr. Obama, like President George W. Bush before him, believes Afghanistan must be transformed by erecting a strong central government, democracy and a modern economy. Washington argues this will prevent terrorism from taking root and bring about lasting &quot;stability.&quot; Hence, following a recent reassessment of the war by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, U.S. commander in Afghanistan, the Obama administration is contemplating deploying 20,000 to 40,000 U.S. troops - on top of the 21,000 already pledged. Moreover, billions have been spent building irrigation canals, schools, hospitals and factories. Civilian advisers are being sent to encourage farmers to grow other cash crops besides opium poppies. Western aid money has been used to establish a massive Afghan army, a large police force and a swollen government bureaucracy. Gen. McChrystal said this week that the situation is &quot;serious,&quot; but not impossible. He still believes victory is within reach. His new strategy is to protect Afghan civilians from Taliban attacks. He also wants to create a lucrative jobs programs and improve local government services. The goal is to win the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of the Afghan people. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says we must combat Afghanistan's &quot;culture of poverty.&quot; Call it humanitarian war through social engineering. Mr. Obama's policy will result in a major American defeat - one that will signal the end of America as a superpower and expose us to the world as a paper tiger. Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. The mighty British and Russian armies were humiliated in drawn-out guerrilla campaigns. The country's mountainous geography and primitive tribal culture are ideally suited for insurgent warfare. By sending in more troops, Washington is playing right into the Taliban's hands: We are enabling the Taliban to pick off our forces one by one as they wage a campaign of attrition. The Taliban blend with the local population, making it almost impossible for U.S. forces to distinguish combatants from civilians. American counterinsurgency efforts are thus alienating some of the locals. Initially welcomed as liberators, we are now viewed in some quarters as occupiers. Moreover, much of the West's aid money is siphoned off by greedy politicians in Kabul. President Hamid Karzai's government is corrupt, venal and ineffective. It barely controls one-third of the country. It is despised by many Afghans for its brutality and incompetence. In addition, Mr. Karzai's vice-presidential running mate is a drug trafficker. The West's efforts to forge a cohesive national state based on federalism and economic reconstruction have failed. Warlords are increasingly asserting power in the provinces. The country is fractured along tribal and ethnic lines. The center cannot hold: Afghanistan remains mired in anarchy, blood feuds and weak, decentralized rule. U.S. troops should be deployed to defend U.S. national interests. Their lives should never be squandered for an experiment in liberal internationalism. In fact, such a policy is morally grotesque and strategically reckless. Mr. Obama should quickly withdraw most U.S. forces from Afghanistan. American air power and small, flexible Special Forces units are more than enough to wipe out al Qaeda terrorists. The Taliban is too hated to reoccupy the country - unless our huge military and economic footprint drives numerous Afghans into the evil, welcoming arms of extremists. </span><br />

Our national security always suffers when we get bogged down in wars where our troops are asked to bleed and die, but are not permitted by our political leaders to win. Our brave soldiers should never be allowed to sacrifice in this way without the hope of victory! The best way to support our troops is to bring them home to their families and make a commitment that we will not let a week go by without thanking a soldier for their willingness to risk life and limb to defend us all. What is it going to take to get our political leaders to realize that the costs of staying and fighting the long war in Iraq and Afghanistan greatly outweigh the costs of redeploying out of theater? The same voices we hear calling for us to send another 40,000 to 100,000 troops to Afghanistan are the ones that would have called for us to keep surging and fighting in Vietnam in perpetuity at the cost of hundreds of thousands of our soldiers lives. It didn’t make sense to do that then and it doesn’t make sense to do so now. Ronald Reagan won the Cold War against the Evil Soviet Empire in part by employing proxies to fight and win our battles for us.

<br />
To justify adopting a more narrow policy toward Afghanistan this spring, President Obama would need to cite several factors. First, the U.S. inability to eliminate the sanctuaries in Pakistan. Second, successful counterinsurgency depends on having a solid local partner. Two years of sustained investment and multiple but fraudulent elections suggest that Afghanistan's central government will not reach the point where it is considered effective or legitimate by the bulk of its own people. All this argues for adopting a policy of counterterrorism rather than state-building. There are also broader reasons to recast policy. The greatest threat to U.S. national security stems from our own fiscal crisis. Afghanistan is a significant contributor to this situation and could play an important role in reducing it. A savings of $75 billion a year could help finance much-needed military modernization and reduce the deficit. Another factor is the increased possibility of a conflict with a reckless North Korea and the continued possibility of a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program. U.S. military forces must be freed up to contend with these issues. The perception that we are tied down in Afghanistan makes it more difficult to threaten North Korea or Iran credibly—and makes it more difficult to muster the forces to deal with either if necessary. Ultimately Afghanistan is a strategic distraction. U.S. interests there are limited. So, too, are the resources available for national security. It is not surprising that the commander in the field, Gen. David Petraeus, is calling for committing greater resources to the theater. But it is the commander-in-chief's responsibility to take into account the nation's capacity to meet all of its challenges, national and international. It is for this reason that the perspectives of Gen. Petraeus and President Obama must necessarily diverge.<br />

<br />
Reassessing Our Grand Strategic Posture in Central Asia<br />
These same issues illustrate why we need to evaluate our grand strategic commitment to Afghanistan andPakistan in a way that makes hard choices about our future posture in Central Asia. We need to debate exactly what US goals are in all of Central Asia, and what overall level of continued US effort is really justified.<br />
A look at the map and the region's infrastructure also makes it clear that Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asia are natural Russian and Chinese spheres of influence in political, military, economic, and energy terms. If we limit our role to conventional diplomacy and military advisory roles, Russia and China will have to do what they can to bring stability and security to the region. Iran and India, and other peripheral powers will have to play a far greater role.<br />
“Strategic neglect” is not an American strength, and neither is “strategic triage.” We cannot afford grand strategies,however, that ignore the need to make far harder choices on a global level. If the costs and risks of a major US commitment in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asia remain this high, or continue to grow, this is one &quot;Great Game&quot; that can best be won by refusing to play it. There are simply too many complex ethnic, sectarian, tribal, and other national tensions in this region for a US to manage the end result. We have too many other interests in Asia, Europe, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East where we already have vital strategic interests, and face problems that challenge our capabilities and resources.<br />
Avoiding Limited Wars That Commit the Bulk of US Ground Forces and US Civil-<br />
Military Resources to Open-Ended Armed Nation Building<br />
More broadly, we need to consider what a near decade of conflict should shows about the way we risk making major long-term commitment of scarce US military forces and civil aid capabilities in the future, and about the need to find better ways to use our resources. It shows that we have to be far more careful about letting limited involvement escalate into “worst case wars” in one narrow part of the world.<br />
We may not like to face the fact that we are actively involved in armed nation building, and that this can be a “worst case” form of limited war. The fact is, however, that we did escalate to this level in Iraq, we are still fighting on this level in Afghanistan, and we have a growing involvement in Pakistan.<br />
They have tied up an immense proportion of the US defense budget, US forces, and scarce aid and development expertise in extremely high-risk commitments to a given conflict whose scale and duration cannot be predicted and run a constant risk of serious escalation and/or failure. Moreover, it is more than doubtful that the US would have escalated or engaged in any of its these wars in the way it did if their costs and risks had been properly assessed before or during the initial phase of military and stability operations. Such wars may become necessary in the future, but we need to consider the cost-benefits of this approach to making strategic commitments even when we have valid grand strategic needs, and the cost-benefits of alternative approaches. The US needs to do a far better job of considering alternative strategies and grand strategies that put far more emphasis on containment and deterrence; on reacting decisively before wars escalate to this level of requirements, and building on allies at moderate cost rather than fighting and spending in broken states.<br />
In the process, the US also needs to be far more realistic about its severe real-world limits as a military “superpower.” The Iraq and Afghan/Pakistan wars have shown that the US now effectively has the land forces for one major regional contingency and no practical prospect of increasing them. These are the same forces that would have to help South Korea in a crisis or any other partner that required US support in a conventional war.<br />

Independently risks miscalculation and great power war<br />

A greater worry has been the operational availability of American ground forces. The army has a system for deploying the 42 new Brigade Combat Teams it is establishing as part of an ongoing programme to restructure its units. The goal is for an active brigade to spend two years at home for each year it is deployed overseas. So many units are needed for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, however, that combat brigades are generally spending only a year at home for each year they are deployed. As one general put it, the brigades are either deployed, have just got back or are preparing to rotate back to Iraq and Afghanistan again. As a consequence, no more than a handful – perhaps as few as two or three Brigade Combat Teams – are immediately available for contingencies elsewhere. The shortage of forces has also constrained training. Since the focus is on Iraq and Afghanistan and combat troops generally spend only a year in the United States before rotating back, the army has essentially abandoned brigade- level heavy mechanised training at the National Training Center. Concerns have grown within the military establishment that the army may be raising a new group of young lieutenants and captains with little experience in high-intensity warfare against heavily equipped armies like North Korea’s. An unexpected crisis on the Korean Peninsula or another trouble-spot would likely force the army to take extraordinary measures. It could respond to the crisis by dispatching troops that had been earmarked for duty in Iraq and by simultaneously extending the deployment of troops already in Iraq well beyond the normal year-long tour of duty. Surging forces in Iraq would likely involve a similar extension of deployment tours. Such a move, however, would risk future difficulties in retaining officers in an all-volunteer force and might stretch the army to the breaking point. The Marine Corps is encountering similar strains. Of the 24 infantry battalions in the active force, nine are deployed, including three Marine Expeditionary Units. Seventy percent of the marine battalions that are deployed are located in the Central Command’s area of responsibility, meaning the Middle East and southwest Asia. The marines generally deploy for seven months instead of a year, but the strain has been similar. Marine units have generally been home only eight or nine months for each seven months they are deployed. Much of their training is geared to counter-insurgency. The marines are not training for high-intensity warfare at the battalion or higher level as much as in the past. To cope with the demands, both services anticipate greater use of the reserves. Army officials have already told Rumsfeld aides that they may be forced to make greater use of the National Guard. Following extensive use in Iraq, the National Guard set a goal of allowing five years at home between foreign deployments so as not to disrupt the family life and careers of its citizen soldiers. Greater use of the Guard would require that this goal be sacrificed. As for the marines, of the six reserve battalions, one has been deployed for almost two years and is currently off-limits. The remaining five have been deployed for about a year, and the marines sought and received authority from Rumsfeld to use them for one more year. In addition, the marines said in August 2006 that they will call back as many as 2,500 members of its Individual Ready Reserve, a pool of manpower that the marines had not tapped since 2003 and which is used to fill military specialities in times of national emergency. Such moves, however, are merely expedient measures. It is not simply a matter of enduring strain on the force. The limited number of ground troops has already had deleterious consequences. In Iraq, the limited numbers of forces have hampered American operations, delaying progress and prolonging the day when American forces might be able to go home. The 2005 operations by the Army’s Third Armored Cavalry Regiment in Tal Afar demonstrated what can be accomplished by an astute commander who is sensitive to the needs of the local population and has the necessary forces to establish control. The regiment worked with Iraqi security forces to clear Tal Afar of insurgents, to hold the town with Iraqi and American troops, then to encourage reconstruction there, an approach known as ’clear, hold, build’. The new counter-insurgency manual hailed the operation, as did Bush. But the reality is that such operations are troop intensive. ‘The units that have sufficient forces are applying the doctrine with good effect’, said one military officer who recently returned from Iraq. ’Those units without sufficient forces can only conduct raids to disrupt the enemy while protecting themselves. They can’t do enough to protect the population effectively and partner with Iraqi forces.‘8 Indeed, an instructive case history that is not included in the new counter- insurgency manual shows how efforts can be set back due to insufficient forces. To mass enough troops to retake Fallujah in the autumn of 2004 the marines drew forces from Haditha, essentially leaving the town at the mercy of the insur- gents. What followed was a devastating setback for the American effort to carry out counter-insurgency operations in the violent al-Anbar province. While the Americans were securing Fallujah the Iraqi police in Haditha were accosted by insurgents and executed. The episode left the town without a police force that could check the operations of the insurgents and taught the Iraqis there that the Americans could not be counted on to protect their nascent institutions, what- ever their good intentions. It also made the task of recruiting a new police force all but impossible. When follow-on marine units were deployed to Haditha their efforts to mount a police recruitment drive failed, forcing the marines to think about seeking police recruits from other parts of the country. Without adequate force levels, operations in al-Anbar became a strategic version of the Whac-a-Mole arcade game in which a target is struck only to appear elsewhere. When American forces massed troops to clear one area they left another area poorly protected, creating a vacuum that the insurgents eagerly filled.9 The consequences were summed up in an intelligence report that was prepared by Multinational Forces-West, the American command for the western area. Outside of islands of relative stability like Fallujah and al-Qaim, cleared in large-scale combat operations by American troops, the dominant force was not the American military or the new Iraqi government, but al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia. The report estimated that the deployment of a coalition division and a massive infusion of aid, neither of which were in the offing, were required to reverse the deteriorating security conditions.10 The risks presented by a constrained number of ground forces extend beyond Iraq. They raise the possibility that an adversary might miscalculate, projecting that it can undertake provocative actions that the United States would find it difficult to respond to. The Iraq War was intended by the Bush administration as a demonstration of American power and resolve that would serve as a cautionary lesson to nations like Iran, which is pursuing a nuclear-weapons capability, or Syria, which has supported Hizbullah. With the difficulties of the United States in Iraq, the lesson has backfired. But the limited number of forces may add to the perception that the United States is bogged down in Iraq and unable to respond adequately to other contingencies<br />

This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline, but it encompasses a trend that appears to be negative and perhaps alarming. Although the US still possesses incomparable military prowess and its economy remains the world’s largest, the once seemingly indomitable chasm that separated America from anyone else is narrowing. Thus, the global distribution of power is shifting, and the inevitable result will be a world that is less peaceful, liberal and prosperous, burdened by a dearth of effective conflict regulation. Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts. However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid. As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves.’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law. Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that America’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973). A world without American hegemony is one where great power wars re-emerge, the liberal international system is supplanted by an authoritarian one, and trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy<br />

Currency wars. Terrorist attacks. Military conflicts. Rogue regimes pursuing nuclear weapons. Collapsing states. And now, massive leaks of secret documents. What is the cause of such turbulence? The absence of empire. During the Cold War, the world was divided between the Soviet and U.S. imperial systems. The Soviet imperium - heir to Kievan Rus, medieval Muscovy and the Romanov dynasty - covered Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia and propped up regimes in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. The American imperium - heir to maritime Venice and Great Britain - also propped up allies, particularly in Western Europe and East Asia. True to the garrison tradition of imperial Rome, Washington kept bases in West Germany, Turkey, South Korea and Japan, virtually surrounding the Soviet Union. The breakup of the Soviet empire, though it caused euphoria in the West and led to freedom in Central Europe, also sparked ethnic conflicts in the Balkans and the Caucasus that cost hundreds of thousands of lives and created millions of refugees. (In Tajikistan alone, more than 50,000 people were killed in a civil war that barely registered in the U.S. media in the 1990s.) The Soviet collapse also unleashed economic and social chaos in Russia itself, as well as the further unmooring of the Middle East. It was no accident that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait less than a year after the Berlin Wall fell, just as it is inconceivable that the United States would have invaded Iraq if the Soviet Union, a staunch patron of Baghdad, still existed in 2003. And had the Soviet empire not fallen apart or ignominiously withdrawn from Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden never would have taken refuge there and the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, might not have happened. Such are the wages of imperial collapse. Now the other pillar of the relative peace of the Cold War, the United States, is slipping, while new powers such as China and India remain unready and unwilling to fill the void. There will be no sudden breakdown on our part, as the United States, unlike the Soviet Union, is sturdily maintained by economic and political freedom. Rather, America's ability to bring a modicum of order to the world is simply fading in slow motion. The days of the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency are numbered, just as our diplomacy is hobbled by wide-ranging security leaks that are specific to an age of electronic communication, itself hostile to imperial rule. Then there is America's military power. Armies win wars, but in an age when the theater of conflict is global, navies and air forces are more accurate registers of national might. (Any attack on Iran, for example, would be a sea and air campaign.) The U.S. Navy has gone from nearly 600 warships in the Reagan era to fewer than 300 today, while the navies of China and India grow apace. Such trends will accelerate with the defense cuts that are surely coming in order to rescue America from its fiscal crisis. The United States still dominates the seas and the air and will do so for years ahead, but the distance between it and other nations is narrowing. Terrorist acts, ethnic atrocities, the yearning after horrible weaponry and the disclosure of secret cables are the work of individuals who cannot escape their own moral responsibility. But the headlines of our era are written in a specific context - that of one deceased empire that used to be the world's preeminent land power and of another, the world's preeminent sea power, that finds itself less able to affect events than ever before, even as it is less sure than ever of the cause toward which it struggles. This is no indictment of President Obama's foreign policy. There is slim evidence of a credible alternative to his actions on North Korea, Iran and Iraq, while a feisty debate goes on over the proper course in Afghanistan. But there is simply no doubt that the post-imperial order we inhabit allows for greater disruptions than the Cold War ever permitted. Husbanding our power in an effort to slow America's decline in a post-Iraq and post-Afghanistan world would mean avoiding debilitating land entanglements and focusing instead on being more of an offshore balancer: that is, lurking with our air and sea forces over the horizon, intervening only when outrages are committed that unquestionably threaten our allies and world order in general. While this may be in America's interest, the very signaling of such an aloof intention may encourage regional bullies, given that rogue regimes are the organizing principles for some pivotal parts of the world. North Korea already plows onward with its nuclear weapons program, even as it lobs artillery shells on a South Korean island, demonstrating the limits of both U.S. and Chinese power in a semi-anarchic world. During the Cold War, North Korea was kept in its box by the Soviet Union while the U.S. Navy dominated the Pacific as though it were an American lake. Now China's economic dominance of the region, coupled with our distracting land wars in the Middle East, is transforming the western Pacific from a benign and stable environment to a more uncertain and complex one. China's navy is decades behind America's, but that should offer little consolation. The United States, having just experienced asymmetric warfare on land, should now expect asymmetric challenges at sea. With its improving mine-warfare capability, seabed sonar networks and cyber-warfare in the service of anti-ship ballistic missiles, not to mention its diesel-electric and nuclear submarines, China will make U.S. Navy operations more dangerous over the coming years. As for Taiwan, China has 1,500 short-range ballistic missiles pointed at the island, even as hundreds of commercial flights each week link Taiwan with the mainland in peaceful commerce. When China effectively incorporates Taiwan in the years to come, that will signal the arrival of a truly multipolar and less predictable military environment in East Asia. In the Middle East we see the real collapse of the Cold War imperial order. The neat Israeli-Arab dichotomy that mirrored the American-Soviet one has been replaced by a less stable power arrangement, with a zone of Iranian influence stretching from Lebanon to western Afghanistan, pitted against both Israel and the Sunni Arab world, and with a newly Islamic, and no longer pro-Western, Turkey rising as a balancing power. Yes, empires impose order, but that order is not necessarily benevolent, as Iran's budding imperial domain shows. U.S. threats against Iran lack credibility precisely because of our imperial fatigue resulting from Iraq and Afghanistan. Out of self-interest we will probably not involve ourselves in another war in the Middle East - even as that very self-interest could consign the region to a nuclear standoff. One standard narrative is that as we recede, China will step up as part of a benign post-American world. But this presupposes that all imperial powers are the same, even when history clearly demonstrates that they are not. Nor does one empire sequentially fill the gap left by another. While the Soviet Union and the United States were both missionary powers motivated by ideals - communism and liberal democracy - through which they might order the world, China has no such grand conception. It is driven abroad by the hunger for natural resources (hydrocarbons, minerals and metals) that it requires to raise hundreds of millions of its citizens into the middle class. This could abet the development of a trading system between the Indian Ocean, Africa and Central Asia that might maintain peace with minimal American involvement. But who is to fill the moral void? Does China really care if Tehran develops nuclear weapons, so long as it has access to Iran's natural gas? And Beijing may not be entirely comfortable with the North Korean regime, which keeps its population in a state of freeze-frame semi-starvation, but China props it up nevertheless. It can be argued that with power comes moral responsibility, but it will probably be decades before China has the kind of navy and air force that would lead it to become an authentic partner in an international security system. For the moment, Beijing gets a free ride off the protection of the world's sea lanes that the U.S. Navy helps provide, and watches us struggle to stabilize Afghanistan and Pakistan so that China can one day extract their natural resources. If the Cold War was an epoch of relative stability, guaranteed by a tacit understanding among empires, we now have one waning empire, that of the United States, trying to bring order amid a world of rising and sometimes hostile powers. Looming over all of this is the densely crowded global map. Across Eurasia, rural populations have given way to megacities prone to incitement by mass media and to destruction by environmental catastrophe. Lumbering, hard-to-deploy armies are being replaced with overlapping ballistic missile ranges that demonstrate the delivery capabilities of weapons of mass destruction. New technologies make everything affect everything else at a faster and more lethal rate than ever before. The free flow of information, as the WikiLeaks scandal makes clear, and the miniaturization of weaponry, as the terrorist bombings in Pakistani cities make clear, work against the rise and sustenance of imperial orders. The American empire has always been more structural than spiritual. Its network of alliances certainly resembles those of empires past, and the challenges facing its troops abroad are comparable to those of imperial forces of yore, though the American public, especially after the debacles in Iraq and Afghanistan, is in no mood for any more of the land-centric adventures that have been the stuff of imperialism since antiquity. Americans rightly lack an imperial mentality. But lessening our engagement with the world would have devastating consequences for humanity. The disruptions we witness today are but a taste of what is to come should our country flinch from its international responsibilities.<br />

Over the past two weeks, as the world's attention has been focused on pro-democracy demonstrations in Egypt, the tale of woe emanating from Afghanistan has only grown worse. As if right on cue, President Hamid Karzai announced at the recent security conference in Munich that provincial reconstruction teams -- a key element of the U.S. military's counterinsurgency strategy -- are undermining his governing authority and should be winded down by 2014. But this latest Karzai salvo is the mere tip of the iceberg. Although Gen. David Petraeus and other administration officials have tried to spin recent military gains as a reason for optimism, by President Barack Obama's own criteria for success, the United States is failing badly in Afghanistan. Back in December 2009, when Obama announced his plans for escalation in Afghanistan, he identified three key elements of the mission: militarily breaking the Taliban's momentum and increasing Afghanistan's capacity to secure itself independently; helping the Afghan government take advantage of improved security to improve governance; and finally, forging a strong partnership between the United States and Pakistan. On nearly all these fronts the U.S. mission is showing very little progress. The military repeatedly claims it is regaining the momentum from Taliban insurgents. And though it appears the Taliban have been weakened by an uptick in U.S. military engagement, the facts also suggest a more complicated reality. According to the well-respected Afghan NGO Safety Office (ANSO), 2010 was the most violent year of the war. The organization claims the evidence is &quot;indisputable&quot; that security conditions in the country are worsening. Only four provinces, according to ANSO are considered to have &quot;low insecurity,&quot; and across Afghanistan civilian casualties are up -- as is U.S. and NATO loss of life. Indeed, there were more than 1,430 insurgent incidents in January 2011, an 80 percent increase over the same period last year. But even if one accepts Petraeus's claims that America has &quot;got our teeth in the enemy's jugular now,&quot; the rest of the story is more uniformly negative. Improvements in Afghanistan's security forces are sketchy at best. A new report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction describes a devastating tale of &quot;poor planning&quot; and weak management that is undermining ambitious U.S. training goals for Afghan security forces. Training of the Afghan police isn't much better. A recent survey of police mentoring in Afghanistan concluded that &quot;corruption among the Afghan police was effectively universal,&quot; and even by NATO's own data, attrition rates for the Afghan police, though improved, are still above 50 percent. How about the aforementioned Hamid Karzai? Here again the story is not good. Karzai finally begrudgingly agreed last month to seat the newly elected Afghan parliament -- four months after a fraud-scarred election. But he did so only after &quot;intense pressure&quot; from the international community. Hopes that Karzai would move &quot;in a new direction,&quot; as Obama said at West Point, have not materialized -- and economic and political corruption, as well as poor governance, remains a fundamental part of life in Afghanistan. With Karzai's government showing such little improvement, relations between Kabul and the U.S. government have become increasingly frayed. Across the border in Pakistan, things aren't much better. The United States has just this week suspended all high-level dialogue with Pakistan over the continued detainment of an U.S. diplomat, Raymond Davis, who is being held in violation of his diplomatic immunity by Pakistani authorities. It's indicative of the cloud of suspicion that continues to darken U.S.-Pakistan relations. Indeed, last month there were reports that Washington plans to offer Islamabad a new set of inducements to remove the Afghan Taliban safe havens in Pakistan. But nine years of enticements from the Obama and Bush administrations have failed to convince Islamabad to abandon the Taliban as a strategic ally -- and there is little reason to believe that a new offering of American baubles and assurances will soften Pakistani intransigence. These tales of unmet strategic objectives represent a fundamental failure of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. Yet this has not stopped U.S. policymakers from continuing to make grandiose claims of progress. In Obama's recent State of the Union address, he said that the fight is being &quot;taken&quot; to the enemy, words that dovetailed with those of his commanding general in Afghanistan, whose recent assessment to troops claimed the mission in Afghanistan is making &quot;impressive progress&quot; and has inflicted &quot;enormous losses&quot; on Taliban fighters. The statements by Obama and Petraeus are now typical fare from the U.S. government: They offer glowing optimism about recent military gains, but make no mention of the larger strategic obstacles that imperil success in Afghanistan. However, without tangible improvement in creating a capable and effective Afghan security force; without a competent and legitimate central government able to provide good governance to its people; without a choking-off of the supply of arms and fighters from across the border in Pakistan, the tactical gains being made by U.S. troops cannot be sustained and, quite simply, the war in Afghanistan cannot be won. All the elements of the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan -- political, diplomatic, and military -- must be working if the effort is to be successful, not just the latter. But instead of recognizing these failures and shifting course, there is abiding resistance to any change among policymakers. Proposals to begin the process of political reconciliation with the Taliban are pushed aside because on the ground, after all, the insurgents are back on their heels. So why negotiate? But this mindset creates a misleading sense of optimism that precludes any serious examination of the current strategy. That myopia was evident in the strategic review released last December by the White House -- a document that, at best, deserves to be called a whitewash. Long overdue in Afghanistan is a sobering recognition by political and military leaders that the current U.S. and NATO strategy is failing, has little chance of success, and must be reformulated immediately. That is the public discussion that needs to be taking place. But none of that will happen so long as the U.S. president and his military commanders ignore the many signs that America is losing the war in Afghanistan -- choosing instead to focus their public rhetoric solely on rosy assessments of military progress.<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">I spent five years as a counterterrorism analyst for the Pentagon and rigorously studied plots from Madrid to London to 9/11.</span></span><span style="color: black;"> The above arguments may have merit in a piecemeal or abstract sense, but fall apart in the specific case of what we all dread: a large-scale, al Qaeda operation aimed at the United States. It is certainly true, for example, that terrorist groups can accomplish much online. Individuals can maintain contact with groups via chat rooms, money can be transferred over the Web (if done with extreme caution), and plotters can download items like instruction manuals for bomb-making, photographs of potential targets, and even blueprints for particular buildings. But <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">all the e-mail accounts, chat rooms, and social media available will never account for the human touch. There is simply no substitute for the trust and confidence built by physically meeting</span></span>, jointly conceiving, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">and then training together for a large-scale, complex operation on the other side of the world. </span></span>As the 9/11 plot developed, mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed (KSM) put the future operatives through a series of training courses along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Courses included physical fitness, firearms, close combat, Western culture, and English language. The 9/11 Commission report notes the extreme physical and mental demands KSM put on the participants -- even if the operation didn't require extensive firearms usage, KSM would have wanted the operatives to be proficient under intense pressure, should the need arise. Juxtapose that with an online learning environment. While you can no doubt learn some amazing things from online courses, it is far preferable to have a dedicated professor physically present to supervise students and monitor their progress. Or think of it another way: You wouldn't want the U.S. Marine Corps to send recruits into battle without training under a drill instructor, would you? KSM was somewhere between a professor and sergeant. Second, critics argue that the Madrid bombings of 2004 (which killed 191) as well those in London a year later (which killed 56) were largely -- though not entirely -- conceived, prepared, and executed within their respective countries, thus obviating the need for a safe haven. True enough. However, unlike 9/11 (which killed nearly 3,000), those plots' successes were possible due to their simple concept and small scale. In both cities, the playbook was essentially the same: Four to eight individuals had to find a safe house, download bomb-making instructions, purchase explosive agents, assemble the devices, and deliver charges to the attack points. Without trivializing the tragic loss of life in the European attacks, building those explosive devices was akin to conducting a difficult high-school chemistry experiment. On that scale, 9/11 was like constructing a nuclear warhead. In every sense, it was a grander vision, involving 20 highly skilled operatives infiltrating the U.S. homeland, who conducted a series of hijackings and targeted four national landmarks with enough know-how, preparation, and contingency plans to be success. In one instance, KSM taught the 9/11 operatives to shoot a rifle from the back of a moving motorcycle, just in case. You can't do that in someone's bedroom -- you need space, time, and the ability to work without worrying that the cops are listening in. In other words, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">as a plot grows in number of operatives, scale of target, distance from base, and logistical complexity, so does the need for space to reduce the chances of being discovered and disrupted.</span></span> The final argument is that denying al Qaeda a safe haven is an exercise in futility: Drive Osama bin Laden from Afghanistan and he'd relocate to some place like Sudan, southern Algeria, Somalia, or other swaths of ungoverned territory. However, this logic makes two faulty assumptions: that al Qaeda is mobile, and that the group's international affiliates would automatically roll out the red carpet for the jihadi refugees. Neither is true. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Bin Laden and his senior and mid level cadre are well-known to intelligence services the world over. Any attempt to travel</span></span><span style="color: black;">, let alone cross an international border (save Afghanistan-Pakistan) </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">would fall somewhere between &quot;utterly unthinkable&quot; and &quot;highly risky.</span></span><span style="color: black;">&quot; Moving would further require massive reorientation of al Qaeda's financial operations and smuggling networks. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Nor would bin Laden's senior leaders be automatically welcomed abroad in areas their regional partners control. Though</span></span><span style="color: black;"> al Qaeda has established &quot;franchise affiliates&quot; in places like North Africa and Southeast Asia, relationships between al Qaeda's leadership and its regional nodes are extraordinarily complex. Groups like the North African affiliate &quot;al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb&quot; (AQIM) are happy to co-opt the al Qaeda &quot;brand&quot; for recruiting and financial reasons, but they don't necessarily share the al Qaeda senior leadership's ideological goals. AQIM is much more focused on attacking the Algerian government or foreign entities within the country, having not displayed much capability or desire for grandiose international operations. And last, recruits come to North Africa more often through independent networks in Europe, not camps along the Durand Line. Think of the relationship like the one you have your in-laws: You might share a name, but you probably don't want them coming to visit for three full weeks. Regional leaders aren't terribly loyal to senior leadership, either. Take Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the deceased leader of the group's Iraq affiliate. He was summoned to bin Laden's side numerous times in an attempt to exert control as the Iraqi commander's tactics grew more grotesque and questionable. Zarqawi declined, not wanting to risk travel or accept instruction from bin Laden. In the end, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">a safe haven along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border is as good as it gets for al Qaeda's chances to launch a large-scale attack against the Un</span></span><span style="color: black;">ited </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">S</span></span><span style="color: black;">tates. Certainly, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">smaller, less complex attacks could be planned without &quot;Afghan real estate,&quot; but any such plot's death toll and long-term effect on American society will be far more limited.</span></span><span style="color: black;"> Unfortunately, that's a risk President Barack Obama has to accept -- no amount of intelligence or counterterrorism operations can provide 100 percent security. But </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">to avoid the Big One, the U.S. president's best bet is to deny al Qaeda the only physical space it can access</span></span><span style="color: black;">. </span><br />

At the same time, Washington must remain highly sensitive to the dynamic whereby decreased military activity in Afghanistan combined with robust operations in Pakistan could induce al-Qaeda to return to Afghanistan and render it a main threat once again. In that light, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">any abrupt wholesale American military withdrawal from Afghanistan would be too risky. Instead, the United States should seek to facilitate a <span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">glide-path to a substantial drawdown</span> - and with it fewer casualties and lower expenditures in Afghanistan - over the next few years. Doing so would involve continuing to suppress al-Qaeda in Pakistan with selective and discriminate drone strikes and denying al-Qaeda access to Afghanistan</span></span>. The former would require bases within Afghan territory from which to deploy airpower and special-operations forces against terrorists and terrorist infrastructure, as well as the troops and equipment to secure these bases. The latter would call for reinforced border security and force protection within Afghanistan, which in themselves would entail a surprisingly large number of soldiers. For these purposes, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">S</span></span>tates <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">would continue to bring extensive human intelligence and surveillance capabilities to bear on Afghanistan to detect and assess potential threats to American interests. To mitigate and eliminate such threats, the generous deployment of US special-operations forces to Afghanistan</span></span> - which currently comprises some 50% of all US special-operations personnel - <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">would have to be maintained over the medium term. </span></span>Meanwhile, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">US train-and-equip programmes for Afghan security forces should be intensified in contemplation of a gradual and controlled hand-off of the domestic counter-terrorism mission to them when they are ready, as well as to prepare them for counterinsurgency operations, should the Afghan government wish to use them for that purpose</span></span>. The United States should also provide strong political and economic support for the Afghan government, which is likely to remain under Karzai once the votes of the 20 August election are counted and certified. Kabul, however, should be left to take the lead in managing its relationship with the Taliban (as well as anti-narcotics policy). With US encouragement, the Karzai government should make it clear to Pashtuns in the southern and eastern parts of the country that if they support insurgents or terrorists aiming to destabilise the Afghan or Pakistani governments, they will suffer financially and militarily. Again, some US forces would be needed to give such arrangements teeth, but not at the levels required for an all-out counter-insurgency. American insurance against a militant Islamist coup or an uncontrollable level of destabilisation also should be left in place. This could entail a standby stabilisation force with tactical air capabilities based in or near Kabul, along with a robust quick-reaction force. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">That policy would reflect the reality that a deeply committed counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan is potentially counterproductive, probably unwinnable and in any event unnecessary. The United States can protect its interests and fulfil its international security obligations with a far more circumscribed counter-terrorism effort focused on Pakistan</span></span>. Under such an approach, US policy would recognise Afghanistan as the residual problem that it has, in fact, become. <span style="color: black;">Two impacts a.

The summit begins today, but discussions will start in earnest Tuesday. Obama said &quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the single biggest threat&quot; to U.S. security is the possibility of a terrorist organization with a nuclear weapon.</span></span> &quot;If there was ever a detonation in New York City, or London, or Johannesburg, the ramifications economically, politically and from a security perspective would be devastating,&quot; he said Sunday before meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who is attending the summit. Also attending: presidents, prime ministers and kings from countries such as Russia, China, India, Pakistan and Jordan. Obama continues one-on-one meetings with leaders today, and on Tuesday, the group will sign a &quot;high-level communiqué&quot; that recognizes the seriousness of the threat and outlines efforts to secure or eliminate vulnerable stockpiles, according to Gary Samore, the White House senior adviser for non-proliferation. The summit is &quot;intended to rally collective action,&quot; White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes says. The meetings will present their own security challenge for the Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies because there will be so many world leaders at one time in Washington. Samore says several countries will announce plans to eliminate or better protect their stockpiles.

Five countries — the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, China and France — are internationally recognized nuclear powers and have signed on to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which pledges to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and technology. India, Pakistan and North Korea also have nuclear weapons, and Israel is suspected of having warheads, according to the non-partisan Arms Control Association. Israel does not admit or deny having them. The United States and Russia hold the overwhelming majority of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, the material that could be used to build a crude but devastating bomb. According to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nuclear-security group run by former Democratic senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, there is no comprehensive inventory of the world's nuclear material. But <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">672 research reactors have been built worldwide and 272 operate in 56 countries, most at universities or other research centers where security is lax</span></span>, the group says. &quot;Much of the nuclear materials that are potentially vulnerable or could be used for nuclear weapons are actually in the hands of private industry, so government regulation is a very important component,&quot; Samore says. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Some of the material already has been stolen, according to Harvard University's </span></span>Matthew <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Bunn,</span></span> author of <em>Securing the Bomb</em>. &quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Nuclear theft is not a hypothetical worry,&quot;</span></span> he says. &quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">It's an ongoing reality</span></span>.&quot; <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The International Atomic Energy Agency</span></span>, a watchdog arm of the United Nations that monitors the use of nuclear power and technology<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">, has documented 18 cases involving the theft or loss of plutonium or weapons-grade uranium</span></span>, mostly occurring in the former Soviet Union. The IAEA says a majority of these cases have not had a pre-identified buyer and &quot;amateurish character&quot; and &quot;poor organization&quot; have been the hallmark of some of the cases involving unauthorized possession of materials. In Prague last year, Obama said, &quot;Black market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound.&quot; Government efforts have been made to secure nuclear material in recent years. Last week, the National Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA) worked with officials in Chile to remove nuclear material from reactors near Santiago and transport it to the USA. The agency has removed all significant amounts of highly enriched uranium from 18 countries, helped convert 60 reactors in 32 countries to the use of safer, low-enriched uranium and closed seven reactors. The NNSA also has secured highly enriched uranium in more than 750 buildings worldwide and safely stored 2,691 kilograms of nuclear material. Despite those efforts, in 2008, the Commission for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction warned, &quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Unless the world community acts decisively and with great urgency, it is more likely than not that a weapon of mass destruction will be used in a terrorist attack&quot; by 2013</span></span>. Nuclear terrorism causes extinction Morgan, 9 - Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Yongin Campus - South Korea (Dennis, Futures, November, “World on fire: two scenarios of the destruction of human civilization and possible extinction of the human race,” Science Direct) In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question ‘‘Is Nuclear War Inevitable??’’ [10].4 In Section 1, Moore points out what <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">most terrorists</span></span> obviously already know about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange</span></span>. As Moore points out, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">all that militant terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. Because of the Russian ‘‘dead hand’’ system, ‘‘where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,’’ it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">S</span></span>tates’’ [10]. Israeli leaders and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it would retaliate with the suicidal ‘‘Samson option’’ against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even ‘‘anti-Semitic’’ European cities [10]. In that case, of course, Russia would retaliate, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of nuclear warheads, many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, would rain upon most of the major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radioactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations in a nuclear winter that could last as long as a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well. And <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on. Any accident, mistaken communication, false signal or ‘‘lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason could, in a matter of a few minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons, and once a weapon is used, then the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high</span></span> while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is actually less probable since <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">each country would act under the ‘‘use them or lose them’’ strategy and psychology</span></span>; restraint by one power would be interpreted as a weakness by the other, which could be exploited as a window of opportunity to ‘‘win’’ the war. In other words, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">once Pandora’s Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them.</span></span> Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, ‘‘everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors’’ [10]. In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">once even just one is used, it is very likely that many, if not all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of much of human civilization while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter</span></span>. </span>b.

If it is a war against extremists and militancy inside Pakistan, it is a civil war because its origins stem from the US, NATO occupation of neighboring Afghanistan. The conflict should be seen as an extension of the ongoing resistance of the Afghan people to alien domination. It is inaccurate to say that the US invaded Afghanistan because of the 9/11 attacks by Al-Qaeda. Former BBC correspondent George Arney reported on September 18, 2001, that Niaz Naik, the former Pakistani foreign secretary, had told him that he was informed by US officials at a UN-sponsored international contact group on Afghanistan in Berlin during July that year that unless Osama bin Laden were handed over swiftly, America would take military action to kill or capture both Bin Laden and Mullah Omar. The wider objective, however, was to topple the Taliban regime and install a transitional government under King Mohammad Zahir Shah. The invasion was to take place in mid-October 2001. Mr. Naik went on to say that he doubted that the US would have abandoned its plan to invade Afghanistan even if Osama were handed over by the Taliban. Arney's story is corroborated by the Guardian correspondent David Leigh in his report published on September 26, 2001, in which he revealed that the Taliban had received specific warning by the US through secret diplomacy in Berlin in July that the Bush Administration would topple the entire regime militarily unless Osama is extradited to the US. This was part of the larger design of US military, industrial complex to bring about regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran. As the US needed bases in Pakistan to accomplish its pre-planned invasion of Afghanistan, the Bush Administration sought to use Islamabad as a cat's paw to pull the chestnuts out of the fire. Fortunately for President Bush, a usurper ruled there, devoid of all legitimacy, legal and moral, and he readily and willingly succumbed to US pressure and made a U-turn by severing all links with the Taliban. He even joined the war against Afghanistan instead of using his leverage with the Taliban to exhaust all means of peaceful settlement of the dispute. The entire region, including Pakistan, was declared a war zone by the US military command, and the flights of all passenger planes were prohibited over a certain altitude, while no merchant ships could enter the harbors of Pakistan, thus bringing maritime trade (which comprises approximately 95 percent of Pakistan's import-export trade) to a standstill. It is no wonder that Pakistan suffered a loss of 34 billion dollars because of its involvement in the Afghan war. America's War As one can see, it was America's war that was imposed upon Pakistan. Whether Pakistan could have avoided the war is a matter of controversy among politicians and political observers. But the war has fuelled insurgency in Pakistan's hitherto peaceful tribal territory adjacent to Afghanistan. This insurgency shows no sign of abatement, as terrorist attacks on military and civilian centers in the capital and major cities of the North-West Frontier Province and Punjab continue with a vengeance, posing threat to the security of the state. In the meantime, routine predator strikes by the US in Waziristan have taken a heavy toll of civilian lives amid accusations of Islamabad's complicity in the piratical attacks on tribespeople, which prompts them to resort to retaliatory strikes on the perpetrators. Not satisfied with Pakistan's military operations in the tribal region, the US Administration has compelled Islamabad's fragile government to pull out its troops from the tense Indo-Pak border and deploy them in the restive tribal belt along the Pak-Afghan border. Now Pakistan faces existential threat from the Taliban and not India, a perception which the country's military leadership is not prepared to share, given the unresolved disputes with New Delhi, which triggered four wars during the last 62 years. At the same time, speculation (not entirely unfounded) is rife about the involvement of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and the former Blackwater (now christened Xe Services) in murder, mayhem, and gunrunning as evidenced by the armed Americans who drive consulate vehicles through cities and, when intercepted, refuse to disclose their identity. It is here that one recalls with dismay the role of General Stanley McChrystal, who until last year headed the Joint Special Operations Command, which runs drone attacks and targeted assassinations with the assistance of the operatives of the former Blackwater. This was revealed by Jeremy Scahill's investigative report published in the US weekly the Nation. That may, perhaps, solve the mystery surrounding a series of assassinations of ulama belonging to various Islamic movements. The sinister motive behind such acts of terror is to incite sectarian violence in Pakistan and lay the blame at the doors of religious extremists. Similar death squads were organized by the CIA in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to carry out political assassinations of nationalists who were opposed to US intervention. At the time, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua complained to the International Court of Justice about the mining of Nicaraguan ports, the violation of the country's airspace, the killing and kidnapping of individuals on the Nicaraguan territory, and the threat or use of force by the US. The court in its decision in June 1986 held that the US was in breach of the customary rules of international law and international humanitarian law. The above case is titled the &quot;Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua.&quot; The precedent set by this case may be invoked by Pakistan to prevent the US drone attacks on its territory. Once the piratical attacks of the US have stopped, the irritant in the tribal insurgency would have gone, paving the way for pacification of the conflict. If this were Pakistan's war, the government would have exercised its own judgment in dealing with the militants at home, either by conciliation or by resort to force. But Islamabad's so-called operation against militants is subordinated to US military designs in the region, aimed at the encirclement of the People's Republic of China and the control of the transit of gas pipelines from Central Asia to South Asia. It is not aimless that China expressed its concern over the concentration of US, NATO troops in the region. India fits in the American scheme of things, hence the US-India nuclear deal.<br />
Pakistan's National Interest In this emerging security environment, Pakistan will have to be content with its role as a junior partner of India. Therefore, the sooner Islamabad extricates itself from the US &quot;war on terror,&quot; the better it is for its security and independence. Doesn't Islamabad realize that its military operation against the militants would leave its border with India vulnerable to a New Delhi offensive? If Pakistan permits the US to attack the suspected training centers of militants on its territory, will it be able to prevent India from doing so? With Islamabad embroiled in internecine strife, it cannot negotiate with India from a position of strength. It may be forced to make a compromise that might be detrimental to its national interest. Pakistan's preoccupation with tribal rebellion would not permit it to deal with separatist ethnic forces in Baluchistan. Undoubtedly, this is a threat to the territorial integrity of Pakistan. After the total failure of the military operation in Baluchistan, the federal government has come round to the painful conclusion that political and not military action can bring militancy to an end. Granting general amnesty to the dissidents and engaging them in a meaningful dialogue on contentious issues is a laudable initiative. The same gesture should be made to the militants in the tribal areas. But Islamabad has adopted double standards in dealing with the Baluchistan militants and the Pashtun militants, as if there were good militants and bad ones. This discriminatory policy would intensify the Pashtun insurgency and might drive them toward even more escalation. The rulers have seen the consequences of military operations in the former East Pakistan, Baluchistan, Karachi, Sind, and FATA (federally administered tribal areas). If anything, the situation has only worsened. The surge of US troops, the expansion of war beyond the borders of Afghanistan, and the attacks on Quetta and Muridke as envisaged by Obama's new strategy would mean that US troops are at war with the people of Pakistan.<br />
Any Solution?<br />
The Obama Administration would be better advised to concentrate on its exit strategy, and to that end, it is imperative that it involve the UN in its peace-making efforts aimed at the establishment of a broad-based government in Afghanistan, because the Karzai Government has no legitimacy. To fill the vacuum, the UN peacekeeping force, made up of troops of states not involved in the Afghan war, may be deployed until a government of national unity is able to assume full responsibility. Here the US can contribute to the postwar reconstruction of Afghanistan under the aegis of the UN. The insurgency in the tribal region is the spillover effect of US military occupation of Afghanistan, but Pakistan faces a far greater threat: the threat of ethnic violence as manifested in the bloody clashes among various linguistic groups in urban and rural Sind. These have been overshadowed by the counterinsurgency operations in FATA, but they may erupt at any moment, thus destabilizing the state.<br />

But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with explosives into a jeep filled with troops today, killing five and wounding as many as 21, including several children who were waiting for a ride to school. Residents of the region where the attack took place are fleeing in terror as gunfire rings out around them, and government forces have been unable to quell the violence. Two regional government officials were beheaded by militants in retaliation for the killing of other militants by government forces. As familiar as this sounds, it did not take place where we have come to expect such terrible events. This, unfortunately, is a whole new ballgame. It is part of another conflict that is brewing, one which puts what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan in deep shade, and which represents a grave and growing threat to us all. Pakistan is now trembling on the edge of violent chaos, and is doing so with nuclear weapons in its hip pocket, right in the middle of one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world. The situation in brief: Pakistan for years has been a nation in turmoil, run by a shaky government supported by a corrupted system, dominated by a blatantly criminal security service, and threatened by a large fundamentalist Islamic population with deep ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan. All this is piled atop an ongoing standoff with neighboring India that has been the center of political gravity in the region for more than half a century. The fact that Pakistan, and India, and Russia, and China all possess nuclear weapons and share the same space means any ongoing or escalating violence over there has the real potential to crack open the very gates of Hell itself.<br />

Recently, the Taliban made a military push into the northwest Pakistani region around the Swat Valley. According to a recent Reuters report: The (Pakistani) army deployed troops in Swat in October 2007 and used artillery and gunship helicopters to reassert control. But insecurity mounted after a civilian government came to power last year and tried to reach a negotiated settlement. A peace accord fell apart in May 2008. After that, hundreds — including soldiers, militants and civilians — died in battles. Militants unleashed a reign of terror, killing and beheading politicians, singers, soldiers and opponents. They banned female education and destroyed nearly 200 girls' schools. About 1,200 people were killed since late 2007 and 250,000 to 500,000 fled, leaving the militants in virtual control. Pakistan offered on February 16 to introduce Islamic law in the Swat valley and neighboring areas in a bid to take the steam out of the insurgency. The militants announced an indefinite cease-fire after the army said it was halting operations in the region. President Asif Ali Zardari signed a regulation imposing sharia in the area last month. But the Taliban refused to give up their guns and pushed into Buner and another district adjacent to Swat, intent on spreading their rule. The United States, already embroiled in a war against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, must now face the possibility that Pakistan could collapse under the mounting threat of Taliban forces there. Military and diplomatic advisers to President Obama, uncertain how best to proceed, now face one of the great nightmare scenarios of our time. &quot;Recent militant gains in Pakistan,&quot; reported The New York Times on Monday, &quot;have so alarmed the White House that the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, described the situation as 'one of the very most serious problems we face.'&quot; &quot;Security was deteriorating rapidly,&quot; reported The Washington Post on Monday, &quot;particularly in the mountains along the Afghan border that harbor al-Qaeda and the Taliban, intelligence chiefs reported, and there were signs that those groups were working with indigenous extremists in Pakistan's populous Punjabi heartland. The Pakistani government was mired in political bickering. The army, still fixated on its historical adversary India, remained ill-equipped and unwilling to throw its full weight into the counterinsurgency fight. But despite the threat the intelligence conveyed, Obama has only limited options for dealing with it. Anti-American feeling in Pakistan is high, and a U.S. combat presence is prohibited. The United States is fighting Pakistan-based extremists by proxy, through an army over which it has little control, in alliance with a government in which it has little confidence.&quot; It is believed <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Pakistan is currently in possession of between 60 and 100 nuclear weapons</span></span>. Because Pakistan's stability is threatened by the wide swath of its population that shares ethnic, cultural and religious connections to the fundamentalist Islamic populace of Afghanistan, fears over what could happen to those nuclear weapons if the Pakistani government collapses are very real. &quot;As the insurgency of the Taliban and Al Qaeda spreads in Pakistan,&quot; reported the Times last week, &quot;senior American officials say they are increasingly concerned about new vulnerabilities for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, including the potential for militants to snatch a weapon in transport or to insert sympathizers into laboratories or fuel-production facilities. In public, the administration has only hinted at those concerns, repeating the formulation that the Bush administration used: that it has faith in the Pakistani Army. But that cooperation, according to officials who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity surrounding the exchanges between Washington and Islamabad, has been sharply limited when the subject has turned to the vulnerabilities in the Pakistani nuclear infrastructure.&quot; &quot;The prospect of turmoil in Pakistan sends shivers up the spines of those U.S. officials charged with keeping tabs on foreign nuclear weapons,&quot; reported Time Magazine last month. &quot;Pakistan is thought to possess about 100 — the U.S. isn't sure of the total, and may not know where all of them are. Still, if Pakistan collapses, the U.S. military is primed to enter the country and secure as many of those weapons as it can, according to U.S. officials. Pakistani officials insist their personnel safeguards are stringent, but a sleeper cell could cause big trouble, U.S. officials say.&quot; In other words, a shaky Pakistan spells trouble for everyone, especially if America loses the footrace to secure those weapons in the event of the worst-case scenario. If Pakistani militants ever succeed in toppling the government, several very dangerous events could happen at once. Nuclear-armed India could be galvanized into military action of some kind, as could nuclear-armed China or nuclear-armed Russia. If the Pakistani government does fall, and all those Pakistani nukes are not immediately accounted for and secured, the specter (or reality) of loose nukes falling into the hands of terrorist organizations could place the entire world on a collision course with unimaginable disaster. We have all been paying a great deal of attention to Iraq and Afghanistan, and rightly so. The developing situation in Pakistan, however, needs to be placed immediately on the front burner. The Obama administration appears to be gravely serious about addressing the situation. So should we all.<br />

AND ONLY c/t solves- conflation of COIN and CT prove that its impossible to end the terrorist threat with both<br />

<br />
This episode indicates the extent of the confusion over counterterrorism (CT) and counterinsurgency (COIN) that marks the contemporary debate over Afghanistan. Both CT and COIN would envisage military action in Afghanistan, but to very different ends. A CT mission would focus exclusively on Al-Qaeda while offering little or no support to the Karzai government; a COIN mission envisages a comprehensive commitment to defeating the Taleban and rebuilding the Afghan state while destroying Al-Qaeda operatives there. Yet it has now become commonplace for politicians and military officials alike to mention CT and COIN in the same breath, or to treat them as if they were functionally equivalent. The official US government definition now frames counterterrorism in classic ‘hearts and minds’ counterinsurgency language: ‘actions taken directly against terrorist networks and indirectly to influence and render global and regional environments inhospitable to terrorist networks’.12 Terrorist threats are now regularly described as insurgencies and vice versa. The influential <em>US Army and Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual</em> states that ‘today’s operational environment also includes a new kind of insurgency, one which seeks to impose revolutionary change worldwide. Al-Qaeda is a well known example of such an insurgency.’13 An official from US Central Command (CENTCOM), for instance, has gone so far to define counterterrorism as a ‘whole of government COIN’ approach.14 Meanwhile, insurgent threats in places such as Chechnya, Indonesia and Thailand are now regularly redescribed as terrorist threats, as analysts speculate on whether local conflicts will become magnets for Al-Qaeda or otherwise spill out into acts of horrific violence on the international stage.<br />
This confusion over the differences between counterterrorism and counterinsurgency is not new, but it has become more serious over the last eight years.15 Since the events of September 11, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">these concepts have regularly been conflated as policy-makers have struggled to come to grips with the threat posed by Al-Qaeda</span></span>. To some extent, this is natural: <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Al-Qaeda is a global terrorist organization which intervenes directly in local conflicts</span></span> (often insurgencies, defined here as organized violent attempts to overthrow an existing government) <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">to bait the US and its allies into exhausting wars of attrition. </span></span>In other words, it is a terrorist organization which dabbles (sometimes successfully, sometimes less so) in insurgencies. But the fact that the threats of terrorism and insurgency are so often intertwined in contemporary conflicts does not make them fundamentally equivalent or susceptible to the same remedies. Nor does it warrant extending counterinsurgency operations on a global level, as some prominent authors have suggested.16 The fusion of the threats from terrorism and insurgency, so often described as symptomatic of the complexity of the modern security challenges, can be misread to imply that the responses to them should be similar or equivalent. In fact, while intermixed in practice, these threats remain distinct, and require a policy response which disaggregates and prioritizes threats and separates those actors who have a negotiable political programme from those who remain incorrigible.<br />
Similarly, the fact that terrorists and insurgents operate in the same theatre, and in some cases function in tandem, is not an argument for a response that seamlessly interweaves elements of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency. Indeed, there is no reason to assume that counterterrorism and counterinsurgency strategies are fully compatible or mutually reinforcing. The record of the war in Afghanistan suggests rather that both models of warfare involve tradeoffs or costs that may offset the gains made by the other. Unless these tradeoffs are properly managed, the simultaneous deployment of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations may operate at cross-purposes and make long-term strategic success more elusive. The fact that US and UK leaders have been so willing to split the difference between counterterrorism and counterinsurgency—and to ignore the offsetting costs of each—may help to account for the current painful stalemate in Afghanistan.<br />
This article will argue that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">counterterrorism and counterinsurgency are two distinct models of war which can operate at cross-purposes when jointly applied to</span></span> low-intensity conflicts such as that in <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Afghanistan</span></span>. The conflation of these two different models of warfare stems from an intellectual error, which assumes that a fused threat (for example, between a nationalist insurgent group like the Taleban and a transnational terrorist group like Al-Qaeda) must necessarily be met by a joint or blended counterterrorism and counterinsurgency approach. In fact, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">these two models of warfare involve divergent assumptions about the roles of force, the importance of winning support among the local population, and the necessity of building a strong and representative government</span></span>. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Such approaches are not</span></span> necessarily mutually reinforcing or even <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">compatible</span></span>. At the tactical and strategic level, there are at least four possible offsetting costs—<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">popular backlash, countermobilization of enemy networks, a legitimacy gap and diminished leverage</span></span>—that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">may be incurred when counterterrorism and counterinsurgency are deployed simultaneously</span></span>. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">At the political level, the conflation of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency risks producing an overly interventionist foreign policy which distracts and exhausts the US</span></span> and UK <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">as they treat an ever-increasing number of localized insurgencies as the incubators of future terrorist threats</span></span>.<br />

2010 is the key year for Russia to expand its sphere of influence and consolidate power over the region – pulling out of Afghanistan allows the US to contain Russian expansion<br />

Well <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">2010 will be a period of consolidation for Russia. It now has a sphere of influence that stretches into the Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan. </span></span>Putin once said that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical disaster in 20th century history. He also said he had no intention of rebuilding that political union. The former statement was true; but we are seeing signs that the latter was just rhetoric. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Putin does have political designs over the states of the f</span></span>ormer<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"> S</span></span>oviet <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">U</span></span>nion – the Customs Union that has just entered into force between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan is the clearest example of this. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">His intention will be to </span></span>eventually <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">integrate them into a new Russian political union</span></span> for it is the next logical step in Russia’s resurgence. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">A customs union is designed to reintegrate the industrial and strategic economic sectors of the old Soviet grid. Mutual economic benefits will flow from this and former Soviet states</span></span> outside it <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">will find it incredibly appealing</span></span> to join (or Russia will make them ‘an offer they cannot refuse’). Once integration is done the weaker states of the customs union have two options - resist political integration while maintaining economic connections (a delicate balancing act), or politically integrate. What is interesting here are the analogies we can take from the EU experience. The EU economic project is intended by French and German elites to eventually create a European superpower. But to do so requires the smaller states to become subservient to the national interests of the larger members (and these interests often diverge). Absent a serious external threat it becomes very hard for the smaller states to convince their populations they should become a tool in a larger, potentially global, geopolitical game the French and German want to gain entry into. This becomes even more difficult when the smaller states are democratic - as we've seen with the referendums in Ireland and eventual acceptance of the watered down 'Lisbon Treaty' instead of the 'Constitutional Treaty'. The states Russia wants to pull back into a political union are not stable and established democracies. Therefore the elites of these states do not need to submit themselves to the will of their population. Furthermore, if joining Russia in a new political union guarantees their monopoly of power (since the Kremlin gains an interest in bolstering these elites) they will be far more willing to go along with it. In a way, former Soviet states will sue for what they can; but take what they must. The reality is that most of them are already economically dependent upon Russia anyway. Furthermore Russia’s great power relative to them means they cannot realistically resist Russian expansion anyway because, as Ukraine, Belarus and Georgia all found out, if you disagree with the political designs of the Kremlin Putin can simply shut off the gas, close down a border, deny them primary goods, or, should need be, smash them with its far superior military power (as Georgia found out). It is the will to use power that makes others fearful and compels them to accommodate one’s interests; not the existence of power itself. Putin has shown time and time again the will to use Russia’s power against its neighbours. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">For the elites in states adjacent to Russia (and their populations) the message is clear: align with Moscow or face the consequences</span></span>. As a consequence the next state to fall back into Moscow’s camp will be Ukraine after its upcoming elections. Obama and the Afghan Surge <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">American military power is going to be absolutely bogged down</span></span> in the Middle East <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">throughout 2010. Obama seems to be escalating the conflict</span></span> for political and diplomatic reasons: US presidents cannot just declare failure and retreat – it’s not in the DNA of the American political system. They have 'to show' that they will fight 'the bad guys' as hard as they can before they can make the rational decision to remove American military power. But <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Obama </span></span>has <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">announced </span></span>that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the surge </span></span>in Afghan <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">is temporary</span></span>. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The 'pull-out' begins in 2011</span></span>. Meanwhile the US will be drawing down troops from Iraq (which is set for an extremely unstable year). This means that, all going to plan, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">by sometime in 2011 American troops should be in reserve and available to be deployed to counter the Russians </span></span>or to any other hotspot<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">. But the Russians know </span></span>this and <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">it gives them one year - 2010 - to completely lock down their influence and eject any remnants of American or European influence</span></span>. Whether they entirely succeed or not is beside the point; <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">by the end of 2010 any move to remove them from their position will have to be momentous</span></span> and overt. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">At the same time whatever Obama's plans may be they are not really his to make, for there are simply too many players now involved in the Middle Eastern cesspool of crises. The most important in the coming year will be the one centred upon Iran. An Escalating Crisis 2009 saw an escalation in the Iranian-American standoff over its nuclear program. Firstly, Obama and co. released proof of a covert Iranian nuclear plant followed by a series of highly significant leaks that seemed to show the Iranians were driving towards nuclear weapons. But this crisis also became consumed by the Russo-American standoff as Russian support for Iran became overt as it seeks to use Iran as a bargaining chip. But the outcome of the crisis is also dependent upon the calculations of Israel. If they actually believe that a nuclear Iran is an 'existential threat' they will have to act against is before it attains nuclear weapons, or at least show America they will act unless it gets tough on Iran. However, for America 'to act' short of war it needs Russian help to impose sanctions. Thus far Russia has given vague signals that it will help if the price is right. The price being American acquiescence to a new Russian political sphere of influence around it’s near abroad (which it already has). Obama and Biden have declared that they will not do this owing to Russia's declining long term geopolitical position (although its power is growing in the short term). Biden, on a trip to Eastern Europe last year, even went so far to announce the Obama's administrations intentions to support efforts by US-friendly governments in the region to counter Russia's push. That means end-game for any Russo-American alignment on Iranian sanctions. At the same time Obama is escalating a war in Afghanistan and needs all the help from regional powers to 'win' this thing - even Iran. If America can accept the inevitability of a nuclear Iran and even the eventual hegemonic domination by Iran over parts of the Middle East and Gulf region then America can do a 'deal' with it whereby it would gain Iranian help to suppress the multiple crises in the Middle East. This would allow the US to drawdown military forces and reorient them back to the greater geopolitical enemy - Russiaru. Therefore Russia has an interest in keeping Iran close and ensuring that a rapprochement between Iran and the US remains impossible. </span></span><br />

Russian expansionism triggers prolif and accidental launch- leads to extinction<br />
Stephen J. Blank 9 [strategic Studies Institute's expert on the Soviet bloc and the post-Soviet world since 1989; former Associate Professor of Soviet Studies at the Center for Aerospace Doctrine, Research, and Education, Maxwell Air Force Base; B.A. in History from the University of Pennsylvania, and a M.A. and Ph.D. in History from the University of Chicago, March 09. “<span style="text-transform: uppercase;">RUSSIA AND ARMS CONTROL: ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION?”] </span><br />
Proliferators or nuclear states like China and Russia can then deter regional or intercontinental attacks either by denial or by threat of retaliation.168 Given a multipolar world structure with little ideological rivalry among major powers, it is unlikely that they will go to war with each other. Rather, like Russia, they will strive for exclusive hegemony in their own “sphere of influence” and use nuclear instruments towards that end. However, wars may well break out between major powers and weaker “peripheral” states or between peripheral and semiperipheral states given their lack of domestic legitimacy, the absence of the means of crisis prevention, the visible absence of crisis management mechanisms, and their strategic calculation that asymmetric wars might give them the victory or respite they need.169 Simultaneously, The states of periphery and semiperiphery have far more opportunities for political maneuvering. Since war remains a political option, these states may find it convenient to exercise their military power as a means for achieving political objectives. Thus international crises may increase in number. This has two important implications for the use of WMD. First, they may be used deliberately to offer a decisive victory (or in Russia’s case, to achieve “intra-war escalation control”—author170) to the striker, or for defensive purposes when imbalances 67 in military capabilities are significant; and second, crises increase the possibilities of inadvertent or accidental wars involving WMD.171 Obviously nuclear proliferators or states that are expanding their nuclear arsenals like Russia can exercise a great influence upon world politics if they chose to defy the prevailing consensus and use their weapons not as defensive weapons, as has been commonly thought, but as offensive weapons to threaten other states and deter nuclear powers. Their decision to go either for cooperative security and strengthened international military-political norms of action, or for individual national “egotism” will critically affect world politics. For, as Roberts observes, But if they drift away from those efforts [to bring about more cooperative security], the consequences could be profound. At the very least, the effective functioning of inherited mechanisms of world order, such as the special responsibility of the “great powers” in the management of the interstate system, especially problems of armed aggression, under the aegis of collective security, could be significantly impaired. Armed with the ability to defeat an intervention, or impose substantial costs in blood or money on an intervening force or the populaces of the nations marshaling that force, the newly empowered tier could bring an end to collective security operations, undermine the credibility of alliance commitments by the great powers, [undermine guarantees of extended deterrence by them to threatened nations and states] extend alliances of their own, and perhaps make wars of aggression on their neighbors or their own people.<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Failure in Afghanistan will cause NATO collapse </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Patrick, 09 - </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations (3/25/09, Stewart, The National Interest, “Out of Area, Out of Business?” </span></span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=21148" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=21148</a>)<br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">On April 3, the leaders of history’s most successful multilateral alliance will gather in Strasbourg, France. NATO confronts an existential crisis in Afghanistan, which has become a test of its utility in the twenty-first century. If it fails there, it risks fading into irrelevance. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Today, fifty-five thousand troops from thirty-eight nations—including twenty-three thousand from the United States—are fighting under NATO’s banner. (Another twenty thousand fall under a separate U.S. command as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.) </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">President Obama will soon announce the results of a two-month strategic review of U.S. Afghan policy. The administration will embrace a ramped-up counterinsurgency effort, beginning with seventeen thousand more U.S. troops. The success of this “made in the USA” strategy, however, will require an international unity of effort. Unfortunately, America’s allies remain divided on some fundamental issues. Before the Strasbourg summit, NATO needs to answer the following questions. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Whose war is this? In 2002, German Defense Minister Peter Struck memorably declared that the defense of Germany began in the Hindu Kush. This unity of purpose has since evaporated. Public support for the war is plunging across most NATO countries, and even previously committed nations like Canada and the Netherlands plan to reduce their military presence. Allied governments have placed more than seventy “national caveats” on involvement in combat operations—content, as British Defense Secretary John Hutton has noted, to “freeload” on the U.S. military. The Strasbourg summit must clarify whether this is still NATO’s war—or just America’s. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">What is the end state? President Obama has wisely dialed down the sweeping rhetoric of the Bush administration, which created unrealistic expectations about what the international community could hope to accomplish in Afghanistan. As the president concedes, Afghanistan is unlikely to emerge soon as a prosperous, effective democratic nation. What Obama has not done is to communicate a desired end state there, beyond the minimalist goal of depriving al-Qaeda of a safe haven. Some NATO allies, as well as the United Nations and World Bank, remain committed to long-term state-building as a solution to chronic Afghan insecurity and abysmal governance, but Washington appears to be moving in the opposite direction. The Strasbourg summit must define a realistic trajectory for the mission through 2020 that the international community can support. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">What is the mission? The lack of a clear end state makes it even harder to reach consensus on what NATO’s mission should be, to say nothing of the appropriate division of labor in fulfilling it. Washington’s emerging strategy envisions a robust counterinsurgency campaign to separate the Afghan population from the Taliban, targeted counterterrorist operations against al-Qaeda, and a vigorous counternarcotics effort to cut the taproots of corruption and violence. Few U.S. allies are enthusiastic about these tasks, preferring to focus on traditional peacekeeping and reconstruction. Washington and its partners need to agree on the right balance among these diverse activities—and national responsibilities for carrying them out. If Europeans decline to fight, they must be prepared to “surge” on the civilian side, deploying aid and experts to train Afghan security forces and address the country’s glaring governance and economic gaps. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">What is the political process? History—not least the Vietnam experience—suggests that no counterinsurgency strategy can rescue an illegitimate and dysfunctional regime. Insurgencies can only be defeated politically, not militarily. Unfortunately, President Hamid Karzai and the entire Afghan government are increasingly reviled by the population, thanks to the impunity enjoyed by powerful warlords and the corrupting impact of the drug trade. NATO must advance a realistic political strategy to complement its military one. One essential prong in this approach is demanding better Afghan government performance in fighting corruption. Another is supporting Afghan-led negotiations with “moderate” Taliban. NATO allies must speak with one voice on both of these contentious issues. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">What can be done about Pakistan? Finally, NATO must adopt a common approach to Pakistan, where Taliban leaders continue to find sanctuary and fertile ground for recruiting foot soldiers. The Afghan insurgency will only end when Pakistan eliminates the Taliban’s havens, not only in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, but also in Baluchistan. And yet many NATO allies, fearing entanglement in Pakistan’s political troubles, would prefer to treat the International Security Assistance Force mission as a purely Afghan affair. To broaden NATO’s horizons, Washington should champion and seek allied support for a regional approach, one that gives Pakistan assurances of its territorial integrity in return for cracking down on sanctuaries and infiltration. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">When the cold war ended two decades ago, the alliance was told to go “out of area or out of business.” Like it or not, NATO’s continued relevance depends on whether it can address the challenges of irregular warfare and the dilemmas of failed states. If the alliance rises to the occasion in Afghanistan, it will remain a pillar of U.S. and international security. If it fails to do so, NATO—having gone out of area—may also go out of business. </span></span><br />

Collapse of NATO causes immediate instability that escalates to superpower nuclear war<br />

Some of those ideas--notably, dissolution and &quot;standing pat&quot;--were never likely to be implemented. Quite apart from the sociological law that says organizations never go out of business even if their main aim has been achieved (the only exception being a slightly ominous one, the Committee for the Free World, which Midge Decter closed down after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact), <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">NATO's essential aim has not been permanently achieved</span></span>. True, the Soviet threat is gone; but <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">a nuclear-armed and potentially unstable Russia is still in the game</span></span>; a major conflict has just been fought in the very Balkans which sparked the First World War; and <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">there are a number of potential wars and civil wars lurking</span></span> in such regions as the Tyrol, the Basque country, Northern Ireland (not yet finally settled), Corsica, Belgium, Kosovo, and Eastern Europe and the Balkans generally where, it is said, &quot; every England has its Ireland, and every Ireland its Ulster.&quot; <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">If none of these seems to threaten the European peace very urgently</span></span> at present, <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">that is</span></span> in part <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">because the existence of NATO makes any such threat futile</span></span> and even counter-productive. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">No nation</span></span> or would-be nation <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">wants to take NATO on</span></span>. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">And if not NATO, what</span></span>?

But neither body has the military heft or the prestige to deter or repress serious strife. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The OSCE is a collective security organization</span></span>, and as Henry Kissinger said of a similar body: &quot;<span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">When all participants agree, there is no need for it; when they split, it is useless</span></span>.&quot; And <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the EU only made itself look ridiculous when it attempted to halt the Bosnian conflict</span></span> in its relatively early stages when a decisive intervention might have succeeded. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">As for dealing with a revived Russian threat, there is no military alliance in sight other than NATO that could do the job</span></span>. In a sense, <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">NATO today is Europe's defense</span></span>. Except for the American forces, <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Western armies</span></span> can no longer play an independent military role. They <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">are wedded to NATO structures and dependent on NATO, especially American, technology</span></span>. (As a French general admitted in the Gulf War: &quot;The Americans are our eyes and ears.&quot;) <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">If NATO were to dissolve--even if it were to be replaced by some European collective defense organization</span></span> such as a beefed-up Western European Union--<span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">it would invite chaos as every irredentist faction sought to profit from the sudden absence of the main guarantor of European stability</span></span>.<br />

<strong><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">COIN shreds our foreign policy priorities—includes resources for diplomacy and climate change</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Cohen 11/30/09 </span></strong>- Michael, senior research fellow at the New America Foundation, New York Daily News, &quot; Mother of all decisions: If Obama escalates in Afghanistan, he'll set back ... &quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2009/11/30/2009-11-30_the_mother_of_all_decisions.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2009/11/30/2009-11-30_the_mother_of_all_decisions.html</a><br />
<br />
Sending from 30,000 to 40,000 troops to that tumultuous nation will likely wreak havoc on Obama's broader first-term foreign policy agenda - consuming resources, sucking up time and attention, and ultimately subverting his larger foreign policy goals. In August, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/National+Intelligence+Council" rel="nofollow">National Intelligence Council</a> Chairman <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/John+Brennan" rel="nofollow">John Brennan</a> declared that under Obama, &quot;the fight against terrorists and violent extremists has been returned to its right and proper place: no longer defining - indeed, distorting - our entire national security and foreign policy, but rather serving as a vital part of those larger policies.&quot; But the military commitment endorsed by President Obama would have the reverse effect - officially making stabilization in Afghanistan and the war against <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Al+Qaeda" rel="nofollow">Al Qaeda</a> and the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/The+Taliban" rel="nofollow">Taliban</a> the President's top priority. For example, one of the most serious challenges facing the country's national security bureaucracy - one Obama and Secretary of State Clinton have expressed serious concern about in the past - is the skewed balance between resources for our military and civilian agencies. Nearly everyone in the foreign policy community agrees that both State and the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/U.S.+Agency+for+International+Development" rel="nofollow">U.S. Agency for International Development</a> are badly under-resourced. But with Obama's likely troop increase in Afghanistan, agencies like the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/U.S.+Department+of+State" rel="nofollow">State Department</a> and USAID will see their dwindling capacity devoted to assisting the military as opposed to the long-term diplomacy and development work that can further <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/United+States" rel="nofollow">U.S.</a> interests in places not named Afghanistan or <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Pakistan" rel="nofollow">Pakistan</a>. The civilian-military balance will only become further skewed. And if the administration requests $100 billion a year for the war in Afghanistan, in the face of looming budget deficits, what are the chances Congress will loosen its purse strings further for two underappreciated foreign policy agencies? Finally, Obama and his advisers will be pressed in devoting their attention and political capital to other foreign policy matters, whether it's pushing for a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, organizing an international coalition to confront the Iranian nuclear program or hammering out international agreements on climate change and trade. It's never easy for Presidents and their advisers to proverbially &quot;walk and chew gum at the same time,&quot; and having 100,000 troops in Afghanistan will make it that much harder. But above all, Obama's goal of changing America's mind-set from the belief that there is a military solution to every national security challenge will be dealt a defining and perhaps fatal blow - and in the end, that is probably the most important reason why troop levels in Afghanistan matter and why the President should think twice. The opportunity costs will be profound, and Obama will risk becoming the one thing he likely did not want to be: a war President. As he prepares to announce a decision that will define his presidency, Obama would be wise to consider the words of one of his predecessors in the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/The+White+House" rel="nofollow">Oval Office</a>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Lyndon+Johnson" rel="nofollow">Lyndon Johnson</a>, who after leaving office told a biographer, &quot;History provided too many cases where the sound of the bugle put an immediate end to the hopes and dreams of the best reformers.&quot; No doubt Obama knows what ultimately happened to Johnson's policy agenda - and his presidency.<br />

Global Warming causes the Earth to explode<br />
Chalko 2k2 (THOMAS J. CHALKO---GEO PHYSICIST @ MT. BEST ACADEMY AUSTRALIA <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4936:http://www.bioresonant.com/news.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bioresonant.com/news.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bioresonant.com/news.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4936 -->, “Global Warming: Can Earth EXPLODE ?”)<br />
The real danger for our entire civilization comes not from slow climate changes, but from overheating the planetary interior. Galileo discovered that Earth moves. Copernicus discovered that Earth moves around the Sun. In 2000 Tom Chalko, inspired by Desmarquet's report, discovered that the solid nucleus of our planet is in principle a nuclear reactor, it is eccentric, and that our collective ignorance may cause it to overheat and explode. The discovery has been published in June 2001 by the new scientific journal NUJournal.net. Polar ice caps melt not because the air there is warmer than 0 deg Celsius, but because they are overheated from underneath. Volcanoes become active and erupt violently not because the Earth's interior &quot;crystallizes&quot;, but because the planetary nucleus is a nuclear fission reactor that needs COOLING. It seems that the currently adopted doctrine of a &quot;crystalline inner core of Earth&quot; is more dangerous for humanity than all weapons of mass destruction taken together, because it prevents us from imagining, predicting and preventing truly global disasters. In any nuclear reactor, the danger of overheating has to be recognized early. When external symptoms intensify it is usually too late to prevent disaster. Do we have enough imagination, intelligence and integrity to comprehend the danger before the situation becomes irreversible? It seems that if we do not do anything today about Greenhouse Emissions that cause the entire atmosphere to trap more Solar Heat, we may not survive the next decade. In a systematically under-cooled spherical core reactor the cumulative cause-effect relationship is hyperbolic and leads to explosion. It seems that there will be no second chance... If you doubt whether a planet can explode - you need to see a witness report of a planetary explosion in our Solar system. Plato (428-348 BC) reported that the explosion of the planet Phaeton had been perceived by our ancestors on Earth to be as bright as lightning... The last few years were the WARMEST ever recorded on Earth. The trend continues. Huge parts of Antarctic and Arctic ice have already melted. Key Antarctic glaciers (Hektoria, Green and Evans for example) increased their melting rate 8 times in 3 years (between 2000 and 2003, Geophys. Res. Lett., 31, L18401). When glaciers begin to slide to the ocean, the sea level rise will cause not only tsunamis but a global planetary flood. Volcanoes become active under Arctic Ocean and in Antarctica In the past, volcanic activity was followed by decades of dormancy. Today, when volcanoes erupt they remain active and the neighboring volcanoes erupt... The Largest Volcanoes on Earth have lost their snow-caps Oceans are warmer than ever. Their increased evaporation produces large amount of clouds, rain and widespread flooding Oceans around Antarctica at depths of 5 km are less salty and less dense confirming that Antarctica is melting from underneath. The fresh water is lighter than salt water, so it should be on top... In heated oceans all currents are severely disrupted Mountain glaciers melt around the globe The weather around the globe becomes more violent every month Trees begun to BLOOM in winter. Photos on the left show Australian blackwood trees blooming in August (Mt Best, Victoria). This is equivalent to European and USA trees blooming in February. Plants detect &quot;season&quot; by monitoring the soil temperature. Energy of earthquakes systematically increases. The graph on the left depicts the annual quake energy since record begun in 1973, computed on the basis of USGS scientific data from all quakes above 4.0 magnitude since 1973. The data is compared (scaled) to 1973 quake energy. The energy of earthuakes 7.0 and above increased 6 times in the same period... According to the current &quot;scientific&quot; dogmas, the planetary interior &quot;crystallizes&quot; and becomes less liquid as the time goes on. So, tectonic plate motion should become slower in time and quakes should become less frequent and less energetic. The evidence presented in the graph on the left demonstrates exactly the opposite. In the period of time when the planetary climate changed by a small fraction of one degree, earthquakes have become 5 times more energetic. I wonder why no one on Earth makes any notice of this? WHY ??? NASA measurements confirm (Science 308, 1431-1435) that Earth absorbs more energy from the Sun that it is able to reflect to space - about 0.85 MegaWatt per square kilometer more. Pollution increases daily and Solar activity is on the increase until 2012. Global increase in tectonic, volcanic and seismic activity seems certain. Have we reached the point of no return? Some people claim that the observable earthquake energy rise is due to &quot;improved equpiment&quot; and/or &quot;increasing the number of seismic stations&quot;. This claim cannot be true. Waves from large quakes travel around the globe and are detectable ANYWHERE. Since time of Cold War there is enough seismic stations on Earth to pin-point location of a nuclear explosion (a quake 4.0) within a few km. Increasing number of seismic stations and better equipment can only be responsible for the increase in the number of &quot;small&quot; quakes being detected. The global energy of &quot;small&quot; earthquakes (below 7.0) increased only by 40% since 1973. In contrast, the global energy of quakes 7.0 and above increased 6 times in the same period. This is not any theory. It is an observable FACT. What causes an 8-fold increase in Antarctic glacier melting in just 3 years? Sun does not deliver 8 times the energy under the Antarctic ice does it? Some scientists predict that effects of &quot;global warming&quot; will take many decades. Can they explain the increase of the melting rate of Antarctic glaciers 8 times in 3 years? Overheating of the fission heated planetary interior can...<br />

Finally, the US is ignoring the global commons. Global trade and finance, climate change, resource scarcities, and epidemics and disease jeopardise life on the planet far more insidiously and dangerously than Islamic terrorism. The US is the world's most indispensable power, to use Madeleine Albright's boast, in terms of global collective action. It must find its way back to these grand strategic challenges and not lose the woods for the trees. A US pullout will not be a cataclysm for India. For one thing, the US will no longer be so helpless before Pakistan, and its military aid might reduce significantly.

A rampant America, after the Cold War, was not always a progressive force, but at least it provided global leadership. Today, the world faces the possibility of an America riven politically, battered economically and shaken militarily, its forces rattled by the experience of asymmetric warfare. An unconfident America, with a waning sense of power and purpose, fighting an unwinnable war in Afghanistan, is not in India's or the world's interest.<br />

<strong><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Extinction</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Yu 9</span></strong>—Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science (Victoria, Human Extinction: The Uncertainty of Our Fate, 22 May 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/spring-2009/human-extinction-the-uncertainty-of-our-fate" rel="nofollow">http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/spring-2009/human-extinction-the-uncertainty-of-our-fate</a>)<br />
<em>A pandemic will kill off all humans.</em><br />
In the past, humans have indeed fallen victim to viruses. Perhaps the best-known case was the bubonic plague that killed up to one third of the European population in the mid-14th century (7). While vaccines have been developed for the plague and some other infectious diseases, new viral strains are constantly emerging — a process that maintains the possibility of a pandemic-facilitated human extinction. Some surveyed students mentioned AIDS as a potential pandemic-causing virus. It is true that scientists have been unable thus far to find a sustainable cure for AIDS, mainly due to HIV’s rapid and constant evolution. Specifically, two factors account for the virus’s abnormally high mutation rate: 1. HIV’s use of reverse transcriptase, which does not have a proof-reading mechanism, and 2. the lack of an error-correction mechanism in HIV DNA polymerase (8). Luckily, though, there are certain characteristics of HIV that make it a poor candidate for a large-scale global infection: HIV can lie dormant in the human body for years without manifesting itself, and AIDS itself does not kill directly, but rather through the weakening of the immune system. However, for more easily transmitted viruses such as influenza, the evolution of new strains could prove far more consequential. The simultaneous occurrence of antigenic drift (point mutations that lead to new strains) and antigenic shift (the inter-species transfer of disease) in the influenza virus could produce a new version of influenza for which scientists may not immediately find a cure. Since influenza can spread quickly, this lag time could potentially lead to a “global influenza pandemic,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (9). The most recent scare of this variety came in 1918 when bird flu managed to kill over 50 million people around the world in what is sometimes referred to as the Spanish flu pandemic. Perhaps even more frightening is the fact that only 25 mutations were required to convert the original viral strain — which could only infect birds — into a human-viable strain (10).<br />

<span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 41px;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">Complacency about the threat is perhaps the biggest obstacle to forging the urgent, in-depth international cooperation needed to secure nuclear stockpiles and reduce the danger of nuclear terrorism. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Many policymakers around the world continue to believe that it would take a Manhattan Project to make a nuclear bomb, that it would be almost impossible for terrorists to get the necessary nuclear material, and that the risk of terrorists getting and using a nuclear bomb is therefore vanishingly small</span></span>. The experience of finding that Iraq did not have nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons in 2003 has made many justifiably skeptical of other assertions about serious threats from such weapons. Unfortunately, <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">while no one can say precisely what the probability of nuclear terrorism is, the danger is very real</span></span>. Several unfortunate facts shape the risk the world faces. Some Terrorists are Seeking Nuclear Weapons <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Most terrorist groups are focused on small-scale violence</span></span> to attain local objectives. For them, the old adage that “terrorists want a lot of people watching, not a lot of people dead” holds true, and nuclear weapons are likely to be irrelevant or counterproductive for their goals. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">But a small set of terrorists with global ambitions and nihilistic visions clearly are eager to get and use a nuclear bomb</span></span>. Osama <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">bin Laden has called the acquisition of nuclear weapons</span></span> or other <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">weapons of mass destruction a “religious duty.”</span></span>1 For years, al Qaeda operatives have repeatedly expressed the desire to inflict a “Hiroshima” on the United States.2 <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Al Qaeda operatives have made repeated attempts to buy nuclear material for a nuclear bomb, or to recruit nuclear expertise.</span> </span>Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, for example, <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri met with two senior Pakistani nuclear scientists to discuss nuclear weapons.</span></span>3 Former CIA Director George Tenet reports that the two provided al Qaeda with a rough sketch of a nuclear bomb design, and that U.S. officials were so concerned about the activities of the “charity” they had established (whose board of directors also included a range of senior retired military officers, and which reportedly also offered nuclear weapons help to Libya) that President Bush directed him to fly to Pakistan and discuss the matter directly with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. 4 Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmoud, the more senior of the two, had long argued that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons rightfully belonged to the whole worldwide “ummah,” or Muslim community, and had advocated sharing nuclear weapons technology. 5 After the 9/11 attacks, intelligence agencies from the United States and other countries learned that <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">in the years leading up to the attacks, al Qaeda had a focused nuclear weapons program</span></span> managed by Abdel Aziz al-Masri (aka Ali Sayyid al- Bakri), an Egyptian explosives expert. The program reported directly to Zawahiri, as did al Qaeda’s anthrax efforts, its other major strategic-scale weapons of mass destruction program. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">This program reportedly got to the point of carrying out tests of conventional explosives for use in a nuclear bomb.6</span> </span>Al Qaeda’s nuclear efforts apparently continued after the disruptions the group faced following the overthrow of the Taliban government and the removal of al Qaeda’s Afghan sanctuary. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">In 2002-2003, U.S. intelligence received a “stream of reliable reporting” that the leadership of al Qaeda’s cell in Saudi Arabia was negotiating to purchase three objects they believed to be Russian “nuclear devices,” and that al Qaeda’s central leadership had approved the purchase if a Pakistani expert using his equipment confirmed that they were genuine</span></span>. (The actual nature of these “devices,” if they existed, the name of the Pakistani expert, and the type of equipment he was to use to examine the devices have never been learned.)7 At the same time these discussions were taking place, <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">bin Laden arranged for a radical Saudi cleric to issue a fatwa or religious ruling authorizing the use of nuclear weapons against American civilians</span></span>.8 The cleric who issued the fatwa was the “steady companion” of the al Qaeda operative leading the negotiations over the nuclear devices. 9 <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Before al Qaeda, the Japanese terror cult Aum Shinrikyo also made a concerted effort to get nuclear weapons.10 Chechen terrorists have certainly pursued the possibility of a radioactive “dirty bomb</span></span>,” <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">and there are at least suggestive indications that they also have pursued nuclear weapons— including two incidents of terrorists conducting reconnaissance at secret nuclear weapon storage sites</span></span>, confirmed by Russian officials. There are at least some indications that <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Pakistani groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba may also be interested</span></span>—<span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">a particularly troubling possibility given the deep past connections these groups have had with Pakistani security services, their ongoing cooperation with al Qaeda, and the example of in-depth cooperation on unconventional weapons provided by al Qaeda’s work with Jemaah Islamiyah on anthrax</span></span>.11 <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">With at least two groups going down this path in the last 15 years</span></span>, and possibly more, <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">there is no reason to expect that others will not do so in the future.</span></span> Some Terrorist Groups Might be Able to Make Crude Nuclear Bombs <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Repeated assessments</span></span> by the U.S. government and other governments <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">have concluded that</span></span> it is plausible that <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">a sophisticated terrorist group could make a crude nuclear explosive</span></span>—capable of destroying the heart of a major city—<span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">if they got enough plutonium or HEU.</span></span> A “gun-type” bomb made from HEU, in particular, is basically a matter of slamming two pieces of HEU together at high speed. An “implosion-type” bomb—in which precisely arranged explosives crush nuclear material to a much higher density, setting off the chain reaction—would be substantially more difficult for terrorists to accomplish, but is still plausible, particularly if they got knowledgeable help (as they have been actively attempting to do).12 <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">One study</span></span> by the now-defunct congressional Office of Technology Assessment <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">summarized</span></span> the technical reality: <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">“A small group of people, none of whom have ever had access to the classified literature, could possibly design and build a crude nuclear explosive device... Only modest machine-shop facilities that could be contracted for without arousing suspicion would be required</span></span>.”13 Indeed, <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">even before the revelations from Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence concluded that “fabrication of at least a ‘crude’ nuclear device was within al-Qa’ida’s capabilities</span></span>, if it could obtain fissile material.”14 It is important to understand that <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">making a crude</span></span>, unsafe, unreliable <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">bomb</span></span> of uncertain yield <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">that might be carried in the back of a large van is a dramatically simpler task than designing and building a safe, secure, reliable, and efficient weapon deliverable by a ballistic missile</span></span>, which a state might want to incorporate into its arsenal. Terrorists are highly unlikely to ever be able to make a sophisticated and efficient weapon, a task that requires a substantial nuclear weapons enterprise— but they may well be able to make a crude one. Their task would be easier if they managed to recruit experts with experience in key aspects of a national nuclear weapons program. Nuclear weapons themselves generally have substantial security measures and would be more difficult to steal than nuclear materials<span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">. If terrorists nevertheless managed to steal an assembled nuclear weapon from a state, there is a significant risk that they might figure out how to set it off</span></span>—though this, too, would in most cases be a difficult challenge for a terrorist group.15 Many modern U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons are equipped with sophisticated electronic locks, known in the United States as “permissive action links” or PALs, intended to make it difficult to detonate the weapon without inserting an authorized code, which terrorists might find very difficult to bypass. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Some weapons</span></span>, however, are either not equipped with PALs or <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">are equipped with older versions that lack some of the highestsecurity features</span></span> (such as “limited try” features that would permanently disable the weapon if the wrong code is inserted too many times or attempts are made to bypass the lock).16 Many nuclear weapons also have safety features designed to prevent the weapon from detonating unless it had gone through its expected flight to its target—such as intense acceleration followed by unpowered flight for a ballistic missile warhead—and these would also have to be bypassed, if they were present, for terrorists to be able to make use of an assembled nuclear weapon they acquired. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">If they could not figure out how to detonate a stolen weapon, terrorists might choose to remove its nuclear material and fashion a new bomb</span></span>. Some modern, highly efficient designs might not contain enough material for a crude, inefficient terrorist bomb; but multistage thermonuclear weapons, with nuclear material in both the “primary” (the fission bomb that sets off the fusion reaction) and the “secondary” (where the fusion takes place) probably would provide sufficient material. In any case, terrorists in possession of a stolen nuclear weapon would be in a position to make fearsome threats, for no one would know for sure whether they could set it off. Terrorists Might be Able to Get HEU or Plutonium Unfortunately, <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">there is also a real risk that terrorists could get the plutonium or HEU needed to make a nuclear bomb</span></span>. As described in more detail in the next chapter, <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">important weaknesses in nuclear security arrangements still exist in many countries</span></span>, creating weaknesses that outsider or insider thieves might exploit. And as discussed in the previous chapter, <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">theft of the essential ingredients of nuclear weapons is not a hypothetical worry but an ongoing reality—the IAEA has documented 18 cases of theft or loss or plutonium or HEU, confirmed by the states concerned</span></span>. HEU-fueled <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">research reactors</span></span>, for example, sometimes located on university campuses, often <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">have only the most minimal security measures in place</span></span>. Many have few or no armed guards; very loose arrangements (if any) to screen personnel before granting them access to the reactor and its nuclear material; few means to detect intruders until they are entering the nuclear material areas; and little revenue to pay for more substantial security arrangements. In some cases, the security in place amounts to little more than a night watchman and a chain-link fence. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">In</span></span> countries such as <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Pakistan, even substantial nuclear security systems are challenged by immense adversary threats, both from nuclear insiders</span></span>—some <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">with</span></span> a <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">demonstrated sympathy for Islamic extremists—and from outside attacks</span></span> that might include scores or hundreds of armed attackers. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">In Russia</span></span>, there have been dramatic improvements in security and accounting for nuclear materials since the early 1990s, and the most egregious security weaknesses—gaping holes in fences, lack of any detector to set off an alarm if plutonium or HEU is being removed—have been corrected, with U.S. and other assistance and Russia’s own efforts. But <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">significant risks remain, from insider corruption to weak nuclear security regulation</span></span>. In the end, all countries where these materials exist—including the United States—have more to do, and need to continually reassess their efforts, to ensure that the security and accounting measures they have in place are sufficient to meet the evolving threat. A nuclear security system not focused on continual improvement is likely to see its effectiveness decline over time as complacency sets in. Nuclear Smuggling Is Extremely Difficult to Interdict <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The nuclear material needed for a bomb is small and difficult to detect</span></span>. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Once such material has left the facility where it is supposed to be, it could be anywhere, and finding and recovering it poses an immense challenge</span></span>. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The plutonium re- quired</span></span> for an implosion-type nuclear bomb <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">would fit in a soda can</span></span>. The HEU required for the simplest type of nuclear bomb for terrorists to make, a less efficient “gun-type” bomb that slams two pieces of HEU together at high speed, is smaller than two two-liter bottles.17 The radiation from plutonium, and particularly from HEU, is weak and difficult to detect, particularly if the adversaries attempting to smuggle it use any significant amount of shielding. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The detectors that are being widely deployed throughout the world</span></span>— or even the more expensive Advanced Spectroscopic Portals (ASPs) that are being considered to replace them—<span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">would have little chance of detecting HEU metal if it had significant shielding</span></span>.18 (Plutonium’s radiation is more penetrating and easier to detect.) To date, only one of the successes in seizing stolen nuclear material reportedly included the material being detected by one of these detectors; the others were the result of police and intelligence efforts, often including participants in the conspiracy or people they were trying to convince to help them or to buy their stolen nuclear material informing the police.19 A crude terrorist nuclear bomb would be considerably larger than the plutonium or HEU at its core, perhaps weighing a ton or so. Nevertheless, just as interdicting smuggling of nuclear materials poses immense challenges, <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">it would also be extremely difficult to stop terrorists from smuggling a crude nuclear weapon to its target</span></span>. A nuclear bomb might be delivered, intact or in ready-to-assemble pieces, by boat or aircraft or truck. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The length of national borders, the diversity of means of transport, the vast scale of legitimate traffic across borders, and the ease of shielding the radiation from plutonium or especially from HEU all operate in favor of the terrorists</span></span>. Building the overall system of legal infrastructure, intelligence, law enforcement, border and customs forces, and radiation detectors needed to find and recover stolen nuclear weapons or materials, or to interdict these as they cross national borders, is an extraordinarily difficult challenge.20 </span></strong></span><br />

Ending counterinsurgency leads to Taliban takeover, risking Afghan and Pakistan Collapse, prolif, and nuclear war<br />
Kagan and Kagan, 9 - * former prof of military history @ West Point AND ** <em>military historian</em> (Fredrick W., Kimberly, <em>“</em>Don't Go Wobbly on Afghanistan”, 10/12/2009, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4958:http://www.aei.org/article/101110 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/article/101110" rel="nofollow">http://www.aei.org/article/101110</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4958 -->)<br />
<br />
It is very likely that the insurgency will grow in size and strength in 2010 faster than Afghan security forces can be developed without the addition of significant numbers of American combat troops.<br />
If the United States should adopt a small-footprint counterterrorism strategy, Afghanistan would descend again into civil war. The Taliban group headed by Mullah Omar and operating in southern Afghanistan (including especially Helmand, Kandahar, and Oruzgan Provinces) is well positioned to take control of that area upon the withdrawal of American and allied combat forces. The remaining Afghan security forces would be unable to resist a Taliban offensive. They would be defeated and would disintegrate. The fear of renewed Taliban assaults would mobilize the Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras in northern and central Afghanistan. The Taliban itself would certainly drive on Herat and Kabul, leading to war with northern militias. This conflict would collapse the Afghan state, mobilize the Afghan population, and cause many Afghans to flee into Pakistan and Iran.<br />
Within Pakistan, the U.S. reversion to a counterterrorism strategy (from the counterinsurgency strategy for which Obama reaffirmed his support as recently as August) would disrupt the delicate balance that has made possible recent Pakistani progress against internal foes and al Qaeda.<br />
Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari, army chief of staff General Ashfaq Kayani, and others who have supported Pakistani operations against the Taliban are facing an entrenched resistance within the military and among retired officers. This resistance stems from the decades-long relationships nurtured between the Taliban and Pakistan, which started during the war to expel the Soviet Army. Advocates within Pakistan of continuing to support the Taliban argue that the United States will abandon Afghanistan as it did in 1989, creating chaos that only the Taliban will be able to fill in a manner that suits Pakistan.<br />
Zardari and Kayani have been able to overcome this internal resistance sufficiently to mount major operations against Pakistani Taliban groups, in part because the rhetoric and actions of the Obama administration to date have seemed to prove the Taliban advocates wrong. The announcement of the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces would prove them right. Pakistani operations against their own insurgents--as well as against al Qaeda, which lives among those insurgents--would probably grind to a halt as Pakistan worked to reposition itself in support of a revived Taliban government in Afghanistan. And a renewed stream of Afghan refugees would likely overwhelm the Pakistani government and military, rendering coherent operations against insurgents and terrorists difficult or impossible.<br />
The collapse of Pakistan, or even the revival of an aggressive and successful Islamist movement there, would be a calamity for the region and for the United States. It would significantly increase the risk that al Qaeda might obtain nuclear weapons from Pakistan's stockpile, as well as the risk that an Indo-Pakistani war might break out involving the use of nuclear weapons.<br />

Taliban takeover causes the fragmentation of Afghanistan – causes escalating wars that go global<br />
Morgan, 07 - Stephen John Morgan 7, Former member of the British Labour Party Executive Committee &amp; a political psychologist, researcher into Chaos/Complexity Theory, &quot;Better another Taliban Afghanistan, than a Taliban NUCLEAR Pakistan!?&quot;, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.electricarticles.com/display.aspx?id=639" rel="nofollow">http://www.electricarticles.com/display.aspx?id=639</a></span><br />
<br />
Although disliked and despised in many quarters, the Taliban could not advance without the support or acquiescence of parts of the population, especially in the south. In particular, the Taliban is drawing on backing from the Pashtun tribes from whom they originate. The southern and eastern areas have been totally out of government control since 2001. Moreover, not only have they not benefited at all from the Allied occupation, but it is increasingly clear that with a few small centres of exception, all of the country outside Kabul has seen little improvement in its circumstances. The conditions for unrest are ripe and the Taliban is filling the vacuum. The Break-Up of Afghanistan? However, the Taliban is unlikely to win much support outside of the powerful Pashtun tribes. Although they make up a majority of the nation, they are concentrated in the south and east. Among the other key minorities, such as Tajiks and Uzbeks, who control the north they have no chance of making new inroads. They will fight the Taliban and fight hard, but their loyalty to the NATO and US forces is tenuous to say the least. The Northern Alliance originally liberated Kabul from the Taliban without Allied ground support. The Northern Alliance are fierce fighters, veterans of the war of liberation against the Soviets and the Afghanistan civil war. Mobilized they count for a much stronger adversary than the NATO and US forces. It is possible that, while they won’t fight for the current government or coalition forces, they will certainly resist any new Taliban rule. They may decide to withdraw to their areas in the north and west of the country. This would leave the Allied forces with few social reserves, excepting a frightened and unstable urban population in Kabul, much like what happened to the Soviets. Squeezed by facing fierce fighting in Helmund and other provinces, and, at the same time, harried by a complementary tactic of Al Qaeda-style urban terrorism in Kabul, sooner or later, a “Saigon-style” evacuation of US and Allied forces could be on the cards. The net result could be the break-up and partition of Afghanistan into a northern and western area and a southern and eastern area, which would include the two key cities of Kandahar and, the capital Kabul. « Pastunistan?» The Taliban themselves, however may decide not to take on the Northern Alliance and fighting may concentrate on creating a border between the two areas, about which the two sides may reach an agreement regardless of US and Allied plans or preferences. The Taliban may claim the name Afghanistan or might opt for “Pashtunistan” – a long-standing, though intermittent demand of the Pashtuns, within Afghanistan and especially along the ungovernable border regions inside Pakistan. It could not be ruled out that the Taliban could be aiming to lead a break away of the Pakistani Pashtuns to form a 30 million strong greater Pashtun state, encompassing some 18 million Pakistani Pashtuns and 12 Afghan Pashtuns. Although the Pashtuns are more closely linked to tribal and clan loyalty, there exists a strong latent embryo of a Pashtun national consciousness and the idea of an independent Pashtunistan state has been raised regularly in the past with regard to the disputed territories common to Afghanistan and Pakistan. The area was cut in two by the “Durand Line”, a totally artificial border between created by British Imperialism in the 19th century. It has been a question bedevilling relations between the Afghanistan and Pakistan throughout their history, and with India before Partition. It has been an untreated, festering wound which has lead to sporadic wars and border clashes between the two countries and occasional upsurges in movements for Pashtun independence.<br />
In fact, is this what lies behind the current policy of appeasement President Musharraf of Pakistan towards the Pashtun tribes in along the Frontiers and his armistice with North Waziristan last year?<br />
Is he attempting to avoid further alienating Pashtun tribes there and head–off a potential separatist movement in Pakistan, which could develop from the Taliban’s offensive across the border in Afghanistan? Trying to subdue the frontier lands has proven costly and unpopular for Musharraf. In effect, he faces exactly the same problems as the US and Allies in Afghanistan or Iraq.<br />
Indeed, fighting Pashtun tribes has cost him double the number of troops as the US has lost in Iraq. Evidently, he could not win and has settled instead for an attempted political solution. When he agreed the policy of appeasement and virtual self-rule for North Waziristan last year, President Musharraf stated clearly that he is acting first and foremost to protect the interests of Pakistan. While there was outrageous in Kabul, his deal with the Pashtuns is essentially an effort to firewall his country against civil war and disintegration. In his own words, what he fears most is, the « Talibanistation » of the whole Pashtun people, which he warns could inflame the already fierce fundamentalist and other separatist movement across his entire country. He does not want to open the door for any backdraft from the Afghan war to engulf Pakistan. Musharraf faces the nationalist struggle in Kashmir, an insurgency in Balochistan, unrest in the Sindh, and growing terrorist bombings in the main cities. There is also a large Shiite population and clashes between Sunnis and Shias are regular. Moreover, fundamentalist support in his own Armed Forces and Intelligence Services is extremely strong. So much so that analyst consider it likely that the Army and Secret Service is protecting, not only top Taliban leaders, but Bin Laden and the Al Qaeda central leadership thought to be entrenched in the same Pakistani borderlands. For the same reasons, he has not captured or killed Bin Laden and the Al Qaeda leadership. Returning from the frontier provinces with Bin Laden’s severed head would be a trophy that would cost him his own head in Pakistan. At best he takes the occasional risk of giving a nod and a wink to a US incursion, but even then at the peril of the chagrin of the people and his own military and secret service. The Break-Up of Pakistan? Musharraf probably hopes that by giving de facto autonomy to the Taliban and Pashtun leaders now with a virtual free hand for cross border operations into Afghanistan, he will undercut any future upsurge in support for a break-away independent Pashtunistan state or a “Peoples’ War” of the Pashtun populace as a whole, as he himself described it. However events may prove him sorely wrong. Indeed, his policy could completely backfire upon him. As the war intensifies, he has no guarantees that the current autonomy may yet burgeon into a separatist movement. Appetite comes with eating, as they say. Moreover, should the Taliban fail to re-conquer al of Afghanistan, as looks likely, but captures at least half of the country, then a Taliban Pashtun caliphate could be established which would act as a magnet to separatist Pashtuns in Pakistan. Then, the likely break up of Afghanistan along ethnic lines, could, indeed, lead the way to the break up of Pakistan, as well. Strong centrifugal forces have always bedevilled the stability and unity of Pakistan, and, in the context of the new world situation, the country could be faced with civil wars and popular fundamentalist uprisings, probably including a military-fundamentalist coup d’état. Fundamentalism is deeply rooted in Pakistan society. The fact that in the year following 9/11, the most popular name given to male children born that year was “Osama” (not a Pakistani name) is a small indication of the mood. Given the weakening base of the traditional, secular opposition parties, conditions would be ripe for a coup d’état by the fundamentalist wing of the Army and ISI, leaning on the radicalised masses to take power. Some form of radical, military Islamic regime, where legal powers would shift to Islamic courts and forms of shira law would be likely. Although, even then, this might not take place outside of a protracted crisis of upheaval and civil war conditions, mixing fundamentalist movements with nationalist uprisings and sectarian violence between the Sunni and minority Shia populations. The nightmare that is now Iraq would take on gothic proportions across the continent. The prophesy of an arc of civil war over Lebanon, Palestine and Iraq would spread to south Asia, stretching from Pakistan to Palestine, through Afghanistan into Iraq and up to the Mediterranean coast. Undoubtedly, this would also spill over into India both with regards to the Muslim community and Kashmir. Border clashes, terrorist attacks, sectarian pogroms and insurgency would break out. A new war, and possibly <span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">nuclear war, </span>between Pakistan and India could not be ruled out. Atomic Al Qaeda Should Pakistan break down completely, a Taliban-style government with strong Al Qaeda influence is a real possibility. Such deep chaos would, of course, open a &quot;Pandora's box&quot; for the region and the world. With the possibility of unstable clerical and military fundamentalist elements being in control of the Pakistan nuclear arsenal, not only their use against India, but Israel becomes a possibility, as well as the acquisition of nuclear and other deadly weapons secrets by Al Qaeda. Invading Pakistan would not be an option for America.

But America's capacities for controlling the situation are extremely restricted. Might it be, in the end, they are also forced to accept President Musharraf's unspoken slogan of «Better another Taliban Afghanistan, than a Taliban NUCLEAR Pakistan!<br />

In August, President Obama laid out the rationale for stepping up the fight in Afghanistan: If left unchecked, the Taliban insurgency will mean an even larger safe haven from which al-Qaeda would plot to kill more Americans. So this is not only a war worth fighting. This is fundamental to the defense of our people. Obamas Af-Pak plan is, in essence, a countersanctuary strategy that denies safe havens to the Taliban and al-Qaeda, with the overriding goal of making America and its allies safer. Under Obama, the Pentagon has already sent a surge of 21,000 troops to Afghanistan, and the Administration is even weighing the possibility of deploying as many as 40,000 more.<br />
This is a sound policy. If U.S. forces were not in Afghanistan, the Taliban, with its al-Qaeda allies in tow, would seize control of the country's south and east and might even take it over entirely. A senior Afghan politician told me that the Taliban would be in Kabul within 24 hours without the presence of international forces. This is not because the Taliban is so strong; generous estimates suggest it numbers no more than 20,000 fighters. It is because the Afghan government and the 90,000--man Afghan army are still so weak.<br />
Probability- troops are key to stability now- withdrawing them would kill pak and terrorism<br />

<br />
The exasperated American surge-and-exit strategy reflects the increased frustration of the Western alliance, which has failed to bring about stability to Afghanistan. The exit part of any military strategy surly [as received] materializes successfully however, the stability part post withdrawal or exit of the affected country always remained dicey. Similarly, in case of Afghanistan, the case would not be any different as the exit would not yield any long term stability. To add to the frustration, the Dutch government's debacle over the issue of withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan, indicates the mood of the Western public over the issue. Also, the fact that no other country has come forward to-date to replace the Dutch forces in Afghanistan makes it evident that the withdrawal will be there soon. The withdrawal though, may portray America as weak but it has no choice since prolonging the stay any more would still tantamount to weakness any way. The withdrawal of foreign forces may not be wholesome but in parts over five to six years. Still, one might see the presence of a few thousand of them at the end, typically on the lines of Iraqi withdrawal. However, in the time leading up to the phased withdrawal, there are more fervent public voices calling for immediate withdrawal of their respective forces from Afghanistan. Amongst the rising tide of like minded people in favour of withdrawal, there are some lonely voices too that are heard on and off calling for continuation of deployment of Western forces in Afghanistan. This segment of the society is skeptical of post withdrawal scenario in Afghanistan. The apprehensions on the withdrawal are many. The most important geopolitical repercussion of the withdrawal being cited would be the perception that America stands defeated in the long drawn Afghan war. The others include the perception that the withdrawal will lead to the Taleban returning to power in Afghanistan, the Taleban allowing Al-Qa'idah renewed access to the country, and Al-Qa'idah making use of Afghanistan to successfully attack the West again. The withdrawal will have its implications on Pakistan too and as such, it must prepare itself to confront all challenges emerging out of the event and exert its weight in stabilizing the situation in Afghanistan. This will be all the more difficult as other countries like India and Iran will also be vying to get some stakes in Afghanistan upon withdrawal of foreign forces from there. Some of the scenarios that might develop out of the situation then would be discussed hereafter in this article. The Northern Alliance would continue to be supported by Russia, India and Iran in the post withdrawal Afghanistan. The Pashtuns, who ruled Afghanistan for over 200 years, having been denied their due right in the Afghan polity under the US occupation, would resist the dominance of the Northern Alliance with the tacit support of its war time friends for Kabul that may result in further bloodshed. Pakistan may again face the burden of the refugees and a destabilized Afghanistan yet again, which would be detrimental to its overall security. Since there exists a lot of disparity within the Afghan society, the Afghan strife will continue that may lead to formation of fresh alliances between various Afghan factions to develop some equilibrium, which resultantly could prolong instability in Afghanistan. The interim period would be exploited by India to cement its foothold in Afghan affairs much to the detriment of Pakistan's interests. The withdrawal may also encourage fundamentalists and extremists the world over, who may be inspired by the resilience of Afghans and their success in forcing foreign military powers out of their lands and as such adopt as means of achieving victories. The perceptions amongst the Afghan Taleban that Pakistan has been siding with the Western forces against them may lead to their disenchantment with Pakistan and they may be inclined to work against its interests. Pakistan does not enjoy very good relations with the Northern Alliance. As such, it will be difficult for it to negotiate an ultimate power sharing deal between the Northern Alliance and the Taleban, if it may try to at some point of time.<br />

Withdrawal leads to civil war – guarantees U.S draw in and turns the aff<br />

But <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">there are many compelling reasons to keep fighting in Afghanistan. Most important among them is that an American withdrawal would return Afghanistan to civil war and reinforce frightful trends in Pakistan. In an Afghan civil conflict pitting the Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Shiite Hazaras against the Pashtuns, the United States would have to choose the anti-Pashtun, anti-Pakistani side to protect against the possibility that the Taliban, a Pashtun-based movement, would again gain the upper hand</span></span>. Remember Western insouciance about Afghanistan between 1994 and 1996, as the Taliban gradually gained ground? This time around<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">, Washington would be obliged to intervene. It could not simply assume</span></span>, as many suggest, that Pashtun jealousies, tribal differences, and <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">powerful competing warlords would be enough to thwart a neo-Taliban advance. But successfully intervening in Pashtun politics from &quot;over the horizon,&quot; with American troops no longer significantly deployed in Afghanistan, would be impossible</span></span>. The Taliban currently have the offensive advantage throughout most of the Pashtun regions with U.S. forces active in the country; <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">imagine U.S. forces gone. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Choosing sides would immediately thrust us into conflict with Islamabad</span></span>, which remains a staunch and, at times, nefarious defender of Afghan Pashtun interests. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Such a collision</span></span> between Washington and Islamabad <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">would be awful</span></span>, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">fortifying Islamic militancy within Pakistan and placing al Qaeda and its allies</span></span>, more clearly than ever before, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">on the same side as the Pakistani military establishment, which is only now getting serious about countering the radical Islamic threat at home. </span></span><br />

Withdrawal causes Indo-Pak conflict.<br />

But it is not just Pakistan that has a lot at stake in Afghanistan. Neighboring India, the South Asian giant, is also nervous about Afghanistan's future, which is another area of competition -- and proxy conflict -- with rival Pakistan. The now-nuclear armed India and Pakistan have <span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">come to blows (and near-blows) a number of times</span> since their independence from the British Empire in 1947. Not surprisingly New Delhi is worried about Islamabad having significant influence in neighboring Afghanistan. India, a markedly terrorism-afflicted state, also worries that Afghanistan could become an operating base for Islamist extremists under the control of Pakistan with the aim of seeking to influence policies regarding Muslim-dominated Kashmir, a long-contested area between Islamabad and Delhi. Indeed, most experts acknowledge that Pakistan views the Afghan Taliban as an asset, seeing them as an ace-in-the-hole to limit Indian influence in Afghanistan, especially if the western forces were to leave precipitously. India and Pakistan, both powerhouses in their own rights, are not only important partners of the United States in fighting terrorism, but in dealing with a host of other key issues, such as nuclear non-proliferation and Iran. Positive relations between them are critical to American interests. Iran is also quite interested in happenings in neighboring Afghanistan and has been supporting its former nemesis, the Taliban, and others with weapons, including IEDs, used in fighting coalition forces. It is not clear what sort of relationship a post-conflict Taliban would have with the Iranians, since they have been sworn enemies in the past, but it is very likely Tehran would seek influence in Afghanistan to check unwelcome policies right next door.<br />

The plan would lead to terrorism, human rights atrocities, Pakistan instability and indopak war<br />

All of these scenarios are conceivable, but they hinge on optimistic assumptions. A shift to a light-footprint approach would carry significant risks. A narrow counterterror campaign would almost certainly offer Americans less protection against international terrorism than the present strategy.51 This is because U.S. Special Forces would be operating in a deteriorating security environment with even fewer sympathetic Afghan partners. They would find it harder to move around the country to collect intelligence or to attack the enemy. With fewer personnel or facilities for training, U.S. forces would face greater challenges in building capable Afghan troops or local security units. A light footprint would also have difficulty dealing with the fact that in recent years al-Qaeda has forged closer ties with elements of the Afghan Taliban, especially the Haqqani network. This new generation of Taliban fighters is more likely to share al-Qaeda’s vision of global jihad. It is plausible that the Taliban would revert to past practices, expanding its partnership with international terrorists as a means to destroy Afghan opponents. If successful, this would make it even harder for the United States to find willing and capable Afghan partners. Under those circumstances, Afghanistan could easily fracture into full-fledged civil war. That war would be every bit as devastating as earlier Afghan conflicts, creating millions of refugees and widespread humanitarian tragedy. By its decision to remain focused on a narrow counterterror mission, the United States would be held partly to blame for the suffering, making many Afghans even less willing to assist U.S. operations. A light footprint would bring Afghanistan no closer to enduring political or economic stability. It would offer little in the way of a realistic plan for a full, responsible U.S. military withdrawal. The United States could find itself trapped in a long, bloody quagmire, with worse prospects than it faces today. The Task Force finds that if Afghanistan falls back into civil war, its neighbors are more likely to take sides than to stand apart or try to dampen the conflict. The Indo-Pakistani competition in Afghanistan could be particularly fierce and would hurt their broader bilateral relationship. The United States would almost certainly find itself at odds with Pakistan’s choice of proxy forces in Afghanistan—the Taliban and its affiliates. Those differences would exacerbate tensions that already exist between Islamabad and Washington. All of these dynamics would take an added toll on the overstressed Pakistani state and endanger its stability.<br />

Bergen 2009, senior fellow at the New America Foundation, [Peter “How Realistic is Walt’s Realism?” 8/19, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/08/19/how_realistic_is_walt_s_realism" rel="nofollow">http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/08/19/how_realistic_is_walt_s_realism</a> )<br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The implication of Walt's objection to the ramped-up Obama strategy in Afghanistan is that the U.S. should either do less in Afghanistan, or even just get out altogether. But America has already gone down this road. Twice. In 1989 the U.S. closed its embassy in Kabul </span></span>and then effectively zeroed out aid to one of the poorest countries in the world; <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">meanwhile Afghanistan was racked by a civil war, which spawned the Taliban who then gave safe haven to al Qaeda</span></span>.<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Then in the winter of 2001 the Bush administration overthrew the Taliban, and because of its aversion to nation-building rebuilt the country on the cheap and quickly got distracted by the war in Iraq. Into the resulting vacuum stepped a resurgent Taliban. This time the movement of religious warriors was much more closely aligned with al Qaeda. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">So the U.S. has already tried the</span></span> Do Nothing approach and the <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Do It Light approach in Afghanistan, the results of which are well known. </span></span>The Obama administration is now attempting a Do It Seriously approach, which has a real chance of success.<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">This alternative strategy</span></span>, which was proposed by Vice President Joe Biden and <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/world/asia/23policy.html?_r=3" rel="nofollow">reported in </a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/world/asia/23policy.html?_r=3" rel="nofollow">//The New York Times//</a>, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">calls for reducing the US military mission in Afghanistan and ramping up airstrikes and covert raids against the al Qaeda in Pakistan’s tribal areas. </span></span><br />
&quot;Rather than trying to protect the Afghan population from the Taliban, American forces would concentrate on strikes against Qaeda cells, primarily in Pakistan, using special forces, Predator missile attacks and other surgical tactics,&quot; <em>The New York Times</em> reported. &quot;The Americans would accelerate training of Afghan forces and provide support as they took the lead against the Taliban. But the emphasis would shift to Pakistan.&quot;<br />
But US military and intelligence officials contacted by <em>The Long War Journal</em> warned that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">a strict focus on a counterterrorism mission concentrating on al Qaeda's leaders in Pakistan would cede the ground in Afghanistan to both the Taliban and al Qaeda and would have only a limited impact on al Qaeda's leadership</span></span>.<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">A ramped up program of cross-border strikes into Pakistan would also likely lead to the destabilization of Pakistan's government and a possible revolt within the Pakistani military and intelligence services</span></span>. And, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">a strategy that focuses heavily on counterterrorism tactics such as unmanned strikes and night raids would only play into the propaganda message of al Qaeda and the Taliban. </span></span><br />
Strong links between al Qaeda and the Taliban will provide safe havens<br />
US officials have warned that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">focusing on al Qaeda while ignoring the Taliban in both Pakistan and Afghanistan underestimates the close relationships between the groups. </span></span><br />
&quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The theory that al Qaeda will not seek shelter with the Afghan Taliban ignores the very lessons we have learned since the Sept. 11 attacks</span></span>,&quot; a US military intelligence official who focuses on al Qaeda and the Taliban told <em>The Long War Journal</em>. &quot;If anything, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the relationship between the Taliban and al Qaeda has strengthened, not weakened, over the past few years.&quot; </span></span><br />
The <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">relationship between the Haqqani Network and al Qaeda is cited as the prime example of the increased linkage between the Taliban and al Qaeda</span></span>. Siraj Haqqani, the military commander of the Haqqani Network, which operates in eastern Afghanistan and in Pakistan's tribal agency of North Waziristan, has close ties to both Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">He has recruited both foreign and local fighters to serve as suicide bombers and has employed them against Afghan and Coalition forces. </span></span><br />
Mullah Sangeen Zadran, a senior Haqqani Network military commander, recently said <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the relationship between al Qaeda and the Taliban is strong</span></span>. Sangeen made the statement in an interview with As Sahab, al Qaeda's propaganda arm. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/threat-matrix/archives/2009/09/an_interview_with_mullah_sange.php" rel="nofollow">According to Sangeen</a>:<br />
&quot;All praise is for Allah, Al-Qaeda and Taliban all are Muslims and we are united by the brotherhood of Islam. We do not see any difference between Taliban and Al Qaeda, for we all belong to the religion of Islam. Sheikh Osama has pledged allegiance to Amir Al-Mumineen (Mullah Muhammad Omar) and has reassured his leadership again and again. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">There is no difference between us, for we are united by Islam and the Sharia governs us. Just as the infidels are one people, so are the Muslims, and they will never succeed in disuniting the Mujahideen, saying that there is Al- Qaeda and Taliban, and that Al-Qaeda are terrorists and extremists</span></span>. They use many such words, but by the Grace of Allah, it will not affect our brotherly relationship. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Now they are also trying to disunite the Taliban, saying that there are two wings, one extremist and another moderate. However, the truth is that we are all one and are united by Islam.&quot;</span></span><br />
The close ties between the Haqqani Network and al Qaeda were highlighted in General Stanley McChrystal's assessment on Afghanistan, which was leaked to <em>The Washington Post</em>. According to McChrystal, the Haqqanis' territories in Khost, Paktika, and Paktia provinces are ripe for al Qaeda camps.<br />
&quot;Al Qaeda's links with HQN [Haqqani Network] have grown, suggesting that expanded HQN control could create a favorable environment for AQAM [al Qaeda and allied movements] to re-establish safe-havens in Afghanistan,&quot; according to the McChrystal assessment.<br />
Withdrawing into bases to conduct raids and Predator/Reaper airstrikes in Pakistan would only allow al Qaeda to prosper in Afghanistan.<br />
&quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">If we pull back, the Afghan military will not be able to hold ground, and the Taliban,</span></span> the Haqqanis, HIG [Gulbuddin Hekmartyr's Hizb-i-Islami faction], <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">and smaller groups will take the ground in much of the South and East, and even in areas in the West and North</span></span>,&quot; a senior US military intelligence official told <em>The Long War Journal</em>.<br />
&quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Once we lose that ground, our access to local intel is hampered</span></span>,&quot; the official said. &quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">We have no doubt al Qaeda and the Taliban will reestablish dominance in short order. The very security of the bases used to conduct the strikes in Pakistan would be in jeopardy.” </span></span><br />
&quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">There are already Taliban safe havens in many areas in Afghanistan, and al Qaeda trainers and advisers, and even some paramilitary units from Brigade 055 are in Afghanistan</span></span>,&quot; the official continued, referring to one of the brigades of al Qaeda's paramilitary Shadow Army based along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.<br />

This is because <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the insurgency is largely located in the tribal belt of the ethnic Pashtuns</span></span> (the Taliban are almost all Pashtuns, though not all Pashtuns are Taliban of course). <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The other ethnic groups who make up the majority, such as the Hazaras, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turkmen, and Aimaqs, belonged to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance and want the United States there. </span></span>Over and over again during my travels through their lands, and even in the Pashtun tribal lands, Afghans told me to tell my fellow Americans not to abandon Afghanistan. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">If we left, the Afghans I met feared the Taliban thugs would come back throwing acid in un-veiled women's faces, burning schools, amputating hands, and stoning women for adultery</span></span> (i.e. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">being caught out on the street with a male who was not family or husband)</span></span>. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">All we have achieved at a cost in blood and gold would be overturned and the Afghans would be right where we left them back in 1991 when they fell prey to the extremists</span></span>. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The peace and stability that we have brought to some two-thirds of Afghanistan is fragile and takes a military presence to maintain. We need time to train the tens of thousands of Afghan police and military to keep the peace and fight the Taliban insurgents in the Pashtun south</span></span>. The Afghans desperately need breathing room. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Even in the tribal south the U.S. has kept the Taliban out of the Pashtuns' spiritual capital of Kandahar and prevented them from reestablishing their harsh laws in Afghanistan's second largest city</span></span>. For this the Kandaharis are grateful. In fact repeated polls have shown that majority of Afghans want the U.S. and NATO there. As they watch Indian soap operas on televisions the Taliban once smashed, send their girls to school, and drive on newly paved roads, millions of Afghans are experiencing the direct benefits of the U.S. presence in their country. This is the work we could have been doing in 1991 and, for all its obvious flaws, it is a tentative sign of progress in the long journey to rebuild civil society in this long suffering land. In other words, compassionate, global-minded Democrats who supported President Bill Clinton's humanitarian interventions in places like Kosovo, Bosnia, Haiti and Somalia owe it to the Afghan people to be patient and do the same for Afghanistan.<br />

<br />
Originally established at Fuchu Air Station on July 1, 1957, USFJ, with its U.S. Army, U.S Marine Corps, U.S Navy, and U.S Air Force elements, consists of approximately 36,000 military personnel, 43,000 dependents, 5,000 DoD civilian employees, and 25,000 Japanese workers. U.S. forces are stationed in Japan pursuant to the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security of 1960.<br />
Headquarters U.S. Forces Japan is located at Yokota Air Base. Approximately 160 military, DoD civilians, and Japanese national employees comprise the Commander, U.S. Forces, Japan's, (COMUSJAPAN) joint staff. The joint staff administers unilateral and bilateral defense issues. HQ USFJ focuses on war planning, conduct of joint/bilateral exercises and studies, administering the Status of Forces Agreement, improving combat readiness, and enhancing the quality of life of military and DOD civilian personnel and their dependents. One of the most significant events in USFJ history took place on January 19, 1960. Christian A. Herter and Douglas MacArthur II signed the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security for the United States. This treaty, with its related diplomatic notes and implementation arrangements, authorized the U.S. military presence in Japan. Of singular importance to USFJ was the signing of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) on that same day. The U.S.- Japan Joint Committee established under the prior Administrative agreement was continued as the means for inter-governmental consultations on general matters regarding implementation of the SOFA on U.S. facilities COMUSJAPAN's mission stems directly from the treaty and the resulting presence of U.S. forces in Japan. The commander is responsible for developing plans for the defense of Japan and must be prepared, if contingencies arise, to assume operational control of assigned and attached U.S. forces for the execution of those plans. The commander's peacetime responsibilities include representing the Commander, U.S. Pacific Command, in relations among U.S. forces and other Department of Defense elements, the U.S. Ambassador, the Japan Defense Agency, and other Government of Japan agencies.The USFJ insignia was approved by the Institute of Heraldry in May 1977. The insignia portrays the close professional working relationship between USFJ and the Japan Self Defense Forces. Japan has implemented a series of &quot;Defense Buildup Plans&quot; since fiscal year 1958 which coincide with USFJ's longevity. The 1960s were a time of turmoil for USFJ, with the return of many of the bases and facilities held since the end of the war, the intense activities at depots and bases in support of American forces deployed in Southeast Asia, and anti-war and anti-base demonstrations among some elements of the Japanese public. A major change in USFJ responsibilities occurred with the 1972 reversion of Okinawa to the Japanese government, and some related changes to the Status of Forces Agreement -- a major expansion of USFJ activities. Military-related problems formerly handled by the High Commissioner, Ryukyu Islands, became the responsibility of USFJ. An Okinawa Area Field Office was established to represent USFJ interests there. In 1976, the Subcommittee for Defense Cooperation was established. This subcommittee, consisting of military and civilian members of both countries, permits consultation concerning mutual defense issues. Return of U.S. facilities and areas, as well as joint usage, continued during the 1970s, especially on the main islands. The U.S. Air Force's Fifth Air Force transferred its tactical aircraft from the main islands and consolidated other activities in the Kanto Plain area. Support and military housing facilities in many areas were closed. Army depots were reduced or closed. Besides reduction in facilities, there was a decrease in the number of Japanese nationals employed by USFJ. On July 1, 1957, USFJ was one of the largest employers in Japan with a main island workforce of 152,000. Overall labor costs were low -- with an average annual payroll cost of $1,181 per employee. Today, the Japanese national workforce is about 25,000; with an average annual payroll of over $56,000 per appropriated employee. During the final four months of 1974, the headquarters of USFJ was relocated from Fuchu Air Station to Yokota Air Base. A real milestone in U.S. and Japan military relations came in November 1978, when both governments approved a document known as the Guidelines for Defense Cooperation. This document formed the basis for definitive and comprehensive military planning and other activities between U.S. forces and Japan Self Defense Forces. The two key elements of the guidelines are: guidance and direction for planning to meet other contingencies in the Far East that would affect Japan's security; and provisions for studies and analyses to be performed in several areas related to and supportive of the two main efforts. Another milestone was the New Special Measures Agreement, signed by the Government of Japan in January 1991. This agreement, combined with previously-agreed-to Labor Cost Sharing agreements and a generous Facilities Improvement Program, clearly established Japan as our most generous ally in Host Nation Support. Japan pays most yen-based labor expenses (appropriated and non-appropriated funds) and a portion of utility costs (fuel, electricity, sewage, and water). <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">The SMA was renewed in 2008. U.S. military strength in Japan is about 36,000 ashore and 11,000 afloat, and U.S. forces are dispersed among 85 facilities located on Honshu, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Total acreage of U.S. bases is approximately 77,000 acres. USFJ bases and facilities range in size from a several thousand acre training area to a single antenna site. </span></span><br />

U.S. commitment to Japan is high now – troops are stationed to deter North Korea and China<br />

&quot;Keeping our alliance with the United States contributes to peace in the region,&quot; Kan said in a televised question-and-answer session with other party leaders. &quot;Stability helps the U.S.-Japan relationship, and that between China and Japan and, in turn, China and the United States.&quot; The U.S.-Japan alliance, formalized over violent protests in 1960, provides for the defense of Japan while assuring the U.S. has regional bases that serve as a <span style="border-bottom: black 1pt solid; border-left: black 1pt solid; border-right: black 1pt solid; border-top: black 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">significant deterrent to hostilities over the Korean Peninsula or Taiwan</span>. Under the pact, promulgated 50 years ago Wednesday, nearly 50,000 American troops are deployed throughout Japan. The U.S. forces include a key naval base south of Tokyo where the only permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier has its home port; Kadena Air Base, which is one of the largest in Asia; and more than 10,000 U.S. Marines on the southern island of Okinawa. The large U.S. presence over the past five decades has allowed Japan to keep its own defense spending low, to about 1 percent of its GDP, and focus its spending elsewhere — a factor that helped it rebuild after World War II to become the world's second-largest economy. &quot;Even though there are some small problems here and there, <span style="border-bottom: black 1pt solid; border-left: black 1pt solid; border-right: black 1pt solid; border-top: black 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">in the bigger sense the relationship remains strong</span>,&quot; said Jun Iio, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. &quot;Very few people think that it is actually necessary to make major changes in the alliance.&quot; But while the alliance is one of the strongest Washington has anywhere in the world, it has come under intense pressure lately over a plan to make sweeping reforms that would pull back roughly 8,600 Marines from Okinawa to the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam. The move was conceived in response to opposition on Okinawa to the large U.S. military presence there — more than half of the U.S. troops in Japan are on Okinawa, which was one of the bloodiest battlefields of World War II. Though welcomed by many at first, the relocation plan has led to renewed Okinawan protests over the U.S. insistence it cannot be carried out unless a new base is built on Okinawa to replace one that has been set for closing for more than a decade. A widening rift between Washington and Tokyo over the future of the Futenma Marine Corps Air Station was a major factor in the resignation of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama earlier this month. It could well plague Kan as well. Kan has vowed to build a replacement facility on Okinawa, as the U.S. demanded, but details are undecided. Implementing the agreement would need the support of the local governor, who has expressed opposition to it. Kan was scheduled to visit Okinawa on Wednesday for ceremonies marking the end of the 1945 battle there that hastened Japan's surrender. Recent tension on the Korean peninsula and China's growing military assertiveness have undoubtedly <span style="border-bottom: black 1pt solid; border-left: black 1pt solid; border-right: black 1pt solid; border-top: black 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">driven home the importance of the U.S. security pact with Japanese leaders</span>.<br />

Any relocation out of Japan of all or even a major part of our combined Marine presence in Japan would represent a fundamental relocation of a critical capability for the defense of Japan. Therefore, making a decision about Henoko has a potential to force the United States, probably sooner rather than later, to make a negative decision to base itself elsewhere. We must be located where we can properly exercise that capability. It really means that we would have to rethink our entire deployment strategy. These are heavy decisions that have long-lasting consequences. Q: Where would they go? A: That's the $64,000 question. I cannot say where they would go, but this would be a strategic decision that would have to be made. But certainly, they would be going away from Japan, and this displacement, we must assume, will reduce substantially the defense posture of Japan. This would also result in a reduced credibility of the United States' presence in Japan, our forward-basing in Japan. Q: Would they go to Guam? A: Perhaps some could go to Guam. Perhaps some would go to Hawaii. Perhaps back to the United States West Coast or elsewhere. There is an additional danger here. That is, once this issue causes a process of fundamental repositioning to begin to occur, understand that many forces will be at work, including U.S. congressional forces. It will be very difficult to manage the sequence of events that play out. And this is not something we want to see happen. But our biggest concern is that it seems the people in Japan that are making these decisions, the Hatoyama government and its political overlords, do not have any sense of the magnitude of the issue with which they are playing. In the greater scheme of things (for) the security of Japan, it almost seems we have a group of boys and girls playing with a box of matches as they sit in a room of dynamite. Long after they have endangered themselves, the real damage will be done to the house of Japan. And the American firemen will not be around once the decision is made to burn down the house. You know what I'm saying. It is, &quot;Do the people that are making these decisions understand the second and third order consequences of forcing the United States to make a very difficult decision?&quot; That's the issue. Q: Tell me about what's happening in Congress. We know that Daniel Inouye and Jim Webb recently visited Okinawa. What's the atmosphere in Congress regarding this issue? A: I think the atmosphere in Congress is one of disappointment. They believed that there was a realignment agreement that would protect and preserve the bilateral security relationship for the next 50 to 100 years. We told them that. We assured them that this was the outcome of the realignment and rebalancing we had agreed to with Japan when the agreement was reached. Our Congress was intensely involved, Senator Inouye among other leaders, in the agreement. And these congressmen understood the details. And now these congressional leaders see an agreement--and I here would not presume to speak for Senator Inouye--that is unraveling. And they're very disappointed. I think this development causes them to question<br />

According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons.

The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention.

A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war, therefore, many countries other than the primary actors could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the United States and China are the two most dominant members. If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/or militarily affected by it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.<br />

<em>For example, as of Dec. 1, only 68.8 percent of university students scheduled to graduate this spring secured jobs — a record low since statistics were first taken in 1996. By comparison, two years ago, then Prime Minister Taro Aso convened the ordinary Diet session on Jan. 5, in the wake of the Lehman Brothers financial shock. Mr. Kan has declared that he will adopt basic directions for tax and social welfare reform and the TPP issue by the end of June. These are not easy issues to tackle. Not only public opinion but also opinion within the DPJ is divided. Without at least unified support from the DPJ, Mr. Kan will not be able to persuade the opposition on these matters. In an attempt to carry out the tax and social welfare reforms, Mr. Kan tapped Mr. Kaoru Yosano, who had assumed important posts under the Liberal Democratic Party's rule, as minister in charge of economic and fiscal policy. Since Mr. Yosano had vehemently attacked the DPJ's policies, both Mr. Kan and Mr. Yosano will face strong criticism from the opposition in the Diet. Mr. Kan also has not yet unified the views of Mr. Yosano and the DPJ on how to finance the basic portion of pensions in the future. In addition to Diet business, Mr. Kan and the DPJ must face voters' verdict in local elections in April. He will be able to overcome his and the DPJ's crisis only when he presents convincing policy measures to stabilize people's lives.</em><br />

The first hurdle is the opening of budget committees at the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors during the upcoming extraordinary Diet session. The ruling coalition parties and the government agreed Tuesday to opposition parties' demands to hold the committee meetings in an atmosphere of collaboration between the ruling and opposition parties in the so-called divided Diet, where the ruling coalition parties control the lower house and the opposition holds a majority in the upper house. <span class="underline0">However, the opposition parties are poised to use the budget committees to grill the government over political fund scandals and other problems involving the DPJ. </span>The second hurdle for Kan is the joint meeting of DPJ members of both Diet chambers that might be held late this month. <span class="underline0">At the meeting, Kan most likely will face grilling over his responsibility for the DPJ's serious electoral setback in the recent upper house poll. The third hurdle is whether Kan can win Cabinet approval for guidelines on ministries' budget allocation requests for fiscal 2011 late this month as scheduled. &quot;I apologize for forcing you to fight a very difficult election campaign because I suddenly referred to the consumption tax issue,&quot; Kan said Tuesday afternoon at the party's first executive board meeting held after the upper house election. &quot;Please kindly allow me to restart [my efforts] and take charge of government,&quot; he said. </span>At a joint meeting of government and DPJ leaders held prior to this, Kan also showed willingness to hold budget committee meetings during the upcoming Diet session. <span class="underline0">Kan was assuming a modest attitude because he believes setting a political agenda that seeks to overcome the divided Diet will directly lead to his administration's stability and his reelection as party president, a source close to the prime minister said. However, the opening of the budget committees could be a double-edged sword for Kan because the opposition parties are going to press the government hard over &quot;money politics&quot; involving former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and</span> former DPJ Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa<span class="underline0">; the relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps' Futenma Air Station in Okinawa Prefecture; and friction among members of the ruling coalition parties and the government over a possible increase of consumption tax rate. </span>&quot;The DPJ hasn't dealt properly with the issues of politics and money,&quot; said Jiro Kawasaki, chief of the Liberal Democratic Party Diet Affairs Committee. Kawasaki said people close to Hatoyama and Ozawa could be summoned to the upper house as unsworn witnesses over the issues. He also plans to grill the prime minister over his decision to retain Justice Minister Keiko Chiba in her post after she lost her Diet seat in the recent upper house election. Even within the DPJ, the atmosphere is not necessarily friendly to Kan. DPJ leaders plan to hold a joint meeting of party lawmakers at the end of this month to reflect on the results of the latest election. <span class="underline0">&quot;We lost the upper house election by scoring 'own goals' again and again,&quot;</span> said some DPJ members close to Ozawa, blaming Kan's leadership. One DPJ leader expressed strong concern and predicted the joint meeting of DPJ lawmakers would not end peacefully.

Reports this week showed the jobless rate reached a five- month high in May, and wages, factory output and household spending fell, showing little sign of revival in domestic demand more than a year after the economy stopped shrinking. A gain in the Tankan business-sentiment index today reflects a post- recession rebound in manufacturers’ earnings led by exports. The risk is that without an end to deflation and rebound in spending, the economy won’t be able to withstand the higher levy Kan plans in as soon as two years. Kan, facing midterm elections July 11, is in danger of repeating the error of his late predecessor Ryutaro Hashimoto, whose 1997 tax rise helped cause a recession, according to Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co. “Hashimoto raised taxes as soon as he thought the economy had gained back just a bit of its health, and that ended up sinking the Japanese economy into a bottomless abyss,” said Akio Makabe, an economics professor at Shinshu University in Matsumoto, central Japan, who has written books on behavioral finance. “If the government doesn’t get its priorities straight, we’ll see another 1997.” </span></span><span style="color: black;">Leads to global nuclear miscalc </span>Auslin 9 [Michael, Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, February 6, “Averting Disaster” Daily Standard ,<span style="color: #147dba;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.29339/pub_detail.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.29339/pub_detail.asp</a></span></em><br />

As they deal with a collapsing world economy, policymakers in Washington and around the globe must not forget that when a depression strikes, war can follow. Nowhere is this truer than in Asia, the most heavily armed region on earth and riven with ancient hatreds and territorial rivalries. Collapsing trade flows can lead to political tension, nationalist outbursts, growing distrust, and ultimately, military miscalculation. The result would be disaster on top of an already dire situation.<br />

No one should think that Asia is on the verge of conflict. But it is also important to remember what has helped keep the peace in this region for so long. Phenomenal growth rates in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, China and elsewhere since the 1960s have naturally turned national attention inward, to development and stability. This has gradually led to increased political confidence, diplomatic initiatives, and in many nations the move toward more democratic systems. America has directly benefited as well, and not merely from years of lower consumer prices, but also from the general conditions of peace in Asia. Yet policymakers need to remember that even during these decades of growth, moments of economic shock, such as the 1973 Oil Crisis, led to instability and bursts of terrorist activity in Japan, while the uneven pace of growth in China has led to tens of thousands of armed clashes in the poor interior of the country. Now imagine such instability multiplied region-wide. The economic collapse Japan is facing, and China's potential slowdown, dwarfs any previous economic troubles, including the 1998 Asian Currency Crisis. Newly urbanized workers rioting for jobs or living wages, conflict over natural resources, further saber-rattling from North Korea, all can take on lives of their own. This is the nightmare of governments in the region, and particularly of democracies from newer ones like Thailand and Mongolia to established states like Japan and South Korea. How will overburdened political leaders react to internal unrest? What happens if Chinese shopkeepers in Indonesia are attacked, or a Japanese naval ship collides with a Korean fishing vessel? Quite simply, Asia's political infrastructure may not be strong enough to resist the slide towards confrontation and conflict. This would be a political and humanitarian disaster turning the clock back decades in Asia. It would almost certainly drag America in at some point, as well. First of all, we have alliance responsibilities to Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines should any of them come under armed attack. Failure on our part to live up to those responsibilities could mean the end of America's credibility in Asia. Secondly, peace in Asia has been kept in good measure by the continued U.S. military presence since World War II. There have been terrible localized conflicts, of course, but nothing approaching a systemic conflagration like the 1940s. Today, such a conflict would be far more bloody, and it is unclear if the American military, already stretched too thin by wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, could contain the crisis. Nor is it clear that the American people, worn out from war and economic distress, would be willing to shed even more blood and treasure for lands across the ocean. The result could be a historic changing of the geopolitical map in the world's most populous region. Perhaps China would emerge as the undisputed hegemon. Possibly democracies like Japan and South Korea would link up to oppose any aggressor. India might decide it could move into the vacuum. All of this is guess-work, of course, but it has happened repeatedly throughout history. There is no reason to believe we are immune from the same types of miscalculation and greed that have destroyed international systems in the past.<br />

The striking thing was the degree of internal unity and outward determination among the alliance's 28 members. </span></span>In recent years, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">derisive dismissals have featured galore in international discourse about the &quot;dysfunctional irrelevance&quot; of NATO</span></span> and an alliance characterized as a &quot;Cold War relic&quot;. In South Asia - Indian, in particular - this almost resulted in an intellectual ellipsis while dwelling on the overall United States regional strategies in the overlapping Afghanistan-Pakistan conflicts. In fact, NATO hardly figured in the Indian discourses on Afghanistan as an issue of consequence. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Facile impressions gathered in the South Asian strategic community that the US was desperately seeking an &quot;exit strategy</span></span>&quot; in Afghanistan and was about to &quot;cut and run&quot; from the Hindu Kush. The <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">NATO summit in Lisbon at the end of November, therefore, came as an eye-opener</span></span> for South Asians. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Voices in the transatlantic space that questioned the continued the raison d'etre of the alliance have fallen completely silent. </span></span>Equally, alliance members of both Old and New Europe seem to have recognized that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">NATO has successfully maneuvered though a transitional phase and completed a process of adjustment in the post-Cold War era. Fundamental divergences in matters of alliance policy are no more. </span></span>Unscathed psyche Quite obviously, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the alliance is well on the way to transforming into a global political-military role, and it is forward-looking</span></span>. There are skeptical voices still that in an era of European austerity, a question mark ought to be put on the alliance's ambitions. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">European cutbacks in military deployment and rigorous savings programs in defense budgets should not be overplayed, either. NATO is by far today the most powerful military and political alliance in the world. </span></span>The US has always been the main provider of the alliance's budget - almost 75% currently - as well as its &quot;hard power&quot;. The perceived widening of the US-Europe &quot;divide&quot;, however, presents a complex scenario as regards the alliance's evolution as a security organization in the 21st century. As NATO secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen underlined at the Lisbon summit, &quot;The United States would look elsewhere for its security partner.&quot; A kind of &quot;division of labor&quot; in international interventions becomes necessary for the US. The Iraq war showed that it is already happening. The <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">various partnership programs of NATO in Central Asia and the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Mediterranean regions can be viewed as part of the overall approach to take recourse to other states or groups of states to promote the Euro-Atlantic interests globally. </span></span>In a manner of speaking, the &quot;concepts&quot; of power are expanding and <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">NATO is seeking ways and means to eliminate unwanted duplications so as to coordinate more efficiently. At any rate, the handwringing over NATO's impending retreat from the world arena as a military alliance pretty much ended in Lisbon. </span></span>( ) US-NATO cohesion is high now, but Unilateral withdrawal of TNWs destroys the alliance McNamara and Spring ‘10 [Sally and Baker – Senior Policy Analysts in European Affairs at Heritage. “President Obama Must Not Remove Nuclear Weapons from Europe” Backgrounder, March 2010</em><br />
<br />
From a strategic standpoint, a proactive national defense relies on the ability to defend physical territory, as well as the ability to deter an enemy attack in the first place. <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">In a highly dangerous world where hostile states—such as Iran and North Korea—possess both nuclear and conventional forces capable of striking the U.S. and its allies, a credible nuclear deterrence, not unilateral disarmament, is the best chance for peace. Therefore, the U.S., in consultation with its allies, should use nuclear weapons in Europe and in the U.S. to protect and defend the U.S. and its allies against strategic attack</span></span>. This position is consistent with a more defensive, broader strategic posture that would require the deployment of robust defensive systems, including ballistic missile defenses. This posture would also require modernizing the nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal, including their delivery systems, to make them better suited to destroying targets that are likely to be used to launch strategic attacks against the U.S. and its allies, as well as targets whose destruction requires the more powerful force of nuclear weapons. These targets could include missiles in hardened silos, deeply buried command and control facilities, and heavily protected nuclear weapons depots. A Threat to NATO <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">Not since radical leftist sentiment gripped Western Europe in the 1980s has the transatlantic relationship faced such a serious ideological challenge to the mutual security of North America and Europe. The removal of American tactical nuclear weapons from European and NATO bases would spell the end of the alliance and the concept of indivisible security. </span></span><br />

<br />
Some of those ideas--notably, dissolution and &quot;standing pat&quot;--were never likely to be implemented. Quite apart from the sociological law that says organizations never go out of business even if their main aim has been achieved (the only exception being a slightly ominous one, the Committee for the Free World, which Midge Decter closed down after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact), <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">NATO's essential aim has not been permanently achieved</span></span>. True, the Soviet threat is gone; but <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">a nuclear-armed and potentially unstable Russia is still in the game</span></span>; a major conflict has just been fought in the very Balkans which sparked the First World War; <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">and there are a number of potential wars and civil wars lurking in</span></span> such regions as the Tyrol, the Basque country, Northern Ireland (not yet finally settled), Corsica, Belgium, Kosovo, and Eastern <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">Europe</span></span> and the Balkans generally where, it is said, &quot; every England has its Ireland, and every Ireland its Ulster.&quot; <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">If none of these seems to threaten the European peace very urgently at present, that is in part because the existence of NATO makes any such threat futile and even counter-productive</span></span>. No nation or would-be nation wants to take NATO on. And if not NATO, what? There are international bodies which could mediate some of the lesser conflicts: the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe is explicitly given that responsibility, and the European Union is always itching to show it can play a Big Power role. But neither body has the military heft or the prestige to deter or repress serious strife. The OSCE is a collective security organization, and as Henry Kissinger said of a similar body: &quot;When all participants agree, there is no need for it; when they split, it is useless.&quot; And the EU only made itself look ridiculous when it attempted to halt the Bosnian conflict in its relatively early stages when a decisive intervention might have succeeded. <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">As for dealing with a revived Russian threat, there is no military alliance in sight other than NATO that could do the job. In a sense, NATO today is Europe's defense</span></span>. Except for the American forces, <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">Western armies</span></span> can no longer play an independent military role. They <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">are wedded to NATO structures and dependent on NATO, especially American, technology</span></span>. (As a French general admitted in the Gulf War: &quot;The Americans are our eyes and ears.&quot;) <span class="underline0"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">If NATO were to dissolve--even if it were to be replaced by some European collective defense organization such as a beefed-up Western European Union--it would invite chaos as every irredentist faction sought to profit from the sudden absence of the main guarantor of European stability</span></span>.<br />

[Otfried – Director of the Berlin Information Center for Transatlantic Security. “NATO’s Nuclear Posture Review: Should Europe End Nuclear Sharing?” BITS Policy Note, 2002 lexis<em>GBS-JV]</em><br />
<br />
<em>This policy note does not pretend to solve that dilemma by suggesting a possible European conceptual approach. It discusses a single measure that could become part of such an approach:<span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;"> Should Europe’s non-nuclear NATO members that are participating in NATO nuclear sharing give up the technical capability to employ sub-strategic nuclear weapons in times of war</span></span>? This questions runs counter to those questions likely to be raised during NATO’s nuclear review. However, it represents one option for working on a European approach. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bits.de/public/policynote/pn02-1.htm#top" rel="nofollow">2. The proposal</a></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">The simple answer is: Yes. Those European nations having a capability to use U.S. nuclear weapons in times of war, should and could revoke that capability. They can do so. If they would do so, for the first time non-nuclear nations </span></span>– beyond rejecting to become nuclear powers - <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">would make a substantial contribution to support the declared common goals of strengthening nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. Those non-nuclear NATO members that have the technical capacity to use nuclear weapons in times of war can renounce it without losing security or political influence</span></span> – and ought to do so in accordance with the Alliance’s 2000 Summit Communiqué as well as the results of the 2000 NPT Review Conference. Nevertheless, <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">they could continue to play their role in NATO nuclear planning. All six nations concerned can jointly take that decision</span></span>. If a joint decision is not reached, important NATO members like Germany should pioneer the idea. According to this policy note, <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">such a step</span></span> would constitute a central new impulse for nuclear disarmament. It <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">would facilitate the process towards additional steps of nuclear disarmament which could for the first time open the way for dismantling thousands of sub-strategic nuclear weapons that are no longer needed or usefu</span></span>l<span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">; would be an important contribution to strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime since it removes the cause for doubts whether nuclear sharing is in compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty</span></span> (Art I and II); would contribute to reducing the role of nuclear weapons in NATO's strategy. The Alliance's nuclear policy could be better brought in line with the 1996 ru-ling of the International Court of Justice. This policy note presents additional findings important for European governments having to consider such a move: <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">Nuclear consultation rights remain in effect if non-nuclear NATO members renounce the technical capability to use nuclear weapons in case of war</span></span>. <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">Nuclear deterrence remains effective, as does intra-Alliance solidarity which finds its expression in sharing the risks, roles, and responsibilities resulting from NATO’s nuclear strategy. The internal cohesion of the alliance will benefit since the repeated debates about zones of different security will become irrelevant once all non-nuclear NATO members are participating in the Alliance’s nuclear policy in a homogeneous way. Finally, the divergent national nuclear interests within NATO to some extent will be harmonized; this can be used constructively to reinforce the non-proliferation and disarmament policies of the Alliance.</span></span></em><br />
