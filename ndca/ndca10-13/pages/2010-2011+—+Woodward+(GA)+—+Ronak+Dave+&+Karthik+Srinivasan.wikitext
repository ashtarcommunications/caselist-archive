===Plan=== 

Thus the plan:

The United States federal government should substantially draw down its military presence in Afghanistan by shifting from a counter-insurgency strategy to a counter-terrorism strategy that reduces its military footprint to the minimum level needed to help train Afghan security forces, prevent massive human rights atrocities, resist an expansion of Taliban control beyond the Pashtun south, and engage in robust counter-terrorism operations as needed including a decrease to 68,000 troops or less by October 2011 and 30,000 or less by July 2012.

We’ll clarify.

===Solvency=== 

__Contention Four: Solvency__

First—the plan is a __substantial reduction in military presence__ —this __saves billions__ and __reduces resentment__ .

2. Scale back and eventually Suspend … <span class="underline">**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">intrusive military <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">presence </span></span>**</span>.

Second—the plan enables a shift to more effective counter-terrorism operations—reducing military presence is key.

3. Keep the focus on Al Qaeda and … <span class="underline">**<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; font-size: 12pt;">military presence declines </span>**</span>.

Fourth—shifting to counter-terrorism is the most effective strategy—it reduces casualties, reassures allies, and keeps the pressure on extremists.

<span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The lesson learned from … and quickly as possible </span></span>.


Fifth—the plan is key to prevent precipitous withdrawal—public support makes a long-term COIN posture politically untenable.

It follows that <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; font-size: 12pt;">the most difficult … **traction** </span>**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">in the region </span>**</span>.


Sixth—pessimistic predictions about the consequences of a drawdown are wrong—we’ll beat their disads with this card alone.

Second, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; font-size: 12pt;">a U.S. drawdown </span>**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">…increase the threat from Al Qaeda </span>**</span>.
