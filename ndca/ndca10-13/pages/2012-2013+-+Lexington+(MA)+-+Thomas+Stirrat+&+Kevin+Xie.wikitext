===Contention 2 Is The State of Intimate Terror=== 
**We start off with a poem from La Frontera, by Gloria Anzaldúa**

**She has this fear that she has no names that she has many names that she doesn’t know her names She has this fear that she’s an image that comes and goes clearing and darkening the fear that she’s the dreamwork inside someone’s else’s skull She has this fear that if she takes off her clothes shoves her brain aside peels off her skin that if she drains the blood vessels strips the flesh from the bone flushes out the marrow She has this fear that when she does reach herself turns around to embrace herself a lion’s or witch’s or serpent’s head will turn around swallow her and grin She has this fear that if she digs into herself she won’t find anyone that when she gets “there” she won’t find her notches on the trees the birds will have eaten all the crumbs She has this fear that she won’t find the way back.**

**The state of intimate terrorism has multiple selves – the self that is oppressed by the Mexican world, the self that is oppressed by the Anglo world, and the only place for resistance is the self in between – the woman of color does NOT FEEL SAFE WITHIN THE INNER LIFE OF HER SELF**
