Cocaine AC- Plan
Chafel defines people in need
"A prime example of people in need are persons living in poverty...A major trend on a substantial number of people living in poverty is that they are drug abusers specifically of things like cocaine." Source: Child Poverty & Public Policy p.56 Google Books
Aff Ground) Aff parameterized to a specific group of people, especially people in poverty as drug abusers of cocaine.
Stable Advocacy) Advocating a plan means I can't shift what args I go for in the 1AR--key to fairness

V) Morality

Korsegaard 92// "[we must] explain what the source of morality in human nature is...

S) Abiding by moral obligations.
Korsegaard 2// "morality is grounded in human sentiments..."

Plan Text) I advocate that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) should institute a compulsory anti-cocaine vaccination program for persons living in poverty.
Solvency Advocate Stevenson 2k4// "If narrower groups were the focus of the immunization, groups at higher risk for abuse..."
Cocaine is the new currency fir Russian Suitcase Bombs 30,000 potential nuclear warheads are up for grabs, the Cocaine Trade also provides profits for Russian Mafia to facilitate proliferation of Russian warheads and expertise.
Watan, Arabi 98// "terrorists smuggle nuclear warheads..."
Impact-
Nuke terrorism ----> extinction
Gordon 2k2// "the existence of WMD now renders..."

Russian Mafia uses cocaine market for profit and power Johnson 2k1// "Russia is turning into a sort of 'New gold' for Colombian..."

Independently, retaliation following even an unsuccessful terrorist attack would kill hundreds of millions
Easterbrook 2k1// "Should a terrorist organization be able to get a nuclear weapon..."
Next, My interpretation is that the neg should defend either the status quo or a competitive policy option.

Standards:
1) Time Skew
