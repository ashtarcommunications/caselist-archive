Bus services have improved significantly under the ADA. Universal design features such as low

Equity in transportation is an important civil rights issue. It is critical to the

access to affordable and reliable transportation. We therefore make the following recommendations.
RECOMMENDATIONS The disability and broader civil rights community must continue to work together for a
