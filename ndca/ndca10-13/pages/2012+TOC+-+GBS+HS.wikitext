<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">Until now, fears of a nuclear war in the Middle East have generally focussed on Iraq.

Newly endowed with a so-called "Prime Minister," this state, although itself non-nuclear, </span>__would greatly heighten the prospect of catastrophic nuclear war__<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> in the area. If all goes well for the United States in Operation Iraqi Freedom, President Bush will feel compelled to reward Arab state allies and supporters with a dedicated American effort to create a Palestinian state. </span>__This state__<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">, tied closely to a broad spectrum of terrorist groups and </span>__flanking 70 percent of Israel's population, would utterly eliminate Israel's remaining strategic depth.

Significantly, a strong emphasis on preemption has now become the recognizable core of President Bush's national security policy for the United States. Several ironies must also be noted.
