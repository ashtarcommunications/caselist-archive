**Observation One: A Failure of Imagination**

**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14pt;">B) Our interpretation:</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14pt;">The judge should endorse the best psychological approach to the resolution.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14pt;">This necessarily requires affirmation. It requires saying ‘yes’ to Mars, ‘yes’ to exploration, and ‘yes’ to the topic itself.</span>**

**D) Our Method**
**The negative will attempt to map out the topic and psychologically attempt to silence the soul within the topic by trying to empiricize and literalize it, looking at implementation, and attempting to get the upper hand. The entire ethos of traditional debate is one that tries to fix, control, and cure the symptoms and problems in the world instead of being open to the world as it presents itself. This is the plan of archetypal psychology: to explore our deep psychological commitments and affirm our most terrorizing images of the world**

**To explore is to is to be open to, or to stand in wonder of. By entering into the image of Mars and discovering its archetypal qualities, we can metaphorically empower our conception of the red planet**

**A) Framework**
**The psyche exists and comes first – it shapes our understanding of the world – everything depends on it**
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Jung 57 </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">(Carl G., renowned scholar of psychoanalysis and founder of the Jung Institute, __The Undiscovered Self__, New American Library, New York, 81-83)</span>
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">For more than fifty years we have known</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 13.3333px;">AND </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 13.3333px;">observed every day and can happen to everyone.</span>

**B) War is normal and inevitable – our history is one of wars – between 2 and 3 per year for all of human history**
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Hillman 04</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 13.3333px;"> (James, retired Director of the Jung Institute, “A Terrible Love of War”, The Penguin Press, ISBN 1-59420-011-4, pgs 17-18)</span>
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Halt! Is war abnormal? I find </span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 13.3333px;">societies-</span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">commemorate the salvational aspect of battle</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 13.3333px;">.</span>

**C) Link: Modern warfare exchanges the battlefield for distant command centers where the enemy can be eliminated with the push of a button – this doesn’t engage our desire to fight - instead of hating war we should embrace it – only then can we repair the psyche**

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 13.3333px;">Why dwell on this archaic god of war </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 13.3333px;">AND </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 13.3333px;">and maneuvers of the mind would be enough.</span>

**D) Impacts**
**Peace is merely the absence of war – it leaves us in a state of psychic numbness**
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Hillman 04 </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">(James, retired Director of the Jung Institute, “A Terrible Love of War”, The Penguin Press, ISBN 1-59420-011-4, pgs 30-31)</span>
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">The worst of war is that it ends </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 13.3333px;">AND </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 13.3333px;">offended Jesus that he declared for a sword.</span>

**And, that takes out the soul – humans become hollow beings that can’t relate to the world around us**
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Walter A</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"> Davis in 2001</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> (//Deracination: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative.// State Univesrity of New York Press, p. 95-96)</span>
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">It is never enough</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> however. Inner discord </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">AND </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">ghostly articulation in Kant’s struggle with the sublime. </span>

**E) The alternative is to love war.**
**Instead of going to war in the name of peace, we should enter war for war’s own sake. This means setting aside our fear and distaste for conflict so we can imagine ourselves embroiled in beautiful strife.**
**Also, the alternative comes first and is a prerequisite to aff solvency because war is the primary psychological task that shapes all of our notions about society – unless we come to terms with the war in each of us, our desire for war will lash out and push us closer and closer to annihilation.**
