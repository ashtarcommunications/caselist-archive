*Observation 2 is Nuclearism: * 
**<span style="color: black;">Our mentality of “strategy” and “tactic” in regards to nuclear weapons solidifies our dependence on them, which is central to the idea of nuclearism</span>**

Arms control is a tool to ensure military dominance - the US demands others disarm while maintaining its own arsenal for 'safekeeping'. Activist calls for disarmament are simply extensions of the war machine designed for co-option and preservation of the military industrial complex.

And, this calculative, detached rational ignores nuclear atrocities resulting in a view of ‘usability’ towards nuclear weapons, making nuclear violence and extinction inevitable.

And, nuclear posturing is based in a genocidal ideology which treats life as disposable - this culminates in nuclear genocide
