=Mission Statement= 
**Hey guys, Britain here. I'll tell you a little bit about us, as well as our goals in this activity called debate. We are both Nazi's and Zionists. We are here to tear down your racist discourse [Brick by brick, of course], and replace it with our (obviously) non-gendered discourse. Anyone who thinks mildly different than myself is a fascist and certainly caused the zero point of the holocaust. Kylie and I are most likely nihilists, but only because your 1AC destroyed any previous value to life. We don't really believe in this thing called switch-side debate, but almost participate in it because we're conformists. We're a bit of Nietzsche, wrapped up in Heidegger, with a little Bataille sprinkled on top. Dropping to us is inevitable, embrace it.**

==1AC - PROTEST== 
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; font-variant: small-caps; line-height: 24px;">**The day was February 15th, 2003: in the largest show of protest in human history millions protested in over 800 cities worldwide against the immanent US invasion of Iraq. However, when the weekend ended and the war machine plugged along with business as usual, the masses stood silent: they didn’t know what came next. And so they disbanded – the resistance disappeared, and a month later Operation Iraqi Freedom began. Everyone just went back to work, and acted like the rallies never happened. It appears rorty, walt, and shively have failed us - simply knowing about government policies has proven to be wholly ineffective to challenge the political. When the peace movement was at its strongest, protesting a war built on a bed of lies, it was also at its weakest. The people are missing – the protesting masses have become a silent majority. Instead of remaining trapped in this traditional framework, prefer a molecular politics of experimentation.**</span>
__This is Gilbert et. al in 2008__
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(February 2008, Jeremy Gilbert, organizer and chair of the roundtable, “Deleuzian politics? A roundtable discussion.” Participants include Claire Colebrook, Eric Alliez, Peter Hallward, and Nicholas Thoburn, pgs. 165-175, [CL]) </span>

**<span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;">Jeremy</span>**<span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;">: Peter - Éric has raised the question, which is of course the urgent one, of </span>**//__<span style="color: windowtext;">how we can….</span>__//**__<span style="color: windowtext;">: you have to have some condition for analysing it. And isn’t that what micropolitics is about? </span>__


**The Stop the War protest movement didn’t __just__ disappear, rather, it was reclaimed by the State; captured within the channels of acceptance. The demonstrations that started out as a mass expression of desire had become overcoded as tolerable opposition – at a very real level the Stop the War Campaign established a direct confluence of interests with State officials. How we engage the political is fundamentally a uniqueness question: Leftist movements as a whole in the last decade have resorted to a repressive politics of symbolic comfort in which protesters police themselves! This co-opted resistance not only makes any form of meaningful political engagement impossible, but actively seeks to deter other expressions of politics: the price has been the endless global wars and genocide under militarist expansion.**
**__This is Ward Churchill in 2007__**
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Ward Churchill, American-Indian activist with AIM, former professor for University of Colorado at Boulder, “Pacifism as Pathology: reflections of the role of armed struggle in North America”, pgs. 48-62, [CL]) </span>
__The question central to the emergence and maintenance of nonviolence as the oppositional foundation of American activism__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> …-thinking people but ultimately acceptable when compared with the unthinkable alternative that any degree of real violence might be redirected against “mother country radicals.” </span>


**This subordination of desire to fear in the face of police lines and threats from the outside world has transformed the State into a war machine. Liberalism asks us to surrender and be safe – war is permeating throughout all of society. Everything is a battlefield: war is being waged on culture, politics and the individual as much as in Iraq. In this way, war is an immanent thing, dispersed everywhere and nowhere at the same time, a ghost war on all of society. The war machine has placed us in a constant state of emergency by its own doing: fear has turned us all into cannibals, desiring our own domination and servitude. If we have to die, better to die in the open air than in an underground sarcophagus. You should challenge the politics of fear and endless war-mongering with a contraption of your own.**
**__This is Daniel Bell in 2007__**
<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: 12.75pt;">(Daniel M., Associate Professor of Theological Ethics, Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory, JCRT 8.2 SPRING 2007 55,d [[http://www.jcrt.org/archives/08.2/]]) </span>

<span style="line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Like Hobbes and Foucault, </span><span class="underline">Deleuze holds that life is constituted by motion…</span>__<span style="color: windowtext;">we will have to look elsewhere. To this alternative we now</span>__ __<span style="color: windowtext;">turn.</span>__ </span>


**Thus the plan:**

**The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence in Iraq.**

**We affirm a politics of continuation and flux - a constantly shifting and moving political hydra that can never be located or contained in one place, never killed in one fell swoop. We would like to change the way that we relate to war and the State – rather than grabbing our picket signs and walking in front of the capital chanting for change, we affirm experimentation with what it means to protest and be an activist. Activism should be a site for infinite combinations, a constant moving-towards revolution in which all of politics is an immanent process rather than a goal. We will always defend the consequences of removing troops, but it is important to note the political climate and ideologies that would have to exist for that to happen. We will never say the plan won’t happen, only describe the context in which its passage is pragmatic.**


**We think it’s time to try again: our solution is not just a political treatment, it’s an evolution. We begin with the way political formations occur in the status quo – movements formulate themselves around broader ideological and political reference points which act as transcendent signifiers constantly coding and directing potential. Even the most revolutionary aims can be tainted by underlying desires which inform the unconscious. Our affirmation takes place at the level of the preconscious, at the level of desires and instincts. Absent our investigation, we’ll inevitably lose control of the political. Rather than ceding ground to the State, we think that engaging the political is the best thing we can do. you shouldn’t get lost in talking about the revolution; rather, we think our affirmation has everything to do with the creation of mutations and escapes. We see ourselves as a blueprint for change, a normative roadmap: revolutions shouldn’t be left to the experts in the halls of Congress, this dooms us to captured forms of activism only that end in misery and death. Ceding the political makes a repeat of history inevitable: global war and depression on repeat. Vote aff to re-invent politics – a revolutionary philosophy.**

**the structure of the 1ac reveals that it works within the rule of enframing – they “observe” the knowledge presented under the guise of objectivity, attempting to perfectly understand it and ultimately to arrive at some certain truth. their attempts to persuade you by insisting upon this monopoly over truth serve to shut down meditative thinking and furthermore destroy the essence of things by eclipsing their concreteness and ignoring their essential contexts. a meditative approach to observing would remain open to the revealing of things as things and respect the mystery inherent in that reveal and therefore attempts to persuade by awakening that truth withuin which the listener is already present. we approach truth not as something to be fully and finally uncovered, but as something present already before us to which we might be more attuned.**
**Joseph 2000** (Aloysius, Duquesne University, Speaking Differently: Deconstruction/Meditative Thinking as the Heart of "the Faculty of Observing", Janushead, 3.1, [[http://www.janushead.org/3-1/ajoseph.cfm]] )
Introduction 
Aristotle, in Book I, Chapter 2, of his Rhetoric says, "Rhetoric may be defined as the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion" (Roberts, 1954, p. 24). This probable ("may be") definition of rhetoric is significant. First, it lends itself to be read in many ways, and second, it shows us that what is at the heart of epideictic rhetoric is probability and not certainty. In this paper I offer a meditative (thinking) reading of the phrase, "the faculty of observing" in conjunction with discerning the available means of persuasion as posited in this definition.1 At the outset it can be stated that meditative thinking/deconstruction2 is not aimed at specifying a technique to choose "the available means of persuasion." Rather it is that which describes the "essence" of observation. Hence, in this paper I also wish to show that the genuine rhetor is one "who dwells" as one would in meditative thinking. 
Observation as meditative thinking: "a letting be" 
From a Heideggerian perspective, the phrase, "the faculty of observing" has significant implications for meditative thinking/deconstruction. If as Cicero says, "Eloquence is wisdom spoken wisely," then observation facilitates the rhetor to speak wisely so as to be able to persuade and stir up a disposition amidst the audience. Heidegger (1953/1996) alludes to this in his phenomenal work, Being and Time, when he writes, "Publicness as the kind of being of the they not only has its attunedness, it uses mood and 'makes' it for itself. The speaker speaks to it and from it. He needs the understanding of the possibility of mood in order to arouse and direct it in the right way" (138-139). Hence, to be persuasive a rhetor needs first of all to observe. It could then be said that "observation" is the condition upon which choosing the appropriate means of persuasion rests. But we may ask, "Is this not common sense?" It reminds us of the English proverb, "Look before you leap." Yet what is to be borne in mind is that because the rational-scientific framework has permeated common sense so much, it cannot be taken for granted that observing or looking is merely a commonsensical activity. The technological and commercial Enframing of this epoch has such a powerful grip over every aspect of human life that common sense has lost its place as conventional wisdom. Besides, in trying to make human life comfortable and highly efficient, technology has succeeded in creating a desensitized human world. Looking or observing loses its passion in such a world that prioritizes distant, dispassionate and objective observation. 
Hence, from a rationalistic and technological perspective, observation or looking is detached seeing. The goal of detached seeing is to arrive at certain knowledge and truth. The observer through detached seeing abstracts the essential qualities of a thing in the effort to understand and interpret it. This leads to clear and valid knowledge. But from an existential-phenomenological perspective, such an approach is impoverished. First of all, such a disengaged (detached seeing) activity robs a thing of its concreteness and its embodiment. Second, this process of abstraction/detached seeing (however convincing and certain it is) is oblivious to the context which makes the thing what it is. These two aspects make observation as detached seeing, in the rational-scientific system, a barren and passionless activity. 
But observation in a radical sense is respect for the phenomena. In his essay, "The Thing," Heidegger (1971b) points to this radical sense of observation which can be characterized as the "essence" of meditative thinking. He writes, "If we let the thing be present in this thinging from out of the worlding world, then we are thinking of the thing as thing" (p. 181). Observation as meditative thinking is radical because the rhetor lets the thing be thing in the way it shows itself -- in its concreteness ("thinging") and its situatedness ("worlding world"). But for the rhetor who affiliates with the rational-scientific tradition, an abstract, passionless and decontextualized observation has its payoffs. The persuasion that arises out of such an affiliation is commercially viable given the profit-oriented and competitive socio-cultural arena that every discipline (arts and sciences) has unwittingly bought into. Within such a structure, the skilful and persuasive speaker is one who possesses the skill to convince the listeners to concede to truth irrespective of its concreteness and situatedness. The monopoly over truth at which this approach arrives is gained through a process of elimination and exclusion such that the listeners are precluded from its multiple and genuine alternatives and possibilities. Through such exclusionary means the speaker and all those who subscribe to such a prescriptive approach to truth thereby become the sole owners of the truth by means of expropriation and exploitation. On the other hand, a rhetor (the one who observes with a passion) enables/facilitates/shows how we live and move in truth through inclusive and non-reductionistic ways. This is truly pedagogical and educative for it persuades by "bringing forth"; not because the speaker has a monopoly over truth, but because the listeners live and share in it already. The work of the rhetor is to awaken them to what they already know. It is in this context that epideictic rhetoric is important. We have no new information introduced; rather, the quality of the phenomena is amplified. 
From a Heideggerian perspective, observing takes on a different meaning as it is based on a radically different assumption. As Hoy (1993) writing on the hermeneutic turn in Heidegger points out: 
Heidegger's strategy is different from the Cartesian strategy, which starts by assuming a basic ontological disconnection (e.g., between mental and physical substance) and then looks for instances of epistemological connection that cannot be doubted (e.g., the knowledge of the existence of a thinking subject). Heidegger's strategy is to see Dasein as already in the world, which suggests that what needs to be explained is not the connection, which is the basis, but the disconnection (p. 176).
The disconnection or the disruption is that which is appealing to the eye of the rhetor who observes by participating. Hence, observation as meditative thinking is to pay attention to the "disconnection" that shows itself in the activity of hovering over as long as we can endure it. To take this a step further, we could say that when the rhetor can endure or stay persistent with this unsettling experience, then the circularity of hermeneutics (through a persistent inhabitation of the phenomenon) gives way to an elliptical movement that is in "essence" elusive and indeterminate. Derrida (1973) calls our attention to this radical difference in what can be called a "project" of deconstruction. He makes an appropriate observation in this regard when he writes: 
There is then, probably no choice to be made between two lines of thought; our task is rather to reflect on the circularity, which makes the one pass into the other indefinitely. And, by strictly repeating this circle in its own historical possibility, we allow the production of some elliptical change of site, within the difference involved in repetition; this displacement is no doubt deficient, but with a deficiency that is not yet, or is already no longer, absence, negativity, nonbeing, lack, silence. Neither matter nor form, it is nothing that any philosopheme, that is, any dialectic, however determinate, can capture. It is an ellipsis of both meaning and form; it is neither plenary speech nor perfectly circular. More and less, neither more nor less -- it is perhaps an entirely different question. (p. 128)
On the part of the rhetor who endures, the latter movement allows for a "re-cognition" of this elusive and disruptive/displacing nature of that which shows itself. In this sense, observation as meditative thinking/deconstruction is respect for the phenomena. In such a movement, we could contend with John D. Caputo (1987) that the observer-participant rhetor is never in a privileged position or the sole owner in regard to what shows itself in meditative thinking/deconstruction. He observes: 
In an a-lethic view, whatever shows itself, whatever comes forth, issues from hidden depths. We know we cannot touch bottom here, that we cannot squeeze what stirs here between our conceptual hands, cannot get it within our grip, cannot seize it round about. The mystery is self-withdrawing, self-sheltering. And that is what gives rise to respect. (p. 276)
Hence, in Heideggerian terms, observation could be seen as akin to letting go or "letting be," which is radical detachment or detached attachment. The genuine rhetor is one who cultivates a respectful disposition as regards the "faculty of observing" and "the available means of persuasion" vis-à-vis that which needs to be spoken about. 


**the 1ac claim to “observe” knowledge is fundamentally based on their role as seeing, knowing subject and the 1ac as a permanent, static, object projected and represented from their subjectivity. this is the modern gestell, ruled by enframing, meaning they engage the 1ac violently as a resource standing in reserve to be consumed.**
**Levin 99** (David Michael, Ph.D., Prof Em of Philo @ Northwestern, “The Philosopher’s Gaze: Modernity in the Shadows of Enlightenment” Gestalt Gestell Geviert: The Way of the Lighting, pp116-169)
In order to understand the perceptual Gestalt as a site and instance of enframing, it is necessary to reflect on perception as a process of articulation, a process of bringing-forth. What is distinctive about the way that perception under the sway of enframing articulates and brings forth a figure-ground Gestalt? “Enframing”, Heidegger says, “challenges forth into the frenziedness of ordering that blocks every view of the coming-to-pass of revealing and so radically endangers the relation [of human beings] to the essence of truth.” Although enframing “comes to pass as a destining of revealing” it is “a destining that gathers together into the revealing that challenges forth.” Although, under the spell of enframing, perception still takes part in a process of unconcealment and effects a certain bringing-forth, its interaction with the presencing of being tends to become a “challenging-forth into ordering,” an “ordering of the real as standing reserve.” Such perception is of course disclosive, but it is also at the same time deeply forgetful, willfully concealing the openness of the ground, the gift of the field in which, and by grace of which, it takes place – and even repressing the fact of this willful concealment: “The Open [itself] becomes an object, and is thus twisted around toward human beings.”Under the spell of enframing, then, perception is never far from violence; its knowledge, in fact, is a power that can only come from aggression and torture. The Gestalt, therefore, essentially undergoes a process that it would not be an exaggeration to describe as its disfigurement: “the original emergence and coming-to-be of energies,…becomes a visibility of things that are already there…the eye, vision, becomes a mere looking-at or looking-over or gaping-at.” These words come from Heidegger’s 1936 Introduction to Metaphysics. But it is clear that he already understood this point much earlier, because, in Being and Time, a work which leads us through a strenuous learning-process toward the achievement of a “moment of vision”, he called attention to our inveterate tendency to fall into “a fixed staring at something that is purely present-at-hand.” Under the cold stare of the gaze, the spontaneously “emerging power” presencing in and as the Gestalt is “hardened” into a state of permanent presence, “deprived of the possibility of appearing spontaneously” – deprived, also, of its radiance, its Schein. With regard to the question of this dullness, this loss of radiance, perhaps it will suffice for the moment to note, here, just two decisive passages: [1] in Being and Time, Heidegger asserts that, “in ‘setting down the subject’, we dim entities down to focus.” [2] In “The Question Concerning Technology,” Heidegger says that “Enframing blocks off the shining forth and holding sway of truth.” With regard to the “hardening into permanence,” Heidegger argues, in Basic Concepts, that “presencing does not mean mere presence, but emerging and opening up…mere presence, in the sense of the present-at-hand, has already set a limit to presencing, emergence, and has thus given up presencing.” In elaborating this point, he observes that “what presences only presences in emerging and precisely not in the presence that has congealed into permanence.” “It belongs,” he says, “to the essence of presencing that its possible non-essence of hardening into something permanent is repelled in it.” All these assertions gain significance when they are understood concretely as phenomenological observations referring to the emergence and dissolution of the figure-ground structures that form in the event of perception and depend on the way our looking and seeing let them emerge, bringing down, drawing them forth, out of the encompassing field of visibility. Most in question, perhaps, and most at stake, is our attitude towards the ground: whether or not its dynamism, its openness, its dimensionality, is granted by the corresponding receptive openness of our perception – our willingness, for example, to let perception be decentered, drawn into abysses of invisibility, radically surprised. As an ontologically oriented capacity, perception calls upon to “engage oneself with the open region and its openness into which every becoming comes to stand.” Elaborating this point, with words (“not to lose myself”) that echo Schelling’s, quoted at the beginning of this study, Heidegger explains that: To engage oneself with the disclosedness of beings is not to lose oneself in them; rather, such engagement withdraws in the face of beings in order that they might reveal themselves with respect to what and how they are and in order that presentative correspondence might take its standard from them. Moreover, this comportment requires an acceptance of concealment: “letting-be,” he says “is intrinsically at the same time a concealing. In the ek-sistent freedom of Dasein…there is concealment.” We need to give thought to the social, cultural, and political significance of the disruptive and anarchic ontological “standard” or “measure” implicit in this engagement, this way of looking and seeing. Gestalt psychology has demonstrated the organic interdependencies, the reciprocally altering interactions that are constitutive of an undisturbed Gestalt formation process. Insisting that “a theory of perception must be a field theory,” Kohler points out, for example, that “objects show a considerable change in size when they are located within a region which has been strongly influenced by a figure.” This means, he says, that the after-effects of such figure-forming processes tend to alter given visual objects. “Prolonged inspection of any specific visual trends,” he notes, “to change its organization. Moreover, other objects which are afterwards shown in the same region of the field are also affected, namely displaced or distorted.” Consequently, as the fixation of a staring gaze, the enframing typical of Gestell interrupts the figure-ground interplay and distorts both figure and ground. Instead of a dynamic, spontaneously, flowing interaction between figure and ground, a looser, freer, softer differentiation between the periphery and the center of focus, deconstructing the metaphysical dualism that prioritizes the center, there is a “freezing” of the flow, interrupting the work of time – the emergence and dissolution of perceptual configurations. And when the figure is subject to such reifying intensity, it becomes detached from its ground, although it is the opening openness, the end-less origin of the figures that enframing brings forth, its presencing is either forgotten, suppressed, neglected, or else it is submitted to the most extreme ontic reduction – as if it could be possessed by the ecological subject as just another figure. Herbert Guenther notes that the openness of the perceptual ground “is present in and actually presupposed by every determinate form. Every determinate entity evolves out of something indeterminate and to a certain extent maintains its connection with this indeterminacy; it is never completely isolated from it. Because the indeterminate entity is not isolated from the indeterminacy…, our attention can shift back and forth between one and the other.” The enframing gaze cannot, will not, let the ground be ground; it cannot, will not, tolerate its immeasurableness, its withdrawal from the grasp of perception, its refusal to be totalized, reified, possessed. Instead of a gaze that is softly focusing, gently hovering, open and receptive to the dynamics of change, open and receptive to the spontaneous emergence of new configurations taking place in the dimensions of the surrounding field; instead of a gaze that “withdraws in the face of beings in order that they might reveal themselves,” in the epoch of enframing there is a tendency for the gaze to become aggressively dualistic – sharp, linear, and atomizing. This is the gaze that has installed – and continues to serve – a metaphysics of reified presence, a metaphysics of closure, violence and mortification. This reification is a persistent theme in Heidegger’s thought, something he clearly articulated in Being and Time and repeatedly emphasized in subsequent lectures and writings. In a 1941 course on Anaximander, for example, Heidegger declared that “permanence is contrary to the…essence of being…but what presences essentially and yet contrary to the essence is the non-essence…to the extent that what respectively presences corresponds to the essence of presencing, it does not consist in and solidify into duration unto permanence.” What resists measure, limitation, finitude, what refuses the ordinance of time, that Anaximander regards as άδιχία, injustice. According to Heidegger, in the world of Greek antiquity people did not relate to what is as to an inwardly conceived image or representation. For the Greeks, what is is what presences; and this experience with perception did not involve looking at what is and having a representation of it in mind; nor did it involved making the one who is looking into a “subject” and making what is presencing into an ‘object”. This construction is a distinctive mark of modernity. It is only in the modern period – the period beginning with the self-affirmation of “Man” in the humanism of the sixteenth century and with a way of looking at the world reintroduced and carried forward, albeit in very different projects, by the Cartesianism and empiricism of the seventeenth century and by the rationalism and romanticism of the eighteenth – that what is present is determined [1] as an ob-ject, [2] as being there for a subject, [3] as (re)presented by the subject to itself, [4] as placed to lie before the subject, and finally, therefore, [5] as present in the form of a representation. In and with this determination of what is present, the ever increasing power of the subject is claimed and asserted. As Derrida correctly remarks in “Sending: On Representation,” Vorstellung “marks the gesture which consists of placing, of causing to stand before one, of installing in front of oneself as available, of localizing ready-to-hand, within the availability of the preposition…The subject is what can or believes it can offer itself representations, disposing them and disposing of them.”Now, Heidegger argues that what is distinctive of modernity – and the cause of his concern – is not so much the fact that experience can be a process of representation as it is the fact that representation is universalized, that it becomes the sole medium for all experiencing, and that its way of relating to what is present encourages us in the attitude of domination. And this means that it encourages us in an attitude that does violence to the background of perception, either by simply forgetting its way of presencing, or by gathering it into the Gestalt in a reified re-presentation of presencing. 


**A WORLD SUBSUMED BY CALCULATIVE TECHNOLOGICAL THOUGHT DESTROYS OUR ONTOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP IN SUCH A WAY THAT THINGS CEASE TO BE THINGS IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. OUR INSTANT ACCESS TO EVERYTHING AS A TOOL FOR USE OBLITERATES THE ESSENTIAL BEING OF ALL THINGS MAKING EVEN TOTAL PLANETARY DESTRUCTION A RADICALLY LESS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND A LIKELY INNEVITABILITY.**
**Caputo 93** (john, Demythologizing Heidegger, p. 136-41)
The essence of technology is nothing technological; the essence of language is nothing linguistic; the essence of starvation has nothing to do with being hungry; the essence of homelessness has nothing to do with being out in the cold. Is this not to repeat a most classical philosophical gesture, to submit to the oldest philosophical desire of all, the desire for the pure and uncontaminated, not to mention the safe and secure? (2) In his essay "The Thing" Heidegger remarks upon the prospect of a nuclear conflagration which could extinguish all human life: Man stares at what the explosion of the atom bomb could bring with it. He does not see that what has long since taken place and has already happened expels from itself as its last emission the atom bomb and its explosion—not to mention the single nuclear bomb, whose triggering, thought through to its utmost poten­tial, might be enough to snuff out all life on earth. (VA, 165/PLT, 166). In a parallel passage, he remarks: ... [Man finds himself in a perilous situation. Why? Just because a third world war might break out unexpectedly and bring about the complete annihilation of humanity and the destruction of the earth? No. In this dawning atomic age a far greater danger threatens—precisely when the danger of a third world war has been removed. A strange assertion! Strange indeed, but only as long as we do not meditate. (G, 27/DT, 56). The thinker is menaced by a more radical threat, is endangered by a more radical explosiveness, let us say by a more essential bomb, capable of an emission (hinauswerfen) of such primordiality that the explosion (Explosion) of the atom bomb would be but its last ejection. Indeed, the point is even stronger: even a nuclear bomb, or a wholesale exchange of nuclear bombs between nuclear megapowers, which would put an end to "all life on earth," which would annihilate every living being, human and nonhuman, is a deriva­tive threat compared to this more primordial destructiveness. There is a pros­pect that is more dangerous and uncanny—unheimhcher—than the mere fact that everything could be blown apart (Auseinanderplatzen von allem). There is something that would bring about more homelessness, more not-being­at-home (un-Heimlich) than the destruction of cities and towns and of their inhabitants. What is truly unsettling, dis-placing (ent-setzen), the thing that is really terrifying (das Entsetzende), is not the prospect of the destruction of human life on the planet, of annihilating its places and its settlers. Further­more, this truly terrifying thing has already happened and has actually been around for quite some time. This more essential explosive has already been set off; things have already been destroyed, even though the nuclear holocaust has not yet happened. What then is the truly terrifying<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">? </span>The terrifying is that which sets everything that is outside (heraussitzl) of its own essence (Wesen)'. What is this dis-placing [Entsetzendel? It shows itself and conceals itself in the way in which everything presences (anwest), namely, in the fact that despite all conquest of distances the nearness of things remains absent. (VA, 165/P1.T, 166) The truly terrifying explosion, the more essential destruction is that which dis-places a thing front its Wesen, its essential nature, its ownmost coming to presence. The essential destruction occurs in the Being of a thing, not in its entitative actuality; it is a disaster that befalls Being, not beings. The destruc­tiveness of this more essential destruction is aimed not directly at man but at "things" (Dirge), in the distinctively Heideggerian sense. The Wesen of things is their nearness, and it is nearness which has been decimated by technological proximity and speed. Things have ceased to have true nearness and farness, have sunk into the indifference of that which, being a great distance away, can be brought close in the flash of a technological instant. Thereby<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, </span>things have ceased to be things, have sunk into indifferent nothingness. Something profoundly disruptive has occurred on the level of the Being of things that has already destroyed them, already cast them out of (herauswerfen¬) their Being. Beings have been brought close to Us technologically; enor­mous distances are spanned in seconds. Satellite technology can make events occurring on the other side of the globe present in a flash; supersonic jets cross the great oceans in a few hours. Yet, far from bringing things "near," this massive technological removal of distance has actually abolished nearness, for nearness is precisely what withdraws in the midst of such technological frenzy. Nearness is the nearing of earth and heavens, mortals and gods, in the handmade jug, or the old bridge at Heidelberg, and it can be experienced only in the quiet meditativeness which renounces haste. Thus the real destruction of the thing, the one that abolishes its most essen­tial Being and Wesen, occurs when the scientific determination of things pre­vails and compels our assent. The thingliness of the jug is to serve as the place which gathers together the fruit of earth and sun in mortal offering to the gods above. But all that is destroyed when pouring this libation becomes instead the displacement of air by a liquid; at that moment science has suc­ceeded in reducing the jug-thing to a non-entity (Nichtige). Science, or rather the dominion of scientific representation, the rule of science over what comes to presence, what is called the Wesen, which is at work in science and technol­ogy, that is the truly explosive-destructive thing, the more essential dis-placing. The gathering of earth and sky, mortals and gods, that holds sway in the thing—for "gathering" is what the Old High German thing means—is scat­tered to the four winds, and that more essential annihilation occurs even if the bomb never goes off: Science's knowledge, which is compelling within its own sphere, the sphere of objects, already had annihilated things long before the atom bomb exploded. The bomb's explosion is only the grossest of all gross confirmations of the long-since accomplished annihilation of the thing. (VA, 168/PLT, 170J When things have been annihilated in their thingness, the mushroom clouds of the bomb cannot be far behind. So whether or not the bomb goes off is not essential, does not penetrate to the essence of what comes to presence in the present age of technological proximities and reduced distances. What is essential is the loss of genuine nearness, authentic and true nearness, following which the actual physical annihilation of planetary life would be a "gross" confirmation, an unrefined, external, physical destruction that would be but a follow-up, another afterthought, a less subtle counterpart to a more inward, profound, essential, authentic, ontological destruction.


**the objectificattion of the world at the hands of the gaze of the 1ac is the root of suffering and vioelnce and is inseperable from racism and all forms of hatred. as an attempt to posit an alternative approach to visuality we attempt to open our eyes to blindness – we approach vision as what heidegger calls “the lighting” which is to say as a hermeneutical interplay between concealment and unconcealment which respects the abyss of that which is unconcealed and thereby subverting the sovreignty of the gaze and denying its power. this move is absolutely essential in that any inclusion of the will to power driven gaze of the 1ac destroys the alternative and results in totalitarian tyranny.**
**Levin 99** (David Michael, Ph.D., Prof Em of Philo @ Northwestern, “The Philosopher’s Gaze: Modernity in the Shadows of Enlightenment” Gestalt Gestell Geviert: The Way of the Lighting, pp116-169)
Following the passage on the interpretation of which we have just been reflecting, Heidegger asks:
Why is it that we stubbornly resist considering even once whether the belonging-together of subject and object does not arise from something that first imparts their nature to both the object and its objectivity, and the subjectivity, and hence is prior to the realm of their recipricrocity?
Carrying this question forward in the direction that Heidegger’s preceding discussion would suggest, we are led to the thought that subject and object are gathered together and belong together in and by grace of the field of the field of the lighting-that elemental presencing of being which opens up, lays down, and gathers a field of visibility. It is the lighting that first joins subject and gathers a field of visibility. It is the lighting that, in its configuration as ground, offers and submits itself to the conditions of perceptivity that rule in the life of a mortal. But in modern times, this “mortal” has become an ego-logical subject: someone who, constituting himself as a subject, focuses on what is present and turns it into an object, a figure split off from the dynamic ground, the surrounding contextual referential field. If our time is “our of joint,” so is the figure-ground Gestalt. 
This splitting off, of subject from object, figure from ground, and the Gestalt itself from the presence of the lighting, is symptomatic of the antagonisms that persist in our deeply divided and still unreconciled society. And when we consider what this splitting means when the “object” of the gaze in another “subject” –when it is a question of how another “subject” is looked at, faced, seen, made to figure in the figure-ground Gestell-then we are approaching the root of the suffering, rage, and violence distinctive of the contemporary world. How different social relations would be if they could be deeply rooted, by virtue of an awareness (Stimmung) that does not presently form very often, in a felt sense of being gathered together in to the underlying unity of the lighting, a felt sense of belonging together in the Laying-down-that-gathers-and of having always already belonged together, gathered through the gift of that lighting, in a dimension of being “prior to the realm of their reciprocity” ! Stereotyped, reifying perceptions of the other, ways of looking at others that are inseparable from racism, nationalism, and ethnic hatreds, would be more difficult to sustain, if the awareness toward which Heidegger is gesturing were to be cultivated as the subsoil in which our vision needs to be well rooted. 
To be sure, as Heidegger says, “the jointure thanks to which revealing and concealing are mutually joined must remain the invisible of all invisibles, since It [is that which] bestows shining on whatever appears.” It must be certainly protected from the will to total visibility, because if not properly cared for, its gift of light and darkness would fall and negation, placed at the disposal of the dominant will to power; and the peoples of the world would eventually be left without any place to hide from totalitarian tyranny and terror. But this possibility, this danger, makes it all the more necessary that we not let the invisibility, the withdrawal of the jointure fall into total oblivion, absolute negation. We need to make this jointure visible in our world: visible, however, as the invisible of all invisibles. And this means that our looking and seeing must let themselves be appropriate by this invisibility, becoming, through their capacity for ontological recollection, its hermeneutic organ, protecting and preserving its necessary withdrawal. 
This interpretation points toward the need for a historically different way of looking and seeing a way of looking and seeing that obeys in care the way of the lighting. Heidegger continues:
If we think it [i.e., the presencing of being] as lighting, this includes not only the brilliance, but also the openness wherein everything, especially the reciprocally related, comes into shining. Lighting is therefore more illuminating, and also more than laying bare. Lighting is the meditatively gathering bringing-before into the open. It is the bestowal of presencing. 
According to Heidegger, “The event of lighting [das Ereignis der Lichtung) is the world. The meditatively gathering lighting which brings into the open is revealing; [but] it abides in self-concealing. Thus it is necessary that, in virtue of our way of looking and seeing, we protect and preserve the self-concealment of the lighting, while at the same time opening to this “event” and letting it come into its own by gathering it into our way and making it visible hermeneutically as that which opens up our world.
Heidegger’s discussion of the lighting is haunted, however, by deep-and well-founded-anxieties. What concerns him is the danger that, in spite of all his precautions, reference to this lighting will be misunderstood. For the self-giving of the lighting both is and is not a lighting, a light we can see. Taking place within the realm of the visible, it can appear only as that which visibly withdraws from the reach of our vision. Thus, most of all, Heidegger is worried that the “event,” the giving, of the lighting- the wonder of gift, that there is light- will be degraded by a reduction to the physics and optics of light. “The lighting,” he says,” is no mere brightening and lightening.” And that is because what he is trying to get us to see is a “revealing-concealing lighting concerned with the presencing of what is present.” Appealing, in spite of the terrible dangers, to our capacity, our potential for vision, he tells us that “the lighting not only illuminates what is present, but gathers it together and secures it in advance in presencing.” Thus, were our own way of looking and seeing to become a recollection and mimetic repetition of this gift of lighting-or, in other words, were our way to become an ontologically appropriate, ontologically appropriated, it would, in its own way, become a gathering, a vision of the Geviert, gathering earth and sky, gods and mortals.
Because we are being gifted with a capacity-to-see the potential of which still remains unrealized and unfulfilled, the gift of the lighting-the wonder that Es gibt lighting-makes a claim on us: a claim that burdens us with the responsibility to realize our great potential for vision, our capacity for responsiveness, our response-ability. Gods and men, says Heidegger, 
Are not only illuminated in the lighting, but are also enlightened from it and toward it. Thus they can, in their own way, accomplish the lighting (bringing it to the fullness of its essence) and thereby protect it.... [moreover, because they receive this lighting and are dependent on it,] they are appropriated into the event of lighting, and are never concealed. On the contrary, they are revealed, thought in still another sense [i.e., in that the claim of this lighting on their responsiveness, e.g., on their responsibility for “using” their capacity to perceive it, puts them on trial]. Just as those who are far distant belong to the distance, so are the revealed-in the sense now to be thought-entrusted [zugertraut] to the lighting that keeps and shelters them.
As beings of sight, we are dependent on the gift of the lighting, and therefore are entrusted to it. But we are also thereby entrusted with it, because the lighting can come into its own, or come back to itself “in fullness of its essence” (as Heidegger puts it), only through the mediation of our way of looking and seeing. For it is only by (the) virtue of our looking and seeing that the lighting can be made visible hermeneutically, visible as the coming of the lighting which first makes our vision possible. Furthermore, the coming of the lighting, as the interplay of concealment and unconcealment within which all that is comes to presence, can be protected and preserved only by (the) virtue of a way of seeing and looking that [1] makes it visible in its invisibility, acknowledging our finitude, our limited horizons, and the immeasurable abyss of the invisible, and that thereby [2] respects the withdrawal and self-concealment of the lighting, protecting and preserving it, instead of violently penetrating its abodes of concealment with an insolent demand for total visibility, total clarity, total control. The lighting gives us light but it also subverts that sovereignty of the gaze, leading it into the shadows, into the dark, into the realms of semblance and deception; obstructing its powers of penetration; compelling submission to the invisible beyond being. The lighting opens our eyes-to blindness. 
Following Heraclitue, who was merciless in criticizing the ways of his contemporaries, Heidegger formulates his own criticism of the looking and seeing that predominates in the contemporary world. He writes: 
Mortals are irrevocably bound to the revealing-concealing gathering which lights everything present in its presencing. But they turn from the lighting, and turn only toward what is present, which is what immediately concerns them in their everyday commerce with each other.... They have no inkling of what they have been entrusted with: presencing, which in its lighting first allows what is present to come to appearance. In the lighting of which they come and go, remains concealed from them and forgotten.
As Heidegger is quick to point out, however, the recollection of the lighting cannot take place in a perception, a way of looking and seeing, for example, that is grasping, possessive, driven by the will to power: 
The golden gleam of the lighting’s invisible shining cannot be grasped, because it is not itself something grasping. Rather, it is the purely appropriating even [das reine Ereignen]. The invisible shining of the lighting streams from the wholesome self-keeping in the self-restraining preservation of destiny [Geschick].

**we begin with bataille’s solar anus as the sight of transgression of the sun as a figure of illumination and knowledge and the knowing gaze. bataille presents us instead with a sun that blinds the gaze, loves its inverse, and discovers its own impotence. it is precisely at the moment that the sun, knowledge, attempts to assert its dominance over the dark mysteries of night that it must have its throat slashed, must be rendered the black solar anus.**
**Bataille 85** (Georges, French pervert, “Visions of Excess: Selected Writings, 1927-1939” Ed. By Allan Stoekl, The Solar Anus, p. 9)
Love, then, screams in my own throat; I am the Jesuve, the filthy parody of the torrid and blinding sun. 
I want to have my throat slashed while violating the girl to whom I am to say: you are the night. 
The Sun exclusively loves the Night and directs its luminous violence, its ignoble shaft, toward the earth, but it finds itself incapable of reaching the gaze or the night, even though the nocturnal terrestrial expanses head continuously toward the indecency of the solar ray.
The solar annulus is the intact anus of her body at eighteen years to which nothing sufficiently blinding can be compared except the sun, even though the anus is the night.

**IT IS WITH THIS IN MIND THAT WE TURN TO THE FIRST AFFIRMATIVE CONSTRUCTION. THE 1AC’S SUBMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE UNDER THE SIGN OF VISIBLE, THEIR IMPLIED ASSERTION THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PERFECTLY SEE AND DIAGNOSE THE WORLD, PLACES ALL OF KNOWLEDGE AND REALITY UNDER THE DOMINANCE OF THE VISUAL. THEY BELIEVE IN THE VIRILE POWER OF THE SUN TO ILLUMINATE THE WORLD PERFECTLY BEFORE THEIR PENETRATING GAZE. THIS SUBMISSION IS NOT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE – IT IS THE VERY LOGIC OF THE PRIMACY OF VISION, THE PANOPTIC TRIUMPH THAT UNDERPINS THE CLINICAL GAZE AT THE HEART OF BIOPOLITICAL CONTROL. AT THE HEART OF THE NOTION THAT POPULATIONS CAN BE DIAGNOSED AND ANESTHETIZED IS THE ASSUMED ABILITY OF THE STATE TO PERFECTLY SEE AND KNOW THE BODY POLITIC.**
**Siisiäninen 2008** (Lauri, political science researcher @ U of Jyväskylä, “From the Empire of the Gaze to Noisy Bodies: Foucault, Audition, and Medical Power” Theory and Event, 11:1)
 When it comes to the role of audition in the sensorial triangle of clinical experience, Foucault's argumentation takes quite an interesting turn: 
 "But one must not loose sight of the essential. The tactile and auditory dimensions did not purely and simply come to be added to the domain of vision. The sensorial triangulation indispensable to anatomo-clinical perception remains under the dominant sign of the visible (sous le signe dominant du visible): firstly, because this multi-sensorial perception is nothing but a manner of anticipating that triumph of the gaze (ce triomphe du regard), which will be the autopsy; the ear and hand are nothing but temporary substitute organs (des organes provisoires de remplacement) anticipating for the death to render to the truth the luminous presence of the visible (la présence lumineuse du visible). . . And above all, the alterations discovered by anatomy concern 'the shape, the size, the position and the direction' of organs or their tissues. . . that is, spatial data (des données spatiales) that belong by right of origin (par droit d'origine) to the gaze." [[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn13|13]]
 As it comes out in this passage, Foucault argues that one should not let the appearance of the sensorial triangulation lead to any illusions about the equality between the three senses at play. Even if touch and audition did have a role in the formation of clinical perception, it was actually limited to their function as nothing but vision's temporary substitutes or "representatives", ones that were in the end reducible to visual experience. In other words, Foucault's strong thesis is that in the formation of clinical perception – in the first opening of the individual body to medical knowledge and intervention – touch and audition did not have any irreducible, indispensable or autonomous significance, the sort of significance reserved for the gaze and visual experience. In stead, the only place left for audition was a position of dependency and submission – a subservient position – under the dominant sign of the visible. 
? The passage quoted shows also that in Foucault's understanding, the truth constituted in the clinical-medical discourse was still determined (in rather classical sense, we could add) utterly by the interrelated terms of visibility, luminosity and presence, accomplished (in practice) only in the opening of the dead corps in autopsy. This means that auditory perception (hearing and the ear) as such did not strictly speaking participate directly to the medical truth and knowledge, the truth of health/pathology, normality/abnormality of an individual body. The clinical-medical truth was constituted by the visible presence of the body to the gaze, not to auditory experience. The only possible "legitimate" contribution of audition to the formation of truth in the clinical discourse was that of a subservient instrument or a temporary, dispensable substitute for vision, one that itself was lacking the capacity of "luminous presence" of truth. The fate of audition in the clinical form of knowledge was to become in the end extinguished in the true goal and fulfillment of medical examination: i.e., in the final triumph of the gaze, in the grasping of the visible truth, where auditory experience no longer has anything to contribute. Thus, the "sensory hierarchy" organizing the triangle becomes quite clearly stated: audition remains firmly submitted under the pre-eminence of vision. In the hierarchic setting, the fate of audition is to become subjugated under, reduced to and in the end extinguished in and by the dominant sign of the visible. 
2. The "Right-of-Origin"- Argument and the Empire of the Gaze
 There is still one turn in Foucault's argumentation on the role of audition in clinical experience – one that becomes articulate in the quotation already discussed – in need of particular emphasis here. As the quotation already shows, Foucault presents an argument concerning what belongs by right of origin (par droit d'origine) to vision and not to hearing. The capacity to collect spatial facts or spatial data (des données spatiales), the capacity to discover spatial objects are capacities that belong "by right of origin" to vision, not audition. As it comes to the anatomo-clinical perception and experience, this means that the capacity to locate "the being of the disease with its causes and effects in a three-dimensional space", [[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn14|14]] as also the capacity to grasp "the shape, the size, the position and the direction of organs or their tissues", [[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn15|15]] in other words the central functions determining clinical experience, belong by right of origin to sight, not to hearing. It is in this irreparable lack, in the incapacity to form spatial-objective experience, that we find the actual reason why audition did not and cannot make any "equal" or symmetrical, irreducible, autonomous and dispensable contribution (but only as a temporary, subservient, indispensable substitute operating under the dominance of vision and gaze) to clinical-medical knowledge or, as it seems logical, to any form of knowledge determined by the spatial-objective form. We should notice, that although auditory perception is defined by the non-spatiality, Foucault doesn't argue that auditory perception would be defined by temporality. Only the lack, the incapacity of spatiality becomes the defining characteristic of audition distinguishing it from vision. 
 The reader should notice that Foucault does not in fact develop this right-of-origin – argument by any reference to the corpus of historical documents he otherwise uses in the study (the works of Laënnec and others). The argument is not actually presented as an interpretation of historical sources at all. It is Michel Foucault himself, who argues here on the right-of-origin difference between vision and audition. It is Foucault himself who states the difference, the juxtaposition of "audio" and "visual", in terms of the unique capacity of vision and the essential incapacity of audition, when it comes to spatial-objective experience. Foucault's argument might come as a surprise, for it is hardly archaeological (in the sense Foucault gives to this term) in character: It is not about the historical conditions of possibility, the difference in capacity/incapacity between vision and audition in the context of a specific historical discursive formation. To argue what vision can and what audition cannot do by right of origin – that is, irrespective of any historical-discursive context – seems to come close to arguing on the conditions of possibility as such, on the trans-historical limits of experience and on the difference between faculties in the strong (transcendental) Kantian sense.[[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn16|16]]
 It is by relying on the idea of audition as the essentially non-spatial and non-objective sense, as opposed to the spatial-objective capacities of vision, not on the basis of historical analysis that Foucault can deny the possibility of audition's equal/indispensable/autonomous contribution and significance to the birth of the clinic and argue for the necessity of audition's reduction to and subjugation under the domination of the gaze. If this is the case, how can one avoid reaching the conclusion that in presenting the right-of-origin- argument, Foucault commits himself to what he first of all consistently set out to dismantle in his archaeologies (and subsequently in his genealogies): the conception of the subject as the possessor of different faculties, with a given, trans-historical coherence and a permanent structure? 
 As we know, the formation of clinical experience – making the individual subject/body into the object of medical knowledge and intervention – is a thoroughly political event for Foucault (this is the case already in The Birth of the Clinic). The birth of the clinical experience –bringing to knowledge and truth the normality/pathology of the individual/singular body – was intrinsically interrelated to the development of the modern form of power and politics. It is through the development of clinical experience that the exercise of this modern form of power, surveying and taking charge of the health/normality of each singular living body and of the social body as a whole, took a decisive step forwards. As we know, in his later works as well, Foucault recurrently comes back to the formation of clinical-medical perception, observation and surveillance, still giving these a central political significance in the modern disciplinary, normative and bio-political dispositive or governmentality. In its operation, the medical power means the traversal and penetration of the whole social space by the clinical perception and experience. Thus, the issue of "audio-visual" difference, their right-of-origin juxtaposition, turns out to be a deeply political issue as well.[[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn17|17]]
 Inasmuch as Foucault argues (this we have already seen) audition to be, by right of origin, without any independent, irreducible significance in the formation of clinical experience (remaining firmly submitted under the dominant sign of the visible), it follows that audition cannot have any significance in the medicalized form of power- and politics either. In the last instance, the meaning of medicalization is brought back to the circulation of the medical gaze (le regard médical). It is the gaze, not audition, which exercises "in the entire space, all the time, a mobile and differentiated surveillance." [[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn18|18]] Foucault concludes his analysis of medicalized power/politics in rather categorical terms, well in line with the right-of-origin- argument: "the gaze that sees is a gaze that dominates (le regard qui voit est un regard qui domine)", making the modern society as such the "empire of the gaze without partitions (l'empire sans cloison du regard)." [[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn19|19]]

**THIS REVALS THE BLINDSPOT IN THEIR OBSERVING - THE DARK UNDERSIDE OF THEIR KNWOING SUN, THE UGLINESS OF THE AFFIRMATIVE’S UNDERSTANDING OF POLITICS AND KNOWLEDGE AS A VISIBILE BODY TO BE SURVEILLED, MANAGED, PROJECTED, AND ULTIMATELY DIAGNOSED AND CURED IS THE POWER TO ASSIGN VALUE AND ELIMINATE UNDERSIRABLE ELEMENTS WHICH PLAYS OUT AS RACISM AND GENOCIDE DEPLOYED IN THE NAME OF DEFENDING LIFE AND TRUTH.**
**Giroux 6** (Henry, the Global TV Network Chair Professorship at McMaster University in the English and Cultural Studies Department, “Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class, and the Biopolitics of Disposability,” College Literature, Vol. 33, No. 3)
Within the last few decades, matters of state sovereignty in the new world order have been retheorized so as to provide a range of theoretical insights about the relationship between power and politics, the political nature of social and cultural life, and the merging of life and politics as a new form of biopolitics. While the notion of biopolitics differs significantly among its most prominent theorists, including Michel Foucault (1990, 1997), Giorgio Agamben (1998, 2002, 2003), and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri (2004), what these theorists share is an attempt to think through the convergence of life and politics, locating matters of “life and death within our ways of thinking about and imagining politics” (Dean 2004, 17).Within this discourse, politics is no longer understood exclusively through a disciplinary technology centered on the individual body—a body to be measured, surveilled, managed, and included in forecasts, surveys, and statistical projections. Biopolitics points to new relations of power that are more capacious, concerned not only with the body as an object of disciplinary techniques that render it “both useful and docile” but also with a body that needs to be “regularized,” subject to those immaterial means of production that produce ways of life that enlarge the targets of control and regulation (Foucault 1997, 249). This shift in the workings of both sovereignty and power and the emergence of biopolitics are made clear by Foucault, for whom biopower replaces the power to dispense fear and death “with that of a power to foster life—or disallow it to the point of death. . . . [Biopower] is no longer a matter of bringing death into play in the field of sovereignty, but of distributing the living in the domain of value and utility. Its task is to take charge of life that needs a continuous regulatory and corrective mechanism” (Ojakangas 2005, 6). As Foucault insists, the logic of biopower is dialectical, productive, and positive 178 College Literature 33.3 [Summer 2006] (1990, 136).Yet he also argues that biopolitics does not remove itself from “introducing a break into the domain of life that is under power’s control: the break between what must live and what must die” (1997, 255). Foucault believes that the death-function in the economy of biopolitics is justified primarily through a form of racism in which biopower “is bound up with the workings of a State that is obliged to use race, the elimination of races and the purification of the race, to exercise its sovereign power” (258). 


**“When I was a little kid my mother told me not to stare into the sun. So once when I was six, I did. The doctors didn't know if my eyes would ever heal. I was terrified, alone in that darkness.”* FOR THE ALTERNATIVE WE TURN ONCE AGAIN TO GEORGES BATAILLE. bataille’s notion of the blind, uprooted eye IN THE STORY OF THE EYE implodes the cartesian underpinings of the modern understanding of vision that attempts to perfectly see and thus perfectly know the world. Bataille does this through TRANSGRESSION, WHICH is pushing a concept to its limit until it explodes. in terms of visuality then bataille presents an eye that is torn out and blinded. THE STORY OF THE EYE FURTHERMORE SIGNALS MOMENT WHEN LANGUAGE EXPLODES AND RADICALLY CHALLENGES ITSELF BY DISCOVERING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DEATH AND LANGUAGE IN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN LIMIT AND BEING. THE REPULSIVE NATURE OF BATAILLE’S STORY IS ESSENTIAL TO IT’S TRANSGRESSION.**
**Focault ’63** (Michel, “A Preface to Transgression”, Religion and Culture Michel Foucault, ed. By Jeremy Carrette, pp 57-71) *Max Cohen in “Pi” by Darren Aronofsky. 
Essentially the product of fissures, abrupt descents and broken contours, this misshapen and craglike language describes a circle; it refers to itself and is folded back on a questioning of its limits – as if it were nothing more than a small night lamp that flashes with a strange light, signaling the void from which it arises and to which it addresses everything it illuminates and touches. Perhaps, it is this curious configuration which explains why Bataille attributed such obstinate prestige to the Eye. Throughout his career (from his first novel to Larmes d’Eros), the eye was to keep its value as a figure of inner experience: ‘When at the height of anguish, I gently solicit a strange absurdity, an eye opens at the summit, in the middle of my skull’. This is because the eye, a small white globe encloses its darkness, traces a limiting circle that only sight can cross. And the darkness within, the sombre core of the eye, pours out into the world like a fountain which sees, that is, which lights up the world; but it is transformed into the bright night of an image. The eye is mirror and lamp: it discharges its light into the word around it, while in a movement that is not necessarily contradictory, it precipitates this same light into the transparency of its well. Its globe has the expansive quality of a marvelous seed – like an egg imploding towards the centre of night and extreme light, which it is and which it has just ceased to be. It is the figure of being in the act of transgressing its own limit.
The eye, in a philosophy of reflection, derives form its capacity to observe the power of becoming always more interior to itself. Lying behind each eye that sees, there exists a more tenuous one, an eye so discreet and yet so agile that its all-powerful glance can be said to eat away at the flesh of its white globe; behind this particular eye, there exists another, and, then, still others, each progressively more subtle until we arrive at the eye whose entire substance is nothing but the transparency of vision. This inner movement is finally resolved in a non-material centre where the intangible forms of truth are created and combined, in this heart of things which is the sovereign subject. Bataille reverses this entire direction: sight, crossing the globular limit of the eye, constitutes the eye in its instantaneous being; sight carries it away in this luminous stream (an outpouring fountain, streaming tears and, shortly, blood), hurls the eye outside itself, conducts it to the limit where it bursts out immediately extinguished flash of its being. Only a small white ball, veined with blood, is left behind, only an exorbitated eye to which all sight is now denied. And in the place from which sight had once passed, only a cranial cavity remains, only this black globe which the uprooted eye has made to close upon its sphere, depriving it of vision, but offering to this absence the spectacle of that indestructible core which now imprisons the dead glance. In the distance created by this violence and uprooting, the eye is seen absolutely, but denied any possibility of sight: the philosophizing subject has been dispossessed and pursued to its limit; and the sovereignty of philosophical language can now be heard from the distance, in the measureless void left behind by the exorbitated subject.
But perhaps the eye accomplishes the most essential aspect of its play when, forced from its ordinary position, it is made to turn upwards in a movement that leads it back to the nocturnal and starred interior of the skull and it is made to show us its usually concealed surface, white and unseeing: it shuts out the day in a movement that manifests its own whiteness (whiteness being undoubtedly the image of clarity, its surface reflection, but for this very reason, it cannot communicate with it, nor communicate it); and the circular night of the iris is made to address the central absence which it illuminates with a flash, revealing it as night. The upturned orb suggests both the most open and the most impenetrable eye: causing its sphere to pivot, while remaining exactly the same and in the same place, it overturns day and night, crosses their limit, but only to find it again on the same line and from the other side; and the white hemisphere that appears momentarily at the place where the pupil once opened is like the being of the eye as it crosses the limit of its vision – when it transgresses this opening to the light of day which defined the transgression of every sight. ‘If man did not imperiously close his eyes, he would finally be unable to see the things worth seeing’.
But what we need to see does not involve any interior secret or the discovery of a more nocturnal world. Torn from its ordinary position and made to turn inwards in its orbit, the eye now pours its light only into a bony cavern. This turning up of its globe may seem a betrayal of ‘la petite mort’, but, more exactly, it simply indicates the death that it experiences in its natural location, in this springing up in place which causes the eye to rotate. Death, for the eye, is not the always elevated line of the horizon, but the limit it ceaselessly transgresses in its natural location, in the hollow where every vision originates, and where this limit is elevated into an absolute limit by an ecstatic movements which allows the eye to spring up from the other side. The upturned eye discovers the bond that links language and death at the moment that it acts out this relationship of the limit and being; and it is perhaps from scenes that interrupt Bataille’s stories invariably concern the spectacle of erotic deaths, where upturned eyes display their limits and rotate inwards in gigantic and empty orbits. Bleu du ciel gies a singularly precise outline of this movement: early in November, when the earth of German cemetery is alive with the twinkling lights of candles and candle stubs, the narrator is lying with Dorothy among the tombstones; making love among the dead, the earth around him appears like the sky on a bright night. And the sky above forms a great hollow orbit, a death mask, in which he recognizes his inevitable end at the moment that pleasure overturns the four globes of flesh, causing the revolution of his sight.
The earth under Dorothy’s body was open like a tomb, her belly opened itself to me like a fresh grave. We were struck with stupor, making love on a starred cemetery. Each light marked a skeleton in a grave and formed a wavering sky as perturbed as our mingled bodies. I unfastened Dorothy’s dress, I dirtied her clothes and her breast with the fresh earth which was stuck to my fingers. Our bodies trembled like two rows of clattering teeth.
But what might this mean at the heart of thought? What significance has this insistent eye which appears to encompass what Bataille successively designated the inner experience, the extreme possibility, the comic process, or simply meditation? It is certainly no more metaphoric than Descartes’s phrasing of the ‘clear perception of sight’ or this sharp point of mind which he called aceis mentis. In the point of fact, the upturned eye has no meaning in Bataille’s language, can have meaning since it marks its limit. It indicates the moment when language, arriving at its confines, overlaps itself, explodes and radically challenges itself in laughter, tears, the overturned eye of ecstasy, the mute and exorbitated horror of sacrifice, and where it remains fixed in this way at the limits of its void, speaking of itself in a second language in which the absence of a sovereign subject outlines its essential emptiness and incessantly fractures the unity of its discourse. The enucleated or upturned eye marks the zone of Bataille’s philosophical language, the void into which it pours and loses itself, but in which it never stops talking – somewhat like the interior, diaphanous and illuminated eye of mystics and spiritualists that marks the point at which the secret language of prayer is embedded and choked by a marvelous communication which silences it. Similarly, but in an inverted manner, the eye in Bataille delineates the zone shared by language and death, the place where language discovers its being in the crossing of its limits: the non-dialectical form of philosophical language. 
This eye, as the fundamental figure of the place from which Bataille speaks and in which his broken language finds it uninterrupted domain, establishes the connection, prior to any form of discourse, that exists between the death of God (a sun that rotates and the great eyelid that closes upon the world), the experience of finitude (springing up in death, twisting the light which is extinguished as it discovers that the interior is an empty skull, a central absence), and the turning back of language upon itself at the moment that it fails –a conjunction which undoubtedly has no other equivalent than the association, well known in other philosophies, of sight to truth or of contemplation to the absolute. Revealed to this eye, which in its pivoting conceals itself for all time, is the being of the limit: ‘I will never forget the violent and marvelous experience that comes from the will to open one’s eyes, facing what exists, what happens’.
Perhaps in the movement which carries it to a total night, the experience of transgression brings to light this relationship of finitude to being, this moment of the limit which anthropological thought, since Kant, could only designate from the distance and from the exterior through language of dialectics.

**WE WILL NOW TEAR OUT THEIR EYES, SLASH THE THROAT OF THEIR SUN via a reading of georges bataille’s “story of the eye”. be warned – transgression requires bravery. bataille, like sade before him, isn’t for the faint of heart or easily offended. PARDON MY FRENCH.**
**Bataille 1928** (Georges, french pervert, “the story of the eye”, supervert.com )
It really was totally out of the question for Simone to lift her dress and place her bare behind in the dish of raw balls. All she could do was hold the dish in her lap. I told her I would like to fuck her again before Granero returned to fight the fourth bull, but she refused, and she sat there, keenly involved, despite everything, in the disembowelments of horses, followed, as she childishly put it, by "death and destruction,” namely the cataract of bowels. Little by little, the sun's radiance sucked us into an unreality that fitted our malaise-the wordless and powerless desire to explode and get up of our behinds. We grimaced, because our eyes were blinded and because we were thirsty, our senses ruffled, and there was no possibility of quenching our desires. We three had managed to share in the morose dissolution that leaves no harmony between the various spasms of the body. We were so far gone that even Granero's return could not pull us out of that stupefying absorption. Besides, the bull opposite him was distrustful and seemed unresponsive; the combat went on just as drearily as before. The events that followed were without transition or connection, not because they weren't actually related, but because my attention was so absent as to remain absolutely dissociated. In just a few seconds: first, Simone bit into one of the raw balls, to my dismay; then Granero advanced towards the bull, waving his scarlet cloth; finally, almost at once, Simone, with a blood-red face and a suffocating lewdness, uncovered her long white thighs up to her moist vulva, into which she slowly and surely fitted the second pale globule-Granero was thrown back by the bull and wedged against the balustrade; the horns struck the balustrade three times at full speed; at the third blow, one horn plunged into the right eye and through the head. A shriek of unmeasured horror coincided with a brief orgasm for Simone, who was lifted up from the stones eat only to be flung back with a bleeding nose, under a blinding sun; men instantly rushed over to haul away Granero's body, the right eye dangling from the head. Thus, two globes of equal size and consistency had suddenly been propelled in opposite directions at once. One, the white ball of the bull, had been thrust into the "pink and dark" cunt that Simone had bared in the crowd; the other, a human eye, had spurted from Granero's head with the same force as a bundle of innards from a belly. This coincidence, tied to death and to a sort of urinary liquefaction of the sky, first brought us back to Marcella in a moment that was so brief and almost insubstantial, yet so uneasily vivid that I stepped forward like a sleepwalker as though about to touch her at eye level.
The story continues a bit later...
"Sir Edmund," she said, rubbing her cheek gently on his shoulder, "I want you to do something.""I shall do anything you like," he replied. She made me come over to the corpse: she knelt down and completely opened the eye that the fly had perched on. "Do you see the eye?" she asked me. "Well?""It's an egg," she concluded in all simplicity. "All right," I urged her, extremely disturbed, “what are you getting at?" "I want to play with this eye." "What do you mean?" "Listen, Sir Edmund," she finally let it out, "you must give me this at once, tear it out at once, I want it!" Sir Edmund was always poker-faced except when he turned purple. Nor did he bat an eyelash now; but the blood did shoot to his face. He removed a pair of fine scissors from his wallet, knelt down, then nimbly inserted the fingers of his left hand into the socket and drew out the eye, while his right hand snipped the obstinate ligaments. Next, he presented the small whitish eyeball in a hand reddened with blood. Simone gazed at the absurdity and finally took it in her hand, completely distraught; yet she had no qualms, and instantly amused herself by fondling the depth of her thighs and inserting this apparently fluid object. The caress of the eye over the skin is so utterly, so extraordinarily gentle, and the sensation is so bizarre that it has something of a rooster's horrible crowing. Simone meanwhile amused herself by slipping the eye into the profound crevice of her ass, and after lying down on her back and raising her legs and bottom, she tried to keep the eye there simply by squeezing her buttocks together. But all at once, it spat out like a stone squeezed from a cherry, and dropped on the thin belly of the corpse, an inch or so from the cock. In the meantime, I had let Sir Edmund undress me, so that I could pounce stark naked on the crouching body of the girl; my entire cock vanished at one lunge into the hairy crevice, and I fucked her hard while Sir Edmund played with the eye, rolling it, in between the contortions of our bodies, on the skin of our bellies and breasts. For an instant, the eye was trapped between our navels." Put it up my ass, Sir Edmund," Simone shouted. And Sir Edmund delicately glided the eye between her buttocks. But finally, Simone left me, grabbed the beautiful eyeball from the hands of the tall Englishman, and with a staid and regular pressure from her hands, she slid it into hers lobbery flesh, in the midst of the fur. And then she promptly drew me over, clutching my neck between her arms and smashing her lips on mine so forcefully that I came without touching her and my come shot all over her fur. Now I stood up and, while Simone lay on her side, I drew her thighs , and found myself facing something I imagine I had been waiting for in the same way that a guillotine waits for a neck to slice. I even felt as if my eyes were bulging from my head, erectile with horror; in Simone's hairy vagina, I saw the wan blue eye of Marcelle, gazing at me through tears of urine. Streaks of come in the steaming hair helped give that dreamy vision a disastrous sadness. I held the thighs open while Simone was convulsed by the urinary spasm, and the burning urine streamed out from under the eye down to the thighs below…

Dropping ta us iz inevitable, embrace it.**

===Affirmative 1AC - PROTEST=== 
**da day wuz February 15th, 2003: in da largest show o' protest in human history millions protested in over 800 cities worldwide against da immanent US invasion o' Iraq. However, when da weekend ended an' da war machine plugged along wiff bidness as usual, da masses stood silent: dey didn’t know what came next. an' so dey disbanded – da resistance disappeared, an' uh month later Operation Iraqi Freedom began. brothas just go back ta werk, an' acted like da rallies never happened. It appears rorty, walt, an' shively gots failed us - simply knowing 'boutgovernment policies has proven ta be wholly ineffective ta challenge da political. When da peace movement wuz at its strongest, protesting uh war built on uh bed o' lies, it wuz also at its weakest. da niggas is missing – da protesting masses gots become uh silent majority. Instead o' remaining trapped in dis here traditional framework, prefer uh molecular politics o' experimentation.**
**dis here iz Gilbert et. al in 2008** (February 2008, Jeremy Gilbert, organizer an' chair o' da roundtable, “Deleuzian politics? uh roundtable discussion.” Participants include Claire Colebrook, Eric Alliez, Peter Hallward, an' Nicholas Thoburn, pgs. 165-175, [CL]) 
Jeremy: Peter - Éric has raised da queshun, which iz o' course da urgent one, o' how we's can….: ya gots ta gots some condition fo' analysing it. an' isn’t dat what micropolitics iz about? 

**da Stop da War protest movement didn’t just disappear, , it wuz reclaimed by da State; captured within da channels o' acceptance. da demonstrations dat started out as uh mass expression o' desire had become overcoded as tolerable opposition – at uh very real level da Stop da War Campaign established uh direct confluence o' interests wiff State officials. How we's engage da political iz fundamentally uh uniqueness queshun: Leftist movements as uh whole in da last decade gots resorted ta uh repressive politics o' symbolic comfort in which protesters po-po themselves! dis here co-opted resistance not only makes any form o' meaningful political engagement impossible, but actively seeks ta deter other expressions o' politics: da price has been da endless global wars an' genocide under militarist expansion.**
**dis here iz Ward Churchill in 2007** (Ward Churchill, American-Indian activist wiff AIM, former professor fo' University o' Colorado at Boulder, “Pacifism as Pathology: reflections o' da role o' armed struggle in North America”, pgs. 48-62, [CL]) 
da queshun central ta da emergence an' maintenance o' nonviolence as da oppositional foundation o' American activism …-thinkin` niggas but ultimately acceptable when compared wiff da unthinkable alternative dat any degree o' real violence might be redirected against “motha country radicals.”

**dis here subordination o' desire ta fear in da face o' po-po lines an' threats from da outside world has transformed da State into uh war machine. Liberalism asks us ta surrender an' be safe – war iz permeating throughout all o' society. Everything be uh battlefield: war iz being waged on culture, politics an' da individual as much as in Iraq. In dis here way, war iz an immanent thin`, dispersed everywhere an' nowhere at da same tyme, uh ghost war on all o' society. da war machine has placed us in uh constant state o' emergency by its own doin': fear has turned us all into cannibals, desiring our own domination an' servitude. If we's gots ta die, bettah ta die in da open air than in an underground sarcophagus. ya should challenge da politics o' fear an' endless war-mongering wiff uh contraption o' yo' own.**
**dis here iz Daniel Bell in 2007** (Daniel M., Associate Professor o' Theological Ethics, Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, Journal fo' Cultural an' Religious Theory, JCRT 8.2 SPRING 2007 55,d http://www.jcrt.org/archives/08.2/) 
Like Hobbes an' Foucault, Deleuze holds dat life iz constituted by motion…we's will gots ta peep elsewhere. ta dis here alternative we's now turn. 


**Thus da plan: da United States federal da system should substantially reduce its military presence in Iraq.**

**we's affirm uh politics o' continuation an' flux - uh constantly shifting an' moving political hydra dat can never be located or contained in one place, never ganked in one fell swoop. we's Wants ta change da way dat we's relate ta war an' da State – than grabbing our picket signs an' walking in front o' da capital chanting fo' change, we's affirm experimentation wiff what it means ta protest an' be an activist. Activism should be uh site fo' infinite combinations, uh constant moving-towards revolution in which all o' politics iz an immanent process than uh goal. we's will always defend da consequences o' removing troops, but it iz important ta note da political climate an' ideologies dat would gots ta exist fo' dat ta happen. we's will never say da plan won’t happen, only describe da context in which its passage iz pragmatic.**

**we's th'o't it’s tyme ta try ag'in: our solution iz not just uh political treatment, it’s an evolution. we's begin wiff da way political formations occur in da status quo – movements formulate themselves around broader ideological an' political reference points which act as transcendent signifiers constantly coding an' directing potential. Even da most revolutionary aims can be tainted by underlying desires which inform da unconscious. Our affirmation takes place at da level o' da preconscious, at da level o' desires an' instincts. Absent our investigation, we's’ll inevitably lose control o' da political. than ceding ground ta da State, we's th'o't dat engaging da political iz da bomb thin` we's can do. ya shouldn’t git lost in jivin' 'boutthe revolution; , we's th'o't our affirmation has everything ta do wiff da creation o' mutations an' escapes. we's see ourselves as uh blueprint fo' change, uh normative roadmap: revolutions shouldn’t be left ta da experts in da halls o' Congress, dis here dooms us ta captured forms o' activism only dat end in misery an' death. Ceding da political makes uh repeat o' history inevitable: global war an' depression on repeat. Vote aff ta re-invent politics – uh revolutionary philosophy.**
**Patton in 2007** (Paul, “Political Normativity an' Post-structuralism: da case o' Gilles Deleuze”, Vortrag ins Institutscolloquium des Philosophischen Instituts der Freien Universität, Berlin, be Donnerstag, den 15. November 2007, pgs. 5-12 [CL]) da normativity o' Deleuze an' Guattari’s concepts provides uh framework … biotechnologies gives reason ta th'o't dat da opening-up o' decision making procedures throughout society constitutes uh further vector o' ‘becoming-democratic.’

**da structure o' da 1ac reveals dat it werkz within da rule o' enframing – dey “observe” da knowledge presented under da guise o' objectivity, attempting ta perfectly dig' it an' ultimately ta arrive at some certain truth. they attempts ta persuade ya by insisting upon dis here monopoly over truth serve ta shut down meditative thinkin` an' furthermore destroy da essence o' things by eclipsing they concreteness an' ignoring they essential contexts. uh meditative approach ta observing would remain open ta da revealing o' things as things an' respect da mystery inherent in dat reveal an' therefore attempts ta persuade by awakening dat truth withuin which da listener iz already present. we's approach truth not as somethin` ta be fully an' finally uncovered, but as somethin` present already 'bfoe us ta which we's might be mo' attuned.** 
**Joseph 2000** (Aloysius, Duquesne University, Speaking Differently: Deconstruction/Meditative Thinkin` as da Heart o' "da Faculty o' Observing", Janushead, 3.1, http://www.janushead.org/3-1/ajoseph.cfm ) Introduction Aristotle, in Book ah, Chapter 2, o' his Rhetoric says, "Rhetoric may be defined as da faculty o' observing in any given case da available means o' persuasion" (Roberts, 1954, p. 24). dis here probable ("may be") definition o' rhetoric iz significant. First, it lends itself ta be read in many ways, an' second, it shows us dat what iz at da heart o' epideictic rhetoric iz probability an' not certainty. In dis here paper ah offer uh meditative (thinkin`) reading o' da phrase, "da faculty o' observing" in conjunction wiff discerning da available means o' persuasion as posited in dis here definition.1 At da outset it can be stated dat meditative thinkin`/deconstruction2 iz not aimed at specifying uh technique ta choose "da available means o' persuasion." it iz dat which describes da "essence" o' observation. Hence, in dis here paper ah also wish ta show dat da genuine rhetor iz one "who dwells" as one would in meditative thinkin`. Observation as meditative thinkin`: "uh letting be" From uh Heideggerian perspective, da phrase, "da faculty o' observing" has significant implications fo' meditative thinkin`/deconstruction. If as Cicero says, "Eloquence iz wisdom spoken wisely," then observation facilitates da rhetor ta speak wisely so as ta be able ta persuade an' stir up uh disposition amidst da audience. Heidegger (1953/1996) alludes ta dis here in his phenomenal werk, Being an' tyme, when he writes, "Publicness as da kind o' being o' da dey not only has its attunedness, it uses mood an' 'makes' it fo' itself. da speaker speaks ta it an' from it. He needs da understanding o' da possibility o' mood in order ta arouse an' direct it in da right way" (138-139). Hence, ta be persuasive uh rhetor needs first o' all ta observe. It could then be said dat "observation" iz da condition upon which choosing da appropriate means o' persuasion rests. But we's may ax, "iz dis here not common sense?" It reminds us o' da cracker ass english proverb, "peep 'bfoe ya leap." Yet what iz ta be borne in mind iz dat cuz da rational-scientific framework has permeated common sense so much, it cannot be taken fo' granted dat observing or looking iz merely uh commonsensical activity. da technological an' commercial Enframing o' dis here epoch has such uh powerful grip over every aspect o' human life dat common sense has lost its place as conventional wisdom. Besides, in trying ta make human life comfortable an' highly efficient, technology has succeeded in creating uh desensitized human world. Looking or observing loses its passion in such uh world dat prioritizes distant, dispassionate an' objective observation. Hence, from uh rationalistic an' technological perspective, observation or looking iz detached seeing. da goal o' detached seeing iz ta arrive at certain knowledge an' truth. da observer through detached seeing abstracts da essential qualities o' uh thin` in da effort ta dig' an' interpret it. dis here leads ta clear an' valid knowledge. But from an existential-phenomenological perspective, such an approach iz impoverished. First o' all, such uh disengaged (detached seeing) activity robs uh thin` o' its concreteness an' its embodiment. Second, dis here process o' abstraction/detached seeing (however convincing an' certain it iz) iz oblivious ta da context which makes da thin` what it iz. deez two aspects make observation as detached seeing, in da rational-scientific system, uh barren an' passionless activity. But observation in uh radical sense iz respect fo' da phenomena. In his essay, "da Thin`," Heidegger (1971b) points ta dis here radical sense o' observation which can be characterized as da "essence" o' meditative thinkin`. He writes, "If we's let da thin` be present in dis here thinging from out o' da worlding world, then we's is thinkin` o' da thin` as thin`" (p. 181). Observation as meditative thinkin` iz radical cuz da rhetor lets da thin` be thin` in da way it shows itself -- in its concreteness ("thinging") an' its situatedness ("worlding world"). But fo' da rhetor who affiliates wiff da rational-scientific tradition, an abstract, passionless an' decontextualized observation has its payoffs. da persuasion dat arises out o' such an affiliation iz commercially viable given da profit-oriented an' competitive socio-cultural arena dat every discipline (arts an' sciences) has unwittingly ganked into. Within such uh structure, da skilful an' persuasive speaker iz one who possesses da skill ta convince da listeners ta concede ta truth irrespective o' its concreteness an' situatedness. da monopoly over truth at which dis here approach arrives iz gained through uh process o' elimination an' exclusion such dat da listeners is precluded from its multiple an' genuine alternatives an' possibilities. Through such exclusionary means da speaker an' all those who subscribe ta such uh prescriptive approach ta truth thereby become da sole owners o' da truth by means o' expropriation an' exploitation. On da other hand, uh rhetor (da one who observes wiff uh passion) enables/facilitates/shows how we's live an' move in truth through inclusive an' non-reductionistic ways. dis here iz truly pedagogical an' educative fo' it persuades by "bringing forth"; not cuz da speaker has uh monopoly over truth, but cuz da listeners live an' share in it already. da werk o' da rhetor iz ta awaken dem ta what dey already know. It iz in dis here context dat epideictic rhetoric iz important. we's gots nahh new 411 introduced; , da quality o' da phenomena iz amplified. From uh Heideggerian perspective, observing takes on uh different meaning as it iz based on uh radically different assumption. As Hoy (1993) writing on da hermeneutic turn in Heidegger points out: Heidegger's strategy iz different from da Cartesian strategy, which starts by assuming uh basic ontological disconnection (e.g., between mental an' physical substance) an' then looks fo' instances o' epistemological connection dat cannot be doubted (e.g., da knowledge o' da existence o' uh thinkin` subject). Heidegger's strategy iz ta see Dasein as already in da world, which suggests dat what needs ta be explained iz not da connection, which iz da basis, but da disconnection (p. 176). da disconnection or da disruption iz dat which iz appealing ta da eye o' da rhetor who observes by participating. Hence, observation as meditative thinkin` iz ta pay attention ta da "disconnection" dat shows itself in da activity o' hovering over as long as we's can endure it. ta take dis here uh step further, we's could say dat when da rhetor can endure or stay persistent wiff dis here unsettling experience, then da circularity o' hermeneutics (through uh persistent inhabitation o' da phenomenon) gives way ta an elliptical movement dat iz in "essence" elusive an' indeterminate. Derrida (1973) calls our attention ta dis here radical difference in what can be called uh "project" o' deconstruction. He makes an appropriate observation in dis here regard when he writes: dere iz then, prob'ly nahh choice ta be made between two lines o' thought; our task iz ta reflect on da circularity, which makes da one pass into da other indefinitely. an', by strictly repeating dis here circle in its own historical possibility, we's allow da production o' some elliptical change o' site, within da difference involved in repetition; dis here displacement iz nahh doubt deficient, but wiff uh deficiency dat iz not yet, or iz already nahh longer, absence, negativity, nonbeing, lack, silence. Neither matter nor form, it iz nuttin' dat any philosopheme, dat iz, any dialectic, however determinate, can capture. It iz an ellipsis o' both meaning an' form; it iz neither plenary speech nor perfectly circular. mo' an' less, neither mo' nor less -- it iz perhaps an entirely different queshun. (p. 128) On da part o' da rhetor who endures, da latter movement allows fo' uh "re-cognition" o' dis here elusive an' disruptive/displacing nature o' dat which shows itself. In dis here sense, observation as meditative thinkin`/deconstruction iz respect fo' da phenomena. In such uh movement, we's could contend wiff John D. Caputo (1987) dat da observer-participant rhetor iz never in uh privileged position or da sole owner in regard ta what shows itself in meditative thinkin`/deconstruction. He observes: In an uh-lethic view, whatever shows itself, whatever comes forth, issues from hidden depths. we's know we's cannot whack bottom here, dat we's cannot squeeze what stirs here between our conceptual hands, cannot git it within our grip, cannot seize it round about. da mystery iz self-withdrawing, self-sheltering. an' dat iz what gives rise ta respect. (p. 276) Hence, in Heideggerian terms, observation could be seen as akin ta letting go or "letting be," which iz radical detachment or detached attachment. da genuine rhetor iz one who cultivates uh respectful disposition as regards da "faculty o' observing" an' "da available means o' persuasion" vis-à-vis dat which needs ta be spoken about. 

**da 1ac claim ta “observe” knowledge iz fundamentally based on they role as seeing, knowing subject an' da 1ac as uh permanent, static, object projected an' represented from they subjectivity. dis here iz da modern gestell, ruled by enframing, meaning dey engage da 1ac violently as uh resource standing in reserve ta be consumed.** 
**Levin 99** (David Michael, Ph.D., Prof Em o' Philo @ Northwestern, “da Philosopher’s Gaze: Modernity in da Shadows o' Enlightenment” Gestalt Gestell Geviert: da Way o' da Lighting, pp116-169) In order ta dig' da perceptual Gestalt as uh site an' instance o' enframing, it iz necessary ta reflect on perception as uh process o' articulation, uh process o' bringing-forth. What iz distinctive 'boutthe way dat perception under da sway o' enframing articulates an' brings forth uh figure-ground Gestalt? “Enframing”, Heidegger says, “challenges forth into da frenziedness o' ordering dat blocks every view o' da coming-ta-pass o' revealing an' so radically endangers da relation [o' human beings] ta da essence o' truth.” Although enframing “comes ta pass as uh destining o' revealing” it iz “uh destining dat gathers together into da revealing dat challenges forth.” Although, under da spell o' enframing, perception still takes part in uh process o' unconcealment an' effects uh certain bringing-forth, its interaction wiff da presencing o' being tends ta become uh “challenging-forth into ordering,” an “ordering o' da real as standing reserve.” Such perception iz o' course disclosive, but it iz also at da same tyme deeply forgetful, willfully concealing da openness o' da ground, da gift o' da field in which, an' by grace o' which, it takes place – an' even repressing da fact o' dis here willful concealment: “da Open [itself] becomes an object, an' iz thus twisted around toward human beings.”Under da spell o' enframing, then, perception iz never far from violence; its knowledge, in fact, be uh power dat can only come from aggression an' torture. da Gestalt, therefore, essentially undergoes uh process dat it would not be an exaggeration ta describe as its disfigurement: “da original emergence an' coming-ta-be o' energies,…becomes uh visibility o' things dat is already dere…da eye, vision, becomes uh mere looking-at or looking-over or gaping-at.” deez werdz come from Heidegger’s 1936 Introduction ta Metaphysics. But it iz clear dat he already understood dis here point much earlier, cuz, in Being an' tyme, uh werk which leads us through uh strenuous learning-process toward da achievement o' uh “moment o' vision”, he called attention ta our inveterate tendency ta fall into “uh fixed staring at somethin` dat iz purely present-at-hand.” Under da cold stare o' da gaze, da spontaneously “emerging power” presencing in an' as da Gestalt iz “hardened” into uh state o' permanent presence, “deprived o' da possibility o' appearing spontaneously” – deprived, also, o' its radiance, its Schein. wiff regard ta da queshun o' dis here dullness, dis here loss o' radiance, perhaps it will suffice fo' da moment ta note, here, just two decisive passages: [1] in Being an' tyme, Heidegger asserts dat, “in ‘setting down da subject’, we's dim entities down ta focus.” [2] In “da queshun Concerning Technology,” Heidegger says dat “Enframing blocks off da shining forth an' holding sway o' truth.” wiff regard ta da “hardening into permanence,” Heidegger argues, in Basic Concepts, dat “presencing do not mean mere presence, but emerging an' opening up…mere presence, in da sense o' da present-at-hand, has already set uh limit ta presencing, emergence, an' has thus given up presencing.” In elaborating dis here point, he observes dat “what presences only presences in emerging an' precisely not in da presence dat has congealed into permanence.” “It belongs,” he says, “ta da essence o' presencing dat its possible non-essence o' hardening into somethin` permanent iz repelled in it.” All deez assertions gain significance when dey is understood concretely as phenomenological observations referring ta da emergence an' dissolution o' da figure-ground structures dat form in da event o' perception an' depend on da way our looking an' seeing let dem emerge, bringing down, drawing dem forth, out o' da encompassing field o' visibility. Most in queshun, perhaps, an' most at stake, iz our attitude towards da ground: whether or not its dynamism, its openness, its dimensionality, iz granted by da corresponding receptive openness o' our perception – our willingness, fo' example, ta let perception be decentered, drawn into abysses o' invisibility, radically surprised. As an ontologically oriented capacity, perception calls upon ta “engage oneself wiff da open region an' its openness into which every becoming comes ta stand.” Elaborating dis here point, wiff werdz (“not ta lose myself”) dat echo Schelling’s, quoted at da beginning o' dis here study, Heidegger explains dat: ta engage oneself wiff da disclosedness o' beings iz not ta lose oneself in dem; , such engagement withdraws in da face o' beings in order dat dey might reveal themselves wiff respect ta what an' how dey is an' in order dat presentative correspondence might take its standard from dem. Moreover, dis here comportment requires an acceptance o' concealment: “letting-be,” he says “iz intrinsically at da same tyme uh concealing. In da ek-sistent freedom o' Dasein…dere iz concealment.” we's need ta give thought ta da social, cultural, an' political significance o' da disruptive an' anarchic ontological “standard” or “measure” implicit in dis here engagement, dis here way o' looking an' seeing. Gestalt psychology has demonstrated da organic interdependencies, da reciprocally altering interactions dat is constitutive o' an undisturbed Gestalt formation process. Insisting dat “uh theory o' perception mus' be uh field theory,” Kohler points out, fo' example, dat “objects show uh considerable change in size when dey is located within uh region which has been strongly influenced by uh figure.” dis here means, he says, dat da afta-effects o' such figure-forming processes tend ta alter given visual objects. “Prolonged inspection o' any specific visual trends,” he notes, “ta change its organization. Moreover, other objects which is afterwards shown in da same region o' da field is also affected, namely displaced or distorted.” Consequently, as da fixation o' uh staring gaze, da enframing typical o' Gestell interrupts da figure-ground interplay an' distorts both figure an' ground. Instead o' uh dynamic, spontaneously, flowing interaction between figure an' ground, uh looser, freer, softer differentiation between da periphery an' da center o' focus, deconstructing da metaphysical dualism dat prioritizes da center, dere be uh “freezing” o' da flow, interrupting da werk o' tyme – da emergence an' dissolution o' perceptual configurations. an' when da figure iz subject ta such reifying intensity, it becomes detached from its ground, although it iz da opening openness, da end-less origin o' da figures dat enframing brings forth, its presencing iz either forgotten, suppressed, neglected, or else it iz submitted ta da most extreme ontic reduction – as if it could be possessed by da ecological subject as just another figure. Herbert Guenther notes dat da openness o' da perceptual ground “iz present in an' actually presupposed by every determinate form. Every determinate entity evolves out o' somethin` indeterminate an' ta uh certain extent maintains its connection wiff dis here indeterminacy; it iz never completely isolated from it. cuz da indeterminate entity iz not isolated from da indeterminacy…, our attention can shift back an' forth between one an' da other.” da enframing gaze cannot, will not, let da ground be ground; it cannot, will not, tolerate its immeasurableness, its withdrawal from da grasp o' perception, its refusal ta be totalized, reified, possessed. Instead o' uh gaze dat iz softly focusing, gently hovering, open an' receptive ta da dynamics o' change, open an' receptive ta da spontaneous emergence o' new configurations taking place in da dimensions o' da surrounding field; instead o' uh gaze dat “withdraws in da face o' beings in order dat dey might reveal themselves,” in da epoch o' enframing dere be uh tendency fo' da gaze ta become aggressively dualistic – sharp, linear, an' atomizing. dis here iz da gaze dat has installed – an' continues ta serve – uh metaphysics o' reified presence, uh metaphysics o' closure, violence an' mortification. dis here reification be uh persistent theme in Heidegger’s thought, somethin` he clearly articulated in Being an' tyme an' repeatedly emphasized in subsequent lectures an' writings. In uh 1941 course on Anaximander, fo' example, Heidegger declared dat “permanence iz contrary ta da…essence o' being…but what presences essentially an' yet contrary ta da essence iz da non-essence…ta da extent dat what respectively presences corresponds ta da essence o' presencing, it do not consist in an' solidify into duration unto permanence.” What resists measure, limitation, finitude, what refuses da ordinance o' tyme, dat Anaximander regards as άδιχία, injustice. According ta Heidegger, in da world o' Greek antiquity niggas did not relate ta what iz as ta an inwardly conceived image or representation. fo' da Greeks, what iz iz what presences; an' dis here experience wiff perception did not involve looking at what iz an' havin` uh representation o' it in mind; nor did it involved making da one who iz looking into uh “subject” an' making what iz presencing into an ‘object”. dis here construction be uh distinctive mark o' modernity. It iz only in da modern period – da period beginning wiff da self-affirmation o' “nigga” in da humanism o' da sixteenth century an' wiff uh way o' looking at da world reintroduced an' carried forward, albeit in very different projects, by da Cartesianism an' empiricism o' da seventeenth century an' by da rationalism an' romanticism o' da eighteenth – dat what iz present iz determined [1] as an ob-ject, [2] as being dere fo' uh subject, [3] as (re)presented by da subject ta itself, [4] as placed ta lie 'bfoe da subject, an' finally, therefore, [5] as present in da form o' uh representation. In an' wiff dis here determination o' what iz present, da ever increasing power o' da subject iz claimed an' asserted. As Derrida correctly remarks in “Sending: On Representation,” Vorstellung “marks da gesture which consists o' placing, o' causing ta stand 'bfoe one, o' installing in front o' oneself as available, o' localizing ready-ta-hand, within da availability o' da preposition…da subject iz what can or believes it can offer itself representations, disposing dem an' disposing o' dem.”Now, Heidegger argues dat what iz distinctive o' modernity – an' da cause o' his concern – iz not so much da fact dat experience can be uh process o' representation as it iz da fact dat representation iz universalized, dat it becomes da sole medium fo' all experiencing, an' dat its way o' relating ta what iz present encourages us in da attitude o' domination. an' dis here means dat it encourages us in an attitude dat do violence ta da background o' perception, either by simply forgetting its way o' presencing, or by gathering it into da Gestalt in uh reified re-presentation o' presencing. 

**uh WORLD SUBSUMED BY CALCULATIVE TECHNOLOGICAL THOUGHT DESTROYS OUR ONTOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP IN SUCH uh WAY dat THINGS CEASE ta BE THINGS IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. OUR INSTANT ACCESS ta EVERYTHING AS uh TOOL fo' USE OBLITERATES da ESSENTIAL BEING o' ALL THINGS MAKING EVEN TOTAL PLANETARY DESTRUCTION uh RADICALLY LESS IMPORTANT ISSUE an' uh LIKELY INNEVITABILITY.** 
**Caputo 93** (john, Demythologizing Heidegger, p. 136-41) da essence o' technology iz nuttin' technological; da essence o' language iz nuttin' linguistic; da essence o' starvation has nuttin' ta do wiff being hungry; da essence o' homelessness has nuttin' ta do wiff being out in da cold. iz dis here not ta repeat uh most classical philosophical gesture, ta submit ta da oldest philosophical desire o' all, da desire fo' da pure an' uncontaminated, not ta mention da safe an' secure? (2) In his essay "da Thin`" Heidegger remarks upon da prospect o' uh nuclear conflagration which could extinguish all human life: nigga stares at what da explosion o' da atom bomb could bring wiff it. He do not see dat what has long since taken place an' has already happened expels from itself as its last emission da atom bomb an' its explosion—not ta mention da single nuclear bomb, whose triggering, thought through ta its utmost poten­tial, might be enough ta snuff out all life on earth. (VA, 165/PLT, 166). In uh parallel passage, he remarks: ... [nigga finds himself in uh perilous shit. Why? Just cuz uh third world war might break out unexpectedly an' bring 'boutthe complete annihilation o' humanity an' da destruction o' da earth? nahh. In dis here dawning atomic age uh far greater danger threatens—precisely when da danger o' uh third world war has been removed. uh strange assertion! Strange indeed, but only as long as we's do not meditate. (G, 27/DT, 56). da thinker iz menaced by uh mo' radical threat, iz endangered by uh mo' radical explosiveness, let us say by uh mo' essential bomb, capable o' an emission (hinauswerfen) o' such primordiality dat da explosion (Explosion) o' da atom bomb would be but its last ejection. Indeed, da point iz even stronger: even uh nuclear bomb, or uh wholesale exchange o' nuclear bombs between nuclear megapowers, which would put an end ta "all life on earth," which would annihilate every living being, human an' nonhuman, be uh deriva­tive threat compared ta dis here mo' primordial destructiveness. dere be uh pros­pect dat iz mo' dangerous an' uncanny—unheimhcher—than da mere fact dat everything could be blown apart (Auseinanderplatzen von allem). dere iz somethin` dat would bring 'boutmo' homelessness, mo' not-being­at-home (un-Heimlich) than da destruction o' cities an' towns an' o' they inhabitants. What iz truly unsettling, dis-placing (ent-setzen), da thin` dat iz really terrifying (das Entsetzende), iz not da prospect o' da destruction o' human life on da planet, o' annihilating its places an' its settlers. Further­mo', dis here truly terrifying thin` has already happened an' has actually been around fo' quite some tyme. dis here mo' essential explosive has already been set off; things gots already been destroyed, even though da nuclear holocaust has not yet happened. What then iz da truly terrifying? da terrifying iz dat which sets everything dat iz outside (heraussitzl) o' its own essence (Wesen)'. What iz dis here dis-placing [Entsetzendel? It shows itself an' conceals itself in da way in which everything presences (anwest), namely, in da fact dat despite all conquest o' distances da nearness o' things remains absent. (VA, 165/P1.T, 166) da truly terrifying explosion, da mo' essential destruction iz dat which dis-places uh thin` front its Wesen, its essential nature, its ownmost coming ta presence. da essential destruction occurs in da Being o' uh thin`, not in its entitative actuality; it be uh disaster dat befalls Being, not beings. da destruc­tiveness o' dis here mo' essential destruction iz aimed not directly at nigga but at "things" (Dirge), in da distinctively Heideggerian sense. da Wesen o' things iz they nearness, an' it iz nearness which has been decimated by technological proximity an' speed. Things gots ceased ta gots true nearness an' farness, gots sunk into da indifference o' dat which, being uh great distance away, can be brought close in da flash o' uh technological instant. Thereby, things gots ceased ta be things, gots sunk into indifferent nothingness. Somethin` profoundly disruptive has occurred on da level o' da Being o' things dat has already destroyed dem, already cast dem out o' (herauswerfen¬) they Being. Beings gots been brought close ta Us technologically; enor­mous distances is spanned in seconds. Satellite technology can make events occurring on da other side o' da globe present in uh flash; supersonic jets cross da great oceans in uh few hours. Yet, far from bringing things "near," dis here massive technological removal o' distance has actually abolished nearness, fo' nearness iz precisely what withdraws in da midst o' such technological frenzy. Nearness iz da nearing o' earth an' heavens, mortals an' gods, in da handmade jug, or da old bridge at Heidelberg, an' it can be experienced only in da quiet meditativeness which renounces haste. Thus da real destruction o' da thin`, da one dat abolishes its most essen­tial Being an' Wesen, occurs when da scientific determination o' things pre­vails an' compels our assent. da thingliness o' da jug iz ta serve as da place which gathers together da fruit o' earth an' sun in mortal offering ta da gods above. But all dat iz destroyed when pouring dis here libation becomes instead da displacement o' air by uh liquid; at dat moment science has suc­ceeded in reducing da jug-thin` ta uh non-entity (Nichtige). Science, or da dominion o' scientific representation, da rule o' science over what comes ta presence, what iz called da Wesen, which iz at werk in science an' technol­ogy, dat iz da truly explosive-destructive thin`, da mo' essential dis-placing. da gathering o' earth an' sky, mortals an' gods, dat holds sway in da thin`—fo' "gathering" iz what da Old High German thin` means—iz scat­tered ta da four winds, an' dat mo' essential annihilation occurs even if da bomb never goes off: Science's knowledge, which iz compelling within its own sphere, da sphere o' objects, already had annihilated things long 'bfoe da atom bomb exploded. da bomb's explosion iz only da grossest o' all gross confirmations o' da long-since accomplished annihilation o' da thin`. (VA, 168/PLT, 170J When things gots been annihilated in they thingness, da mushroom clouds o' da bomb cannot be far behind. So whether or not da bomb goes off iz not essential, do not penetrate ta da essence o' what comes ta presence in da present age o' technological proximities an' reduced distances. What iz essential iz da loss o' genuine nearness, authentic an' true nearness, following which da actual physical annihilation o' planetary life would be uh "gross" confirmation, an unrefined, external, physical destruction dat would be but uh follow-up, another afterthought, uh less subtle counterpart ta uh mo' inward, profound, essential, authentic, ontological destruction.

**da objectificattion o' da world at da hands o' da gaze o' da 1ac iz da root o' suffering an' vioelnce an' iz inseperable from racism an' all forms o' hatred. as an attempt ta posit an alternative approach ta visuality we's attempt ta open our peeps ta blindness – we's approach vision as what heidegger calls “da lighting” which iz ta say as uh hermeneutical interplay between concealment an' unconcealment which respects da abyss o' dat which iz unconcealed an' thereby subverting da sovreignty o' da gaze an' denying its power. dis here move iz absolutely essential in dat any inclusion o' da will ta power driven gaze o' da 1ac destroys da alternative an' results in totalitarian tyranny.**
**Levin 99** (David Michael, Ph.D., Prof Em o' Philo @ Northwestern, “da Philosopher’s Gaze: Modernity in da Shadows o' Enlightenment” Gestalt Gestell Geviert: da Way o' da Lighting, pp116-169) Following da passage on da interpretation o' which we's gots just been reflecting, Heidegger asks: Why iz it dat we's stubbornly resist considering even once whether da belonging-together o' subject an' object do not arise from somethin` dat first imparts they nature ta both da object an' its objectivity, an' da subjectivity, an' hence iz prior ta da realm o' they recipricrocity? Carrying dis here queshun forward in da direction dat Heidegger’s preceding discussion would suggest, we's is led ta da thought dat subject an' object is gathered together an' belong together in an' by grace o' da field o' da field o' da lighting-dat elemental presencing o' being which opens up, lays down, an' gathers uh field o' visibility. It iz da lighting dat first joins subject an' gathers uh field o' visibility. It iz da lighting dat, in its configuration as ground, offers an' submits itself ta da conditions o' perceptivity dat rule in da life o' uh mortal. But in modern times, dis here “mortal” has become an ego-logical subject: someone who, constituting himself as uh subject, focuses on what iz present an' turns it into an object, uh figure split off from da dynamic ground, da surrounding contextual referential field. If our tyme iz “our o' joint,” so iz da figure-ground Gestalt. dis here splitting off, o' subject from object, figure from ground, an' da Gestalt itself from da presence o' da lighting, iz symptomatic o' da antagonisms dat persist in our deeply divided an' still unreconciled society. an' when we's consider what dis here splitting means when da “object” o' da gaze in another “subject” –when it be uh queshun o' how another “subject” iz looked at, faced, seen, made ta figure in da figure-ground Gestell-then we's is approaching da root o' da suffering, rage, an' violence distinctive o' da contemporary world. How different social relations would be if dey could be deeply rooted, by virtue o' an awareness (Stimmung) dat do not presently form very often, in uh felt sense o' being gathered together in ta da underlying unity o' da lighting, uh felt sense o' belonging together in da Laying-down-dat-gathers-an' o' havin` always already belonged together, gathered through da gift o' dat lighting, in uh dimension o' being “prior ta da realm o' they reciprocity” ! Stereotyped, reifying perceptions o' da other, ways o' looking at others dat is inseparable from racism, nationalism, an' ethnic hatreds, would be mo' difficult ta sustain, if da awareness toward which Heidegger iz gesturing wuz ta be cultivated as da subsoil in which our vision needs ta be well rooted. ta be sure, as Heidegger says, “da jointure thanks ta which revealing an' concealing is mutually joined mus' remain da invisible o' all invisibles, since It [iz dat which] bestows shining on whatever appears.” It mus' be certainly protected from da will ta total visibility, cuz if not properly cared fo', its gift o' light an' darkness would fall an' negation, placed at da disposal o' da dominant will ta power; an' da peoples o' da world would eventually be left without any place ta hide from totalitarian tyranny an' terror. But dis here possibility, dis here danger, makes it all da mo' necessary dat we's not let da invisibility, da withdrawal o' da jointure fall into total oblivion, absolute negation. we's need ta make dis here jointure visible in our world: visible, however, as da invisible o' all invisibles. an' dis here means dat our looking an' seeing mus' let themselves be appropriate by dis here invisibility, becoming, through they capacity fo' ontological recollection, its hermeneutic organ, protecting an' preserving its necessary withdrawal. dis here interpretation points toward da need fo' uh historically different way o' looking an' seeing uh way o' looking an' seeing dat obeys in care da way o' da lighting. Heidegger continues: If we's th'o't it [ah.e., da presencing o' being] as lighting, dis here includes not only da brilliance, but also da openness wherein everything, especially da reciprocally related, comes into shining. Lighting iz therefore mo' illuminating, an' also mo' than laying bare. Lighting iz da meditatively gathering bringing-'bfoe into da open. It iz da bestowal o' presencing. According ta Heidegger, “da event o' lighting [das Ereignis der Lichtung) iz da world. da meditatively gathering lighting which brings into da open iz revealing; [but] it abides in self-concealing. Thus it iz necessary dat, in virtue o' our way o' looking an' seeing, we's protect an' preserve da self-concealment o' da lighting, while at da same tyme opening ta dis here “event” an' letting it come into its own by gathering it into our way an' making it visible hermeneutically as dat which opens up our world. Heidegger’s discussion o' da lighting iz haunted, however, by deep-an' well-founded-anxieties. What concerns him iz da danger dat, in spite o' all his precautions, reference ta dis here lighting will be misunderstood. fo' da self-giving o' da lighting both iz an' iz not uh lighting, uh light we's can see. Taking place within da realm o' da visible, it can appear only as dat which visibly withdraws from da reach o' our vision. Thus, most o' all, Heidegger iz trippin' dat da “event,” da giving, o' da lighting- da wonder o' gift, dat dere iz light- will be degraded by uh reduction ta da physics an' optics o' light. “da lighting,” he says,” iz nahh mere brightening an' lightening.” an' dat iz cuz what he iz trying ta git us ta see be uh “revealing-concealing lighting concerned wiff da presencing o' what iz present.” Appealing, in spite o' da terrible dangers, ta our capacity, our potential fo' vision, he tells us dat “da lighting not only illuminates what iz present, but gathers it together an' secures it in advance in presencing.” Thus, wuz our own way o' looking an' seeing ta become uh recollection an' mimetic repetition o' dis here gift o' lighting-or, in other werdz, wuz our way ta become an ontologically appropriate, ontologically appropriated, it would, in its own way, become uh gathering, uh vision o' da Geviert, gathering earth an' sky, gods an' mortals. cuz we's is being gifted wiff uh capacity-ta-see da potential o' which still remains unrealized an' unfulfilled, da gift o' da lighting-da wonder dat Es gibt lighting-makes uh claim on us: uh claim dat burdens us wiff da responsibility ta realize our great potential fo' vision, our capacity fo' responsiveness, our response-ability. Gods an' niggas, says Heidegger, is not only illuminated in da lighting, but is also enlightened from it an' toward it. Thus dey can, in they own way, accomplish da lighting (bringing it ta da fullness o' its essence) an' thereby protect it.... [moreover, cuz dey receive dis here lighting an' is dependent on it,] dey is appropriated into da event o' lighting, an' is never concealed. On da contrary, dey is revealed, thought in still another sense [ah.e., in dat da claim o' dis here lighting on they responsiveness, e.g., on they responsibility fo' “usin`” they capacity ta perceive it, puts dem on trial]. Just as those who is far distant belong ta da distance, so is da revealed-in da sense now ta be thought-entrusted [zugertraut] ta da lighting dat keeps an' shelters dem. As beings o' sight, we's is dependent on da gift o' da lighting, an' therefore is entrusted ta it. But we's is also thereby entrusted wiff it, cuz da lighting can come into its own, or come back ta itself “in fullness o' its essence” (as Heidegger puts it), only through da mediation o' our way o' looking an' seeing. fo' it iz only by (da) virtue o' our looking an' seeing dat da lighting can be made visible hermeneutically, visible as da coming o' da lighting which first makes our vision possible. Furthermore, da coming o' da lighting, as da interplay o' concealment an' unconcealment within which all dat iz comes ta presence, can be protected an' preserved only by (da) virtue o' uh way o' seeing an' looking dat [1] makes it visible in its invisibility, acknowledging our finitude, our limited horizons, an' da immeasurable abyss o' da invisible, an' dat thereby [2] respects da withdrawal an' self-concealment o' da lighting, protecting an' preserving it, instead o' violently penetrating its abodes o' concealment wiff an insolent demand fo' total visibility, total clarity, total control. da lighting gives us light but it also subverts dat sovereignty o' da gaze, leading it into da shadows, into da dark, into da realms o' semblance an' deception; obstructing its powers o' penetration; compelling submission ta da invisible beyond being. da lighting opens our peeps-ta blindness. Following Heraclitue, who wuz merciless in criticizing da ways o' his contemporaries, Heidegger formulates his own criticism o' da looking an' seeing dat predominates in da contemporary world. He writes: Mortals is irrevocably bound ta da revealing-concealing gathering which lights everything present in its presencing. But dey turn from da lighting, an' turn only toward what iz present, which iz what immediately concerns dem in they everyday commerce wiff each other.... dey gots nahh inkling o' what dey gots been entrusted wiff: presencing, which in its lighting first allows what iz present ta come ta appearance. In da lighting o' which dey come an' go, remains concealed from dem an' forgotten. As Heidegger iz quick ta point out, however, da recollection o' da lighting cannot take place in uh perception, uh way o' looking an' seeing, fo' example, dat iz grasping, possessive, driven by da will ta power: da golden gleam o' da lighting’s invisible shining cannot be grasped, cuz it iz not itself somethin` grasping. , it iz da purely appropriating even [das reine Ereignen]. da invisible shining o' da lighting streams from da wholesome self-keeping in da self-restraining preservation o' destiny [Geschick].

**Siisiäninen 2008** (Lauri, political science researcher @ U o' Jyväskylä, “From da Empire o' da Gaze ta Noisy Bodies: Foucault, Audition, an' Medical Power” Theory an' Event, 11:1)  When it comes ta da role o' audition in da sensorial triangle o' clinical experience, Foucault's argumentation takes quite an interesting turn:  "But one mus' not loose sight o' da essential. da tactile an' auditory dimensions did not purely an' simply come ta be added ta da domain o' vision. da sensorial triangulation indispensable ta anatomo-clinical perception remains under da dominant sign o' da visible (sous le signe dominant du visible): firstly, cuz dis here multi-sensorial perception iz nuttin' but uh manner o' anticipating dat triumph o' da gaze (ce triomphe du regard), which will be da autopsy; da ear an' hand is nuttin' but temporary substitute organs (des organes provisoires de remplacement) anticipating fo' da death ta render ta da truth da luminous presence o' da visible (la présence lumineuse du visible). . . an' above all, da alterations discovered by anatomy concern 'da shape, da size, da position an' da direction' o' organs or they tissues. . . dat iz, spatial data (des données spatiales) dat belong by right o' origin (par droit d'origine) ta da gaze." 13  As it comes out in dis here passage, Foucault argues dat one should not let da appearance o' da sensorial triangulation lead ta any illusions 'boutthe equality between da three senses at play. Even if whack an' audition did gots uh role in da formation o' clinical perception, it wuz actually limited ta they function as nuttin' but vision's temporary substitutes or "representatives", ones dat wuz in da end reducible ta visual experience. In other werdz, Foucault's strong thesis iz dat in da formation o' clinical perception – in da first opening o' da individual body ta medical knowledge an' intervention – whack an' audition did not gots any irreducible, indispensable or autonomous significance, da sort o' significance reserved fo' da gaze an' visual experience. In stead, da only place left fo' audition wuz uh position o' dependency an' submission – uh subservient position – under da dominant sign o' da visible. ? da passage quoted shows also dat in Foucault's understanding, da truth constituted in da clinical-medical discourse wuz still determined (in classical sense, we's could add) utterly by da interrelated terms o' visibility, luminosity an' presence, accomplished (in practice) only in da opening o' da dead corps in autopsy. dis here means dat auditory perception (hearing an' da ear) as such did not strictly speaking participate directly ta da medical truth an' knowledge, da truth o' health/pathology, normality/abnormality o' an individual body. da clinical-medical truth wuz constituted by da visible presence o' da body ta da gaze, not ta auditory experience. da only possible "legitimate" contribution o' audition ta da formation o' truth in da clinical discourse wuz dat o' uh subservient instrument or uh temporary, dispensable substitute fo' vision, one dat itself wuz lacking da capacity o' "luminous presence" o' truth. da fate o' audition in da clinical form o' knowledge wuz ta become in da end extinguished in da true goal an' fulfillment o' medical examination: ah.e., in da final triumph o' da gaze, in da grasping o' da visible truth, where auditory experience nahh longer has anythin` ta contribute. Thus, da "sensory hierarchy" organizing da triangle becomes quite clearly stated: audition remains firmly submitted under da pre-eminence o' vision. In da hierarchic setting, da fate o' audition iz ta become subjugated under, reduced ta an' in da end extinguished in an' by da dominant sign o' da visible. 2. da "Right-o'-Origin"- Argument an' da Empire o' da Gaze  dere iz still one turn in Foucault's argumentation on da role o' audition in clinical experience – one dat becomes articulate in da quotation already discussed – in need o' particular emphasis here. As da quotation already shows, Foucault presents an argument concerning what belongs by right o' origin (par droit d'origine) ta vision an' not ta hearing. da capacity ta collect spatial facts or spatial data (des données spatiales), da capacity ta discover spatial objects is capacities dat belong "by right o' origin" ta vision, not audition. As it comes ta da anatomo-clinical perception an' experience, dis here means dat da capacity ta locate "da being o' da disease wiff its causes an' effects in uh three-dimensional space", 14 as also da capacity ta grasp "da shape, da size, da position an' da direction o' organs or they tissues", 15 in other werdz da central functions determining clinical experience, belong by right o' origin ta sight, not ta hearing. It iz in dis here irreparable lack, in da incapacity ta form spatial-objective experience, dat we's find da actual reason why audition did not an' cannot make any "equal" or symmetrical, irreducible, autonomous an' dispensable contribution (but only as uh temporary, subservient, indispensable substitute operating under da dominance o' vision an' gaze) ta clinical-medical knowledge or, as it seems logical, ta any form o' knowledge determined by da spatial-objective form. we's should notice, dat although auditory perception iz defined by da non-spatiality, Foucault don' argue dat auditory perception would be defined by temporality. Only da lack, da incapacity o' spatiality becomes da defining characteristic o' audition distinguishing it from vision.  da reader should notice dat Foucault do not in fact develop dis here right-o'-origin – argument by any reference ta da corpus o' historical documents he otherwise uses in da study (da werkz o' Laënnec an' others). da argument iz not actually presented as an interpretation o' historical sources at all. It iz Michel Foucault himself, who argues here on da right-o'-origin difference between vision an' audition. It iz Foucault himself who states da difference, da juxtaposition o' "audio" an' "visual", in terms o' da unique capacity o' vision an' da essential incapacity o' audition, when it comes ta spatial-objective experience. Foucault's argument might come as uh surprise, fo' it iz hardly archaeological (in da sense Foucault gives ta dis here term) in character: It iz not 'boutthe historical conditions o' possibility, da difference in capacity/incapacity between vision an' audition in da context o' uh specific historical discursive formation. ta argue what vision can an' what audition cannot do by right o' origin – dat iz, irrespective o' any historical-discursive context – seems ta come close ta arguing on da conditions o' possibility as such, on da trans-historical limits o' experience an' on da difference between faculties in da strong (transcendental) Kantian sense.16  It iz by relying on da idea o' audition as da essentially non-spatial an' non-objective sense, as opposed ta da spatial-objective capacities o' vision, not on da basis o' historical analysis dat Foucault can deny da possibility o' audition's equal/indispensable/autonomous contribution an' significance ta da birth o' da clinic an' argue fo' da necessity o' audition's reduction ta an' subjugation under da domination o' da gaze. If dis here iz da case, how can one avoid reaching da conclusion dat in presenting da right-o'-origin- argument, Foucault commits himself ta what he first o' all consistently set out ta dismantle in his archaeologies (an' subsequently in his genealogies): da conception o' da subject as da possessor o' different faculties, wiff uh given, trans-historical coherence an' uh permanent structure?  As we's know, da formation o' clinical experience – making da individual subject/body into da object o' medical knowledge an' intervention – be uh thoroughly political event fo' Foucault (dis here iz da case already in da Birth o' da Clinic). da birth o' da clinical experience –bringing ta knowledge an' truth da normality/pathology o' da individual/singular body – wuz intrinsically interrelated ta da development o' da modern form o' power an' politics. It iz through da development o' clinical experience dat da exercise o' dis here modern form o' power, surveying an' taking charge o' da health/normality o' each singular living body an' o' da social body as uh whole, took uh decisive stFep forwards. As we's know, in his later werkz as well, Foucault recurrently comes back ta da formation o' clinical-medical perception, observation an' surveillance, still giving deez uh central political significance in da modern disciplinary, normative an' bio-political dispositive or governmentality. In its operation, da medical power means da traversal an' penetration o' da whole social space by da clinical perception an' experience. Thus, da issue o' "audio-visual" difference, they right-o'-origin juxtaposition, turns out ta be uh deeply political issue as well.17  Inasmuch as Foucault argues (dis here we's gots already seen) audition ta be, by right o' origin, without any independent, irreducible significance in da formation o' clinical experience (remaining firmly submitted under da dominant sign o' da visible), it follows dat audition cannot gots any significance in da medicalized form o' power- an' politics either. In da last instance, da meaning o' medicalization iz brought back ta da circulation o' da medical gaze (le regard médical). It iz da gaze, not audition, which exercises "in da entire space, all da tyme, uh mobile an' differentiated surveillance." 18 Foucault concludes his analysis o' medicalized power/politics in categorical terms, well in line wiff da right-o'-origin- argument: "da gaze dat sees be uh gaze dat dominates (le regard qui voit est un regard qui domine)", making da modern society as such da "empire o' da gaze without partitions (l'empire sans cloison du regard)." 19

**Giroux 6** (Henry, da Global TV Network Chair Professorship at McMaster University in da cracker ass english an' Cultural Studies Department, “Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class, an' da Biopolitics o' Disposability,” College Literature, Vol. 33, nahh. 3) Within da last few decades, matters o' state sovereignty in da new world order gots been retheorized so as ta provide uh range o' theoretical insights 'boutthe relationship between power an' politics, da political nature o' social an' cultural life, an' da merging o' life an' politics as uh new form o' biopolitics. While da notion o' biopolitics differs significantly among its most prominent theorists, including Michel Foucault (1990, 1997), Giorgio Agamben (1998, 2002, 2003), an' Michael Hardt an' Antonio Negri (2004), what deez theorists share iz an attempt ta th'o't through da convergence o' life an' politics, locating matters o' “life an' death within our ways o' thinkin` 'boutan' imagining politics” (Dean 2004, 17).Within dis here discourse, politics iz nahh longer understood exclusively through uh disciplinary technology centered on da individual body—uh body ta be measured, surveilled, managed, an' included in forecasts, surveys, an' statistical projections. Biopolitics points ta new relations o' power dat is mo' capacious, concerned not only wiff da body as an object o' disciplinary techniques dat render it “both useful an' docile” but also wiff uh body dat needs ta be “regularized,” subject ta those immaterial means o' production dat produce ways o' life dat enlarge da targets o' control an' regulation (Foucault 1997, 249). dis here shift in da workings o' both sovereignty an' power an' da emergence o' biopolitics is made clear by Foucault, fo' whom biopower replaces da power ta dispense fear an' death “wiff dat o' uh power ta foster life—or disallow it ta da point o' death. . . . [Biopower] iz nahh longer uh matter o' bringing death into play in da field o' sovereignty, but o' distributing da living in da domain o' value an' utility. Its task iz ta take charge o' life dat needs uh continuous regulatory an' corrective mechanism” (Ojakangas 2005, 6). As Foucault insists, da logic o' biopower iz dialectical, productive, an' positive 178 College Literature 33.3 [Summer 2006] (1990, 136).Yet he also argues dat biopolitics do not remove itself from “introducing uh break into da domain o' life dat iz under power’s control: da break between what mus' live an' what mus' die” (1997, 255). Foucault believes dat da death-function in da economy o' biopolitics iz justified primarily through uh form o' racism in which biopower “iz bound up wiff da workings o' uh State dat iz obliged ta use race, da elimination o' races an' da purification o' da race, ta exercise its sovereign power” (258). 

“**When ah wuz uh little kid muh motha fuckin motha told me not ta stare into da sun. So once when ah wuz six, ah did. da doctors didn't know if muh motha fuckin peeps would ever heal. ah wuz terrified, alone in dat darkness.”* fo' da ALTERNATIVE we's TURN ONCE ag'in ta GEORGES BATAILLE. bataille’s notion o' da blind, uprooted eye IN da STORY o' da EYE implodes da cartesian underpinings o' da modern understanding o' vision dat attempts ta perfectly see an' thus perfectly know da world. Bataille do dis here through TRANSGRESSION, WHICH iz pushing uh concept ta its limit until it explodes. in terms o' visuality then bataille presents an eye dat iz torn out an' blinded. da STORY o' da EYE FURTHERMORE SIGNALS MOMENT WHEN LANGUAGE EXPLODES an' RADICALLY CHALLENGES ITSELF BY DISCOVERING da CONNECTION BETWEEN DEATH an' LANGUAGE IN da CONNECTION BETWEEN LIMIT an' BEING. da REPULSIVE NATURE o' BATAILLE’S STORY iz ESSENTIAL ta IT’S TRANSGRESSION.** 
**Focault ’63** (Michel, “uh Preface ta Transgression”, Religion an' Culture Michel Foucault, ed. By Jeremy Carrette, pp 57-71) *Max Cohen in “Pi” by Darren Aronofsky. Essentially da product o' fissures, abrupt descents an' broken contours, dis here misshapen an' craglike language describes uh circle; it refers ta itself an' iz folded back on uh questioning o' its limits – as if it wuz nuttin' mo' than uh small night lamp dat flashes wiff uh strange light, signaling da void from which it arises an' ta which it addresses everything it illuminates an' touches. Perhaps, it iz dis here curious configuration which explains why Bataille attributed such obstinate prestige ta da Eye. Throughout his career (from his first novel ta Larmes d’Eros), da eye wuz ta keep its value as uh figure o' inner experience: ‘When at da height o' anguish, ah gently solicit uh strange absurdity, an eye opens at da summit, in da middle o' muh motha fuckin skull’. dis here iz cuz da eye, uh small whitey globe encloses its darkness, traces uh limiting circle dat only sight can cross. an' da darkness within, da sombre core o' da eye, pours out into da world like uh fountain which sees, dat iz, which lights up da world; but it iz transformed into da bright night o' an image. da eye iz mirror an' lamp: it discharges its light into da werd around it, while in uh movement dat iz not necessarily contradictory, it precipitates dis here same light into da transparency o' its well. Its globe has da expansive quality o' uh marvelous seed – like an egg imploding towards da centre o' night an' extreme light, which it iz an' which it has just ceased ta be. It iz da figure o' being in da act o' transgressing its own limit. da eye, in uh philosophy o' reflection, derives form its capacity ta observe da power o' becoming always mo' interior ta itself. Lying behind each eye dat sees, dere exists uh mo' tenuous one, an eye so discreet an' yet so agile dat its all-powerful glance can be said ta eat away at da flesh o' its whitey globe; behind dis here particular eye, dere exists another, an', then, still others, each progressively mo' subtle until we's arrive at da eye whose entire substance iz nuttin' but da transparency o' vision. dis here inner movement iz finally resolved in uh non-material centre where da intangible forms o' truth is created an' combined, in dis here heart o' things which iz da sovereign subject. Bataille reverses dis here entire direction: sight, crossing da globular limit o' da eye, constitutes da eye in its instantaneous being; sight carries it away in dis here luminous stream (an outpouring fountain, streaming tears an', shortly, blood), hurls da eye outside itself, conducts it ta da limit where it bursts out immediately extinguished flash o' its being. Only uh small whitey ball, veined wiff blood, iz left behind, only an exorbitated eye ta which all sight iz now denied. an' in da place from which sight had once passed, only uh cranial cavity remains, only dis here black globe which da uprooted eye has made ta close upon its sphere, depriving it o' vision, but offering ta dis here absence da spectacle o' dat indestructible core which now imprisons da dead glance. In da distance created by dis here violence an' uprooting, da eye iz seen absolutely, but denied any possibility o' sight: da philosophizing subject has been dispossessed an' pursued ta its limit; an' da sovereignty o' philosophical language can now be heard from da distance, in da measureless void left behind by da exorbitated subject. But perhaps da eye accomplishes da most essential aspect o' its play when, forced from its ordinary position, it iz made ta turn upwards in uh movement dat leads it back ta da nocturnal an' starred interior o' da skull an' it iz made ta show us its usually concealed surface, whitey an' unseeing: it shuts out da day in uh movement dat manifests its own whiteness (whiteness being undoubtedly da image o' clarity, its surface reflection, but fo' dis here very reason, it cannot communicate wiff it, nor communicate it); an' da circular night o' da iris iz made ta address da central absence which it illuminates wiff uh flash, revealing it as night. da upturned orb suggests both da most open an' da most impenetrable eye: causing its sphere ta pivot, while remaining exactly da same an' in da same place, it overturns day an' night, crosses they limit, but only ta find it ag'in on da same line an' from da other side; an' da whitey hemisphere dat appears momentarily at da place where da pupil once opened iz like da being o' da eye as it crosses da limit o' its vision – when it transgresses dis here opening ta da light o' day which defined da transgression o' every sight. ‘If nigga did not imperiously close his peeps, he would finally be unable ta see da things worth seeing’. But what we's need ta see do not involve any interior secret or da discovery o' uh mo' nocturnal world. Torn from its ordinary position an' made ta turn inwards in its orbit, da eye now pours its light only into uh bony cavern. dis here turning up o' its globe may seem uh betrayal o' ‘la petite mort’, but, mo' exactly, it simply indicates da death dat it experiences in its natural location, in dis here springing up in place which causes da eye ta rotate. Death, fo' da eye, iz not da always elevated line o' da horizon, but da limit it ceaselessly transgresses in its natural location, in da hollow where every vision originates, an' where dis here limit iz elevated into an absolute limit by an ecstatic movements which allows da eye ta spring up from da other side. da upturned eye discovers da bond dat links language an' death at da moment dat it acts out dis here relationship o' da limit an' being; an' it iz perhaps from scenes dat interrupt Bataille’s stories invariably concern da spectacle o' erotic deaths, where upturned peeps display they limits an' rotate inwards in gigantic an' empty orbits. Bleu du ciel gies uh singularly precise outline o' dis here movement: early in November, when da earth o' German cemetery iz alive wiff da twinkling lights o' candles an' candle stubs, da narrator iz lying wiff Dorothy among da tombstones; making love among da dead, da earth around him appears like da sky on uh bright night. an' da sky above forms uh great hollow orbit, uh death mask, in which he recognizes his inevitable end at da moment dat pleasure overturns da four globes o' flesh, causing da revolution o' his sight. da earth under Dorothy’s body wuz open like uh tomb, her belly opened itself ta me like uh fresh grave. we's wuz struck wiff stupor, making love on uh starred cemetery. Each light marked uh skeleton in uh grave an' formed uh wavering sky as perturbed as our mingled bodies. ah unfastened Dorothy’s dress, ah dirtied her gear an' her tittie wiff da fresh earth which wuz stuck ta muh motha fuckin fingers. Our bodies trembled like two rows o' clattering teeth. But what might dis here mean at da heart o' thought? What significance has dis here insistent eye which appears ta encompass what Bataille successively designated da inner experience, da extreme possibility, da comic process, or simply meditation? It iz certainly nahh mo' metaphoric than Descartes’s phrasing o' da ‘clear perception o' sight’ or dis here sharp point o' mind which he called aceis mentis. In da point o' fact, da upturned eye has nahh meaning in Bataille’s language, can gots meaning since it marks its limit. It indicates da moment when language, arriving at its confines, overlaps itself, explodes an' radically challenges itself in laughter, tears, da overturned eye o' ecstasy, da mute an' exorbitated horror o' sacrifice, an' where it remains fixed in dis here way at da limits o' its void, speaking o' itself in uh second language in which da absence o' uh sovereign subject outlines its essential emptiness an' incessantly fractures da unity o' its discourse. da enucleated or upturned eye marks da zone o' Bataille’s philosophical language, da void into which it pours an' loses itself, but in which it never stops jivin' – somewhat like da interior, diaphanous an' illuminated eye o' mystics an' spiritualists dat marks da point at which da secret language o' prayer iz embedded an' choked by uh marvelous communication which silences it. Similarly, but in an inverted manner, da eye in Bataille delineates da zone shared by language an' death, da place where language discovers its being in da crossing o' its limits: da non-dialectical form o' philosophical language. dis here eye, as da fundamental figure o' da place from which Bataille speaks an' in which his broken language finds it uninterrupted domain, establishes da connection, prior ta any form o' discourse, dat exists between da death o' God (uh sun dat rotates an' da great eyelid dat closes upon da world), da experience o' finitude (springing up in death, twisting da light which iz extinguished as it discovers dat da interior iz an empty skull, uh central absence), an' da turning back o' language upon itself at da moment dat it fails –uh conjunction which undoubtedly has nahh other equivalent than da association, well known in other philosophies, o' sight ta truth or o' contemplation ta da absolute. Revealed ta dis here eye, which in its pivoting conceals itself fo' all tyme, iz da being o' da limit: ‘ah will never forget da violent an' marvelous experience dat comes from da will ta open one’s peeps, facing what exists, what happens’. Perhaps in da movement which carries it ta uh total night, da experience o' transgression brings ta light dis here relationship o' finitude ta being, dis here moment o' da limit which anthropological thought, since Kant, could only designate from da distance an' from da exterior through language o' dialectics. 

**we's WILL NOW TEAR OUT they peeps, SLASH da THROAT o' they SUN via uh reading o' georges bataille’s “story o' da eye”. be warned – transgression requires bravery. bataille, like sade 'bfoe him, isn’t fo' da faint o' heart or easily offended. PARDON muh motha fuckin FRENCH. Bataille 1928** (Georges, french pervert, “da story o' da eye”, supervert.com ) It really wuz totally out o' da queshun fo' Simone ta lift her dress an' place her bare behind in da dish o' raw balls. All she could do wuz hold da dish in her lap. ah told her ah Wants ta tap dat ass ag'in 'bfoe Granero returned ta fight da fourth bull, but she refused, an' she sat dere, keenly involved, despite everything, in da disembowelments o' horses, followed, as she childishly put it, by "death an' destruction,” namely da cataract o' bowels. Little by little, da sun's radiance sucked us into an unreality dat fitted our malaise-da wordless an' powerless desire ta explode an' git up o' our behinds. we's grimaced, cuz our peeps wuz blinded an' cuz we's wuz thirsty, our senses ruffled, an' dere wuz nahh possibility o' quenching our desires. we's three had managed ta share in da morose dissolution dat leaves nahh harmony between da various spasms o' da body. we's wuz so far gone dat even Granero's return could not pull us out o' dat stupefying absorption. Besides, da bull opposite him wuz distrustful an' seemed unresponsive; da combat go on just as drearily as 'bfoe. da events dat followed wuz without transition or connection, not cuz dey weren't actually related, but cuz muh motha fuckin attention wuz so absent as ta remain absolutely dissociated. In just uh few seconds: first, Simone bit into one o' da raw balls, ta muh motha fuckin dismay; then Granero advanced towards da bull, waving his scarlet cloth; finally, almost at once, Simone, wiff uh blood-red face an' uh suffocating lewdness, uncovered her long whitey thighs up ta her moist vulva, into which she slowly an' surely fitted da second pale globule-Granero wuz thrown back by da bull an' wedged against da balustrade; da horns struck da balustrade three times at full speed; at da third blow, one horn plunged into da right eye an' through da head. uh shriek o' unmeasured horror coincided wiff uh brief orgasm fo' Simone, who wuz lifted up from da stones eat only ta be flung back wiff uh bleeding nose, under uh blinding sun; niggas instantly rushed over ta haul away Granero's body, da right eye dangling from da head. Thus, two globes o' equal size an' consistency had suddenly been propelled in opposite directions at once. One, da whitey ball o' da bull, had been thrust into da "pink an' dark" cunt dat Simone had bared in da crowd; da other, uh human eye, had spurted from Granero's head wiff da same force as uh bundle o' innards from uh belly. dis here coincidence, tied ta death an' ta uh sort o' urinary liquefaction o' da sky, first brought us back ta Marcella in uh moment dat wuz so brief an' almost insubstantial, yet so uneasily vivid dat ah stepped forward like uh sleepwalker as though 'boutto whack her at eye level. da story continues uh bit later... "nigga Edmund," she said, rubbing her cheek gently on his shoulder, "ah wants ya ta do somethin`.""ah shall do anythin` ya like," he replied. She made me come over ta da corpse: she knelt down an' completely opened da eye dat da fly had perched on. "Do ya see da eye?" she asked me. "Well?""It's an egg," she concluded in all simplicity. "All right," ah urged her, extremely disturbed, “what is ya getting at?" "ah wants ta play wiff dis here eye." "What do ya mean?" "Listen, nigga Edmund," she finally let it out, "ya mus' give me dis here at once, tear it out at once, ah wants it!" nigga Edmund wuz always poker-faced except when he turned purple. Nor did he bat an eyelash now; but da blood did smoke ta his face. He removed uh pair o' fine scissors from his wallet, knelt down, then nimbly inserted da fingers o' his left hand into da socket an' drew out da eye, while his right hand snipped da obstinate ligaments. Next, he presented da small whitish eyeball in uh hand reddened wiff blood. Simone gazed at da absurdity an' finally took it in her hand, completely distraught; yet she had nahh qualms, an' instantly amused herself by fondling da depth o' her thighs an' inserting dis here apparently fluid object. da caress o' da eye over da skin iz so utterly, so extraordinarily gentle, an' da sensation iz so bizarre dat it has somethin` o' uh rooster's horrible crowing. Simone meanwhile amused herself by slipping da eye into da profound crevice o' her ass, an' afta lying down on her back an' raising her legs an' bottom, she tried ta keep da eye dere simply by squeezing her buttocks together. But all at once, it spat out like uh stone squeezed from uh cherry, an' dropped on da thin belly o' da corpse, an inch or so from da dong. In da meantime, ah had let nigga Edmund undress me, so dat ah could pounce stark naked on da crouching body o' da beotch; muh motha fuckin entire dong vanished at one lunge into da hairy crevice, an' ah fucked her hard while nigga Edmund played wiff da eye, rolling it, in between da contortions o' our bodies, on da skin o' our bellies an' titties. fo' an instant, da eye wuz trapped between our navels." Put it up muh motha fuckin ass, nigga Edmund," Simone shouted. an' nigga Edmund delicately glided da eye between her buttocks. But finally, Simone left me, grabbed da fine eyeball from da hands o' da tall Englishman, an' wiff uh staid an' regular pressure from her hands, she slid it into hers lobbery flesh, in da midst o' da fur. an' then she promptly drew me over, clutching muh motha fuckin neck between her arms an' smashing her lips on mine so forcefully dat ah came without touching her an' muh motha fuckin come smok'd all over her fur. Now ah stood up an', while Simone lay on her side, ah drew her thighs , an' found myself facing somethin` ah imagine ah had been waiting fo' in da same way dat uh guillotine waits fo' uh neck ta slice. ah even felt as if muh motha fuckin peeps wuz bulging from muh motha fuckin head, erectile wiff horror; in Simone's hairy poon-tang, ah seen da wan blue eye o' Marcelle, gazing at me through tears o' urine. Streaks o' come in da steaming fro helped give dat dreamy vision uh disastrous sadness. ah held da thighs open while Simone wuz convulsed by da urinary spasm, an' da burning urine streamed out from under da eye down ta da thighs below…
