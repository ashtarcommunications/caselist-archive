==Holocaust trivialization== 

A.The Holocaust is a religious term used to refer to the attempted Nazi extermination of the Jewish people. Using the term in any other context is a joke.

2. Impact-Their argument risks a slippery slope – once we decide that certain lives are not worth living- all killing is justified and we jeopardize all ethics
Lisa Hanger, B.A. at Miami University, Summer, 1992, Journal of Law-Medicine, 5 Health Matrix 347




3. The alternative is to reject the affirmative for their framing of life. We endorse a framework where there is always meaning to life.

==Ableist Rhetoric is bad== 
Even if their rhetoric is not targeted at a specific person, disability metaphors perpetuate the disability stigma and oppression of people with disabilities.
Moshe 5 (Liat, PhD Student in Sociology, Disability Studies and Women Studies at Syracuse University, “’Lame Idea: Disabling Language in the Classroom’”, Building Pedagogical Curb Cuts: Incorporating Disability in the University Classroom and Curriculum)


Ableist language upholds the notion of the “ideal body” and perpetuates the medical model.

==Guerilla Kritik== 

The affirmative invokes the image of the guerrilla war against power. Ironically this sad appropriation of an empty mythos is what reveals the strategic paralysis the affirmative and dooms their project.

When that core of the.... often an early grave. 


The myth of the Guerilla inevitably slips into a violent, self enclosed fantasy that ignores its own failure, its violence and it s cooperation by the political elites of the day.
