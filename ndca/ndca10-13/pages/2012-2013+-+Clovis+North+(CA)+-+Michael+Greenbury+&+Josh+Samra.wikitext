__**Contention 1 – SQ**__

**Status quo fails- two reasons**
a) Inadequate funding system has left inland waterways in disrepair --- it’s only matter a of time before a major failure
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Boselovic, 12</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (3/18/2012, Len, “Locked and Dammed: The region's 23 locks and dams are on the brink of failure,” [[http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/environment/locked-and-dammed-the-regions-23-locks-and-dams-are-on-the-brink-of-failure-517289/?print=1]], JMP)</span>

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While Pittsburgh has some of the oldest locks</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;">...</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="line-height: 1.5;"> invest in themselves,"</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> he said.</span>

b) Crumbling infrastructure risks failures __across the system__ that will force freight onto costly and environmentally dangerous alternatives
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Toohey, 11</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> --- President and CEO of Waterways Council, Inc. (9/21/2011, Mike, Congressional Documents and Publications, House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment Hearing - "The Economic Importance and Financial Challenges of Recapitalizing the Nation's Inland Waterways Transportation System," Factiva, JMP)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Mr. Chairman, our inland waterways...</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.5;">preventing that outcome.</span>

Plan: <span style="line-height: 1.5;">The United States federal government should substantially increase investment for inland waterway transportation infrastructure in the United States by $20 billion dollars.</span>



__**Contention 2 Is the Economy**__
a) The economy is improving now but growing congestion on inland waterways will expose gaps in the infrastructure and tank competitiveness
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The Herald Dispatch, 12</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (5/24/2012, “Nation should invest in waterways facilities,” [[http://www.herald-dispatch.com/opinions/x1198917856/Nation-should-invest-in-waterways-facilities]], JMP)</span>

America's inland waterways...<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.5;"> American consumer, too.</span>

b) Even if there are no catastrophic failures the lack of investment __injects uncertainty__ that will undermine the viability of the inland waterway system
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bray, 11</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> --- Center for Transportation Research, University of Tennessee, Knoxville (9/21/2011, Larry G., Congressional Documents and Publications, House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment Hearing - "The Economic Importance and Financial Challenges of Recapitalizing the Nation's Inland Waterways Transportation System,” Factiva, JMP)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Has Aging Infrastructure Left US Inland Navigation at a Crossroads?</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">While my years of study...</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.5;">restored will top many lists.</span>

c) The loss of inland water systems causes economic collapse- three internal links

1) Business and agriculture uncertainty undermines U.S. competitiveness
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Gibbs, 12 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">– Member, Representative for Ohio’s 18th Congressional District (4/18/2012, Bob Gibbs, “HOW RELIABILITY OF THE INLAND WATERWAY SYSTEM IMPACTS ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS”, [[http://transportation.house.gov/news/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=1609]])</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Washington, DC – The Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee... to our country.”</span>

2) The lack of investment prevents an economic recovery
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Davidson, 5/20</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Paul, 5/20/2012, “USA's creaking infrastructure holds back economy,” [[http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/story/2012-05-20/creaking-infrastructure/55096396/1]], JMP)</span>

Inland waterways quietly //keep...//<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.5;">waterways are less visible, he says.</span>

3) Also failures independently drive up electricity costs that will __ripple through the economy__
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Boselovic, 12</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (3/18/2012, Len, “Locked and Dammed: The region's 23 locks and dams are on the brink of failure,” [[http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/environment/locked-and-dammed-the-regions-23-locks-and-dams-are-on-the-brink-of-failure-517289/?print=1]], JMP)</span>
*William Harder is the former navigation manager in the Corps' Great Lakes and Ohio River division

**<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Corps and industry officials...</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.5;">spokesman Gary Lobaugh said.</span>**

**<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">d) two impacts to economic decline</span>**
**<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">1) prolif, regional wars, and terrorism</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Kemp ’10</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [Geoffrey Kemp, Director of Regional Strategic Programs at The Nixon Center, served in the White House under Ronald Reagan, special assistant to the president for national security affairs and senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs on the National Security Council Staff, Former Director, Middle East Arms Control Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2010, The East Moves West: India, China, and Asia’s Growing Presence in the Middle East, p. 233-4]</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The second scenario...</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">for two-thirds of the planet’s population</span>**
**e) hegemony**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Freidberg & Schonfeld, 8</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> --- *Professor of Politics and IR at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School, AND </span>**senior editor of Commentary and a visiting scholar at the Witherspoon Institute in Princeton (10/21/2008, Aaron and Gabriel, “The Dangers of a Diminished America”, Wall Street Journal, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122455074012352571.html?mod=googlenews_wsj)

With the global financial system...<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.5;"> continued American leadership.</span>



__**Contention 3 is free trade**__

First is china bashing- Unemployment causes backlash against free trade and China bashing
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Jimenez 12 </span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">(Alfredo Montufar-Helu Jimenez, master's student at Georgetown University; degree in political science and international relations from CIDE, Mexico City, “Protectionism Makes Comeback As Recovery Stalls”,http://atlanticsentinel.com/2012/01/protectionism-makes-comeback-as-recovery-stalls/, RS)</span>

The plan is our only hope- investing in inland waterways creates immediate employment and allows the U.S. to double exports over the next five years
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Toohey, 11 </span>---<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> President and CEO of Waterways Council, Inc. (9/21/2011, Mike, Congressional Documents and Publications, House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment Hearing - "The Economic Importance and Financial Challenges of Recapitalizing the Nation's Inland Waterways Transportation System," Factiva, JMP)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Mr. Chairman, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we face a ...</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.5;"> recapitalize our Nation's inland waterways system.</span>

Waterway infrastructure improvements are key to boost exports now - establishes trade leadership
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Independent Record, 12</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (January 12, 2012, Independent Records, HelenaAir- Montana Daily News, “Efficient waterways key to exports,” [[http://m.helenair.com/mobile/article_622a021e-3ced-11e1-9a56-001871e3ce6c.html]])</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A major infrastructure project neart... country’s exports depends upon it.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 14pt;">And we have two impact scenarios</span>**

China bashing causes war with China
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Palmer and Somerville 11</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> (*Doug Palmer, Staff writer for Reuters, **Glen Somerville, staff writer for Reuters, “Analysis: Obama to challenge China on trade as election nears”, Reuters, October 13, 2011,**</span>**<span class="apple-converted-space" style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;"> [[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/13/us-usa-china-trade-idUSTRE79C72820111013]], RS</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">)</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Second is protectionism</span>**

**Lack of trade leadership causes protectionism and mercantilism**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Linicome 6/12/12</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Scott Lincicome, an international trade attorney with White & Case, LLP. He has extensive experience in trade litigation before with the United States Department of Commerce, the US International Trade Commission (ITC), served as a senior trade policy adviser for Senator John McCain’s Presidential campaign, former researcher for the CATO Institute, “Is Missing American Trade Leadership Beginning to Bear Protectionist Fruit?” June 12, 2012, http://lincicome.blogspot.com/2012/06/is-missing-american-trade-leadership.html, RS) </span>**

__Contention 4 is Solvency**__

A) The Corps has improved communications in the last year – all we need is funding
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Clark 11/30</span> (Raina, writer for MarineLink.com, “Poor Conditions, Better Communications”, MarineLink.com, 30 November 2012, [[http://www.marinelink.com/news/communications-conditions349641.aspx]], accessed 8 December 2012) MG

B) A federal investment strategy is key to effectively expand inland waterways --- imposes obligations on government planners and decision makers
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bray, 11</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> --- Center for Transportation Research, University of Tennessee, Knoxville (9/21/2011, Larry G., Congressional Documents and Publications, House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment Hearing - "The Economic Importance and Financial Challenges of Recapitalizing the Nation's Inland Waterways Transportation System,” Factiva, JMP)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Does Economic Theory Support a Federal Role in the Creation of Renewed Inland Navigation Capacity and, If So, What is the Proper Course?</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Even after decades of mergers...</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="line-height: 1.5;">spread equitably across this broader array of beneficiaries</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">C) Federal action is key to ensure increased use of inland waterways for freight transportation --- federal government key to signal</span>
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">DOT</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 20</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">11 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(United States Department of Transportation, April 2011, “America’s Marine Highway Report to Congress”, [[http://www.marad.dot.gov/documents/MARAD_AMH_Report_to_Congress.pdf]]”) </span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Despite significant progress in short sea ...</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Highway services in a significant manner.</span>

D) The federal government has constitutional right
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Toohey, 11</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> --- President and CEO of Waterways Council, Inc. (9/21/2011, Mike, Congressional Documents and Publications, House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment Hearing - "The Economic Importance and Financial Challenges of Recapitalizing the Nation's Inland Waterways Transportation System," Factiva, JMP)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Mr. Chairman, </span>the inland waterways system...<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> extending demands of commerce."</span>

E) Federal action is key- Jurisdiction kills state and private sector solvency
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">DOT</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 20</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">11 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(United States Department of Transportation, April 2011, “America’s Marine Highway Report to Congress”, [[http://www.marad.dot.gov/documents/MARAD_AMH_Report_to_Congress.pdf]]”) </span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Conclusion </span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The inland waterway system of the United States stands ...national transportation network for the 21 st Century.</span>

G) Increasing funding for infrastructure investments will prevent catastrophic failures in the system --- further delay risks economic crises
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Boselovic, 12</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (3/25/12, Len, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, “LEGISLATION PROPOSED TO FUND DETERIORATING LOCKS AND DAMS,” Factiva, JMP)</span>

H) Spending is inevitable --- doing it now is better to prevent much greater spending and economic decline in the future
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 12</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (3/25/2012, “WATER TORTURE CONGRESS NEEDS TO ACT ON DECAYING LOCKS AND DAMS,” Factiva, JMP)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There's still time. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A 2010 report produced by the industry and corps suggested raising the diesel fuel tax to between 26 and 29 cents and to use the trust fund exclusively for lock construction and repair projects costing $100 million or more, with other projects picked up by the federal government.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Soon legislation will be introduced in Congress to increase funding to $380 million a year -- and that should be taken up as a matter of urgency.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Post-Gazette has often editorialized about the problems of aging locks and dams and the need to do something, but never before has an in-depth series laid out the stakes so starkly and comprehensively. Will anyone listen? Or must a disaster happen in order to get the nation's attention? No one wants to write an editorial that begins, "We told you so."</span>
