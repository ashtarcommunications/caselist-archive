<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Overgrown with weeds, wilted flowers, and cracked tombstones — the decline of our cemeteries and graveyards reveals the fact that society views death as biological --- excluding it as a social event—it is only ever the final beat of a heart and then you are forgotten.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">There is no symbolic exchange—the dead are dried up like forgotten and lost gods our cemeteries fall, the dead are the least of our concern—seen as unproductive in our consumer society that fuels the violence of media driven destruction</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Life isn’t a preparation to have more life, more objects, and more happiness… it is a quest to prepare to die—but we forget this and assert immortality.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Every car door we slam, every key we turn, every cinnamon challenge taken is haunted by death</span></strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Far from imagining a world without evil, violence, or car crashes, the plan returns social exchange with death—we refuse to be blackmailed by the desire to endlessly ward off death.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We don’t assert death as a biologicalevent—rather we understand death as a social event—your ballot is a ritual tool, an initiation process, not an end to a debate career at the TOC, not an end to a round but a beginning—it reverses the biological assumption about death through a ceremony.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Your magical wand of fiat is a ritual staff, one that refuses to banish away death but rather rejects the splitting of life and death—this debate is about who has the best relation to the dead.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">This exclusion of the dead from our social spheres is the founding binary upon which all other forms of violence are built</span></strong><br />

<u><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>Contention 3 is the Ceremony</strong></span></u><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The signs of the 1ac are pushed to their absurd limit and this ceremony is a fatal strategy without meaning—and the fidelity to the rules of the game for no other purpose than they are the rule of the game kills the cult of meaning and subjectivity.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Though this might seem immoral we prefer to the strategy of identification with the absurdity of debate, overly highlighted cards, half-drunk critics, and its arbitrary chaotic impact… this fascination with evils is a way to show the presence of power so it can be exposed.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The social is just a sharing of simulation—and so is debate, no one really believes the shit they say but the game is fun—in order to not replicate a culture of sameness it is necessary to assert a seductive strategy that remakes illusion in the arbitrary rules of the game.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The useless signs of the 1ac disappoint demands for meaning—this abuse of the sign in the 1ac is key to deconstructing the logic of subject.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The 1AC may be drawing to a close but our ceremony isn’t --- By asserting the rules absent any meaning or ethics a strategy of seduction takes place that disrupts the logic of causality and history—this is a strategy of play that reclaims the fun in debate through the creating of a widely creative ceremony.</span></strong><br />

Imagine you woke up tomorrow and there were no cars. Youdidn’t have one,<span class="underline"> your neighbor didn’t </span>have one<span class="underline">, your cousin</span> in Vermillion <span class="underline">didn’t</span> have one.<br />
Also no bikes, vespas, or motorcycles. No highway transport of any kind,except for the occasional delayed and underfunded ambulance.<br />
<span class="underline">So you could get to medical care sometimes.</span><br />
<span class="underline">But </span>what is the list of things you are completely unable to do?<br />
<span class="underline">If groceries aren’t close, that’s shot. What about your pharmacy</span>?<br />
I’m one of the lucky ones. By accident of location I am close to church, banking, pharmacy, and groceries.)<br />
What about clothing, shoes, or dental care? Glasses?<br />
<span class="underline">Never mind the out of reach luxury of visiting friends, taking in a movie, or going to the park. Out to dinner? </span>Forget about it.<br />
That’s the kind of life that many many people with disabilities live in Lorain County right now, and have since 2009 when paratransit and fixed transit disappeared from everywhere in Lorain County except Lorain and Elyria in 2009. (With some exceptions that I’ll detail in a moment.)<br />
And please don’t bring out that tired old saw: “We don’t have that problem in Lorain County…I never see any folks with disabilities in my business anyway so it’s not my problem.”<br />
The *reason* you don’t see us spending our time or money in your businesses<span class="underline">, houses of worship, or homes, folks….</span>is because we *cannot get to them.* <span class="underline">If we cannot get to then, how would you ever be able to accurately grasp the scope of the problem?</span><br />
Some of us do not have friends or family with accessible transport<span class="underline"> that can step in. </span>It’s not like there’s a lift van in every garage.<br />
We cannot walk where we need to go.<br />
<span class="underline">We cannot defray some of our own “cost” to society as we would very much like to do, by full or part time employment, because </span>how in the heck do we get there? One of my neighbors lost a cool job because her transport source became inaccessible to her.<br />

Human existence is defined by individual experiences and narratives such as these, unique to each individual’s understandings yet seemingly opaque when viewed from a position of alterity. All communities are defined by these narratives, used to distinguish between self and other. While sacred orders define themselves by a fixed transcendent idea of the human and seek to eradicate the profane other, holy communities seek self-transcendence through the affirmation of the dignity of others through justice and compassion.<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Fasching and deChant</span></strong>200<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">1</span></strong> (Darrell J., Professor of Religious Studies at the University of South Florida, Dell, Director of Religious Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of South Florida, <em>Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach,</em> Pp. 10)<br />
<span class="underline">Human religiousness is defined by … human </span>dignity <span class="underline">of precisely those who do not share my identity and my stories.</span><br />

Hello Mr. Ennis, My name is Pedro Segura and I am a high school policy debater. This year's debate topic centers around US military presence in Japan and other countries. <span class="underline">My team and I argue that a removal of American Marine presence from the Okinawa prefecture, including that stationed at Futenma, would prevent animosity from the Okinawan public from spilling over and causing the US-Japanese alliance further damage. </span>Absent an immediate resolution to the Futenma issue, we argue that strategically important American bases elsewhere on Japan, specifically the Yokosuka naval base and the Kadena air base, will experience backlash from an angry public. We use excerpts from your November 29, 2010 Dispatch Japan article, &quot;Okinawa: Why the Nakaima win spells trouble&quot; to elaborate upon the specific ways that public sentiment can spill over and harm the alliance, with Prime Minister Naoto Kan's upcoming visit to Washington and the potential malleability of the newly reelected Okinawan governor, Hirokazu Nakaima, to public anti-base sentiment. My question is<span class="underline">, should the Futenma issue be spotlessly resolved, how would this affect anti-base sentiment in Japan as a whole, specifically in other cities with American bases? I</span> understand that the Kadena air base, whose strategic necessity was asserted in your August 2010 article, &quot;Gates and Japan,&quot; is rather large and is centered in the towns of Kadena and Chatan, and has already been the object of sizable local protests and activism. <span class="underline">Would a perceived victory for anti-base movement embolden such anti-base rhetoric? And if it did, would the Japanese government be willing to go through another political mess like the one associated with Futenma to sate anti-Kadena movements?</span> I thank you sincerely in advance for your time. If you can provide your opinion, I would like to share this exchange with other debaters on a blog, with your consent. It could be very valuable educationally for many people and we really appreciate your time. Cheers, Pedro Segura<br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">subject bases in Japan</span><br />
Pedro, My pleasure to try to answer your excellent, pointed questions. First off, it is not clear what a &quot;spotless&quot; resolution of the Futenma would look like. Leaving that aside, a resolution of Futenma <span class="underline">that was widely perceived by Okinawans as &quot;fair,&quot; </span>would greatly reduce anti-base sentiment on Okinawa<span class="underline">, and almost certainly do the same on the four mainland islands of Japan, where anti-base sentiment is significantly lower than that on Okinawa</span>. In other words, a &quot;fair&quot; resolution of the Futenma issue would go a long way toward putting the US base presence in Japan overall on a stable foundation politically for many years to come. It should be emphasized that the main source of tension <span class="underline">over the US force presence in Japan </span>is <span class="underline">the heavy concentration of US facilities in </span>Okinawa <span style="font-size: 9pt;">prefecture (state), and particularly on the main island of Okinawa. Of all of the territory in Japan overall taken up by US military </span>facilties (less than 1% of Japan's total territory), 75% of the land is concentrated in Okinawa prefecture. On the main prefectural island, not surprisingly also named Okinawa, a full 20% of the total island territory is taken up by US military facilities. <span class="underline">At the site of other major US facilties in Japan, including Yokusuka</span>, Misawa air base, the Atsugi naval air station, the Iwakuni Marine Air Station, the Yokoto US Air base, and the US Army Camp Zama (all on the main island of Honshu), <span class="underline">there is very little anti-base sentiment. Yokosuka, for example, is an old navy city, formerly the location of major basing for the Imperial Japanese Navy. The local citizens around Yokosuka are respectful of the US sailors</span>. Okinawa is quite different. First there is long-standing cultural distance between Okinawans and Japanese on the main islands, the result of which is a deep feeling, rarely expressed, that Okinawans are not &quot;really&quot; Japanese. Toward the end of World War II, Okinawans came to believe that the main island residents essentially sacrificed Okinawans. The Battle of Okinawa caused enormous death and destruction in Okinawa. As the post-World War II period progressed, the heavy US base presence on the main islands, including in Tokyo, greatly receded, while that on Okinawa did not change much. This has led to a feeling among Okinawans that they, and their territory, bear the brunt of the burden of hosting US bases, which are crucial to the alliance. <span class="underline">The residents of the main islands benefit from the alliance, but bear a much, much smaller burden in the form of US bases, than do the main islands</span>. All of this tension finally erupted in September 1995, at the time of the brutal rape of a young Japanese woman by four US servicemen based on Okinawa. To reduce the pressure-cooker of tension that finally erupted due to the rape, the US knew it had to make a dramatic gesture. Then-Prime Minister Hatoyama proposed to the US that the Futenma facility be closed, as its location in the middle of Ginowan city poses enormous problems; an airplane or helicopter crash would cause enormous physical, human, and political damage. The US finally agreed to close Futenma, and protracted negotiations ensued concerning where to relocate the operations then based at Futenma. In the end, the two side decided to move the operations Camp Schwab, also on Okinawa. After more than 15 years, that is where the issue remains. <span class="underline">The most controversial aspect of the projected replacement for Futenma is that it would entail construction of a new facility, in beautiful Henoko Bay</span>, which struck many Okinawans as yet another sign of failure to consider their sentiments in the matter. <span class="underline">The Kadena base is quite large, and has been the focus of some protests. But there is a broad consensus that the antipathy directed at Kadena is manageable, especially if the Futenma issue is resolved</span> in a &quot;fair&quot; way. <span class="underline">Kadena is also located on Okinawa, and some</span>US officials have expressed concern that Kadena would be the next focus on anti-base sentiment<span class="underline"> on Okinawa should the US &quot;retreat&quot; on the Futenma issue. </span>But there is not strong evidence to support that assertion.Rather than fueling anti-base activists to target new facilities<span class="underline">, a decision by the US to </span>alter the current Futenma <span class="underline">replacement plans and make a new, &quot;fair&quot; </span>arrangementwould actually reduce the broader anti-base heat on Okinawa.<br />

1.3 Definitions <span class="underline">We define</span> (net) public <span class="underline">investment as</span> public <span class="underline">expenditure that </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">adds to the</span></em> public <em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">physical capital stock</span></em><span class="underline">. This would include</span> the <span class="underline">building</span> of <span class="underline">roads, ports, </span>schools, hospitals<span class="underline"> etc. This corresponds to the definition of</span> public <span class="underline">investment </span>in national accounts data,<em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">namely, capital expenditure</span></em>. It is not within the scope of this paper to include public expenditure on health and education, despite the fact that many regard such expenditure as investment. Methods for assessing the poverty impact of public expenditure on social sectors such as health and education have been well covered elsewhere in recent years (see for example, van de Walle and Nead, 1995; Sahn and Younger, 2000; and World Bank, 2002).<br />

<span class="underline">Capital costs are fixed</span>, one-time <span class="underline">expenses incurred on the purchase of land, buildings, construction, and equipment used</span> in the production of goods or in the rendering of services. Put simply, it is the total cost needed to bring a project to a commercially operable status. Whether a particular cost is capital or not depend on many factors such as accounting, tax laws, and materiality.<br />
<span class="underline">Capital costs include expenses for </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">tangible goods</span></em><span class="underline"> such as the purchase of plants and machinery</span>, as well as expenses for intangibles assets such as trademarks and software development.<br />
Capital costs are not limited to the initial construction of a factory or other business. Namely, the purchase of a new machine to increase production and last for years is a capital cost. <em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Capital costs do not include labor costs (they do include construction labor).</span></em> Unlike operating costs, capital costs are one-time expenses but payment may be spread out over many years in financial reports and tax returns. Capital costs are fixed and are therefore independent of the level of output.<br />

In this analysis, investment in infrastructure is defined as <strong>capital spending on transportation</strong>, utilities (for example, water and power supply), environmental projects, and schools. 1 In addition, because they account for a significant share of the tax-exempt debt issued, health care facilities and hospitals are treated as infrastructure in this study, although they might not be classified as such for many other types of analyses. <span class="DebateUnderline">Capital spending under this study’s definition consists of investment </span>in <strong>physical capital</strong>, such as structures and facilities,<span class="DebateUnderline"> rather than intangible capital, which is formed by spending on</span> educational <span class="DebateUnderline">programs or on research and development</span>.<br />

Mr Obama is thinking big. His 2012 budget proposal contains $556 billion for transport, to be spent over six years. But his administration has declined to explain where the money will come from. Without new funding, some Democratic leaders have warned, a new, six-year transport bill will have to trim annual highway spending by about a third to keep up with falling petrol-tax revenues. But Republicans are increasingly sceptical of any new infrastructure spending. Party leaders have taken to using inverted commas around the word “investment” when Democrats apply it to infrastructure.<br />

 <br />
We advocate the entirety of the 1AC except the author citations.<br />
<br />
Plagiarism solves and avoids the net benefits-it allows us to create radical change and opens up space for us and others to listen. There is no such thing as intellectual property only by sharing their ideas as our own can we solve the 1AC<br />
Andrew <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Barron</span>, hopeless romantic, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and</span> pedro <span style="font-size: 12pt;">segura</span>, Gotham’s reckoning <span style="font-size: 12pt;">RIGHT NOW </span><br />
<br />
So we can see that our acceptance of the tradition of &quot;intellectual property&quot; has negative effects upon our endeavors to think critically and learn from our artistic and philosophical heritage. What can we do to address this problem? One of the possible solutions is plagiarism.II. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Plagiarism and the Modern Revolutionary Plagiarism is an especially effective method of appropriating and reorganizing ideas, and as such it can be a useful tool for a young man or woman looking to encourage new and exciting thinking in others. And it is a method that is revolutionary in that it does not recognize &quot;intellectual property&quot; rights but rather strikes out against them and all of the negative effects that recognizing them can have. Plagiarism focuses attention on content and away from incidental issues, by making the genuine origins of the material impossible to ascertain. Besides, as suggested above, it could be argued that the genuine origins of the contents of most inspirations and propositions are impossible to determine anyway. By signing a new name, or no name at all, to a text, the plagiarizer puts the material in an entirely new context, and this may generate new perspectives and new thinking about the subject that have not appeared before.</span>Plagiarism also makes it possible to combine the best or most relevant parts of a number of texts, thus creating a new text with many of the virtues of the older ones—and some new virtues, as well, since the combination of material from different sources is bound to result in unforeseeable effects and might well result in the unlocking of hidden meanings or possibilities that have been dormant in the texts for years. Finally, above all, plagiarism is the reappropriation of ideas: when an individual plagiarizes a text which those who believe in intellectual property would have held &quot;sacred,&quot; she denies that there is a difference in rank between herself and the thinker she takes from. She takes the thinker's ideas for herself, to express them as she <span style="font-size: 10pt;">sees fit, rather than treating the thinker as an authority whose work she is duty-bound to preserve as he intended. She denies, in fact, that there is a fundamental difference between the thinker and the rest of humanity, by appropriating the thinker's material as the property of humanity. After all, a good idea should be available to everyone—should belong to everyone—if it really is a good idea. In a society organized with human happiness as the objective, copyright infringement laws and similar restrictions would not hinder the distribution and recombination of ideas. These impediments only make it more difficult for individuals who are looking for challenging and inspiring material to come upon it and share it with others. </span>So, if there truly is &quot;nothing new under the sun,&quot; take them at their word, and act accordingly. Take what seems relevant to your life and your needs from the theories and doctrines prepared by those who came before you. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Don't be afraid to reproduce word for word those texts which seem perfect to you, so you can share them with others who might also benefit from them. And at the same time, don't be afraid to plunder ideas from different sources and rearrange them in ways that you find more useful and exciting, more relevant to your own needs and experiences. Seek to create a personally constructed body of critical and creative thought</span>, with elements gathered from as many sources as possible, rather than choosing from one of the prefabricated ideologies that are offered to you. After all, do we have ideas, or do they have us?<br />
<br />
The impact is the worst forms of violence imaginable you must meet our demands to end the demand for intellectual property<br />

Without revolution we are doomed to extinction. This round is key though it allows us to live free as individuals and change the system and process to one that allows for anarchy.<br />

<br />
Can we get along? Even for those of us who would prefer to be hermits, there is no question today more important than this one—the fate of our species and planet will be decided by it. There is no shortcut around this dilemma. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Any kind of capital-R Revolution, any redistribution of wealth and power, will be short-lived and irrelevant without a fundamental change in our relationships—for social structure is an expression of these relationships, not a factor external to them. Revolution, then, is not a single moment, but a way of living: anarchy and hierarchy always coexist in varying proportions, and the important question is simply which you foster in your own life</span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span></em>We are ill-qualified to reconstruct human relations if we can’t even get along with each other in the attempt—and nothing seems to create dissension and division like those attempts. Often it seems that the people who know least how to relate to others are the self-professed activists who set out to save them. Yet<span style="font-size: 10pt;">these conflicts are not an inescapable consequence of human nature, but rather a pattern of cause and effect—which can and must be altered.</span> This is a starting place to consider what the challenges are in undertaking this, and why we’ve had such a hard time to date.<br />

Our counterplan is competitive by avoiding the disads to federal overrule and judicial process – having the appeal courts overrule necessary precludes Supreme Court action, making the perm impossible<br />
Next, the counterplan solves - Inferior courts should not be constrained by precedent – the best judicial model has the lower courts act as proxies to shield the Supreme Court<br />

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: 0px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: 19784px; width: 1px;">In the 1950s the Mississippi was ready for another change, exploring in ever greater enthusiasm the Atchafalaya River basin. But this time the river had a new enemy: money. If the river succeeded in doing what it had always done, it would leave high and dry the Port of New Orleans, devastate the city’s economy as well as that of Baton Rouge, cut off nearly 20 per cent of the country’s oil imports and 16 per cent of the nation’s fisheries harvest, and choke off a major outlet for U.S. Agricultural exports. It would leave high and dry a chain of refineries and factories stretching from Baton Rouge to New Orleans that depend for their existence on the barges and the fresh water that the river wants to give to the Atchafalaya. It was, well, unthinkable. <span class="underline">The <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Congress ordered the </span>U.S. Army <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Corps </span>of Engineers to go to war with the Mississippi. “We are <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">fight</span>ing Mother <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Nature</span>,” </span>the Corps declared in a promotional film, “It’s a battle we have to fight day by day, year by year; the health of our economy depends on victory. Our opponent could cause the United States to lose nearly all her seaborne commerce, to lose her standing as first among trading nations.” <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The result of this</span></span> declaration of war <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">was</span></span> named, with typical Corps hubris, <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the Old River Control Structures</span></span><span class="Underline0"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">.</span></span> The Old River was a natural east-west channel that had opened between the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers about 200 miles above New Orleans. By the 1950s, 30 per cent of the Mississippi’s flow was roaring down the steeper, lower Atchafalaya drainage, scouring it ever deeper, getting ready to switch its course entirely. The Corps’ war on water consisted of throwing a dam across the Old River, then building, 10 miles upstream, a 560-foot-long set of 11 floodgates across an artificial channel that henceforth would bend the Father of Waters to the will of the United States Congress. That body declared it illegal for the Mississippi to yield more than 30 per cent of its flow to the Atchafalaya. That is how much it gave up in 1950, and by law, for the Mississippi, it was to be forever 1950. The implementation of the law began in 1963, when the Control Structures took over. It was all part of the Corps of Engineers’ “Mississippi River and Tributaries Project” — the war to end all floods for all time from Cairo, Illinois, to New Orleans. Ten quiet years followed, for which the Corps took a great deal of credit. Then came a most unquiet year, when <span class="underline">a combination of heavy rains in the fall of 1972, heavy winter snow and repeated deluges in the spring of 1973 brought massive flooding. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The Corps </span>ran up the white flag and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">opened all the floodgates at Old River</span></span>, and still, day after day, the Father of Waters hammered on the bars of its cell, shook the structure as if it were in a Magnitude 8 earthquake, threw nine-ton boulders at it and ate away at its massive foundations. If you stopped a car on top of the control structure (yes, there’s a road – Route 15 – across what you might call the bridge to San Luis Rey, Louisiana) and opened the car door, the vibration of the structure would slam it shut<span class="underline">. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">One of the </span>massive <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">walls that gathered the flow</span> of the Mississippi <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">in to the floodgates collapsed. </span>When the whole thing was a whisker away from total failure, the waters began to recede. Afterward, the badly frightened engineers of the Corps wondered how close it had been</span><span class="Underline0">. </span>As John McPhee described one of the more riveting moments in the long history of man’s war on nature: “<span class="underline">As soon as the water began to recede they set about learning the dimensions of the damage.<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> The structure was </span>obviously <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">undermined</span></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">, </span>but how much so, and where? What was solid, what was not? What was directly below the gates and the roadway? With a diamond drill, in a central position, they bored the first of many holes in the structure. When they had penetrated to basal levels, they lowered a television camera into the hole. They saw fish.”<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> <span class="Underline0">The Corps propped the structure up, poured more concrete, set more pilings, built even more floodgates</span> </span>(the so-called auxiliary structure, deployed in 1986) and <span class="underline">saw it withstand major flooding in 1983, 1993 and 1997. But <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the river will win </span>this war, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">and will go to Morgan City, </span>and bring down the Control Structures and with them the economy of the United States</span><span class="Underline0">.</span> As a study conducted by the Water Resources Research Institute, at Louisiana State University, concluded: <span class="underline">“It could happen next year, during the next decade, or sometime in the next thirty or forty years. But <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the final outcome is simply a matter of time </span>and it is only prudent to prepare for it.”</span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: 0px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: 19784px; width: 1px;"><span class="underline">The northern Gulf</span> of Mexico <span class="underline">has 41% of</span> the <span class="underline">national</span> inventory of coastal <span class="underline">wetlands</span>, but some 6<span class="underline">0%</span> of <span class="underline">these are concentrated in the MRD </span>(Turner 1997). MRD coastal wetlands are among the most threatened in the world, however, accounting for over 80% of the nation’s total coastal wetland loss (Field, D.W. 1991, Turner 1997, Dahl 2000). The most recent assessment by the US Geological Survey indicates a loss of 1,515 square miles since 1932 in the MRD, with another 368 in the Chenier Plain of southwest Louisiana (Couvillion et al., 2011). It is apparent that the <span class="underline">loss is not distributed uniformly over the MRD</span> (Figure 11). Almost half of the marshes that once made up the bird's foot delta at the mouth of the main stem of the MSR are now gone, while those around the Atchafalaya River mouth have been much more stable, and the twin deltas of the Atchafalaya have grown rapidly although they are getting less than 30 percent of the MSR discharge. The net loss in the MRD over this 79 year period amounts to 26 percent of the 5,763 square miles of wetlands once present in the MRD. The only good news is that the rate of land loss appears to be dropping from 70 square miles a year in the 1970s to 12 square miles per year since the mid-1980s (Couvillion et al., 2011). This loss is due in large part to the construction of levees along the Mississippi River and dredging of more than 15,000 miles of canals for navigation and energy development. These <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">man-made modifications </span>have disrupted natural flooding cycles and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">prevented deposition of sediments that</span> once <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">sustained the wetlands of the </span>Mississippi River <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Delta</span></span>. <span class="underline">Without a new round of human <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">intervention </span>to reconnect the Mississippi River to its delta and to restore estuarine hydrology, it is projected that Louisiana’s coastal <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">wetlands, </span>along <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">with their amazing biological productivity, will be gone</span></span> in less than 200 years. <span class="underline">The MRD is the most dynamic and changeable landscape in North America, because it is subject to subsidence or sinking rates that are also unequalled anywhere else</span>. So wetland loss has always been a natural part of the deltaic cycle in the MRD, as the MSR has periodically shifted courses in a major way every 1,000 years or so. Once the primary locus of deposition shifts away from one lobe as the river begins to build a new one elsewhere across the deltaic plain, wetlands associated with the abandoned lobe begin to break up and disappear as they sink below sea level. This geologic history is evident in land loss maps that have been compiled since the advent of high-resolution aerial photography in the 1930s. Today, <span class="underline">only the wetlands in the vicinity of the outlets of the Atchafalaya are stable and sustainable, while everywhere else, particularly adjacent to the leveed MSR mainstem, MRD <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">wetlands are experiencing a catastrophic collapse</span></span> (Figure 11). <span class="underline">Shoreline retreat and barrier island fragmentation are aspects of the delta cycle, particularly as it has been accelerated by modern managemen</span>t, but <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the</span> <span class="underline">more pervasive <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">impact is that of </span>interior <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">breakup of wetlands </span>and rapid formation of large bays and lagoons that <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">reduce the integrity of the coast</span> and make it more vulnerable to deep inland penetration of oil</span>, whether released offshore or in the interior.

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: 0px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: 19784px; width: 1px;">Under natural conditions, the massive watershed of <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the Mississippi delivered</span> huge amounts of fresh water and massive amounts of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">sediment to </span>create the salinity mixing zones and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">re-nourish</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">deltaic structure</span></span><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> <span class="underline">which</span></span> together <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">support</span></span> the <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">wetlands</span></span> that both cleanse waters entering the Gulf <span class="underline">and providing habitats for</span> a plethora of <span class="underline">wildlife</span> and fisheries species. Furthermore, the Mississippi once delivered freshwater and sediments to the Gulf through multiple outlets, including a number that were significant only during large discharge events. Today that discharge is delivered through only two, with most flow directed into deep water off the continental shelf where it is stratified with lighter freshwater forming a layer over denser salt water. This is the artificially induced situation that gives rise to the dead zone. If this water were released through multiple outlets, particularly to the east, it would drive wetland creation and rehabilitation within the deteriorating wetlands just over the levees that are today being lost at higher rates than anywhere else on the planet. Finally, <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">creating</span> controllable lateral <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">discharges through</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">levees would</span> generate estuarine conditions farther east on the shallow shelf, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">giving rise to </span>higher <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">productivity</span></span> in Chandeleur and Mississippi Sounds far <span class="underline">beyond the Louisiana border</span>. Thus, the vast majority of river water entering the US GOM comes in at two points located about 150 miles apart, with most entering during the first six months of the year. <span class="underline">The nature of </span>these <span class="underline">outlets has been heavily modified by man</span>, with the largest input at the MSR bird's foot artificially pinned precariously to the edge of the continental shelf by a vast complex of rock structures built to allow deep-draft navigation into the MSR. <span class="underline">Maintaining this e</span>ntrance <span class="underline">requires nearly constant dredging as the MSR is no longer capable of efficiently transporting sand through these structures and is seeking other outlets</span>. Upstream, <span class="underline">the MSR is managed for a single deep channel</span> to facilitate barge traffic during the lowest discharge periods, and is flanked by thousands of miles of flood control levees designed to confine the highest discharges and speed floods into the GOM. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Modifications</span> in this century-old management scheme <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to provide </span>more outlets for <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">sediment</span> and water within the MRD <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">could</span> greatly <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">improve</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">sustainability </span>and cost-effectiveness of both flood control and navigation</span>, <span class="underline">while allowing the MSR <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to</span> better <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">sustain</span> not only MRD <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">wetlands</span>, but also those in other Gulf states as far east as Mobile Bay</span>. The effectiveness of the small diversions operated at Caernarvon and Davis Pond in keeping oil out of MRD estuaries during the BP disaster provided much evidence that<span class="underline"> additional river <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">outlets offer the best potential for limiting ecological damage</span></span> to critical estuaries during future oil releases, whether caused by blowouts or tanker accidents.</span><br />

Development on the coast, from draining of wetlands for energy projects to <span class="underline">channelling waterways for navigation, have changed or interrupted these flows, causing river sediments simply to flow into the Gulf of Mexico rather than being deposited along the delta</span> to protect the coastline. The result has been a massive loss of coastal wetlands. In fact, scientists estimate that every 48 minutes a piece of wetlands the size of a football field disappears into the Gulf of Mexico. Habitat and Biodiversity Loss <span class="underline">The <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">loss of </span>delta <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">coastline</span> also <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">represents</span> a significant <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">loss of </span>coastal habitat and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">biodiversity</span>. The penetration of saltwater into freshwater systems,</span> caused by the destabilization of coastal barriers, <span class="underline">is toxic for much of the plant and animal life in the area. </span>Similarly, <span class="underline">the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">lack of </span>new <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">sediments </span>drastically <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">reduces</span></span> the health and <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">resilience </span>of coastal forests and wetlands</span>, essentially starving them of water and nutrients. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The</span></span> Mississippi <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Delta is home to</span> </span>a rich variety of plants and animals, from <span class="underline">numerous species of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">migratory birds</span> to endangered sperm <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">whales</span></span> in its deeper waters, <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">all </span>of which <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">are threatened by </span>these changes and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">losses in habitat</span></span>. <span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">Chemical Contamination and Cancer Alley Cancer Alley, an unfortunate name given to the area along the Mississippi between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, in which more than 100 chemical and energy companies have set up processing plants, has a rate of cancer far above the national average, presumable caused by dangerous chemicals related to chemical production and refining. The area, predominantly inhabited by poor, minority communities, also has few medical facilities and limited infrastructure. Although Cancer Alley is an extreme example of chemical contamination in the area, it is far from exceptional. Much of the Mississippi Delta has high rates of chemical contamination, posing serious threats to wildlife and public health. Climate Change and Vulnerability Coastal </span><span class="underline">wetlands</span> and barrier islands, in addition to housing rich biodiversity<span class="underline">, act as physical <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">barriers against</span> coastal storms and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">changes in sea level</span>. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Delta </span>systems</span> can also <span class="underline">absorb huge amounts of water, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">acti</span>ng <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">as </span>natural <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">sponges to reduce</span> the frequency, duration and intensity of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">flooding</span></span>.

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: 0px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: 19784px; width: 1px;">The United Nations declared 2010 to be the International year of biodiversity. This year we will celebrate life on earth and the importance of biodiversity. It also presents an occasion for us to think more about biodiversity. What exactly is meant by biodiversity? Why it is so important? Biodiversity is best defined as the variety of all living things. It covers everything from genetic diversity through to the mix of animals and plants that make up an ecosystem. The greater the variety of life the greater the biodiversity. <span class="underline">Different <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">species</span></span> within ecosystems fill particular roles, they all have a function, they <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">all have a niche</span></span>. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">They</span> interact </span>with each other and the physical environment <span class="underline">to provide ecosystem services that <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">are</span> </span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">vital</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">for</span> our <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">survival</span>.</span></span> For example plant species convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and energy from the sun into useful things such as food, medicines and timber. A bee pollinating a flower (Image: ClearlyAmbiguous Flickr) Pollination carried out by insects such as bees enables the production of ⅓ of our food crops. Diverse mangrove and coral reef ecosystems provide a wide variety of habitats that are essential for many fishery species. To make it simpler for economists to comprehend the magnitude of services offered by biodiversity, a team of researchers estimated their value – it amounted to $US33 trillion per year. “<span class="underline">By protecting biodiversity we maintain ecosystem services</span>” Certain species play a “keystone” role in maintaining ecosystem services. Similar to the removal of a keystone from an arch, <span class="underline">the removal of these species can result in the collapse of an ecosystem and the subsequent removal of ecosystem services</span>. The most well known example of this occurred during the 19th century when sea otters were almost hunted to extinction by fur traders along the west coast of the USA. This led to a population explosion in the sea otters’ main source of prey, sea urchins. Because the urchins graze on kelp their booming population decimated the underwater kelp forests. This <span class="underline">loss of habitat led to declines in local fish populations</span>. Sea otters are a keystone species once hunted for their fur (Image: Mike Baird) Eventually a treaty protecting sea otters allowed the numbers of otters to increase which inturn controlled the urchin population, leading to the recovery of the kelp forests and fish stocks. In other cases, ecosystem services are maintained by entire functional groups, such as apex predators (See Jeremy Hance’s post at Mongabay). During the last 35 years, over fishing of large shark species along the US Atlantic coast has led to a population explosion of skates and rays. These skates and rays eat bay scallops and their out of control population has led to the closure of a century long scallop fishery. These are just two examples demonstrating how <span class="underline">biodiversity can maintain the services that ecosystems provide for us, such as fisheries</span>. <span class="underline">One could argue that to maintain ecosystem services we don’t need to protect biodiversity but rather, we only need to protect the species and functional groups that fill the keystone roles</span>. However, <span class="underline">there are a couple of problems with this idea.</span> First of all, <span class="underline">for most ecosystems we don’t know which species are the keystones! <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Ecosystems are</span> so <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">complex</span> that we are still discovering which species play vital roles</span> in maintaining them. In some <span class="underline">cases its <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">groups of species</span> not just one species that <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">are vital for the ecosystem</span></span>. Second, <span class="underline">even if we did complete the enormous task of identifying and protecting all keystone species, what back-up plan would we have if an unforseen even</span>t (e.g. pollution or disease) <span class="underline">led to the demise of these ‘keystone’ species</span>? Would there be another species to save the day and take over this role<span class="underline">? <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Classifying</span> some <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">species as</span> ‘<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">keystone’ implies that the others are not important</span></span>. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">This may lead to the non-keystone</span> species <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">being considered</span> ecologically <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">worthless and</span> subsequently over-<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">exploited</span></span>. Sometimes <span class="underline">we may not even know which species are likely to fill the keystone roles.</span> An example of this was discovered on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. This research examined what would happen to a coral reef if it were over-fished. The “over-fishing” was simulated by fencing off coral bommies thereby excluding and removing fish from them for three years. By the end of the experiment, the reefs had changed from a coral to an algae dominated ecosystem – the coral became overgrown with algae. When the time came to remove the fences the researchers expected herbivorous species of fish like the parrot fish (Scarus spp.) to eat the algae and enable the reef to switch back to a coral dominated ecosystem. But, surprisingly, the shift back to coral was driven by a supposed ‘unimportant’ species – the bat fish (Platax pinnatus). The bat fish was previously thought to feed on invertebrates – small crabs and shrimp, but when offered a big patch of algae it turned into a hungry herbivore – a cow of the sea – grazing the algae in no time. So a fish previously thought to be ‘unimportant’ is actually a keystone species in the recovery of coral reefs overgrown by algae! Who knows how many other species are out there with unknown ecosystem roles! In some cases it’s easy to see who the keystone species are but <span class="underline">in many ecosystems seemingly unimportant or redundant <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">species are</span> also <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">capable of </span>changing niches and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">maintaining ecosystems</span></span>. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The more biodiverse an ecosystem is, </span></span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">the more likely these species will be present and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the more resilient an ecosystem is</span></span></span> to future impacts. Presently we’re only scratching the surface of understanding the full importance of biodiversity and how it helps maintain ecosystem function. The scope of this task is immense. In the meantime, <span class="underline">a wise insurance policy for maintaining ecosystem services would be to conserve biodiversity</span>. In doing so, <span class="underline">we increase the chance of maintaining our ecosystem services in the event of future impacts such as disease, invasive species and of course, climate change.</span> This is the international year of biodiversity – a time to recognize that biodiversity makes our survival on this planet possible and that our protection of biodiversity maintains this service.</span><br />

The back-flow </span>filling of swamps and lakes aggravated siltation and removed the natural flow of water through those areas. That flow had washed silt and decayed plant matter from the swamps in high water times, but after the changes, water tended to flow into each area, slow down and sit until the water level dropped, often draining only once in a flood cycle instead of continually as it had in the past. <span class="underline">In the summer months, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">standing water </span>reached high temperatures that <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">worsened </span>low <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">oxygen problems and </span>discouraged <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">growth </span>of many types<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> of aquatic life. </span>One result of half a century of flow in the new patterns caused by the levees and stream closures has been the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">loss of </span>a large percentage of the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">open </span>and deep<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> water areas </span>i<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">nside the Atchafalaya </span>Basin Floodway System </span>(ABFS) – that area between the protection levees and from US Highway 190 to Morgan City. Hundreds of acres of open water in “Grand Lake” are now willow flats and stands of cottonwood because of the inland delta formation caused by the increased slit carried by the deep, straight channel being dropped in the wide, slower-moving lake.

Most wastewaters do not have enough biodegradable carbon and an external organic source to carry out heterotrophic denitriﬁcation<span class="underline">. In nitrogen removal treatment, biological processes frequently have several obstacles because of lower energy consumption and high cost in the wastewater treatment plant</span><span class="Underline0">. </span>Consequently, many studies on the mechanisms of the nitrogen cycle – not only nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation but also new sustainable processes – are being conducted [32]. In constructed wastewater wetlands<span class="Underline0">, </span><span class="underline">the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">denitriﬁcation </span>process <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">may remove 60-70% of the total </span>removal <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">nitrogen</span></span> and 20-30% of that is derived from plant uptake [35, 37]. In stormwater wetlands, the proportion of nitrogen removed by wetlands is considered to be considerably lower [38]. The mass budget for nutrients indicates that 14% is originated by physical treatment process and 8.6% by plant uptake; i.e<span class="underline">., the absorbed amount of nitrogen into the plant itself is small, but <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the absorbed nitrogen stimulates</span> diverse <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">ecological activities</span> </span>[39]. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Most </span>particulate <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">organic nitrogen </span>in constructed wetlands <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is removed by sedimentation</span> </span>[1]. Particulates may settle on the wetland ﬂoor or may adhere to plant stems. The decomposed materials such as TN, TP, and organics of low molecular weight are used by microorganisms and plants [22]. In nitrogen removal in wetlands, combined physical and chemical processes can be employed. An enhanced sedimentation method using magnesium-ammonium-phosphate (MAP), as added precipitation reagent, has been developed for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater treatment and has the potential to be applied in constructed wetlands</span><br />

Farber uses the replacement cost method for groundwater-dependent communities to develop pump and main infrastructure that would deliver water from other communities.56 Laska notes that</span> <span class="underline">communities that depend on surface water from rivers and bayous rely on coastal wetlands to prevent saltwater intrusion</span>. Laska does not provide economic value estimates for this service. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Wetland loss will mean increased salinity problems</span></span> for these communities.57 Figures for this service were derived from the replacement cost of desalinization plants for 19 coastal parishes in Louisiana and the population of 2.2 million people they serve. Desalinization of brackish water is less expensive than estuarine saltwater. Assuming that the average American uses 90 gallons of water per day, this amounts to an annual 72.3 billion gallons of water use in the Louisiana coast. Using figures from the American Water Works Association, a “low” cost of $1.50/1000 gallons and a “high” cost of $4/1,000 gallons were established. This gives values of $46.67 and $124.47 on a per acre-year basis in 2007 dollars.58 <span class="underline">Some economists argue that replacement costs provide “upper bound” estimates of ecosystem services values. The replacement cost method is appropriate for valuing the water supply functions of the Mississippi River Delta’s wetlands because there are no other alternatives except human-engineered replacements for the provision of freshwater to many communities. In addition, human-built systems, such as a desalinization plant, are more vulnerable to hurricanes damage. Thus the replacement costs may be considerable underestimates because a plant may be destroyed prior to the expected lifetime of the facility. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Built replacement options</span>, such as desalinization, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">are in fact more vulnerable to damage or destruction under conditions of wetland loss.</span> Thus, replacement cost method for human-engineered systems may greatly underestimate the true costs of supplying drinking water. </span></span><br />

These changes alter the ecosystem as they impact the health of plants and marine creatures. Examples of these chemical changes include increases and decreases in water salinity and oxygen levels, as well as increases in acidity. </span>These changes place stress on certain plants and animals, forcing them to adapt to the new conditions, migrate to other locations, or die. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Hypoxia,</span> a condition characterized by low oxygen content in water, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">threatens marine ecosystems </span>along the northern Gulf Coast. </span>Hypoxic waters are defined as those with oxygen contents less than 2 parts per million (United States Geologic Survey, 2010). <span class="underline">Because marine <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">plants and animals rely on oxygen </span>to survive, such <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">oxygen-starved waters can be deadly</span>.</span> Increased nutrient concentrations in Gulf waters, caused at least in part by elevated levels of fertilizer runoff into the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, increase nitrogen levels in the water, contributing to the extent of hypoxia in the region. These nutrients feed microscopic plant life, such as algae and zooplankton, which form vast blooms, or areas in which dense concentrations of this plant material is suspended in the water column. Figure 20 shows the extent of algae blooms in the northern Gulf of Mexico, as seen by a satellite. The plant material in these blooms eventually dies and settles to the seafloor, where the decomposition process removes oxygen from the deepest waters. Figure 20 illustrates the extent of algal blooms along the northern Gulf Coast. In recent years, scientists have observed increases in the area of mid-summer hypoxia near the Gulf of Mexico seafloor. Figure 21 indicates that the 5-year average area of hypoxic waters in the Gulf of Mexico covered nearly 6,000 square miles, for the period 2005-2009. This is larger than the long-term average, which covered an average of less than 5,000 square miles annually (United States Geologic Survey, 2010). <span class="underline">Global climate change may influence the extent of hypoxia because the amount of rainfall observed over inland regions affects the quantity of nutrients washed into the Gulf of Mexico. In fact, research indicates that<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> increased river discharge, or the amount of fresh water </span>rivers release <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">into salt-water </span>bodies<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">, is the leading factor stimulating hypoxia</span></span> (Stow et. al., 2005; Eldridge and Roelkea, 2010). As scientists anticipate that the midwestern United States should observe more winter and spring precipitation, as well as heavier downpours in the future (U.S. Global Change Research Program, 2009), <span class="underline">fertilizer runoff into the Mississippi River should increase, which would likely elevate the extent of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico (Jusic et. al., 2003). Climate change will likely also impact salinity levels along the Gulf Coast. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Water salinity </span>increases or decreases when <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">changes occur in the balance between </span>the amount of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">fresh water flowing toward the sea and the </span>amount <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">of salt water flowing toward land. </span>Locations that experience the greatest rates of relative sea-level rise often observe the greatest salinity increases because sea water pushes inland more rapidly in these places. Locations near river mouths also tend to observe rapid salinity changes, as changing precipitation patterns inland alter the rate at which freshwater from rivers is discharged into saltwater basins.</span> Heavy inland rainfall patterns produce higher freshwater discharge levels, lowering salinity levels near the coast. Conversely, salinity levels rise during droughts, because during these periods rivers provide less freshwater to the coastal environment. It is difficult to determine how climate change will impact salinity levels. Similar to what happens with hypoxia levels, anticipated increases in Midwest winter and spring precipitation, as well as increased frequencies of heavy downpours in that region, may increase the discharge rate of the Mississippi River, which could decrease salinity levels in the northern Gulf of Mexico. However, scientists also expect longer time periods between rainfall events in the southeastern United States (U.S. Global Change Research Program, 2009), which may decrease the runoff of other rivers, and increase salinity levels in those regions. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Much </span>of the central and western <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Gulf Coast will </span>also <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">observe increased salinity </span>levels<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> in association with sea-level rise and </span>the resulting saltwater <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">intrusion </span>along the coast.</span></span><br />

The problems raised by acid rain alone are striking examples of [end page 106] innumerable problems that appear everywhere on our planet. The concrete-like clay layers, impervious to almost any kind of plant growth, replacing dynamic soils that once supported lush rain forests remain stark witness to a massive erosion of soil in all regions north and south of our equatorial belt. The equator—a cradle not only of our weather like the ice caps but a highly complex network of animal and plant life—is being denuded to a point where vast areas of the region look like a barren moonscape. We no longer &quot;cut&quot; our forests—that celebrated &quot;renewable resource&quot; for fuel, timber, and paper. We sweep them up like dust with a rapidity and &quot;efficiency&quot; that renders any claims to restorative action mere media-hype. Our entire planet is thus becoming simplified, not only polluted.

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: 0px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: 19784px; width: 1px;">LA FOURCHE PARISH, La. -- <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The native Houma people</span>, who have long relied on fishing and trapping in the marshlands of Louisiana, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">have been </span>through a lot as a tribe. They have been <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">robbed of</span> their <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">lands</span>, subjected to segregation, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">witnessed the </span>steady <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">erosion of marshlands and been displaced by hurricanes</span></span>. Now, some fear the oil slick that threatens to invade <span class="underline">the bayou could be the final blow to their culture and traditions</span>. &quot;We still could make a living here,&quot; says tribal elder Antoine &quot;Whitney&quot; Dardar, 74. &quot;But now, with the oil coming, I don't know.&quot; <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The tribe, </span>which has about 17,000 members, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">has lived off the marsh for hundreds of years,</span> and until recently many members made their living entirely off of marsh resources—moving from one harvest to another, season by season</span>. &quot;In May there was shrimping, then we would start crabbing, we caught redfish in the summer, white shrimp in August, and then trapped nutria in the fall and sold the pelts,&quot; says Aubrey Chaisson Jr., who is in his 50s<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The Houma Indians survived this way</span> after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, when the U.S. government took control of the region from the French. Unlike French and Spanish colonists before them, the Americans rejected the Houma tribe's property claims, says tribal historian Michael Dardar, who is the nephew of Antoine. The Houma people were eventually forced out of their permanent villages to the north in Bayou Cane, and moved into this area deep in the marshes, where they traditionally had seasonal fishing villages. &quot;They ignored us and hoped we would wither away,&quot;</span> Dardar says. In the 1920s and 30s, after oil was discovered in the marsh area, the Houma Indians suffered another land grab, according to Dardar. &quot;The Houma were mostly illiterate, and spoke only the Houma-French language,&quot; he says. &quot;A lot of people came in and (acquired) their property through a variety of methods.&quot; Many Houma people signed documents they were told were leases by the oil interests and others, but the papers turned out to be quit-claim deeds, Dardar says. Later, hundreds of the documents held by the parishes mysteriously disappeared. &quot;We have no tribal lands,&quot; says Laura Billiot, a member of the tribal council that represents more than half the Houmas, who are concentrated in La Fourche Parish and neighboring Terrebonne Parish. &quot;<span class="underline">The oil companies and the politicians took our lands a long time ago.&quot;</span> It is difficult for the Houma Indians to do battle with either oil companies or the government because they are not a federally recognized tribe, though they have tribal status with the state of Louisiana. They lost a bid to gain federal status 20 years ago, in part because of opposition from other tribes. In addition, Dardar says, oil companies petitioned the Bureau of Indian Affairs against recognition of the Houma tribe. Paradoxically, as commercial <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">fishermen have had a harder time making money because of</span> foreign <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">competition</span></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">, </span>high fuel prices and erosion of the marsh caused by oil companies, many -- including Houma tribe members -- have turned to the oil companies to supplement their incomes. And most will say they don't oppose drilling, but wish there was more oversight of the oil industry. &quot;<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">I</span>t's a tragedy what they have done here. They have made a mess of my heritage,&quot; says Tommy Verdin, who runs a large shrimp trawler. But when Verdin came back to Grand Isle after Hurricane Katrina and found his home reduced to a slab and his boat badly damaged, he got his captain's license to run oil supply boats. &quot;I had my back against the wall,&quot; he says. Aubrey James Chaisson, 36, says his father advised him when he was growing up that he should not go into the fishing business. So the younger Chaisson piloted boats for the oil companies for a while before becoming the Grand Isle fire chief. But he says he misses the life he knew as a kid<span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">.</span> <span class="underline">&quot;I feel I've been robbed,&quot; says the father of four. &quot;<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">You can't raise your kids as native Americans anymore</span>.&quot; </span>One pocket of Houma Indian families is famously clinging to their traditional lifestyle on tiny Isle de Jean Charles in Terrebonne Parish, but their situation is becoming increasingly dire. <span class="underline">Where there were 100 Houma families living prior to the recent string of hurricanes—Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike—there are now only about 20</span>, says historian Dardar. Some of the others would like to return, but they face obstacles that include the cost of replacing destroyed homes with stronger, higher structures on land that is rapidly eroding and sinking. In addition, the road to the island remains damaged and is regularly submerged during high tide. The parish government says it doesn't have the funds to repair it. Add to those challenges the threat of oil. &quot;<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The <span class="underline">tribe is at a crossroads</span></span><span class="underline">,&quot; says Kirk Cheramie, program director for a Houma radio station who also acts as spokesman for the tribe. &quot;<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">We are tied to the land</span>, the resources, the fish, the crab and shrimp… Not only that, but <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">it's where our families are buried. It's our identity</span>.&quot; </span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: 0px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: 19784px; width: 1px;">Here, I’d advance thestraightforward premise that the <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">land rights of</span> “<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">First Americans” should serve as a </span></span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">first priority</span></span><span class="underline"> for everyone seriously committed to accomplishing positive change</span> inNorth America. But before I suggest everyone jump off and adopt this priority, I suppose it’s only fair that I interrogate the converse of the proposition: if making things like class inequity andsexism the preeminent focus of progressive action in North America inevitably perpetuates the internal colonial structure of the United States, does the reverse hold true? I’ll state unequivocally that it does not. <span class="underline">There is no indication whatsoever that a restoration of indigenous sovereignty in Indian Country would foster class stratification anywhere</span>, least of all in Indian Country. In fact, all indications are that when left to their own devices, <span class="underline">indigenous peoples have consistently organized their societies in the most class-free manners</span>. Look to the example of the Haudenosaunee (Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy). Look to theMuscogee (Creek) Confederacy. Look to the confederations of the Yaqui and the Lakota, and those pursued and nearly perfected by Pontiac and Tecumseh. <span class="underline">They represent the very essence of enlightened egalitarianism and democracy.</span> Every imagined example to the contrary brought forth by even the most arcane anthropologist can be readily offset by a couple of dozen other illustrations along the lines of those I just mentioned. Would sexism be perpetuated? Ask one of the Haudenosaunee clan mothers, who continue to assert political leadership in their societies through the present day. Ask Wilma Mankiller, current head of the Cherokeenation , a people that traditionally led by what were called “Beloved Women.” Ask a Lakota woman—or man, for that matter—about who it was that owned all real property in traditional society, and what thatmeant in terms of parity in gender relations. Ask a traditional Navajo grandmother about her social and political role among her people. Women in most traditional native societies not only enjoyed political, social,and economic parity with men, they often held a preponderance of power in one or more of these spheres. Homopho bia? Homosexuals of both genders were (and in many settings still are) deeply revered as specialor extraordinary, and therefore spiritually significant, within most indigenous North American cultures. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The extent to which </span>these <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">realities do not </span>now <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">pertain in native societies is </span>exactly <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the extent to which Indians have been subordinated to </span>the mores of the invading<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">, dominating cultur</span></span><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">e</span>. Insofar as <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">restoration of</span> Indian <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">land rights is tied directly to the reconstitution of traditional indigenous</span> social, political, and economic <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">modes</span>, you can see where this leads: the relations of sex and sexuality accord rather well with the aspirations of feminist and gay rights activism</span>. How about a restoration of native land rights precipitating somesort of “environmental holocaust”? Let’s get at least a little bit real here. If you’re not addicted to the fabrications of Smithsonian anthropologists about how Indians lived, or George Weurthner’s EurosupremacistEarth First! Fantasies about how we beat all the wooly mammoths and mastodons and saber-toothed cats to death with sticks, then this question isn’t even on the board. I know it’s become fashionable amongWashington Post editorialists to make snide references to native people “strewing refuse in their wake” as they “wandered nomadically about the “prehistoric” North American landscape. What is that supposed toimply? That we, who were mostly “sedentary agriculturalists” in any event. Were dropping plastic and aluminum cans as we went? Like I said, lets get real. Read the accounts of early European arrival, despite thefact that it had been occupied by 15 or 20 million people enjoying a remarkably high standard of living for nobody knows how long: 40,000 years? 50,000 years? Longer? Now contrast that reality to what’s beendone to this continent over the past couple of hundred years by the culture Weurthner, the Smithsonian, and the Post represent, and you tell me about environmental devastation. That leaves militarism and racism. Taking the last first, there really is no indication of racism in traditional Indian societies. To the contrary, the record reveals that Indians habitually intermarried between groups, and frequently adopted both childrenand adults from other groups. This occurred in pre-contact times between Indians, and the practice was broadened to include those of both African and European origin—and ultimately Asian origin as well—oncecontact occurred. Those who were naturalized by marriage or adoption were considered members of the group, pure and simple. This was always the Indian view. <span class="underline">The Europeans and subsequent Euroamericansettlers viewed things rather differently, however, and foisted off the notion that Indian identity should be determined primarily by “blood quantum</span>,” an outright eugenics code similar to those developed in placeslike Nazi Germany and apartheid South Africa. Now that’s a racist construction if there ever was one. Unfortunately, a lot of Indians have been conned into buying into this anti-Indian absurdity, and that’s somethingto be overcome. But there’s also solid indication that quite a number of native people continue to strongly resist such things as the quantum system. As to militarism, no one will deny that Indians fought warsamong themselves both before and after the European invasion began. Probably half of all indigenous peoples in North America maintained permanent warrior societies. This could perhaps be reasonably construedas “militarism,” but not, I think, with the sense the term conveys within the European/Euro-American tradition. <span class="underline">There were never, so far as anyone can demonstrate,, wars of annihilation fought in this hemisphere prior to the Columbian arrival, none</span>. In fact, it seems that <span class="underline">it was a more or less firm principle of indigenous warfare not to kill, </span>the object being to demonstrate personal bravery, something that could be done onlyagainst a live opponent. There’s no honor to be had in killing another person, because a dead person can’t hurt you. There’s no risk. This is not to say that nobody ever died or was seriously injured in the fighting. They were, just as they are in full contact contemporary sports like football and boxing. Actually, these kinds of Euro-American games are what I would take to be the closest modern parallels to traditional inter-Indian warfare. For Indians, it was a way of burning excess testosterone out of young males, and not much more. So, <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">militarism</span> in the way the term <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is used today is</span> as alien <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to native tradition as smallpox and atomic bombs</span>.</span> Not only is it perfectly reasonable <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to assert that a restoration of</span> Indian <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">control over</span> unceded <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">lands </span>within the United States <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">would do nothing </span>to perpetuate suchproblems as sexism and classism, but the reconstitution of indigenous societies thiswould entail <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">stands to free the affected portions of North America from such maladie ltogether</span></span>. Moreover, it can be said that the process should have a tangible impact interms of diminishing such oppressions elsewhere. The principles is this: <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">sexism</span>, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">racism</span>, and all the rest <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">arose</span> here <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">as a concomitant to the </span>emergence and consolidation of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the </span>Eurocentric <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">nation-state</span> form of sociopolitical and economic organizatio</span>n. <span class="underline">Everything the state does, </span>everything it can do, is entirely contingenton its maintaining its internal cohesion<span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">, a cohesion signified </span>above all <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">by itspretended </span>territorial <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">integrity, its ongoing domination of </span>Indian <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Country</span></span>. Given this, itseems obvious that the literal dismemberment of the nation-state inherent to Indianland recovery correspondingly reduces the ability of the state to sustain <span class="underline">theimposition of objectionable relations within itsel f. It follows that realization of indigenous land rights serves to undermine or destroy the ability of the status quo tocontinue imposing a racist, sexist, classist, homophobic, militaristic order on non-Indians. </span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: 0px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: 19784px; width: 1px;">Our partnership involves the states of Vermont and New York, the Province of Quebec, and numerous federal agencies, including the USEPA, the USDA, USDI, and the USACE. This partnership is highly effective and through our work to restore the lake ecosystem, we also are ensuring an economic future for citizens in our region. This work is of vital importance to the regional economy, including the tourism and recreation economy for which we are well known, and which depends so fundamentally upon this great and wonderful lake. One of the great discoveries in my work with the Lake Champlain Basin Program's federal agency partners is the good faith and dedication that they bring to the task of cleaning up and restoring America's waterways. I have great admiration and appreciation for all of our federal partners. Today, <span class="underline">my testimony will focus on the essential work of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</span>, and particularly their role in Environmental Restoration projects. Cleaning up pollution in a lake is exceedingly difficult and costly. And it always includes interrupting the flow of pollutants into the drainage system to prevent further contamination. Pollution prevention requires changing the way things work in the landscape that drains into the lake. In Lake Champlain, as <span class="underline">in the Great Lakes and other parts of the nation, ecosystem restoration efforts often require advanced engineering design expertise and leadership that communities and states simply can not provide</span>. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The</span> competence and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">engineering expertise of the</span> U.S. Army <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Corps</span> of Engineers <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is a vital resource</span> for planning, designing and executing restoration plans. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The stature</span> of the Corps, its <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">track record with large projects and</span> its quality control <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">protocols provide</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">leadership that is essential</span></span> to maintain and improve the water quality of our rivers and lakes. <span class="underline">The U.S. Army Corps is currently facilitating several restoration</span> projects in the Lake Champlain watershed. With the Corp's support, an infestation of water chestnut, an invasive aquatic plant that has dominated the entire southern part of the lake for years is now nearly under control. This program, run in partnership with the states of Vermont and New York, has lead us out of an almost hopeless situation and we are seeing a return to public enjoyment of shoreline areas in the southern part of Lake Champlain. This summer we expect to begin work on projects to intercept storm water runoff into Lake George, part of the Lake Champlain ecosystem, and to stabilize eroding streambanks in the Missisquoi watershed, <span class="underline">with expertise, oversight and funding by the U.S. Army Corps. Without their leadership and support, this vital work could not happen</span>. <span class="underline">The role of the U.S. Army Corp's Environmental Restoration authority is a vital nationwide asset; getting projects done - and done professionally - all across America</span>. <span class="underline">Dam removal projects, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">wetland restoration</span>, fish passages and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">streambank stabilization</span> projects <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">restore</span> degraded <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">ecosystems</span>, improve American lives, strengthen our nation's economy and ensure that we will be able to provide clean drinking water</span> to ourselves, our children and their children. Lake St. Clair, and the St. Clair River, located between Lake Huron and Lake Erie, faces massive problems of nutrient loading, invasive species and the challenges of a busy waterway. It is in desperate need of pollution prevention and ecosystem restoration action. <span class="underline">The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has taken the lead role in drawing together federal agencies and communities in the U.S. and Canada to address this international challenge</span>. <span class="underline">The stature and expertise of the Corps, and its mandate to develop a management plan</span>, under Section 246 of WRDA 1999, <span class="underline">placed it in the logical lead in this important effort</span>. One of the greatest restoration programs in the history of our nation is underway in the Everglades and South Florida Ecosystem, with U.S. Army Corps leadership. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan approved by Congress in WRDA 2000 is the key to the future of the huge everglades ecosystem and the vitality of a significant sector of the Florida economy. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Coordination of</span> the work of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">eight federal agencies and</span> more than <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a hundred local</span> stakeholder <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">governments</span>, regional councils and state agencies, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">could only be managed by</span> an agency with the engineering capacity, traditions and commitment of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the U.S. Army Corps</span></span>. From Texas to Mississippi in the Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem, wetlands are disappearing at the rate of nearly 22,000 acres per year. The U.S. Army Corps is a partner with the State of Louisiana on a feasibility study that will enable us to better understand this problem, and how to mitigate and minimize losses, to restore a future for this region. Similar case histories, of projects large and small, could be cited from across the nation, with the accolades and gratitude of millions of American citizens. America today faces unprecedented challenges of ecosystem damage and resultant declines in water quality, contaminated and weed- infested waterways, and polluted lakes and estuaries across the nation. These problems have compromised drinking water supplies for millions of Americans, caused desperate struggles for survival in the tourism and recreation industries, and created an alarming trend towards more and greater problems in the near future. The <span class="underline">U.S. Army <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Corps</span> of Engineers <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is a vital part of our</span> military <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">service that</span> works directly in the homeland to <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">meet </span>these <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">challenges with </span>the world's best professional <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">expertise</span></span>. <span class="underline">Its stature and traditions of service to America have turned to environmental restoration projects that require engineering solutions</span>. <span class="underline">The Corps brings the best tools in the nation to guide the engineering problem-solving</span> that these special ecosystems require. I would like to direct your attention to the challenges we face regarding the Corp's Continuing Authorities programs and Sections 206 and 1135. The existing program limits of $25 million for each have simply not kept pace with current needs, and are now a fraction of what America needs them to be. In the Lake Champlain watershed, this means that several ongoing projects are being suspended due to a national shortfall. Suspending good projects partway through their implementation, whether in Lake Champlain or elsewhere across the nation, neither saves money nor avoids expense. The problems in each case will get far more costly, not less costly. The opportunities to prevent or contain pollution will be lost if a shortfall like this persists. The most cost-effective solution to large ecosystem problems is to invest adequately in their restoration at the earliest possible date. Any alternative is likely to be a false economy in the short term and result a burgeoning burden of additional accrued contamination and sharply increased costs of restoration in the long term. Finally, the work of the U.S. Army Corps on environmental restoration is not only about conservation philosophy or environmental ethics. It is also about our nation's economic engines. As we know so well in the northeast, it is about the vitality of the tourism economy and the quality of life that keeps the recreation businesses in business. It is about trucks on the highway, the pulse of commerce and trade. It is about reducing bankruptcies and maintaining jobs. It is about smell of the tap water in the cities and towns across the nation; it is about the health of our own human habitat throughout this nation that is our future. In the final analysis, ecosystem restoration and water quality is about insuring the quality of life for citizens across America, and the health of our children and their children for generations to come. I hope the members of this Committee will continue to recognize, appreciate and support <span class="underline">the vital role of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in service to the American homeland</span> and, in particular, will fully support their Environmental Restoration programs. Thank you for the invitation to testify before you today. I look forward to answering your questions.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: 0px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: 19784px; width: 1px;">First, and foremost, we need to realize that <span class="underline">some risks are so trivial that they are simply not meaningful</span><u>.</u> This is not to argue that all low probability/high impact arguments should be ignored, but rather to suggest that <span class="underline">there is a point beneath which probabilities are meaningless. </span>The problem with low probability arguments in debate is that they have taken on a life of their own. <span class="underline">Debate <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">judges </span>routinely <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">accept minimal risks which would be</span> summarily <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">dismissed by</span> business and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">political leaders</span></span><u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">.</span></u> While it has been argued that our leaders should take these risks more seriously, we believe that <span class="underline">many judges err in assessing any weight to such speculative arguments. The solution, of course, is to recognize that <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">there is a line beyond which probability is not </span>meaningfully <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">evaluated. We do not believe it is possible to conclude</span>, given current evidence and formats of debate, that <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a plan might cause a 1 in 10,000 increase in the risk of nuclear conflagration.</span></span>17 Further, even if it were possible, we need to recognize that at some point <span class="underline">a risk becomes so small that it should be ignored</span><u>.</u> As the Chicago Tribune aptly noted, we routinely dismiss the probability of grave impacts because they are not meaningful: It begins as soon as we awake. Turn on the light, and we risk electrocution; several hundred people are killed each year in accidents involving home wiring or appliances. Start downstairs to put on the coffee, and you're really asking for it; about 7,000 Americans die in home falls each year. Brush your teeth, and you may get cancer from the tap water. And so it. goes throughout the day -- commuting to work, breathing the air, working, having lunch, coming home, indulging in leisure time, going back to bed.18 <span class="underline">Just as we ignore these risks in our own lives, we should be willing to ignore minimal risks in debates. Second, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">we must consider the increment of the risk</span></span><u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">.</span></u> All too often, disadvantages claim that the plan will dramatically increase the risk of nuclear war. This might be true, and still not be compelling, if the original risk was itself insignificant. For example, it means Hale to double the probability of nuclear war if the original probability was only 1 in one million. To avoid this temptation<span class="underline">, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">advocates should focus on the initial probability, and not</span> on the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">marginal doubling</span> of the risk claimed</span> by the negative.</span><br />

Indeed, contrary to what the revivalists describe, <span class="underline">the most striking features of the</span> contemporary <span class="underline">international landscape are the intensification of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">economic globalization</span>, thickening <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">institutions, and</span> shared problems of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">interdependence</span>. The overall structure</span> of the international system today <span class="underline">is</span> quite <span class="underline">unlike that of the nineteenth century</span>.

<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: 0px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: 19784px; width: 1px;">All that remains of Sagan's Big Chill are curves such as this, but history is full of prophets of doom who fail to deliver, not all are without honor in their own land. The 1983 'Nuclear Winter&quot; papers in Science were so politicized that even the eminently liberal President of The Council for a Liveable World called &quot;The worst example of the misrepesentation of science to the public in my memory.&quot; Among the authors was Stanford President Donald Kennedy. Today he edits Science, the nation's major arbiter of climate science--and policy. Below, a case illustrating the mid-range of the ~.7 to ~1.6 degree C maximum cooling the 2006 studies suggest is superimposed in color on the Blackly Apocalyptic predictions published in Science Vol. 222, 1983 . They're worth comparing, because the range of soot concentrations in the new models overlaps with cases assumed to have dire climatic consequences in the widely publicized 1983 scenarios -- <span class="underline">&quot;<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Apocalyptic predictions require, to be taken seriously, higher standards of evidence</span></span> <strong><span style="font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">than do assertions on other matters where the stakes are not as great.&quot;</span></strong> <span class="underline">wrote Sagan</span> in <span class="underline">Foreign Affairs</span>, Winter 1983 -84. <span class="underline">But that &quot;evidence&quot; was never forthcoming.</span> 'Nuclear Winter' never existed outside of a computer except as air-brushed animation commissioned by the a PR firm - Porter Novelli Inc. <span class="underline">Yet Sagan predicted </span>&quot;the<span class="underline"> extinction</span> of the human species &quot; <span class="underline">as temperatures plummeted 35 degrees C</span> and the world froze in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust<strong>.</strong> <span class="underline">Last year, Sagan's cohort tried to reanimate the ghost in a machine</span> anti-nuclear activists invoked in the depths of the Cold War<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">, <span class="underline">b</span></span><span class="underline">y re-running equally arbitrary scenarios on a modern interactive Global Circulation Model.</span> But the Cold War is history in more ways than one. It is a credit to<span class="underline"> post-modern<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> computer climate simulations</span> </span>that they<span class="underline"> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">do not reproduce the apocalyptic results</span> </span>of what Sagan oxymoronically termed &quot;a sophisticated one dimensional model.&quot; <span class="underline">The subzero 'baseline case' has melted down into a tepid 1.3 degrees of average cooling- grey skies do not a Ragnarok make. </span>What remains is just not the stuff that End of the World myths are made of. <strong><span style="font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">It is hard to exaggerate how seriously &quot; nuclear winter &quot;was once taken by policy analysts who ought to have known better. Many were taken aback by the sheer force of Sagan's rhetoric</span></strong> Remarkably, Science's news coverage of the new results fails to graphically compare them with the old ones Editor Kennedy and other recent executives of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, once proudly co-authored and helped to publicize. You can't say they didn't try to reproduce this Cold War icon. Once again,<span class="underline"> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">soot </span>from imaginary software<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> materializes in midair </span>by the megaton, flying higher than Mount Everest. This <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is not physics, but a crude exercise in ' garbage in, gospel out' </span>parameter forcing </span>designed to maximize and extend the cooling an aeosol can generate, by sparing it from realistic attrition by rainout in the lower atmosphere.<span class="underline"> Despite decades of progress in modeling atmospheric chemistry, there is none</span> in this computer simulation<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">, </span><span class="underline">and ignoring photochemistry further extends its impact.</span> Fortunately, the history of science is as hard to erase as it is easy to ignore. Their past mastery of semantic aggression cannot spare the authors of &quot;Nuclear Winter Lite &quot; direct comparison of their new results and their old. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Dark smoke clouds in the lower atmosphere don't last long enough to spread</span> </span>across the globe.<span class="underline"> Cloud droplets and rainfall remove them, rapidly</span> washing them out of the sky in a matter of days to weeks- not long enough to sustain a global pall. Real world weather brings down particles much as soot is scrubbed out of power plant smoke by the water sprays in smoke stack scrubbers <span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">R</span>obock acknowledges this- <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">not even a single degree of cooling results when soot is released at lower elevations</span> in the models . The workaround is to inject the imaginary aerosol at truly Himalayan elevations -</span> pressure altitudes of 300 millibar and higher , where the computer model's vertical transport function modules pass it off to their even higher neighbors in the stratosphere , where it does not rain and particles linger<span class="underline">. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The new studies</span> </span>like the old suffer from the disconnect between a desire to paint the sky black and the vicissitudes of natural history. As with many exercise in worst case models both at<span class="underline"> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">invoke rare phenomena as commonplace,</span> claiming it prudent to assume the worst. But <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the real world is subject to Murphy's lesser-known second law- if everything must go wrong, don't bet on it.</span></span> In 2006 as in 1983 firestorms and forest fires that send smoke into the stratosphere rise to alien prominence in the modelers re-imagined world , but in the real one remains a very different place, where though <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">every month sees forest fires burning areas the size of cities</span> </span>- 2,500 hectares or larger, stratospheric smoke injections arise but once in a blue moon. So how come these neo-nuclear winter models feature so much smoke so far aloft for so long? The answer is simple- the modelers intervened. Turning off vertical transport algorithms may make Al Gore happy- he has bet on reviving the credibility Sagan's ersatz apocalypse , but there is no denying that in some of these scenarios<span class="underline"> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">human desire, </span>not physical forces<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> accounts for the vertical hoisting of millions of tons of mass ten vertical kilometers into the sky,</span> to the level at which the models take over , </span>with results at once predictable --and arbitrary. <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">This is not physics, it is computer gamesmanship</span></span> carried over to a new generation of X-Box. I must now return to getting and vetting the new papers and their references- this has been a preliminary examination of what the public has been told, and more detailed critiques of the science will doubtless be directed to the journals were the new work appeared. This time round, the details are scarcely worth arguing, because the global frost made famous by the original 'TTAPS' model has disappeared . From the truly frigid 7,000 degree-day &quot;baseline case&quot; advertised as hard science in 1983 to a tepid results of today, &quot;Nuclear Winter has well and truly melted down. The 1986 review of TTAPS reception follows.</span>
